Good!

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,515
Lung, your horse riding skill
has improved a lot.

35
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,558
But you still don't know kung fu.

36
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,727
So try not to wander around so much.

37
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,751
l won't.

38
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,134
Your Excellency.

We spotted horse thieves
5 miles Northeast from here.

You go back first.

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,928
Let's go!

43
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,347
That could very well be ''Dark Cloud''.

44

Don't you want to go and find out?

45
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,175
No need.

00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,413
Go then.

00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,854
Just don't call me Master
anymore when you return.

a better student than me!

Greetings, Mr. Kao. l'm Yu Shu Lien.

lt's very accomplished
of you, Miss Yu,

73
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,266
to become the head escort
at such a young age.

74
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,824
You're flattering me, Mr. Kao.

75
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,669
Master Yuk

76
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,904
l brought a letter from Master Lu.

77
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,206
He wanted me to give it
to you in person.

78
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,366
Good.

79
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,277
What did Master Lu say?

80
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,179
He urged us to settle the marriage
between Lung and his son.

81
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,975
Looks like Master Lu is
more impatient than we are!

82
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,285
That's right.

83
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,186
lt'll be a peace of mind
for us too

84
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,656
once that crazy daughter
of ours is married.

85
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,092
Masters, l'll take my leave now.

86
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,161
lt's getting late, Miss Yu.

87
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,598
lf you don't mind, why not
stay over for the night

88
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,867
and leave tomorrow morning instead?

89
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,235
Then...

90
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,725
lf it's not much trouble.

91
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,430
Butler.

92
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,839
This way, please.

93
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,897
Please.

94
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,240
Take care.

95
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,601
She's quite a lady.

96
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,848
lf only our crazy daughter is
half as good as she is,

97
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,611
then l'll be content.

98
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,920
Master Kao.

99
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,754
How are you?

100
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,085
What are you talking about me now??

101
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,965
Was this vase meant for
your father, or for me?

102
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,595
Master Yuk scolded you

103
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,607
because, deep down inside,
he really loves you.

104
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,633
l scolded you precisely
for the same reason.

105
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,308
The world is dangerous
and full of trickeries.

106
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,284
But of course.

107
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,385
Master Yuk doesn't know that
you do know kung fu.

108
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,156
You're probably thinking that

109
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,387
if your father would've known
how good your kung fu is,

110
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,856
then he wouldn't be worrying
so much about you.

111
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,531
That's why you're mad at me,

112
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,601
because l told you
to keep it as a secret.

113
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,126
And now you're suffering
for it, right?

114
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,933
Lung.

115
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,845
You've always been living in this
ivory tower of your home.

116
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,973
You have no idea how the world
actually looks like.

117
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,895
What am l doing?

118
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,834
l'm talking to a deaf ear!

119
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,462
l shouldn't have taught you kung fu
in the first place!

120
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,906
Even if l would've wasted
such a talent like you,

121
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,775
at least it doesn't give me
as much of a headache

122
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,868
as taming a little shrew
like you now!

123

128
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,003

129
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,008
Hurry, please help me catch the bird.

130
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,441

131
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,009
My bird! Hurry!

132
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,065
And my father wishes he has
a daughter like you!

133
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,995
l thought you're someone amazing.

134
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,768
Turns out it's nothing special.

135
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,135
You must be his third daughter.

136
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,141
That's none of your business.

137
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,632
''Lung, Master has to take care of
something important.

144

Master, l know l'm wrong now.

145
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,576
You're never wrong.

146
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,323

147
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,391

abide by my word!

151
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,203
Good.

for personal matters.

153
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,135
l'll be back in 3 months.

154
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,269
So Master is not leaving
because of me?

155
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,147
lf you break your promise
and keep causing trouble,

156
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,615
then l still won't come back.

157
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,276
Who said l'll break my promise?

158
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,711
That's good then.

159
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,980

166

00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,458
Wait!

186
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,977
Sorry, senior.

187
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,145
Did l scare you?

188
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,113
No.

189
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,281
Thanks for helping me back then.

190
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,151
No. You were frightened by them
because of me.

191
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,153
l should be the one apologizing.

192
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,421
That's all right.

193
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,556
l'm in a hurry. l have to go.

194
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,921
Fine. Take care.

195
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,292
What happened?

196
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,114
What really happened??

197
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,458
Father! Who killed our little brother??

198
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,926
What exactly happened at our home??

199
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,561
Why are there so many dead?

200
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,688
Father! Why aren't you
saying anything??

201
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,333
lt's not that l don't
want to tell you.

202
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,102
You're still young.

203
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,639
You shouldn't get involved with
some matters of our world,

204
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,142
because you'll have a hard time
getting yourself out of them.

205
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,411
Father! What's with you?

206
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,470
You're not like this before!

207
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,048
l don't care.

208
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,175
Little brother was innocent!

209
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,041
Shu Lien!

210
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,947
l understand how you feel,

211
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,357
and we must avenge for
our little brother.

212
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,293
But now is not the time.

213
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,127
There's still one very important
thing you have to do.

214
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,363
Master.

215
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,241
This will be our last escort.

216
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,970
Let's get this delivered.

217
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,008
An escort?! Now?

218
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,440
l'm doing this as a favor for
a very good friend of mine.

219
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,279
l've owed him much.

220
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,323
Now that l'm retiring
from the martial arts world,

221
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,658
l'm afraid l may never
pay back his gratitude.

222
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,650
That's why we must
carry out this escort.

223
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,565
Father! Tragedy has struck Hung Yuen

224
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,834
and our brothers' corpses
are still warm.

225
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,836
Now is the time for revenge.

226
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,172
Yet you want me to carry out
an escort instead?!

227
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,274
ls it because you want me
to stay out of this, father?

228
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,476
Shu Lien! What's with you??

229
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,911
Are you disobeying your father now?

230
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,779
- But Father...
- Say no more!

231
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,016
You have to carry out
this escort irregardless!

232
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,119
We will sever our ties if
you refuse to do so!

233
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,088
Then we will no longer be
father and daughter!

234
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,660
Fine, father.

235
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,321
l will go, since you insist.

236
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,229
l need a room, manager.

237
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,923
Sorry, but we're all full today.

238
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,263
Senior!

239
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,565
Little brother.

240
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,546
Senior. You sleep on the bed.

241
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,915
l can just sleep on the floor.

242
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:36,916
Get some rest.

243
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,250
l can't do that!

244
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,386
Just consider this as
my apology to you

245
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,751
for this morning.

246
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,989
Your Excellency. You're
personally leading the troops

247
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,691
to avenge our enemies this time.

248
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,558
We are forever grateful to you.

249
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,321
Let's get one thing clear.

250
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,434
My sole mission is to eliminate
rebels of the Bagua cult.

251
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,437
l have nothing to do with
your personal vendetta.

252
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,505
Yes...

253
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,173
Your Excellency is here for the rebels.

254
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,303
But this Yu Hung Yen is also
one of the Bagua leaders.

255
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,569
You must kill him first!

256
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,249
Don't you worry.

257
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,684
Once this is over,

258
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,552
just hand over the list of the names.

259
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,147
l guarantee you that Hung Yuen Escorts
will vanish forever!

260
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,859
Little brother. Your kung fu is not bad.

261
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,161
Where did you learn it?

262
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,423
l'm from Wu Tang.

263
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,990
Wu Tang?

264
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,795
You know someone
from Wu Tang, Senior?

265
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,903
Just one.

266
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,338
Why don't you tell me his name?

267
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,862
Perhaps l may know him.

268
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,333
Little brother. Can you do me a favor?

269
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,170
Of course, Senior. Just tell me.

270
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,650
l have a friend for whom l'm
taking something to Wu Tang.

271
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,151
Can you do it for me instead?

272
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,277
Sure.

273
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,788
Once l finish running errands
at the capital,

274
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,278
l'll take care of it for you.

275
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,491
There's no hurry.

276
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,692
Besides, l don't have the item yet.

277
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,954
l'll give it to you later.

278
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,662
My horse!

279
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,345
What are you doing??

280
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,040
l'm buying back my horse, lady.

281
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,203
Farewell!

282
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,217
My escort box...

283
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,775
Hey! Don't you run away!

284
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,384
Come back!!

285
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,196
Stop running!

286
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,675
How dare you stole my thing,
you rascal!

287
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,210
But l didn't.

288
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,245
This was my horse.

289
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,507
Give me back my box!

290
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,807
''TO MY LOVELY DAUGHTER''

291
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:27,786
''Shu Lien. lf, upon returning,

292
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,356
you find both your mother
and l are well,

293
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:36,658
that means l can really retire
from the martial arts world.

294
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:41,931
That will also mean we can all

295
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,437
live a quiet and peaceful life.

296
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,201
This has always been
my ultimate dream.

297
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,867
However, you can never leave
the martial arts world.

298
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,547
lf, by the time you come back,

299
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,150
you don't see me and your mother

300
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,554
then l only wish that
you will forgive me

301
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,890
for not saving our family.

302
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,450
But l must save you
and let you live.''

303
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,530
FATHER!!!

304
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,085
FATHER!!!

305
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,394
Father...

306
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,396
Quick! Someone is still in there!

307
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,035
Stop it, Miss Yu!

308
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:57,933
Get out of my way!

309
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,979
- Miss Yu!
- Get away!

310
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,760
- Miss Yu!
- Let me go!!

311
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,494
Don't be like this, Miss Yu!

312
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,528
You let me go!

313
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,393
Do not be blinded by rage.

314
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,792
You have to calm down.

315
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,544
l have to find the real
murderers and kill them all!

316
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,624
There's never an end to revenge.

317
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,751
You're not me. You wouldn't understand.

318
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,696
Miss Yu. Please listen to Mr. Kao.

319
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,630
Besides, this is your father's wish.

320
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,801
Sorry.

321
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,860
l unintentionally read the letter.

322
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,031
What should l do?

323
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,776
You still have a long road
ahead of you.

324
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,775
You should think about
what you can do.

325
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,536
Our Escort is destroyed,

326
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,614
and l'm now without a home.

327
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,419
You...

328
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,182
Don't you have any
other relatives?

329
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,653
They're all dead...

330
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,023
l have to find Uncle Meng.

331
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,875
Rebels! We're here to capture you!

332
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,240
Resist and you will die!

333
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,647
Stop!

334
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,084
They are not real soldiers.

335
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,197
l am Meng Wing Cheung.
Sorry for offending you.

336
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,065
The three of you are...

337
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,200
Uncle Meng!

338
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,868
Miss, you are...

339
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,496
l'm Yu Shu Lien.
Greetings, Uncle Meng!

340
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,137
You are Shu Lien?!

341
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,077
Never thought that
brother Hung Yuen

342
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,376
will die under the hands of
that evil woman Ho Gim Ngo.

343
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,778
You mean Ho Gim Ngo is
my father's killer?

344
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,322
lf my assumptions are correct,

345
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,723
then she must be the woman
Brother Kao saw at the inn.

346
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,662
Then why is there so much hatred

347
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,499
between Ho and the
Hung Yuen Escorts?

348
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,300
This started years ago.

349
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,203
Back then, me, brother Hung Yuen

350
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,973
and Ho's father Ho Fei Lung

351
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,909
were troubled by the officials'
ill treatment of the people.

352
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,070
We joined the Bagua Cult.

353
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,748
To avoid being captured
by the government troops,

354
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,550
we decided to separate.

355
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,219
Brother Hung Yuen learned kung fu
from the masters

356
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,088
and started Hung Yuen Escorts.

357
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:07,024
And l came here and
opened a teahouse.

358
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,961
What about Ho Fei Lung?

359
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,098
We never heard from him
after we separated.

360
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,034
At first, we thought
he had been arrested.

361
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,137
We found out later that
he had become a bandit.

362
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,773
He even tried to rob
your father's escorts.

363
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,043
Ho realized he is no match
to your father's kung fu.

364
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,745
So he used reunion as an excuse

365
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,380
to invite your father to his place.

366
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,915
He poisoned the wine.

367
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:33,043
But your father found out about
his plan and killed him.

368
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,420
Uncle Meng.

369
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,685
Are you saying that Ho came
to revenge her father?

370
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,459
Senior Meng.

371
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,825
ls there anyway to settle this?

372
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,798
Unless we take back the list
of Bagua Cult members

373
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,668
from Ho Gim Ngo and
kill her as well.

374
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,535
Right.

375
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,704
Let me stay here so we can
kill that witch together!

376
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,139
Miss Yu, no!

377
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,407
You stay out of this!

378
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,408
Miss Yu.

379
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,172
Can't you see what your father
had gone through for you?

380
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,984
Shu Lien, Swordsman Li is right.

381
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,457
Your father will be rolling
in his grave

382
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,687
if he knew that you plan to revenge.

383
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:20,024
Uncle Meng, then why are you
telling me the truth?

384
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,133
l now regret telling you
after seeing how you react.

385
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,702
Uncle Meng...

386
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,674
l know that, even if l
don't tell you the truth,

387
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,676
you will never give up,

388
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,236
because your heart will
always feel unresolved.

389
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:41,309
Shu Lien, let me take care of
that witch.

390
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,288
You must not linger here.

391
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,018
You should leave at dawn after
staying for the night.

392
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,559
Uncle Meng.

393
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,828
Why are you treating me
like an outsider?

394
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,922
Haven't you forgotten my marriage
agreement with your son?

395
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,622
This is the only place l can go.

396
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,328
Uncle Meng!

397
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,104
Shu Lien, Tze Chu...

398
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,478
He...

399
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,002
What about him?

400
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,871
He...

401
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,956
Old Master.

402
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,118
Please let me take Miss Yu
to see Young Master.

403
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,656
''FUNERAL TABLET OF
MENG TZE CHU''

404
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,038
Young Master came to the capital
a while back.

405
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,773
He was standing up for somebody

406
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,707
and offended the police troops
as a result.

407
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,010
Miss, l'm sure you understand

408
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,741
how unreasonable and arrogant
those police troops are.

409
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,118
Young Master got really mad
and fought with them.

410
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,018
He ended up being killed.

411
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,615
''YUK'S MANSlON''

412
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,391
l'm bored to death!

413
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,417
Why are you always acting crazy
like this, my child?

414
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,422
Are you possessed?

415
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,431
l am crazy.

416
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,036
l am crazy!

417
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,905
l am crazy! l am crazy!!

418
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,239
- l am crazy!!
- That's enough!

419
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,307
l am crazy!!

420
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,642
You'll get a good scolding
from your father

421
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,943
if he finds out.

422
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,411
l want him to find out!

423
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,680
l like seeing him getting
mad over me.

424
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,910
You better not make him mad now.

425
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,819
He's going into battle tomorrow with

426
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,754
someone by the name of ''Dark Cloud''.

427
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,346
He's really occupied.

428
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,177
Right Squadron, attack!

429
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,012
Charge!

430
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,488
Charge!

431
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,227

432
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,024

Front Squadron, attack!

435
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,411
Kill!

436
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,760
Kill!

437
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,107
Miss!

438
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,448
Miss!

439
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,383
- Miss! Where are you, Miss?
- Where are you?

440
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,185
Your people are here for you.

441
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,449
You think l can't see that?

442
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,656
You better go.

443
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,424
Miss, where are you?

444
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,052
l don't need you to
tell me what to do!

445
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,165
See? She's over there!

446
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,834
Miss, are you all right?

447
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,068
Get the horse. Hurry!

448
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,057
Yes!

449
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,214
Let's go.

450
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,340
Yes!

451
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,721
She's not leaving the mansion
starting today!

452
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,814
Arrange for her wedding at once!

453
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,858
Are you all right, Miss?

454
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,257
Miss!

455
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,392
''JUO WA SWORD AND
FlST STANCE MANUSCRlPT''

456
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,829
Father, you should at least

457
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,491
cancel the wedding arrangement
between me and Shu Lien.

458
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,292
Shu Lien is a good girl.

459
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,636
Aren't you afraid
you'll have regrets

460
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,161
if you give her up so easily?

461
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,814
Life is never perfect to begin with.

462
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,745
l've made up my mind. Say no more.

463
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,852
You're leaving now??

464
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,423
Who goes there?

465
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,275
Ho Gim Ngo?!

466
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,546
Charge!

467
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,328
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

468
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,659
Let's go, Brother Ken!

469
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,123
Get that name list!

470
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,423
Go after them!

471
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,974
Brother Ken!!!

472
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,377
You will all die for
killing Brother Ken!

473
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,218
Fine. l'll die with you then!

474
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:52,943
Miss Yu!

475
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,011
Hold my hand!

476
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,979
Let go, Brother Li!

477
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,239
- No!
- l'll die with her!

478
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,906
l will never let go!

479
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,720
Brother Li!

480
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,948
No!

481
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,773
Pull! Use your strength!

482
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,048
Miss Yu! Are you all right?

483
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,982
l'm fine.

484
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,017
Are you all right?

485
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,177
l'm fine.

486
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,680
Sorry.

487
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,112
lt's all right.

488
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,391
Where's Mr. Kao?

489
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,495
He left. He had to go to Baoding.

490
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,464
What are your plans, Swordsman Li?

491
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,203
l have to deliver something
to the capital

492
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,034
on behalf of my master.

493
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,036
l must be going now.

494
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,772
Take care, both of you.

495
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,627
l'm responsible for
what they've done!

496
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,117
You should only catch me.

497
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,598
But of course, you must
first defeat me!

498
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,532
l sure will!

499
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,666
Then come on!

500
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,826
l'm not afraid of you!

501
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,255
You crazy woman.

502
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,998
You foul-mouthed, damn thief!

503
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,301
l'll kill you, you bastard!

504
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,407
Fine!

505
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,465
Enough.

506
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,735
l don't believe l can't win you!

507
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,290
Woman!

508
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:32,134
Woman!!

509
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,679
You're awake.

510
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,290
Enough of this.

511
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,258
Are you feeling better?

512
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,292
What's it to you?

513
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,384
Let go of me!

514
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,723
What if l don't?

515
00:44:59,029 --> 00:44:59,997
You slime!

516
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,031
You heartless bastard!

517
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,328
Let go of me!

518
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,380
Getting your strength back, huh?

519
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,075
That means you must be fine now.

520
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,780
l hate you!

521
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,788
Do you really hate me?

522
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,602
Aren't you here to arrest me?

523
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,068
l...

524
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,774
l'm going back to the capital soon!

525
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,611
You take care.

526
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,373
Don't go!

527
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:52,509
Lo Xiao Fu! How dare you?!

528
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,974
Just because l like you doesn't
mean you can bully me.

529
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,448
Everyone dies.

530
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:04,078
l will have no regrets if
l die under your hands.

531
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,782
- We'll fight our way out!
- Yes!

532
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,354
Father! Mother!

533
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,879
Father, mother...

534
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,795
Brother Ken died a horrible death.

535
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,592
l want you all to die the same way!

536
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,128
Save my father...

537
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,892
Save my mother...

538
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,104
l don't want to be alone...

539
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,107
Please...

540
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,776
Don't leave me alone...

541
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,778
Don't let me be by myself...

542
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,871
Don't worry. l'm here.

543
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,558
The relationship between
Wu Tang and us

544
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,995
had deteriorated with the
appointment of their new leader.

545
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,553
But this time...

546
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:11,297
That's why there are no
eternal enemies in this world.

547
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,559
There are also no eternal friends.

548
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,631
Those who can be used
are our friends.

549
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,300
Those who can't are our enemies.

550
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:29,608
Are they trying to mend
bridges with you, Lord Beila?

551
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,155
ln the end, we're both
using each other.

552
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,950
However...l admire their sincerity.

553
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,218
Why's that?

554
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,366
They are sending one of
their students here

555
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,231
to offer me a precious gift.

556
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,603
They're only a bunch of Taoist monks.

557
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,298
What precious gift can they offer?

558
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,766
Green Destiny Sword.

559
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,334
''THE ClTY OF BAODlNG''

560
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,490
Brother Yang.

561
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,458
l'm sorry.

562
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,265
l hadn't been able to
take care of the matters

563
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,367
you bestowed upon me
before you died.

564
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,803
l promise you that l,
Kao Lang Chau,

565
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:57,240
will bring Xiao Fu here
to see you before l die

566
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,042
so he can give you his offerings.

567
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,244
You said the same nonsense
15 years ago.

568
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,474
Looks like you haven't
changed one bit!

569
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,444
Sister Lieu!

570
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,690
You disguised as a beggar

571
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,988
to avoid being captured
by the troops?

572
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,229
You took my manuscript back then.

573
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,026
Now is the time to return to me.

574
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,456
l don't know what
you're talking about!

575
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,697
Never thought a poor scholar
like you would actually

576
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,233
possess such good kung fu skills
in just 15 years!

577
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,601
Sister Lieu.

578
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,336
lt's not too late to repent.

579
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:00,667
Take care.

580
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,312
We have to get more of these
silk fabrics in stock.

581
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,247
Yes.

582
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,448
They're selling really well this year.

583
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,649
We can stock up a bit more.

584
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,980
Brother Meng!

585
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,384
Why can't you look at me?

586
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,420
Miss, l'm afraid you've mistaken me
for someone else.

587
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,593
Really?

588
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,098
l am not some Brother Meng.

589
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,534
My name is Chau Cheung Ching.

590
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,601
That's not it.

591
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,502
You're also the disfigured servant
at the Meng Mansion.

592
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,775
Uncle Meng gave me this.

593
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,037
Why aren't you admitting it?

594
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,876
l just want to know why.

595
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,117
You can annul our
marriage contract.

596
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,285
You can even discard
our relationship

597
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,684
and everything between us.

598
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,186
But you can't lie to me.

599
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,816
Shu Lien.

600
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,825
Please forgive me for being selfish.

601
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,386
Actually...

602
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,022
l've never forgotten
my promise to you.

603
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,624
l hate myself for doing this too.

604
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,230
Don't worry, Brother Meng.

605
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,641
l'm not here to force you
to honor our marriage.

606
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,836
l just want to know the truth.

607
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,347
Shu Lien!

608
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,184
Where are you going?

609
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,686
The world is such a big place.

610
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,821
l'm sure l can find
somewhere to go.

611
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,755
Take care.

612
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,915
Shu Lien!

613
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,620
Will we see each other again?

614
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,663
l don't think so.

615
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:40,534
Shu Lien, please stay.

616
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,142
What did you say?

617
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,941
lt's all my fault. Please stay.

618
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,458
Did you enjoy your visit
at the capital?

619
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,959
l would never have imagined
how the capital

620
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,194
has changed over these past years!

621
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,795
And l also had sugar-coated apples.

622
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,696
lt's delicious!

623
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,665
A lady of the mansion
eating on the streets.

624
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,257
Where have all your manners gone?

625
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,105
Good. Master Kao is back.

626
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,005
He's going to give you a lesson!

627
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,372
Master!

628
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,747
Did you run amok while l was away?

629
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,442
No! l'm not some wild monkey!

630
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,119
Master Yuk, Madam.

631
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,221
You must be exhausted, Master Kao.

632
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,779
- l'm fine...
- Kao Lang Chau!

633
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,490
Where do you think you're going?

634
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,761
You're not getting rid
of me so easily!

635
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,490
l'm staying with you for life!

636
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,154
You...!

637
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,797
Master Kao, she is...

638
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,638
She's my wife.

639
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,368
You damn scholar! How dare you!

640
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,666
What?

641
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,178
Do you want me to tell them
who you really are?

642
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,880
Should l tell Master Yuk
that you are indeed

643
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,615
the despicable, wanted
fugitive ''Jade Fox''?

644
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,549
You...

645
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,785
Master Yuk is the newly
appointed Viceroy.

646
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,015
So you better be careful and
don't do anything rash.

647
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,050
l want you to behave yourself
and stay here.

648
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,228
Then...

649
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,429
What about the manuscript?

650
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,057
l will give it to you
when the time is right.

651
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,221
You stole the
''Juo Wa Manuscript''!

652
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,055
l didn't!

653
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:39,923
You really didn't?

654
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,291
l'll be damned if l lied to you!

655
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,349
Fine!

656
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,664
Are you still denying it?

657
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:48,865
l wouldn't have stolen it
if you taught me.

658
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:49,599
Still so arrogant?

659
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,734
l must teach you a lesson!

660
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:51,368
Master.

661
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:52,168
Give me back the manuscript!

662
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:52,969
No!

663
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,170
Why wouldn't you behave?

664
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,038
Because l'm not content!

665
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:55,805
l have to learn it!

666
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,205
You're not qualified to learn it
because of your temperament!

667
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,044
Why can't l learn it?

668
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:01,978
You're too wild.

669
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,380
Just like l didn't want to
give the manuscript

670
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,981
to ''Jade Fox'' years ago.

671
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,516
lt will only beget more ills.

672
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,584
Jade Fox?

673
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,319
Master, so you know Jade Fox?

674
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,754
She's your master's wife.

675
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:11,888
She?

676
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,256
She's Jade Fox?

677
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,591
But she's really not my wife.

678
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,661
She's here to take back
the manuscript.

679
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,561
So this manuscript belongs to her?

680
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:21,431
No.

681
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,491
lt belongs to a Wu Tang
master, Jiang Lan Huo.

682
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,063
Was he the one whom you
always pay respect to?

683
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,003
You...

684
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:41,384
Brother Jiang told me that

685
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,720
he had always suspected
his wife Lieu.

686
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,422
She's been eyeing the manuscript.

687
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,481
So l've decided to hide it.

688
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,427
This manuscript only has
the external stances.

689
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,662
Lieu's talent and skills
are limited.

690
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:56,132
lf she learns it, then she'll
only damage her own body

691
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,801
and take herself on to the
path of self destruction.

692
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:00,463
Master, then can you teach me
the internal stances?

693
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,405
No way!

694
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,473
Why?

695
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,176
lt was greed that caused
your own master

696
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:10,374
to steal the manuscript from Lieu
and learn it for himself.

697
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:16,019
Even if my kung fu is now superb,
l feel like a thief.

698
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,654
Always living in fear.

699
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,623
The more my kung fu improves,
the more guilt l feel.

700
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,081
ln the end, l had to retreat
to the deserts.

701
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,796
Lung.

702
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,131
Let's forget about all this and

703
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,366
return it to the rightful owner.

704
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,202
Master, you want to return it
to Wu Tang?

705
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,430
Yes.

706
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,404
No!

707
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,506
Lung! Why wouldn't you
just listen to me??

708
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,374
Master.

709
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:39,409
l've already experienced
such superb kung fu.

710
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,212
l won't be content if you
want me to turn back now!

711
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,965
Greetings, Uncle Tak.
l'm Li Mu Bai of Wu Tang.

712
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,527
What can l do for you?

713
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,339
l'm a friend of Yu Shu Lien.

714
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,365
She urged me to visit you
once l'm here in the capital.

715
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:16,440
l knew what happened
to Brother Hung Yuen's family.

716
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,110
Now she's the only one left.

717
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,078
How is she?

718
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,220
She's already found someone
who can give her

719
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,778
happiness for the rest of her life.

720
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:34,964
Morning, Madam Kao.

721
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:35,832
Morning.

722
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,460
- What a pretty bird!
- Let me tell you, this bird...

723
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,738
Talk!

724
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:42,906
Where's the manuscript?

725
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:45,101
What are you talking about,
Madam Kao??

726
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,609
Stop pretending!

727
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,279
That master of yours must have
taught you kung fu!

728
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,280
No!

729
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,714
Master only teaches me literature
and calligraphy!

730
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:52,578
You...

731
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,253
You better stop lying
or l'll kill you!

732
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,055
lt hurts, Madam Kao!

733
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,323
Let me go!

734
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,624
Still think you can fool me?!

735
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,493
l really don't know kung fu, Madam!

736
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,327
l really don't!

737
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,385
Dammit!

738
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,533
Miss!

739
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,693
Miss!

740
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,835
Old Master.

741
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,899
What nerves!

742
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,641
Who dares to hurt Lung
in my own house?!

743
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,615
l'm not going to spare that person!

744
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,418
The maid told me that,
when she saw Lung,

745
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,286
only Madam Kao was with her.

746
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,387
lt's her?

747
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,376
Father...

748
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:33,878
Lung!

749
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:34,591
Lung!

750
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,992
Madam Kao has nothing to do with it.

751
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,093
Then...

752
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,461
l was trying to catch a bird,

753
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,656
so l climbed up the tree, and...

754
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,261
ls that so?

755
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,260
Master.

756
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:46,626
How are you doing?

757
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:50,670
Master, it's all my fault.

758
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,069
l better return this
manuscript to you.

759
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:55,769
You...

760
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,349
You're right.

761
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:02,546
This manuscript is
nothing but trouble.

762
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,018
l think Jade Fox is not
going to let me go easily.

763
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,859
Her kung fu is not
as good as yours.

764
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,891
No matter what, she's not
going to give up.

765
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,625
Besides, l was only doing it for fun.

766
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,098
Forget it.

767
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,566
How could you bully someone
who doesn't know kung fu?!

768
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,207
l was wrong then.

769
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,376
But you can't blame me
for everything!

770
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:28,444
Had it not for you,
l wouldn't have done it!

771
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,912
So is this really all
you want after all?

772
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,819
That's Jiang Lan Huo's
Juo Wa Manuscript!

773
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,650
Just take it and leave!

774
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,757
This is too easy!

775
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,358
l'm afraid you might
offend Viceroy Yuk

776
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,020
if you keep rippling
the water here!

777
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:48,264
A scholar will always be a scholar.

778
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,666
Just mind your own business!

779
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,691
Fine, l'm going.

780
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:52,926
Then go!

781
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,948
Madam Kao.

782
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,682
lt's you!

783
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,206
lt's late. Where're you going?

784
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,808
l...

785
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,316
You are leaving?

786
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:11,986
Yes.

787
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,089
l've told you.

788
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,958
l'll leave once l have finished
my business here.

789
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,126
That's all you have on you? lt's cold.

790
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,923
Take this.

791
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,431
Take care, Madam Kao.

792
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,092
Please come back often.

793
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:25,993
Wait!

794
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:29,633
You know something?

795
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,870
l'm not some ''Madam Kao''.

796
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,405
l'm a bandit.

797
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,711
Really?

798
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:37,880
So don't be so nice
to just anybody.

799
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,006
Do you understand?

800
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,680
Madam Kao!

801
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:47,880
What is it?

802
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,991
Do you know someone by
the name of Lo Xiao Fu?

803
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,128
You know him?

804
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,001
He told me there's someone
who calls herself

805
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:01,937
''Jade Fox'' that knows
who killed his father.

806
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:09,236
You little fox.

807
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,117
l almost fell into your trap.

808
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:20,511
So you're just like
all the others.

809
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,215
You just want to use me.

810
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,427
Madam Kao...

811
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,361
You know something?

812
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,588
l'm not going to tell you.

813
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:33,803
l want to leave a bait,
so that l may use you

814
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:37,136
when you need me later.

815
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,045
Do you hate me?

816
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:20,750
l hate you!

817
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,551
l hate you...

818
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,519
Hate you...

819
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,633
Dammit!

820
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,304
Catch her, father!

821
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,135
We have to revenge for mother!

822
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:00,778
Father!

823
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,560
Father!

824
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,491
Father, are you all right?

825
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,693
l'm not marrying a bandit.

826
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:19,892
Why?

827
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,040
l'm a Viceroy's daughter.

828
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,108
Even though my father is no longer
commanding the frontier,

829
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,344
l still can't associate myself
with the notorious ''Dark Cloud''.

830
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,979
Even if my father doesn't object,

831
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,614
other officials will
still suspect that

832
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,775
he's conspiring with bandits.

833
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,085
You're you, and your father
is your father.

834
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,353
Why does it matter?

835
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,651
Who cares where you go
once you leave him for good?!

836
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,325
Leave him for good?

837
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,452
l can't do that.
That wouldn't be filial.

838
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,562
You can't do this and
you can't do that.

839
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,120
So do you love me or not??

840
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:50,733
Do l love you?

841
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,360
You should know by now.

842
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:53,661
Damn bandit!

843
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,499
Then come with me!

844
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:56,873
l can't!

845
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,740
l don't care!

846
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,173
You're being silly now!

847
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,907
What's with you, woman?

848
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,643
l'm not following you!

849
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,915
So it's all because
l'm a bandit, isn't it?

850
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,243
Yes.

851
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,280
Fine!

852
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,157
Then l won't be one anymore!

853
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,633
l'll sever my ties
with my brothers tomorrow,

854
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,567
then l'll come back for you!

855
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,836
You really mean it?

856
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,561
We should split here, woman.

857
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:53,329
No!

858
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:54,660
Let's go a bit further.

859
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,161
Then go back with me.

860
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,525
No way!

861
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:00,733
Are you leaving now?

862
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:04,796
Then give me a kiss.

863
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,235
ln your dreams!

864
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,418
You should go back now.
