00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,172
Michael!

3
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:24,181
Michael!!

4
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:18,728
Excellence,
education, faith.

5
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:24,500
These are the foundations of the
religious formation and strong education

6
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,070
that Holy Name Episcopal High
School

7
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:33,343
has been providing young women for
nearly one and a half centuries.

8
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,578
Hello.

9
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,713
I'm Reverend Warren Peters,

10
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:41,285
President and Principal of Holy
Name Episcopal High School.

11
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,755
Our mission is to educate the
young women entrusted to our care

12
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,624
with the immaculate teachings of
the Word

13
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:54,131
and nurture them into productive and
spiritually rich members of society.

14
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,067
You have expressed an interest
in attending Holy Name.

15
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,271
I'll be your host through this
video tour,

16
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,708
a chance for you to view the
magnificent facilities

17
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,315
and beautiful campus of Holy Name,
to help you decide if our institution...

18
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:41,278
There're ants in the
wildflowers you had me pick.

19
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,114
There's Raid in there.

20
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:45,648
Maybe we should order
some.

21
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,652
There's a place on the mainland
that ships for free.

22
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:54,458
You know, every penny I get,
goes to getting you into Holy Name.

23
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,660
Can you collect the mail on your
way through?

24
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,362
We have the liturgy tonight.

25
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:07,304
No, you moved the
liturgy for the vigil tonight.

26
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,505
The men are still trolling for
him.

27
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,443
Yeah, I know.

28
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,779
Stupid thing.
What a waste.

29
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:21,251
That's why you're not supposed
to swim there.

30
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,187
God bless him.

31
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,622
You want to begin?

32
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:30,626
- No, you.
- All the way up.

33
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,863
Proverbs, chapter 3, verse 5.

34
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:38,334
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
and do not rely on your own insight.

35
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,504
Trust in the Lord with all your
heart and do not rely on your own insight.

36
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,440
Be not wise.

37
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,775
Be not, in all your
ways, acknowledge.

38
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,313
In all your ways, acknowledge Him
and He shall make straight your path.

39
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,782
In all your ways, acknowledge
Him and He shall make straight your path.

40
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,516
Be not wise in your own
eyes.

41
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,251
Be not wise in your own
eyes.

42
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,889
Be not wise in your own eyes.
In the Proverbs it says train up a child

43
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:04,127
and the way he should go and when he
is old, he will not depart from it.

44
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,731
The question is, what is the
right way

45
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:13,170
and how do we know if something is right
for our children or even ourselves?

46
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:16,707
From Matthew, every good tree
bringeth forth good fruit,

47
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,345
but a corrupt tree bringeth
forth good fruits.

48
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:25,915
Every good tree doesn't bring
evil fruits.

49
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:31,588
We have a small orchard here on
Lacquesset Island

50
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:37,895
and when one of our fruits go missing,
we all lose some of our fruit.

51
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:43,767
So, so let's pray for the men and women
who are looking for Michael Quinn,

52
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,837
that their search is fruitful.

53
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,438
Amen.

54
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:54,211
As a mother stills her
child

55
00:09:54,243 --> 00:10:00,684
Thou canst hush the ocean wild

56
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:06,756
Boisterous waves obey Thy will

57
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,730
When the Saints can then be
still

58
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:19,703
When at last I near the shore

59
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:25,842
And the fearful breakers roar

60
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:31,982
'Twixt me and the peaceful rest

61
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:39,289
Then, while leaning on Thy
breast

62
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:45,462
May I hear Thee say to me

63
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:52,469
"I will pilot thee."

64
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:09,413
Launched by NASA's jet
Propulsion Laboratory in 1977,

65
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:14,383
Voyager 2 and its sister probe,
Voyager 1 were designed as space travelers

66
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,054
to reach the furthest unknown
areas of space.

67
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:22,826
This August Voyager 2 will pass within
3,000 miles of the planet Neptune.

68
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:27,797
Using its television cameras, Voyager
2 will send back pictures of Neptune...

69
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,733
- Thomas!
- What?

70
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:31,834
You know what?

71
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:35,439
Why don't you move up to this
chair here, please.

72
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,840
Thomas?

73
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,974
I don't want to; make
someone else do it. Make her do it.

74
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:42,045
- No, Thomas.
- I don't mind.

75
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,083
Then you take Hannah's
seat.

76
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:13,944
Michael.

77
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:46,008
- Wow.
- Look at that!

78
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,525
Got it?

79
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,795
See what love the Father
has bestowed on us,

80
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,998
that we may be called the
children of God.

81
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,067
Yet so we are.

82
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:22,606
The reason the world does not know
us is that it did not know Him.

83
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,041
We are God's children now.

84
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:28,812
What we shall be has not yet
been revealed.

85
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:33,148
We do know that when it is
revealed, we shall be like Him,

86
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:37,586
for we shall see Him as He is.

87
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,723
We pray for Michael's family,

88
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,126
that the Lord will fill the
present emptiness in their hearts

89
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:49,165
with the love and prayerful support
of many friends, we pray to the Lord.

90
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,566
Lord, hear our prayer.

91
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:54,670
For each of us here present,
that God will bless us richly

92
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,842
with the gifts he knows we need
to fully celebrate life

93
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:06,316
and recognize the new beginning, which he
offers us each day, we pray to the Lord.

94
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,151
Lord, hear our prayer.

95
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:15,291
We remember Michael today
for his life has touched each of us.

96
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:19,161
We know him as our brother here
in this congregation.

97
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:22,866
We know him as a good student in
our school

98
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,337
and we know him as Lacquesset's
youngest lobsterman,

99
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,641
as his father, Herb's sternman.

100
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:36,679
For a moment, let us be with our
own memories of Michael.

101
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,072
On a note of new beginnings, I
have an announcement.

102
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,008
Our, our own Hannah Newcomb,

103
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,645
has applied for Holy Name High
School in Shore Springs,

104
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:12,314
which she hopes to be attending
this fall.

105
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,050
There's a contribution box at
the door.

106
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:20,290
This is a great honor for her and
it's a great honor for our island...

107
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,925
What did you just say?

108
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,926
...to attend this great
institution.

109
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:32,702
I hope, I hope that, I encourage you
all as you leave, to leave some...

110
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:37,741
This is my son's funeral!
Not a sideshow for that orphan!

111
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:47,916
Fuck your school, honey.

112
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,420
It's nothing personal, but fuck
you all the same.

113
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:55,658
That's enough.

114
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,362
Rejoice in the fact
that we do see

115
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:40,103
a great deal of decency and
heroic virtue in our lives.

116
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:44,339
And priests especially don't
thank the people enough

117
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:50,814
who make our priestly ministry possible
with their presence and generosity...

118
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:56,386
the servants who are serving the
Father,

119
00:18:56,418 --> 00:19:03,192
serving the decent Son as an
important part of their lives.

120
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,129
But also the Word of the Father.

121
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:16,139
The servants have to be open and
willing to welcome home...

122
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:21,297
Hello?

123
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:32,075
Hello?

124
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:39,515
Hello?

125
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:46,388
Hannah? Is that you?

126
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:51,394
What are you doing out here?

127
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:56,965
I heard a sound.

128
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:02,005
Is something wrong with
you?

129
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,348
It's past 5:00.

130
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:20,322
You probably should start your
chores.

131
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,258
Jerry?

132
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,361
I'd like to work for the Quinns
this summer.

133
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:30,500
I could go out and haul lobster
traps for him.

134
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,568
Absolutely not.

135
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,637
Michael was a stern man
on Herb Quinn's lobster boat

136
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,240
and now he has nobody to help
him.

137
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,342
Please, put that out of
my face.

138
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:46,715
We could talk about it later.

139
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:52,355
Give and it shall be
given to you.

140
00:22:52,387 --> 00:23:01,397
For whatever measure you deal out to
others, it will be dealt to you in return.

141
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:05,233
Will you be paid?

142
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:11,407
Yes.

143
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,446
Your chores.

144
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:10,232
I'm going out for a smoke.

145
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:16,739
These are my dad's.

146
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:21,577
He was 81.

147
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:26,616
Yeah?

148
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:46,101
I'm really sorry about the
service.

149
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:51,607
I didn't ask him to say any of
that.

150
00:24:51,639 --> 00:25:00,649
Yeah, well...

151
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:09,091
I could come work for
you.

152
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:16,299
I could go on the boat, I could
help you.

153
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:23,805
I need the money.

154
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:31,379
I don't think so.

155
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:36,853
Sean is...

156
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:46,096
I could use the help,
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

157
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:19,415
Here we go.

158
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:28,457
Bonnie brought them over.

159
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:33,428
Hmm... hmm.

160
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,930
They're really good.

161
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,831
They're made from honey,
she said.

162
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:40,403
I don't know.

163
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:42,538
From the bee lady?

164
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:50,913
I don't know.

165
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:56,952
I found this the other day.

166
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,722
I haven't much to give you, you
know.

167
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:08,731
Pinching pennies for that school,
but I wanted to give you something.

168
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:21,077
When you first came here,
people said you were a gift from God.

169
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:23,478
Of course, I don't have any
children of my own,

170
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:32,521
but I've come to think of you
like that.

171
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:40,862
You ought to have nothing but
the best opportunities.

172
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:48,870
You deserve that school and I'm
going to make sure you get it.

173
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:53,075
Excellence,
education, faith.

174
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:56,578
These are the foundations of the
religious formation

175
00:29:56,611 --> 00:30:01,483
and strong education that Holy
Name Episcopal High School

176
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:07,590
has been providing young women for
nearly one and a half centuries.

177
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:09,992
Our mission is to educate the
young women

178
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:14,863
entrusted to our care with the
immaculate teachings of the Word

179
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:23,905
and nurture them into productive and
spiritually rich members of society.

180
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:22,097
Hello?

181
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:31,106
Herb?

182
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,833
Sorry.

183
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:15,917
You sure about this?

184
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,525
Truck.

185
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,552
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

186
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:54,623
Over here and down here.

187
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:56,325
You got it?
You OK?

188
00:32:56,357 --> 00:33:01,563
Yeah, good.

189
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:21,884
Hannah.

190
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,895
OK.

191
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,130
These five traps are yours.

192
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,934
Whatever they catch, you keep
the profit.

193
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:43,338
That'll be your pay.

194
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,641
Do you have any other work
clothes?

195
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:51,646
No, not really.

196
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,796
Here you go.
These were Michael's.

197
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,734
Some of them should fit you.

198
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:16,772
He was a little dude.

199
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:24,179
There's weeds growing
around the flowers here.

200
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:25,813
Those aren't weeds;
mint.

201
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:33,821
I planted it, remember?

202
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,290
How was your work today?

203
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:39,827
All right.

204
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:44,667
We just hauled out some traps
from the storage area.

205
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,069
What about your pay?

206
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:51,973
He gave me some traps of
my own.

207
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:57,979
And what if you don't
catch anything; what then?

208
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,817
For nearly one and
a half centuries.

209
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,052
Hello.

210
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm Reverend Warren Peters,

211
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:09,758
President and Principal of Holy
Name Episcopal High School.

212
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,328
Our mission is to educate the
young women entrusted to our care

213
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,098
with the immaculate teachings of
the Word

214
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:24,005
and nurture them into productive and
spiritually rich members of society.

215
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,876
Holy Name fosters empathy and
responsibility for self

216
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:32,381
and others in a fully
residential community.

217
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:37,720
Students are encouraged to think
creatively, work collaboratively,

218
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:45,059
develop individual passions and
celebrate talent.

219
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,036
Those fit you OK?

220
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:07,075
Yep.

221
00:37:56,557 --> 00:38:05,568
OK. You ready? All right.

222
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:17,879
This guy right here is your
throttle.

223
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:20,548
I can't see.

224
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:23,252
You're doing fine.

225
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:25,153
Look behind you.

226
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:28,589
See the landing? See that rock?

227
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,592
I want you to turn right,
throttle up.

228
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:36,899
This one right here.

229
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:43,437
It's OK, you're doing great.

230
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,443
Do it again.

231
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:27,443
Open yours right up, you
got to check yours, too.

232
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:32,046
Is that what I keep
doing?

233
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,086
Nope.
You got to put these in there.

234
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,332
Hannah?

235
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,234
Yeah?

236
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:41,870
Didn't forget, did you?

237
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,205
No.

238
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:48,376
You've still got evening
chores.

239
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:51,378
Hannah?

240
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:54,883
Yeah, I will.

241
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:57,285
There's dinner when
you're finished.

242
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:02,323
OK.

243
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,343
Did you gather all of the
donations from today?

244
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:22,877
Yes.

245
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,446
Did you put them in the
den?

246
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:31,453
Yes, Jerry.

247
00:44:31,486 --> 00:44:35,423
Fishing isn't an excuse
for neglecting your duties here.

248
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,796
Remember?

249
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:48,336
Aren't you forgetting something?

250
00:44:48,368 --> 00:44:51,705
Dear Lord, thank you for
this food

251
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:59,747
and for giving me the chance to help Herb
Quinn and his family and their son, Michael,

252
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:03,385
who you took from us for reasons
we're not to know.

253
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:08,423
Amen.

254
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:53,334
Hello?

255
00:45:53,368 --> 00:46:02,377
Who is it?

256
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:54,122
Well, safe.

257
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:56,758
Want a sandwich? I made
two.

258
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:05,801
Sure.

259
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,171
No, no!
What the hell you doing?

260
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:12,673
No.
Come on.

261
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:14,042
I'm not going to eat it.

262
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:20,080
Why not?

263
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:23,818
Needed salt.

264
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,716
Marcy!

265
00:49:28,749 --> 00:49:30,651
Herb.

266
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,288
I'll have a stout and a
soda for her.

267
00:49:33,321 --> 00:49:37,725
Sure, dear.

268
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:41,729
I'm sure you all know
Hannah.

269
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:43,897
So what's shaking
today, Herb?

270
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,034
I'm showing Hannah the art
of the haul.

271
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,303
How you liking it out
there, Hannah?

272
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:49,937
Good.

273
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,638
No luxury cruise,
though, is it?

274
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:53,574
No, it's not.

275
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:54,441
You all done with school,
Hannah?

276
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:56,711
Yeah. I graduated last
week.

277
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,944
That's great.

278
00:49:57,979 --> 00:50:00,948
You were the one and only, the
one and only graduate, huh?

279
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:04,751
Congrats.
I remember...

280
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:08,222
So Hannah, what do you know about
this old timer you been working for?

281
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:09,957
Ever hear any stories?

282
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,259
I could tell you some
stories.

283
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:13,861
You save your stories,
Marcy.

284
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:16,363
Just go back there and do what
you're good at doing.

285
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:19,767
Well, Herb always was a
tough son of a bitch.

286
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,202
Don't mind my swearing.

287
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:25,339
The only problem was you couldn't
get him ornery enough to fight.

288
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:28,108
He's always kind.
Yep.

289
00:50:28,142 --> 00:50:30,278
His old man was like that, too.

290
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,981
That's why we were all a bit
surprised when Sean fell for him.

291
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:37,719
We always thought the biggest
prick gets the chick.

292
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,153
Hannah, you're going to
have to pardon Lemann.

293
00:50:39,185 --> 00:50:40,854
His language gets a little
colorful.

294
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:46,060
Turns out, turns out, even young
women sometimes go for a man of substance.

295
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:51,332
Night they met, we were over at
Jake's place having a few barley pops

296
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:54,935
and Sean and Herb, they lost
some kind of bet.

297
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,403
Card game, cards.

298
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:59,807
Cards.

299
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,209
Something like that,
something like that.

300
00:51:02,243 --> 00:51:03,478
They lost the bet.

301
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,681
They had to snowmobile from one
end of the island to the other,

302
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:10,283
just the way God made 'em.

303
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:11,885
You mean like ...?

304
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:13,655
Nude, honey.

305
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:17,425
Naked!

306
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:22,630
It was love at first
sight.

307
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:31,338
I missed the evening
service.

308
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:34,841
You want me to talk to
Jerry?

309
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:39,079
This is my fault.

310
00:51:39,113 --> 00:51:44,085
No, I got it.

311
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:23,290
Hey, Jerry.

312
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:25,425
I'm sorry I kept her out late.

313
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:28,328
I wanted to repay her hard work
with a soda.

314
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:30,932
Yeah, well, money would
be better.

315
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:37,204
Yeah, well, we should be
getting to her traps tomorrow, right?

316
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:42,276
Go in, Hannah.

317
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:46,046
Hey, Herb. Hey,
Lori.

318
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,817
Jerry, she's been a really
big help.

319
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,419
I can't thank you enough.

320
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:56,457
OK.
Goodbye.

321
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:05,165
Herb took me to the
Squall.

322
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:10,171
Look at you.

323
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:16,943
They're my bib pants.

324
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:21,149
What do you think?

325
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:25,453
What if the girls from Holy Name
saw you?

326
00:53:25,486 --> 00:53:30,024
Do you think they would let you
in?

327
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:39,033
Do you think you're worthy to
represent this church there?

328
00:53:39,066 --> 00:53:47,274
Because of how I'm
dressed?

329
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,210
I want you to give a
confession.

330
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:52,345
What?
What do you mean?

331
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:54,115
Come on.

332
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,184
Where?

333
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:57,084
In there.

334
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:58,385
That's the closet.

335
00:53:58,419 --> 00:54:01,522
It'll do.
Come on.

336
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:05,560
Jerry, no.
Why?

337
00:54:05,593 --> 00:54:08,529
In there.

338
00:54:08,562 --> 00:54:11,432
Jerry.

339
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:16,470
Go in.

340
00:54:27,113 --> 00:54:28,381
Hannah?

341
00:54:28,414 --> 00:54:30,984
There's no light.

342
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,120
It's blown.

343
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:37,057
You can start.

344
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:41,362
I don't know what you
want me to do.

345
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:46,900
Say, bless me, for I have
sinned.

346
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:49,937
OK.
Bless me, for I have sinned.

347
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,107
The Lord be in your heart and
on your lips, that you may truly...

348
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,877
Jerry, this is stupid.
Why am I in the closet?

349
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,245
...to in the Common
Prayer...

350
00:54:57,278 --> 00:54:58,111
Can I come out?

351
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:07,053
Most merciful God.

352
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:09,890
Hannah?

353
00:55:09,923 --> 00:55:12,659
What did I do wrong?

354
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:15,263
You haven't kept your
promise to me.

355
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:17,564
I've done everything I
used to do for you.

356
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:19,900
No, you haven't.

357
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:21,468
You told me I could work
for him.

358
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:24,605
I told you, you could
work for him, that is all.

359
00:55:24,638 --> 00:55:26,240
I'm just trying to help.

360
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:29,977
There are people who need
our help.

361
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,312
If you want to help, find
somebody...

362
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:41,356
He lost his son.

363
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:44,624
I didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:55:47,995 --> 00:55:55,202
Jerry, please.

365
00:55:55,234 --> 00:56:00,240
Jerry, can I please come out?

366
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,051
Hannah?

367
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:46,119
Yeah?

368
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:51,158
It's Thomas.

369
00:57:04,405 --> 00:57:06,540
Wow, this is cool.

370
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:07,675
Is this your room?

371
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:08,675
No.

372
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:10,344
Are you camping?

373
00:57:10,377 --> 00:57:12,446
It's so small.

374
00:57:12,479 --> 00:57:14,381
What were you watching?

375
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:15,782
I have to be quiet.

376
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:17,451
What movies were you
watching?

377
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,353
A video from Holy Name.

378
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,688
Oh.
Holy Name?

379
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:24,091
Oh, yeah. Cool.

380
00:57:24,124 --> 00:57:26,292
I don't know where I'm going
yet.

381
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:29,463
Maybe I'll go to Holy Name, too.
I don't know.

382
00:57:29,495 --> 00:57:34,501
Well, it's for girls
only, so...

383
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:46,179
Thank Bonnie for me.

384
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:49,816
She gave me a buck.

385
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,685
How'd you get this in here?

386
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:55,356
This is so cool, you have TV.

387
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,059
What's that?

388
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:02,530
Is that... let me see that.

389
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,131
Holy shit, it is.
This is Michael's hat.

390
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:08,101
It was in the bag of
stuff Herb gave me.

391
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:09,403
You're wearing Michael's
clothes?

392
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:10,504
No.

393
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:13,174
I was going to give it back
anyway. I don't need it.

394
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:13,808
Oh yeah?

395
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:15,709
Well, how about right now.

396
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:21,615
Now?
No, I have to study.

397
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:25,086
I think they would want
it back right now.

398
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:32,425
Thomas! Thomas!

399
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:36,363
Come and get it, cow!

400
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:39,633
Whoo!

401
00:58:39,665 --> 00:58:46,539
Thomas?

402
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:52,146
Thomas, we shouldn't be here.

403
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:54,414
Why?

404
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:59,420
Come on, just check it out.

405
00:59:27,914 --> 00:59:37,124
Just wait.

406
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,896
Don't you think we should give
the hat back?

407
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:45,198
She probably wants it.

408
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:50,803
Just give me the hat and
let's go.

409
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:53,606
Why don't you go knock
on the door?

410
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,542
What?

411
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:00,580
The door for the hat,

412
01:00:01,714 --> 01:00:06,687
the door for the hat.

413
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:28,509
OK, give me the hat.

414
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:38,418
Hello?

415
01:00:38,452 --> 01:00:43,457
Who is it?

416
01:00:53,499 --> 01:00:57,604
Michael?

417
01:00:57,638 --> 01:01:00,507
Dad?

418
01:01:05,845 --> 01:01:07,914
Fuck!

419
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:10,751
I'll kill you, you fuck!

420
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:19,794
Herb?
Herb?

421
01:01:23,664 --> 01:01:25,332
- What was it?
- No, no, no.

422
01:01:25,365 --> 01:01:26,000
It's nothing.

423
01:01:26,033 --> 01:01:27,334
No, nothing.

424
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:28,769
Herb, I heard you say Michael.

425
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:29,870
What was it?

426
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:30,937
Come on, come on, let's go
inside.

427
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,039
Come on, it's nothing.

428
01:01:32,071 --> 01:01:37,278
Come on, it's OK.

429
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:30,997
It was only a joke, come
on.

430
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:32,433
Let go!

431
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:37,604
I'm not holding you.

432
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,874
Hannah, what is this?

433
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,576
What are you doing?

434
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:55,048
What are you doing?

435
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,952
I'm camping.

436
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:04,992
Put this on and join me
out here.

437
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:16,002
Good morning.

438
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,236
What the hell is this?

439
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:20,039
We need a charter over to
Ram Island, can you help us?

440
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:23,143
What do you need to go
there for.

441
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:26,513
It's a church matter.

442
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:27,948
Yeah, well, have a...

443
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:30,917
We're going to see Kay
Goodall.

444
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,218
What for?

445
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:36,723
It's a church matter.

446
01:04:36,756 --> 01:04:45,766
Yeah, you said that.

447
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:52,939
Yeah, all right.

448
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,080
She's sick, you know.

449
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:03,749
Yes.

450
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:06,220
The bee lady?

451
01:05:06,252 --> 01:05:09,122
What?

452
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:14,127
Like the honey?

453
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:27,240
Why are we going?

454
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:29,576
Can't hear you.

455
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:32,145
Why are we going?

456
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,048
We're going to anoint Kay
Goodall.

457
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,916
I'm going to give her the Last
Rites.

458
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:41,955
I'm not ordained.

459
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:49,563
It's a little surge-y out
there.

460
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:52,598
My brother Paul's a sword
fisherman.

461
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:56,602
My cousin worked on a trawler
until he retired.

462
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:58,304
I could never do it.

463
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:02,276
I could never spend more than
half an hour on a boat.

464
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:03,944
We should be in the clear;

465
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:07,948
not much farther now.

466
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:13,053
I don't know how you
fisher folk do it.

467
01:06:13,086 --> 01:06:19,959
I mean, the work, the endless
trapping and killing.

468
01:06:19,993 --> 01:06:28,101
You spend so much time doing
something of no substance.

469
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:32,238
You gotta raise a family
somehow.

470
01:06:32,272 --> 01:06:36,743
God bless you for it.

471
01:06:36,776 --> 01:06:41,781
Fathers are fathers.

472
01:06:58,832 --> 01:07:03,837
Hannah!

473
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,117
Mrs. Goodall!

474
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:19,885
Why don't you go around back?

475
01:07:19,919 --> 01:07:24,925
Here.

476
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:38,972
Mrs. Goodall!

477
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:13,906
Mrs. Goodall?

478
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:18,945
Mrs. Goodall, are you all right?

479
01:08:32,057 --> 01:08:34,961
Spooky, isn't it?

480
01:08:34,994 --> 01:08:35,895
I'm sorry.

481
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:39,899
You're a little spooky
yourself.

482
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:42,735
It's a border stone.

483
01:08:42,769 --> 01:08:48,208
My husband found it at the base
of the Himalayas in Rasuwa.

484
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,243
That's where we met.

485
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:51,811
He took it with him.

486
01:08:51,845 --> 01:08:52,945
Are you Mrs. Goodall?

487
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:55,749
Wherever he moved.

488
01:08:55,781 --> 01:09:00,986
He's buried right underneath it
now.

489
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:06,793
And I swear to you, that thing
is still moving.

490
01:09:06,825 --> 01:09:12,031
It has moved three feet in as
many years.

491
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,501
- Really?
- Yeah.

492
01:09:14,534 --> 01:09:23,744
Now where do you suppose he's
off to now?

493
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,217
Kind of thought I'd be
getting more visitors

494
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:35,922
after Bonnie brought me all
those birthday cards.

495
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:39,359
Here you go, girl.

496
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:43,329
So, priest, to what do I owe the
pleasure of this visit?

497
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:47,868
Are you here to talk me into
dying?

498
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,935
No, Mrs. Goodall.

499
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:52,172
My ward here hopes to be
ordained one day...

500
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:56,109
Ooh!

501
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:58,244
How's the tea, ward?

502
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:04,950
It's from the An Hui province.
You know where that is?

503
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:12,425
I was there in 1947 with the Red
Cross, see?

504
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,363
Queen can't get enough of this
stuff.

505
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:23,936
And here I am in Abyssinia two
years later, which is now...

506
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,872
Kathleen, if you don't
mind, this will only...

507
01:10:25,904 --> 01:10:27,072
What's your name, dear?

508
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:28,440
Hannah.

509
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:29,842
Hannah what?

510
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:31,343
Hannah Newcomb.

511
01:10:31,377 --> 01:10:33,814
Ooh, not much of a
name.

512
01:10:33,846 --> 01:10:36,215
Of course, Kathleen Goodall
isn't much better.

513
01:10:36,248 --> 01:10:38,450
Goodall was Raymond's name.

514
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,521
My maiden name is Plummer.

515
01:10:41,553 --> 01:10:43,522
Imagine.

516
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:48,562
Well, now, priest.
What's it gonna be?

517
01:10:48,595 --> 01:10:50,329
Anointing of the sick?

518
01:10:50,363 --> 01:10:54,967
The Eucharist or just a good old
fashioned spanking?

519
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,403
This will only take a
minute.

520
01:10:56,436 --> 01:10:58,438
Here, take this.
Take the book.

521
01:10:58,471 --> 01:10:59,272
Why?

522
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:00,006
Take the book, come with
me.

523
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:06,212
Come with me.
Take the oil.

524
01:11:06,245 --> 01:11:09,882
What good is the ritual
if she's not ordained?

525
01:11:09,915 --> 01:11:11,851
The oil is blessed.
It'll still work.

526
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:12,886
Jerry...

527
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:13,552
Now say after me...

528
01:11:13,586 --> 01:11:14,521
Jerry...

529
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:15,555
The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

530
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:24,597
Magic oil.

531
01:11:24,897 --> 01:11:31,171
My soul needs no cleansing,
priest.

532
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:39,880
And if God has anything on me,
you just send him down.

533
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:43,917
No offense, child.

534
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:48,654
Would you help me,
please?

535
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:55,328
Hannah.

536
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,198
You should have seen Hannah
today, Herb.

537
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,133
The work of God.

538
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:04,037
I'll bet.

539
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,373
I'm proud of you, Hannah.

540
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:11,410
You did good work today.

541
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:28,995
Sorry. We got to haul this
one in since we're here already.

542
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:34,467
This looks like one of yours.

543
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:22,048
Look at that.

544
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:31,123
Well, it'll come out with a
little soap and water.

545
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,127
It's not good work for a girl.

546
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,297
It's not good.

547
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:45,270
In a month you'll be with the other
girls and they'll look at you.

548
01:13:45,303 --> 01:13:51,211
I want to make sure that you're
right up there with them.

549
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:55,749
We just about got enough for the
first term.

550
01:13:55,781 --> 01:14:00,453
Enough money.

551
01:14:00,485 --> 01:14:09,462
And you spend all your time hauling
lobsters out, going around with fishermen.

552
01:14:12,464 --> 01:14:18,605
Who's going to be around to show
them the way when I'm not here?

553
01:14:18,637 --> 01:14:25,711
Judgment will wrack their bones.

554
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:34,720
I can't go to Holy Name.

555
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:41,160
What do you mean?

556
01:14:41,194 --> 01:14:47,834
I'm not going.
I don't want to.

557
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:49,735
Go get ready for service.

558
01:14:49,769 --> 01:14:56,109
I'm not going and I'm not
going to stay here with you anymore.

559
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:58,811
Oh, no?

560
01:14:58,845 --> 01:15:00,780
And what are you going to do?

561
01:15:00,812 --> 01:15:04,417
Fourteen years old, pull bugs
out of the water

562
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:06,385
and slosh that water on you for
the rest of your life?

563
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,421
Fourteen years old!

564
01:15:08,454 --> 01:15:11,091
They brought you out here, so I
could raise you as a Christian.

565
01:15:11,123 --> 01:15:13,760
And as long as I'm around,
you'll do what by me.

566
01:15:13,793 --> 01:15:16,096
Do you understand?

567
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,430
Now get that cleaned up for
service in an hour.

568
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:23,368
If you mess up one more time,
you will not leave this island!

569
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:26,638
That'll be my charity on you.

570
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:31,645
I want it cleaned up!

571
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:10,250
Excellence,
education, faith.

572
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:14,887
These are the foundations of the
religious formation and strong education

573
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:16,323
that Holy Name Episcopal High
School

574
01:16:16,355 --> 01:16:21,426
has been providing young women for
nearly one and a half centuries.

575
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:22,595
Hello.

576
01:16:22,628 --> 01:16:25,932
I'm Reverend Warren Peters,
President and Principal of

577
01:16:25,964 --> 01:16:30,736
Holy Name Episcopal High School
in Stockton Springs.

578
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:35,475
I want to personally congratulate
you on your acceptance to Holy Name.

579
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,644
I'm sure you probably have lots
of questions.

580
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:43,182
Future students want to know what a day
in the life looks like here at Holy Name.

581
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:47,854
Well, that's what this
acceptance video is for.

582
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:51,191
Let's step inside the hallways
of Holy Name

583
01:16:51,223 --> 01:17:00,232
to give you a better idea of what to
expect when you come here in the fall.

584
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:28,754
Hello?

585
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:33,793
Hello.

586
01:18:58,684 --> 01:19:03,656
Hello.

587
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:19,739
Thomas!

588
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:24,743
What are you doing?

589
01:19:37,422 --> 01:19:39,358
Church is that way.

590
01:19:39,391 --> 01:19:41,360
Can I ride that?

591
01:19:41,394 --> 01:19:43,396
Want to drive it?

592
01:19:43,428 --> 01:19:46,899
You can ride it if I drive.

593
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:49,668
Where?

594
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:57,510
Stand up on the pegs.
Hold on to me.

595
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:02,515
Hold on tight.

596
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:30,802
It's not even that high.

597
01:21:30,836 --> 01:21:35,641
I'll bet he's not even dead.

598
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:38,877
Why do you say that?

599
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:47,520
It's deep right there.
I could jump that.

600
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:50,890
Do it.

601
01:21:50,922 --> 01:21:53,859
For what?

602
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:55,927
I'll let you kiss me.

603
01:21:55,961 --> 01:21:57,562
When?

604
01:21:57,596 --> 01:22:04,035
After.

605
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:08,941
OK.

606
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:15,815
But if I die, it's your fault.

607
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:20,285
What are you waiting
for?

608
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:25,525
Nothing.

609
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:39,137
You're in deep shit!

610
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:44,177
Fuck off!

611
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:06,698
What are you doing?

612
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,868
What's happened?

613
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:11,671
What's happened?

614
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:15,107
What happened?

615
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:21,247
Trust in the Lord with all your
heart and do not rely on your own insight.

616
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,651
In all your ways acknowledge Him
and He will make great your path.

617
01:23:26,685 --> 01:23:30,923
Be not... let go!

618
01:23:30,955 --> 01:23:34,760
Mrs. Quinn!

619
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:39,799
I'm sorry.

620
01:23:44,168 --> 01:23:48,273
Come on!
What are you doing?

621
01:23:48,306 --> 01:23:56,147
Calm down, it's OK.

622
01:23:56,181 --> 01:23:58,284
What'd they send you?

623
01:23:58,316 --> 01:24:00,218
Did they let you in?

624
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:02,922
Hannah!

625
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:08,994
Hannah!

626
01:24:09,028 --> 01:24:17,770
Hannah!

627
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:18,937
Hannah!

628
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:24,843
Open the door!

629
01:24:24,877 --> 01:24:27,213
...School in
Stockton Springs.

630
01:24:27,245 --> 01:24:31,783
I want to personally congratulate
you on your acceptance to Holy Name.

631
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:36,823
I'm sure you probably have lots
of questions.

632
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:43,995
...far from the light and warmth
of the Sun and the life of the Earth,

633
01:24:44,029 --> 01:24:46,732
Voyager 2 passed over the cold
blue clouds of Neptune tonight,

634
01:24:46,765 --> 01:24:50,703
its cameras snapping pictures
and its sensors gathering data

635
01:24:50,735 --> 01:24:55,273
on the composition and dynamic
forces of the giant planet.

636
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:59,010
The rendezvous was the culmination
of the most far-reaching exploration

637
01:24:59,043 --> 01:25:03,048
of the planet in the history of
the space age.

638
01:25:03,082 --> 01:25:07,887
As Voyager 2 approached Neptune at
a speed of 38,000 miles an hour,

639
01:25:07,919 --> 01:25:08,988
it transmitted...

640
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,422
Hannah, please come out.

641
01:25:10,455 --> 01:25:12,891
...showing sharper
deeper details of the swirling clouds

642
01:25:12,925 --> 01:25:18,931
in Neptune's great dark spots, a
storm system the size of earth.

643
01:25:18,963 --> 01:25:25,236
Hannah, I'm sorry.

644
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:32,278
I'm not going, Jerry.

645
01:25:32,311 --> 01:25:35,147
We can talk about it.

646
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:41,052
Please come out.

647
01:25:41,086 --> 01:25:47,293
It's... It's my fault.

648
01:25:47,325 --> 01:25:50,895
I should have never let you work
with him.

649
01:25:50,928 --> 01:25:58,136
He couldn't even take care of
his own son.

650
01:25:58,169 --> 01:26:03,007
That doesn't mean
anything coming from you.

651
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:08,047
You never loved anything.

652
01:26:44,482 --> 01:26:49,120
Hey.

653
01:26:49,154 --> 01:26:56,861
Come on, come on inside.

654
01:26:56,895 --> 01:27:01,499
What's going on?

655
01:27:01,533 --> 01:27:06,539
What happened?

656
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:20,919
I need to stay here
tonight.

657
01:27:34,533 --> 01:27:39,539
Wait here a minute, OK?

658
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:10,368
Hi.

659
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:17,508
Hi.

660
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:26,651
He isn't going to save
you, you know.

661
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:29,021
Hey.

662
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:34,060
Let's get out of here, OK?

663
01:29:10,294 --> 01:29:19,305
Fred stills this stuff.

664
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:27,046
You ever have homemade spirit?

665
01:29:47,498 --> 01:29:56,508
Me and Michael used to come here
all the time.

666
01:29:56,809 --> 01:30:02,314
Learned how to swim right out
there.

667
01:30:02,346 --> 01:30:11,356
He was a good swimmer, looked
like a monkey.

668
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:16,361
Did you know your daddy?

669
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:21,400
No.

670
01:30:21,432 --> 01:30:28,506
I think I remember my mother,
though.

671
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:32,444
Why did you come to live
here?

672
01:30:32,476 --> 01:30:35,213
I don't know.

673
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:38,717
Did you ever ask?

674
01:30:38,749 --> 01:30:40,386
Nope.

675
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:47,059
Jerry said, Jerry said it was
ungrateful

676
01:30:47,092 --> 01:30:55,234
to look past the path that God
had set for me.

677
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:57,035
Yeah.

678
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:05,044
Well, I always, I always thought
you made your own path.

679
01:31:56,695 --> 01:32:05,704
It was in the bag with
all the other stuff.

680
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:34,899
No.

681
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:40,138
It's OK.

682
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:48,146
No, no.

683
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,383
Please, please, please,
please.

684
01:32:51,415 --> 01:32:52,383
Please, don't.

685
01:32:52,417 --> 01:32:56,655
Please, please, please.

686
01:32:56,687 --> 01:32:59,158
Please, please, please.

687
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:00,024
Herb.

688
01:33:00,059 --> 01:33:03,462
Please, please, please,
please.

689
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,329
Herb, stop it.

690
01:33:05,363 --> 01:33:08,767
Please, please, please,
please.

691
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,503
Stop.

692
01:33:12,537 --> 01:33:17,543
Please, please...

693
01:33:27,752 --> 01:33:32,725
Michael.

694
01:33:38,829 --> 01:33:39,830
No!

695
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,935
Michael!
Michael!

696
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:45,303
Herb!

697
01:33:45,337 --> 01:33:48,339
Herb!

698
01:33:50,507 --> 01:33:55,480
Herb!

699
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:04,522
Herb!

700
01:34:06,357 --> 01:34:08,327
Herb?

701
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:11,797
Here.

702
01:34:11,829 --> 01:34:17,868
I'm all right.

703
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:22,841
Shut that off.

704
01:34:22,873 --> 01:34:31,883
I'm all right.

705
01:34:32,617 --> 01:34:38,656
Look at them all.

706
