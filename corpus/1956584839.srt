his movies over and over again.

And you reaped
the rewards, Ed.

Look how much money
he's made this company.

149
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,175
It's not about money.

150
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,004
It's about image.

you do this to him.

Oh, he did it to himself.

155
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,838
Did you see his
latest pile of crap?

156
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,884
Ed, that movie bombed becauseit sucked, not because of Ryan.

157
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,538
You're a good manager, Todd.

158
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,758
You've guided Ryan'scareer from the beginning.

159
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,107
You've produced almost
all of his movies,

160
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,456
and you made him a star.

161
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,850
But lately, his
stock is dropping.

162
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,460
And I don't see
my company growing

163
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:34,159
with this kind of client, or you holding me back.

164
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,510
What's that supposed to mean?

165
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,555
Todd, unlike any other
manager here, I let you

166
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,297
focus almost solely on Ryan.

167
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:45,562
If I let him go, then itmakes sense to let you go too.

168
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,610
Ed, Ryan's kind of celebrity
doesn't just go away.

169
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,133
America had a place in
their heart for him.

170
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,918
It's just a matter of
carving that out again.

00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:23,948
Yeah.

185
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,863
I love your films.

186
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:26,995
Thanks.

187
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,649
And you are?

188
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,519
[GUSHES] Ronnie.

189
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,433
Ronnie.

190
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:31,956
Hi, Ronnie.

191
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,393
[Chuckles]

192
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,090
What are you drinking?

193
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,005
Cranberry vodka.

194
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,876
The movie was terrible.

195
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,661
I know.

196
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,577
It wasn't your fault. I'm justsaying that your reputation

197
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,839
with the ladies--
- I'm a dog.

198
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,580
Yeah.

199
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,018
Hey, I am no different thanany other normal single guy.

200
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,107
How about yes, you are.

201
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,457
According to nine magazines thatare on the stands right now,

202
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,894
you're one of the mostfamous single men in America.

203
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,114
But look, that's part of
the job-- the public's

204
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,202
interest in your life.

205
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,377
So I'm supposed to be a monk?

206
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:02,639
No.

207
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,467
But the public has
to love you again.

208
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,382
And if you're serious abouthaving the kind of career

209
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,819
that we've always aimed for, something's got to change.

210
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,431
Because right now, thetabloids have it out for you.

211
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,349
Tomorrow's newspaper,
you'll be gay.

212
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,353
At least I still have
the Julia Roberts movie.

213
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,748
You lost the
Julia Roberts movie.

214
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,228
What happened?

215
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,664
I'll fix it.

216
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,970
I promise.

217
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,667
We got to focus on
the image thing.

218
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,016
You can't cheat.

219
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,627
You can't break up
with other women

220
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,106
without letting them know it.

221
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,456
And you can't [inaudible].- No, no.

222
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,761
That's just the
tabloids exaggerating.

223
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,284
I know.
I know.

224
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,677
But you can't give themas much fodder as you do.

225
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,034
I'm sorry.

226
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,429
[Laughter]

227
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,738
So Leslie, there's
a few reality show

228
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,783
ideas we think you'll love.

229
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,263
Bring them on.

230
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,569
First one--

231
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,222
"Under Shelter."

232
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:08,096
25 homeless people livingtogether in a real shelter.

233
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:10,011
Each week, they compete
in various obstacles--

234
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,839
who can eat the most
soup in 10 minutes,

235
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,711
who can make the best outfit outof raggedy clothing, et cetera.

236
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:18,236
Each week, someone is kickedback out onto the street.

237
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,979
But the last remaining homelessperson wins a million dollars

238
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,634
and is therefore
no longer homeless.

239
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,857
I love it.
Sold.

240
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:30,945
What else?

241
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,729
School bully.

242
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,905
We go into a middle school andtake out the five meanest kids

243
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,080
and pit them
against one another.

244
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,126
They get 10 points
for detention,

245
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,737
20 points for
making somebody cry,

246
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,913
40 points for mouthing
off to a teacher.

247
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,830
Bully with the most pointswins the school bully crown.

248
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:50,399
But what they don't realize isthat this gets them suspended

249
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,227
from school permanently.

250
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:55,056
So in the end, this reallyteaches a valuable lesson.

251
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,103
Brilliant.

252
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,017
Sold.

253
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,584
What else?

254
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:05,501
OK, it's "TemptationIsland" meets "Survivor."

255
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,677
10 engaged couples
on a cruise ship,

256
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,680
and you get points for cheating.

257
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,290
The couple with the
lowest points each week

258
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,204
gets kicked off.

259
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,510
And here's the twist.

260
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm bored.

261
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,861
But you're on the right trackwith the romantic slant.

262
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,124
What else?

263
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,865
It's called "The Vegetable."

264
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,912
Eight families, each with afamily member on life support.

265
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:25,782
Now--

266
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,575
[door closes]

267
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,187
Yo!
RYAN BANKS: Yo!

268
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,362
I got breakfast.

269
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,712
RYAN BANKS: Thanks.

270
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,541
Have you thought any moreabout our talk last night?

271
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,151
RYAN BANKS: Not really.

272
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,892
Like, I don't know, maybesettling down for a while?

273
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,851
RYAN BANKS: Show me awoman to settle down with.

274
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,809
'Cause I never met her.

275
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,812
[Laughs] How
about I show you 15?

276
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:56,683
15?

277
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,597
Yeah.

278
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,250
That's a good start.

279
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,384
It's called "I Want
to Marry Ryan Banks."

280
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,952
It's your own reality show.

281
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,867
America will pick your
potential wife for you.

282
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:07,781
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

283
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:08,695
Think about it.

284
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,392
Think about it.

285
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,047
For six weeks, you'll havewomen around you at all times.

286
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,526
This makes you very happy.

287
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,267
They're competing for your love.

288
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,704
They're throwing
themselves at you.

289
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,227
It's a win-win.

290
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,576
The catch is America voteseach week for the girl

291
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:21,969
they like the best.

292
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,797
It's the ultimate
fantasy fulfillment.

293
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:26,234
Normal girl marries
big celebrity.

294
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,801
And we're going to
depict you as the man

295
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,367
that everybody wants to see--

296
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,195
the sweet, sensitive,
romantic guy,

297
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,023
the guy of every girl's dreams.

298
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:34,895
And in the end, you
get the perfect girl.

299
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,157
It can't go wrong.

300
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,201
That's ridiculous.

301
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:38,942
Of course it's ridiculous.

302
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,422
Look at the state of television.

303
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,380
What isn't ridiculous?

304
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,512
The tabloids say you're a dog.

305
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,427
You say, yeah, I am a dog.

306
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,950
Here's what I'm going
to do to change that.

307
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:50,780
I'm going to date 15
women at one time.

308
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,564
Do I really have to
marry the final girl?

309
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,870
No, of course not.

310
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,132
Who knows?

311
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,830
Maybe you'll find
somebody you like.

312
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,614
Do I get to pick the women?

313
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,963
No, you can't pick
the women because you

314
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,399
got to be all excited.
- Screw that.

315
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,357
OK, we'll see what we can do.

316
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,883
OK.

317
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,842
All right, let's do it.

318
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,234
What's next?

319
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,106
Sell it to a network.

320
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:13,890
And that's not going
to be a problem.

321
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,631
I love it.

322
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,460
This is just the
thing for sweeps.

323
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,070
So here's what I'm thinking.

324
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,463
Each week on
Tuesday night, we'll

325
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,204
broadcast an edited
version of the week's

326
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,814
most dramatic footage.

327
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,251
Then viewers have a couplehours to call in and vote.

328
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:30,211
On the next night, we boot thebitches with the least votes.

329
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,603
That's original.

330
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,953
Please, I haven't
had an original thought

331
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,216
in my life, which brings
me to my next idea.

332
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,480
We should get AT&T Wirelessto sponsor the whole thing.

333
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,003
Viewers can text in their votes.

334
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,744
We'll do signage,
product placement.

335
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,268
The show won't cost us a dime.

336
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,357
So let's go find some women.

337
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,837
You read my mind.

338
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,404
MAN [ON WEBSITE]: Ryan
is searching for a wife.

339
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,407
If you want to marry
Ryan Banks, click here.

340
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,061
- Did you see our website?- Yeah.

341
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,279
Yeah.

342
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,020
You got me Lakers
season tickets?

343
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,761
Lakers season tickets?

344
00:11:58,892 --> 00:11:59,762
I thought you'd like those.

345
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:00,807
You didn't have to do that.

346
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,156
It made be happy to do that.

347
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,679
Congrats on getting
our show picked up.

348
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,420
Well, congrats on havingevery woman in America

349
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,248
want to be your wife,
including the ones

350
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,118
that are already married.

351
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,381
Insane, right?

352
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,295
Yeah.

353
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:12,253
Shall we?

354
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,210
Yes, let's shall.

355
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,737
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]:
And honestly, Ryan,

356
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:21,741
I've always felt
something really intense

357
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:22,829
when I watch your movies.

358
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,047
[Chuckles] Oh, god.

359
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,135
Mm.

360
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,702
We really have a connection.

361
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,878
And I think that's somethingthat's worth checking

362
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,925
out and checking me out.

363
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,143
Yes.
Yes.

365
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,015
Yes?

366
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,451
Oh, yes.

367
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,279
Do you not understand
the point of this show?

368
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,933
We need variety.

369
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,370
And you need to see
me not be into her.

370
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,853
I'll get respect for dissingthe girl with the biggest rack.

371
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:47,810
That's a good point.

372
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:48,724
Mm.

373
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,340
OK.

374
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,864
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]: I've
seen all your movies.

375
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,169
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]: I
also play the ukulele.

376
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,431

377
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,215
MALE VOICE [ON VIDEO]: Hi, Ryan.- What?

378
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,956
[Laughter]

379
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,522
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]: [SINGING] La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

380

TRISH [ON VIDEO]: I don't know.Is this thing working?

381
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,481
Is it on?

382
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,264
PATRICK [ON VIDEO]:
Yes, it's on, Trish.

383
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:07,787
OK, are you sure?

384
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:08,309
Yeah?

385
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,005
OK, OK.

386
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:09,963
Hi.

387
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,747
Hi, I'm Trish from Boston.

388
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,357
And this is my husband, Patrick.

389
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,925
And I know what you're
thinking-- three way.

390
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,187
No.

391
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,275
I mean, not that I
would mind, Ryan.

392
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,146
But--

393
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,060
Trish.

394
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,974
Sorry.

395
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,714
Come on.

396
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,542
We're actually making thisvideo for my sister, Charlie,

397
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,848
who would never
in a million years

398
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,067
submit herself for
something like this.

399
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,068
Huh.

400
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,634
She'd be too embarrassed.

401
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,549
Charlie works in this littlebookstore in Cambridge.

402
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,029
She's a smarty.

403
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,596
She went to an Ivy Leagueschool and graduated

404
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,424
at the top of her class.

405
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:38,165
Patrick, get closer.

406
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,862
She has no idea
we're stalking her.

407
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,867
Look at that body, huh?

408
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,651
Hot mama.

409
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,089
[Laughs]

410
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,568
Over there.

411
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,048
Over there.

412
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,529
This is the bar Patrick
and I own in Southeast.

413
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,271
Oh, and there's Charlie withsome of her biggest fans.

414
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,620
Oh, they're all
in love with her.

415
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,578
But she's picky.

416
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,493
She is your girl.

417
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,191
Now, I would submit myself.

418
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:07,324
But I'm already married, andI'm probably not your type.

419
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:10,240
Look, I know Ryan gets a lotof flack in the tabloids.

420
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,982
But I know the tabloids lie.

421
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:16,290
My sister Charlie-- shedeserves a Prince Charming.

422
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,075
And we hope that Prince
Charming is Ryan.

423
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,121
She's perfect.

424
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,513
Absolutely perfect.

425
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,395
ELLEN CARTER: So you're lookingto settle down with a woman?

426
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,875
That's right.

427
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,964
Well, that could really
only mean one thing--

428
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,226
you want me.

429
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,184
[Laughs] Ellen,
you're already taken.

430
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,098
Oh, yes.

431
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,883
I know.

432
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,450
But I think we both realize Iwould leave my husband for you.

433
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,104
But seriously, you
are going to be living

434
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,672
in a mansion with 15 women?

435
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:51,760
That's right.

436
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,370
What a slut.

437
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,242
I've been called
worse many times before.

438
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,593
But you know, I really
want to find someone.

439
00:14:58,723 --> 00:14:59,681
I'm from Boston.

440
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,335
I grew up like everyone else.

441
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:04,294
And I feel like the reasonI haven't fallen in love

442
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,341
with anyone is because I justdon't meet enough women that

443
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,430
are normal and real.

444
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,345
ELLEN CARTER: Well, we
could put your number

445
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,563
right up on the screen.

446
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,914
And I promise you
my viewers would

447
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,959
give you enough
normal and real dates

448
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,614
to last for your entire life.

449
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,312
But seriously, you are goingto be selecting 30 finalists--

450
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,748
RYAN BANKS: Yeah.

451
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,967
That you're going to
be flying to Hollywood--

452
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:25,794
Mm-hmm.ELLEN CARTER: For interviews.

453
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,404
Mm-hmm.

454
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,189
And then you're going tobe choosing the final 15.

455
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,233
RYAN BANKS: That's right.

456
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,669
Well, I tell you what, Ryan.

457
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,715
Why don't we call one
of those finalists

458
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,892
and let her know that
she has made the cut?

459
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:37,849
Really?

460
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,850
Absolutely.

461
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,374
Charlie Norton from Boston.

462
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,331
No way.

463
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,551
That's great.

464
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,161
No one ever said
the man couldn't act.

465
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,903
She should be in hersister's bar right about now.

466
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:48,991

My nerves are gonna die.

480
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,400
I hope she does that
every time she sees you.

481
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,314
Yeah, right.

Is this a joke?

00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:27,987
No, it isn't.

495
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:29,031
I know this is a joke.

496
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:29,901
No, really.

497
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:30,815
It's me.

498
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,299
This isn't a joke?

499
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,301

00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,615
Well, your sister sent ina videotape on your behalf.

505
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,792
And our producers chose youas one of our finalists.

506
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:54,187
So we want to fly you to LosAngeles and interview you.

507
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,275
How does that sound?

508
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,624
Oh.

509
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,234
This is-- this is crazy.

510
00:16:58,365 --> 00:16:59,975
I-- I can't--

511
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,368
- I'll be there.

What are you--
I can't do this!

516
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,852
You have to do this, Charlie.

517
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,593
Come on, how many nightshave you complained that you

518
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,117
haven't met the right guy, huh?

519
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,336
Yeah, but I don't
want to meet him on TV.

520
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,337
It's a sign of the times.

521
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,948
And hello, it is Ryan Banks.

522
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,602
Trish--

523
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,300

And you, you.

528
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,875
Oh, hey, did we rememberto order the roses

529
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,051
for the girls' hotel rooms?

530
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:32,921
Two dozen each.

531
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,618
And I had an idea.

532
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,838
That would make it nice tohave a note attached from Ryan.

533
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:37,795
Brilliant.

534
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,232
Who hired you?
- You did.

535
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,363
I'm good.

536
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,582
You do Ryan's
autograph, right?

537
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:44,280
Oh, yeah.

538
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,543
TRISH: We're with the "I Wantto Marry Ryan Banks Show."

539

Look at this.

541
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,464
Who are they from?

542

00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:53,440
Ask her to take a walk.

1279
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,704
Uh, Charlie, would
you like to take a walk?

1280
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:58,837
Yeah, I'd love to.

1281
00:42:58,967 --> 00:42:59,838
Excuse us, ladies.

1282
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:00,708
Sure.

1283
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:06,192
TODD DOHERTY [THROUGHFEED]: So do you miss home?

1284
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,150
So do you miss home?

1285
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,412
Yeah.

1286
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:10,326
Yeah.

1287
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:11,458
My sister, especially.

1288
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,415
Hmm.

1289
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,940
OK, be interested in her.

1290
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,682
What's, um-- what's
she like, your sister?

1291
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,031
Oh.

1292
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,294
Well, she's obsessed
with you, actually,

1293
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:24,079
which is why put me up to this.

1294
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,909
You know, that's so strange, because I feel so normal.

1295
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,390
It's so strange to
hear stuff like that

1296
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,392
because I feel so normal.

1297
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,525
Yeah, but you live
a pretty blessed life.

1298
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,092
Come on, admit it.

1299
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:41,488
You wouldn't trade it tobe slinging beers at a bar.

1300
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,708
Don't-- don't give
her the sob story.

1301
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:44,578
You're right.

1302
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:45,797
It is fun.

1303
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,973
I've been very lucky.

1304
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:51,280
[Sighs] But let's
stop talking about me.

1305
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,153
[Sighs] But let's
not talk about me.

1306
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:55,023
OK.

1307
00:43:58,548 --> 00:43:59,506
Now take her hand.

1308
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:05,773
Good.

1309
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:13,172
No, no.

1310
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:14,086
What are you doing?

1311
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:15,000
What are you-- don't.

1312
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,525
Don't kiss her.

1313
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:23,443
[Chuckles] Um--

1314
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,097
Sorry.

1315
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:29,101
This is-- this is all justhappening a little too fast.

1316
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,015
So--

1317
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,238
TODD DOHERTY [THROUGH
FEED]: You blew it.

1318
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:37,326
You totally blew it.

1319
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:38,197
I didn't tell you to kiss her.

1320
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,024
The timing was all off.

1321
00:44:39,154 --> 00:44:40,590
Timing?

1322
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:41,679
What are you talking about?

1323
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:49,164
[Claps] OK, ladies,
lots of energy.

1324
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,427
We're dancing, smiling,
high, high energy.

1325
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:52,864
OK, and rolling.

1326
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:54,256
Music.

1327
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,258
[Music playing]

1328
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,480
I think you and I have a lotin common, you know, with the--

1329
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,397
the need to explore ourselvesthrough other characters.

1330
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:07,748
I mean, we are both
actors, famous or not.

1331
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:10,403
Nothing that they say aboutyou in the tabloids is true.

1332
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:11,317
Come on.

1333
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,710
Ryan, come and dance.

1334
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,190
Come on.

1335
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:17,671
Come on, guy.

1336
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:18,672
RYAN BANKS: Hey.

1337
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,282
Hey.

1338
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:24,156
[SINGING] [inaudible] there'san energy that's here.

1339
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:27,115
Dance all night.

1340
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:39,084
Dance all night.

1341
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,477
So, um, do you think
I have the qualities

1342
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,436
to be Mrs. Ryan Banks?

1343
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:44,350
[Laughs]

1344
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,134
Who are you betting on?

1345
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:48,136
I like Lauren, the actress.

1346
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:49,137
I like Mindy.

1347
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:51,183
And Charlie, of course.

1348
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,837
You think so?

1349
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:53,838
Please.

1350
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,187
She's the perfect candidate.

1351
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:56,928
Charlie, come on
back out and dance.

1352
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:58,277
[Inaudible] I'm
just going to take

1353
00:45:58,407 --> 00:45:59,234
a break for a little while.- Yeah?

1354
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:00,670
Oh!

1355
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,237
Hey, Dave, back off
a little bit, will you?

1356
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:02,934
No.
You know what?

1357
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:04,544
I'm really OK.

1358
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,459
I'm-- I'm just going to gooutside and get some air.

1359
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:08,461
Truthfully, this whole thingis just a little weird.

1360
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:13,248
Not too weird for you, is it?

1361
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,206
Not too weird for me.

1362
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:20,952
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

1363
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:21,866
Hi.

1364
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,042
Oh, it's OK.

1365
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,608
Is this what you have
to go through these days

1366
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,132
to get a date?

1367
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:29,395
Well, why fall in loveif you can't do it on TV?

1368
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:31,789
Is that how you
met your girlfriend?

1369
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,791
No, I'm single.

1370
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,314
Oh.

1371
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:37,316
There must be a very goodreason you're single.

1372
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:41,363
Well, I could probably saythe same thing about you.

1373
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,191
You know, if I ever want
to really meet somebody,

1374
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:46,412
the obvious choice is
just have my own show.

1375
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,456
I want to marry [inaudible].

1376
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:48,327
[Laughs] Right.

1377
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:49,241
That'd be great.

1378
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,982
Yeah.

1379
00:46:51,112 --> 00:46:53,854
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry I'm so agh.

1380
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,335
It's just that
Ryan's really sweet.

1381
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,120
It's just so hard to get toknow the real him this way.

1382
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:00,034
No.

1383
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:01,253
Is it really?

1384
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:02,254
[Laughter]

1385
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:03,168
Yeah.

We have--

00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,639
[bell dings]

1397
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:40,553
Lauren.

1398
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:41,467
Yay.

[Applause]

1400
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:47,690
You're meeting with the
director, two producers,

1401
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,431
Nicole may or may not be there.

1402
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,434
Now, remember, this is theone movie you want to land.

1403
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:53,566
This is Oscar caliber.

1404
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:54,959
I'll land it, buddy.

1405
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,264
Don't worry.

1406
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,788
Hey, what was with
Charlie at the club?

1407
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,878
I just think she's freakedout by all this stuff.

1408
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:02,270
But she's the only one, right?

1409
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:04,098
Oh, yeah.

1410
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:05,926
Then she's got to be more intoit, or it's not going to work.

1411
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:07,449
You're a producer.
Talk to her.

1412
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,363
Take her out of here.

1413
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:09,190
Give her a pep talk.

1414
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,413
[Laughs] I can't take
her outside the house.

1415
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:15,327
Take her to my house.

1416
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:16,328
No one will know.

1417
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,546
Do it tonight.

1418
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:18,460
Kareen will make you dinner.

1419
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:27,948
Mm.

1420
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,907
Yeah, I could definitely
get used to living here.

1421
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:31,734
So you're planning on winning?

1422
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:33,301
Oh, yeah.

1423
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:36,522
Mm, I think I'll put aeast wing right over there.

1424
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:37,610
But for now, it'll do.

1425
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,828
[Music playing]

1426
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,569
So the real
reason we're here is

1427
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,441
I just want to make you feelmore comfortable about doing

1428
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:44,834
the show.

1429
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:45,966
I am trying.

1430
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,750
And I do like him, you know.

1431
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:51,972
It just-- you have to admit thiswhole thing's a little weird.

1432
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,191
I have to admit it
is a little weird.

1433
00:48:56,281 --> 00:49:00,111
You so do not seem like oneof these Hollywood type people.

1434
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,504
How did you get
involved in all this?

1435
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:05,464
Um, Ryan and I have
been friends forever.

1436
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:07,466
We moved out here.

1437
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:09,685
One thing led to another, andit just sort of made sense

1438
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,166
to go into business together.

1439
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:13,472
So what did you
want to do before one

1440
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:14,342
thing led to another?

1441
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,826
I don't remember.

1442
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:28,530
A friend's business-- allin one, that has to be hard.

1443
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,098
TODD DOHERTY: How so?

1444
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:32,708
Well, he's Ryan Banks,
and your whole life

1445
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:33,622
revolves around that.

1446
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,416
You want to get some fresh air?

1447
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:47,071
Go for a walk?

1448
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,551
Oh, there's nowhere
to walk in that way.

1449
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:51,162
Doesn't he have, like,
a 40 acre property?

1450
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:59,866
Yeah, I can't wait to go home, hang out at my sister's bar.

1451
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,433
I'd kind of love tochuck all this for a week,

1452
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:04,218
go back home, and
see it sometime.

1453
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,524
That's so weird.

1454
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,395

Why aren't you helping me?

1633
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:37,829
You should be
able to handle this.

1634
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:38,917
Are you kidding me?

1635
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:40,048
No.

1636
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,442
Don't let me down now.

1637
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:43,748
And roll cameras.

1638
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:46,272
Cue harp.

1639
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,621
[Clears throat] Sorry.

1640
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:48,970
I was just saying that--

1641
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,276
[WHISPERS] Let me
know what you think.

1642
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,669
It's one step at a time.

1643
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:55,237
I was just saying
that we should

1644
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:56,891
take this one step at a time.

1645
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:59,154
[WHISPERS] And we
barely know each other.

1646
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:00,417
I mean, we barely
know each other.

1647
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:06,074
And I think that
these decisions--

1648
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:13,560
we should make together
when the time comes.

1649
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,955
And I think we should
make those decisions

1650
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:19,740
together when the time comes.

1651
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,742
[Chuckles] That's
a really good answer.

1652
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:40,848
So [clears throat] Iwas wondering how I could

1653
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:42,763
be so torn between two guys.

1654
00:57:42,894 --> 00:57:44,417
And I realize now that I'm not.

1655
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:45,287
No.

1656
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,941
Ryan's a great guy.

1657
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:48,595
And I think you should gofor it, if you think that--

1658
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:49,640
Yeah, yeah.

1659
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,945
Ryan's great on paper, you know?

1660
00:57:51,076 --> 00:57:53,034
But there's never
been any real spark.

1661
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,688
And I couldn't figure
out how he kept

1662
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,125
saying all the right things.

1663
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,694
And I realize now
that he wasn't.

1664
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,436
And this is all fake.

1665
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,308
And you were saying
them the whole time.

1666
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:07,745
Not the whole time.

1667
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,050
Uh-huh.

1668
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:12,140
When he found me
upstairs in the hallway?

1669
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:14,752
Uh, yeah, I was there.

1670
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:16,493
And by the hot tub?

1671
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:18,016
[Sighs uncomfortably]

1672
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:19,931
He didn't know the answerto the crossword puzzle.

1673
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,324
And that walk in thegarden when he kissed me.

1674
00:58:22,455 --> 00:58:24,370
Yes, but I didn't
tell him to kiss you.

1675
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,067
That was all him.- I didn't want him to kiss me.

1676
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,895
I know.
I know.

1677
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:28,940
It was totally the wrong moment.- Completely the wrong moment.

1678
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,508
Yeah.

1679
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:32,683
So it's you.

1680
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:33,945
- OK, I should go.
- No, don't go.

1681
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:35,381
I need to go.

1682
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,340
Look, it's my fault.
You need to do the show.

1683
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:40,821
And eventually, you'llwind up falling for Ryan.

1684
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:41,692
Everybody does.

1685
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,916
Keep your eyes closed.

1686
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:50,527
OK, OK.

1687
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:51,745
This way.
This way.

1688
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:52,659
I got you.
I got you.

1689
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,664
OK, you can open your eyes.

1690
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:03,017
Patrick, what is this?

1691
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,810
You haven't been
on one in a while.

1692
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:17,292
So I thought this
would be a good idea.

1693
00:59:17,423 --> 00:59:20,513
Patrick, this isn't like you.

1694
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,255
I know you like the romance.

1695
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:24,735
And if I want to
keep you around,

1696
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,171
I figure I have to step it up.

1697
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:33,178
[Laughs]

1698
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:34,440
STAN [ON TV]:
Congratulations, ladies.

1699
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,354
America's spoken.

1700
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:36,485
The three of you remain.

1701
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:38,531
You must be so excited.

1702
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,752
Jessica, I'm sorry totell you that America has

1703
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:43,841
taken you out of the running.

1704
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:46,408
That's totally fine.

1705
00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:48,323
I'm totally fine with that.

1706
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:51,762
Yeah, you just keep
telling yourself that.

1707
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:55,504
Next week, stay tuned as we seeRyan on an exotic vacation date

1708
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,811
with each of the
three remaining girls.

1709
00:59:57,942 --> 01:00:00,161
We'll see you next time.

1710
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,468
So when this is allover, if you're not picked,

1711
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,253
I would love to take you out.

1712
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:06,733
That's perfect.

1713
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:08,517
I mean, she obviously likes you.

1714
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,215
And Ryan obviously
cares for her as much

1715
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:12,609
as he's cared about any othergirl, which is like care

1716
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:13,958
factor of zero.

1717
01:00:14,088 --> 01:00:15,133
So you're not a bad friend.

1718
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,395
Are you sure?

1719
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,439
Yes.

1720
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,180
Todd, you have to go after this.

1721
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,965
You deserve to be happy too.

1722
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:22,662
But you're going to have to waituntil after the show is over.

1723
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:24,925
[Phone rings]

1724
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:26,187
It's Todd.

1725
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,536
Hey, it's Charlie.

1726
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,190
Hey.

1727
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:30,322
CHARLIE NORTON [ON PHONE]:So, um, Lauren's on her date

1728
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:31,845
with Ryan in Carmel.

1729
01:00:31,976 --> 01:00:33,194
And there's barely anybody here.

1730
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,719
And I'm starving.

1731
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:39,113
You want to bring over
a pizza or something?

1732
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:41,986
[Camera whirring]

1733
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:47,948
OK.

1734
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,341
We're good.

1735
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:50,647
We have to continually
avoid that.

1736
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:51,560
Huh.

1737
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:58,350
It was nice having dinner withyou and Ryan the other night.

1738
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,917
You and I make a pretty
good date, don't we?

1739
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,701
Yeah.

1740
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:04,617
Look, you and I both knowthat it's not really going

1741
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,706
to happen between Ryan and me.

1742
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,839
And he knows that too.

1743
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,842
Yeah, I don't know.

1744
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,452
So we're going to
let a TV show get

1745
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:15,323
in the way of whatever this is?

1746
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:17,195
It's my show that
I created for him.

1747
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,501
And you're the favorite.

1748
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:22,591
It just seems like
you have sacrificed

1749
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:24,463
everything in your life
for the sake of his.

1750
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:29,729
I've never had anyone paythis much attention to me.

1751
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:33,994
And not because I
only just met you.

1752
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:42,220
Duck.

1753
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,179
[Camera whirs]

1754
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:49,140
Oh.

1755
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:53,231
[Laughs] Oh.

1756
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:54,145
Mm.

1757
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:55,668
Mm.

1758
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,715
OK, you have to
let me off the show.

1759
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:01,456
Oh, that's not possible.

1760
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:05,069
America would be up in arms.

1761
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,940
There has to be
another solution.

1762
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,681
Maybe you could
just start pretending

1763
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,815
you're the biggest loser onearth, make America hate you.

1764
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:12,729
Then they'll vote you off.

1765
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,821
Oh, my-- that's it.

1766
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:18,735
What?

1767
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:20,345
No, that's it.

1768
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:22,869
I was to go to Victoria withRyan this weekend, right?

1769
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,392
Well, I'll just start
acting like the biggest

1770
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:26,264
tool on the planet.

1771
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:28,440
Ryan will be repulsed.

1772
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,137
And America will vote me off.

1773
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:31,530
And that's it.

1774
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,271
Oh, that's kind of brilliant.

1775
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,620
It was your idea.

1776
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,621
You know, you really
should start taking

1777
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,579
some credit for yourself.

1778
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,627
I'm going to be the worstdate Ryan has ever had.

1779
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,802
This is insane.

1780
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:44,891
[Laughs] Oh.

1781
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:45,762
Mm.

1782
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,391
I think I'm getting sick.

1783
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,653
Sure you need this many bags?

1784
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,524
We're only here for two days.

1785
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:10,656
You can never be too prepared.

1786
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,223
Oh.

1787
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,702
Hey.

1788
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,617
Hey, guys, back off a
little bit, will you?

1789
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:17,619
I don't like this hotel.

1790
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,623
This place is a dump.

1791
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,756
Oh, thank you for
going shopping with me.

1792
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,932
Know how much I
hate sightseeing.

1793
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:27,238
Plus, I need to find
something to wear

1794

brought your checkbook.

Um, a couple of dragon
rolls, definitely.

1806

Huh.

1807
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,195
Thanks.

a Chinese chicken salad.

01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:17,462
Charlie, this is a
Japanese restaurant.

1810
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,116
Hmm?

1811
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:21,858
Um, so you can make surethat the chicken isn't cooked

1812
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:24,034
in oil, and that thelettuce is triple washed,

1813
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:25,209
and the dressing is egg-free.

1814
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,123
Thank you.

1815
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,431
This is super.

1816
01:04:30,562 --> 01:04:31,476
Are you having as
much fun as I am?

1817
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:33,130
I'm trying to.

1818
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,611
[Chuckles]

1819
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:37,482
Oh.

1820
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,886
What came over her?

1821
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:54,107
At least it'll mix
it up a little bit.

1822
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:56,675
Let's see just howsteamy Ryan and Lauren got.

1823
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,250
You know, I didn't come intothis expecting to fall for you.

1824
01:05:10,384 --> 01:05:13,474
But you surprised me
in every single way.

1825
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:14,911
You made me surprised myself.

1826
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,703
Ryan and Mindy took a funtrip up to San Francisco,

1827
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:28,011
where there was no shortageof bonding activity.

1828
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,796
Have a good trip, skipper.

1829
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,319
Thanks.

1830
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,190
What do you got?

1831
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,104
Ah.

1832
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:35,148
Here we go.

1833
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:38,064
It's not bad.

1834
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:39,065
Oh--

1835
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:40,240
I win.

1836
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:42,677
[Laughs]

1837
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:43,983
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]: What's that?

1838
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:45,680
Feed me.

1839
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,769
Oh, my goodness.

1840
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,033
[Laughter]

1841
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,338
We can go to the redwoods.

1842
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:52,905
I know.

1843
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,820
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]: OrAlcatraz, or just stay in.

1844
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,256
MINDY [ON TV]: That sounds good.

1845
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:57,866
STAN [ON TV]: Now let's
go to glorious Victoria,

1846
01:05:57,997 --> 01:06:01,218
Canada, where the sparks
between Ryan and Charlie

1847
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:02,088
got even hotter.

1848
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,750
Amazing hotel, right?

1849
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,794
Oh, thank you.

1850
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:21,368
When I'm Mrs. Ryan Banks.

1851
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:22,369
Mrs. Ryan Banks.

1852
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,762
This is super.

1853
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:24,719
I mean, are you having
as much fun as I am?

1854
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:25,633
Yep.

1855
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,507
I don't get it.

1856
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:32,684
I thought she said
she sabotaged it.

1857
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:34,164
Ooh.

1858
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,687
Now pick up thosephones and cast your vote

1859
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:37,994
with AT&T. This is
your last chance

1860
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:41,519
to affect the outcome, takingit down to the final two.

1861
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:45,218
One of those two will
be Mrs. Ryan Banks.

1862
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:47,655
We'll see you all tomorrow nightwhen we're joined by Ryan's

1863
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:50,006
last three leading ladies.

1864
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:52,965
Good night, everyone.

1865
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:54,053
FEMALE SINGERS
[ON TV]: [SINGING]

1866
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:57,535
I want to marry Ryan Banks.

1867
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:58,927
Leslie.

1868
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:01,495
Leslie, that footage
was a complete lie.

1869
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,932
That is blatantly notwhat happened in Victoria.

1870
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,847
Isn't this what you want?

1871
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:08,154
She's the one you
want America to pick.

1872
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:10,069
The other two won't donearly as much for his career

1873
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,331
as she will.

1874
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:12,506
Lauren's too desperate,
and he and Mindy

1875
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:13,594
are more like friends.

1876
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:14,682
You didn't even
consult with me.

1877
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:15,640
I don't have to.

1878
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:16,902
I'm the network.

1879
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,512
And we want ratings,
which means we

1880
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:21,080
have to keep this neck andneck until the last episode.

1881
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:22,081
I owe you.

1882
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:23,822
[Claps] I owe you guys one.

1883
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:26,520
Do you know how ridiculous Iwould have looked with Charlie

1884
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,913
in Victoria if you
wouldn't have pulled

1885
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,262
that amazing editing job?

1886
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:30,220
Mm.

1887
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,438
It was awesome.

1888
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:34,876
This is unbelievable.

1889
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:37,705
What's with him?

1890
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:40,186
That was Lauren
and Ryan in Carmel.

1891
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:44,147
And finally, as a reminder, let's take a look at Ryan's

1892
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:45,496
vacation date with Charlie.

1893
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,681
Amazing hotel, right?

1894
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:57,682
Oh, thank you.

1895
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:02,904
When I'm Mrs. Ryan Banks.

1896
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:05,733
Mrs. Ryan Banks.

1897
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:07,170
This is super.

1898
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,954
I mean, are you having
as much fun as I am?

1899
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,870
Yep.

1900
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,524
CHARLIE NORTON [ON TV]: Ooh.

1901
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:15,874
STAN [ON TV]: Well, America, you have made your choice.

1902
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:19,182
Let's see which two girls Ryanwill eventually choose from.

1903
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:32,847
[Bell dings]

1904
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:38,679
Lauren, will you accept
this key to my heart?

1905
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,028
Yes, of course.

1906
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:52,998
[Bell dings]

1907
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:53,912
Charlie.

1908
01:08:58,525 --> 01:08:59,352
Thank you.

1909
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:05,358
Can you accept
this key to my heart?

1910
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:06,838
Yes, of course.

1911
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,584
So tonight, we bid
farewell to Mindy,

1912
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,063
who the viewers
seem to think was

1913
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,978
more of a friend than a lover.

1914
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:17,892
Hmm.

1915
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:19,546
Can't feel good, Mind.

1916
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,200
Can't feel good.

1917
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:24,203
That means next week,
Ryan will choose.

1918
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:28,642
Will it be Charlie, oris it going to be Lauren?

1919
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:29,687
Find out next week.

1920
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:30,688
Good night.

1921
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:31,645
And we are clear.

1922
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,825
I don't know
exactly what that was.

1923
01:09:37,956 --> 01:09:39,305
But that was not me.

1924
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:40,524
I cannot do this anymore.

1925
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:41,960
I'm done.

1926
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,440
OK, listen, I understandwhy you're upset.

1927
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,571
I completely
understand, Charlie.

1928
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:45,703
But you can't quit the show.

1929
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,183
Yes, I can!

1930
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:48,923
This entire show
is a complete sham.

1931
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:50,838
I would be disrespecting
myself if I didn't quit!

1932
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:58,411
Hey, whatever
that was, go fix it.

1933
01:09:58,542 --> 01:09:59,630
[Knocking]

1934
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,197
TODD DOHERTY:
Charlie, it's time.

1935
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,850
We have nothing to talk about.

1936
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:07,377
Hey, look.

1937
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,248
Look, I'm angry about
what they did too, OK?

1938
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,076
Mm-hmm.

1939
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,991
Hey, you know, they editedthis whole thing without me

1940
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:13,905
even knowing about it.

1941
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:22,957
All right.

1942
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:27,962
This whole thing hasgotten entirely out of hand.

1943
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,486
I had nothing to do with this.

1944
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:30,661
CHARLIE NORTON: Yeah, but you knew, didn't you?

1945
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:31,836
You knew, and you
didn't tell me.

1946
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,490
I didn't know
until last night.

1947
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,752
You know, and this wholeacting like an idiot thing,

1948
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:35,927
it was your idea.

1949
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:36,710
TODD DOHERTY: It
was going to work.

1950
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:38,234
You were perfect.

1951
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:39,844
CHARLIE NORTON: Well,I'm glad you were amused.

1952
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:41,715
Problem is you didn't holdup your end of the bargain.

1953
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:44,849
You are no better than
anyone else around here.

1954
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:46,981
I did fall for somebody here, but it's not Ryan Banks.

1955
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:48,766
It was you.

1956
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:51,203
I just wish I had morerespect for you than I do.

1957
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,771
Bottom line, Todd, this
whole show is a joke.

1958
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:56,904
And I'm not going to be
a part of it anymore.

1959
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,341
- Charlie, Charlie.
- What?

1960
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:00,038
Sorry to interrupt.

1961
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:01,779
The next time you want tohave a conversation like this,

1962
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:03,911
I suggest you take
off your microphone.

1963
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:04,825
You're fired.

1964
01:11:17,882 --> 01:11:19,449
Literally, for as
long as I can remember,

1965
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:20,885
it's been this way.

1966
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:22,974
You are so far out in
left field with this.

1967
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:25,150
You're just too
obsessed with Ryan Banks

1968
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,630
to think about
anybody else's life.

1969
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,805
Are you kidding me with this?

1970
01:11:27,935 --> 01:11:29,197
You know, for
the past 10 years,

1971
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:30,590
it's been my job to
obsess about Ryan Banks.

1972
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:31,548
That's right.

1973
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:32,723
You wanted to work for me.

1974
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:35,160
No, I didn't.

1975
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,683
Look, I don't blame you, Ryan.

1976
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,772
You are who you are, andI helped you become that.

1977
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:43,168
But somewhere along the line, I just completely lost myself.

1978
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,256
And then I met her.

1979
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,345
And I tried to resist it.

1980
01:11:46,476 --> 01:11:50,044
And for once, I did
something for myself.

1981
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:53,265
I put work and your careerfirst in my life forever.

1982
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,093
And it took her to
make me realize that.

1983
01:11:58,096 --> 01:11:59,184
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1984

2166

STAN [ON TV]: You'vechosen two women for him.

2167
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:25,255
He's met their families, spentmore time with them one on one.

2168
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:30,390
And now he says he's
made his final decision.

2169
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:32,001
Thanks for sneaking me in.

2170
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:33,176
Well, like you're
not going to be

2171
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:35,743
here when this all goes down.

2172
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,484
All right, I will
come and get you

2173
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,399
later so you can be there forCharlie when this is all over.

2174
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:40,270
OK.

2175
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:58,766
Hey, Lauren.

2176
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:07,645
I have had the most
wonderful time with you.

2177
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:13,825
You're charming, andambitious, and beautiful.

2178
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:16,349
I really feel like
we made a connection.

2179
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,135
And obviously, America
felt it as well.

2180
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:20,049
Yes.

2181
01:21:23,139 --> 01:21:25,054
But I don't think
we're a match.

2182
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:27,926
[Crowd yells]

2183
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:29,754
What?

2184
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,322
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]: If I'm goingto settle down with someone,

2185
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:35,368
I want us to complement eachother with our differences.

2186
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:37,501
And the fact that
we're both actors,

2187
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:41,679
it's a little close to home.

2188
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:43,550
I was so ready to
give that up for you.

2189
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:47,380
No, but I want whoever I'mwith to have their own life,

2190
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:48,512
you know?

2191
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:49,730
Unbelievable.

2192
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:55,823
[Sniffles] [sobbing]

2193
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:56,694
Sorry.

2194
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:08,662
[Door closes]

2195
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,037
Hi, Charlie.

2196
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:43,567
[Clears throat]

2197
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,612
You got to be kidding me.

2198
01:22:45,743 --> 01:23:00,366
Charlie Norton, will youmarry my friend, Todd Doherty?

2199
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:04,805
It's OK.

2200
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:05,806
It's OK.

2201
01:23:16,339 --> 01:23:17,296
Yes.

2202
01:23:17,427 --> 01:23:20,386
Yes, of course.

2203
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:22,780
What?

2204
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:25,652
[Applause]

2205
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:29,352
I'm sure you're wonderingwho Todd Doherty is.

2206
01:23:29,482 --> 01:23:32,137
Todd is my best friend.

2207
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:33,747
He's my manager.

2208
01:23:33,878 --> 01:23:37,099
And I'm pretty sure he'supstairs in my room right now.

2209
01:23:42,278 --> 01:23:45,107
[Laughter]

2210
01:23:46,804 --> 01:23:49,285
Now, the entire
time you, America,

2211
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:52,505
thought Charlie and I
were falling in love,

2212
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:55,204
it was really Charlie and Todd.

2213
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:57,902
Now, I know Todd tried
to resist her at first.

2214
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,036
But knowing Charlie,
that's pretty tough.

2215
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:04,648
You see, the editing of theshow displayed something false,

2216
01:24:04,778 --> 01:24:06,650
something that wasn't there.

2217
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,261
But I'm happy to say thata real love connection

2218
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:10,784
was made on the show.

2219
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:13,700
It just didn't involve me.

2220
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:16,225
And when I realized what
was happening, I was--

2221
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:18,314
I was furious at first.

2222
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:22,274
But after a lot of thinking, I realized what I had to do.

2223
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:24,407
And with the help
of a security camera

2224
01:24:24,537 --> 01:24:28,498
and a few very dedicated
undercover operatives,

2225
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:31,327
I think I succeeded.

2226
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:32,241
What am I going to do?

2227
01:24:32,371 --> 01:24:34,330
She won't take my calls.

2228
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,679
You want to know
what I would do?

2229
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:37,768
I would get on a plane
and go visit her.

2230
01:24:37,898 --> 01:24:40,249
You can't just sit here.

2231
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:42,686
So through Todd's
assistant, Nikki,

2232
01:24:42,816 --> 01:24:45,428
I encouraged him
to go after her.

2233
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:46,733
So I had Nikki book his ticket--

2234
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:47,647
Oh, you did not.

2235
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:49,084
Ha, ha, ha.

2236
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,085
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]:
--just so you could see

2237
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,912
how perfect they are together.

2238
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:53,914
And her brother-in-law,
Patrick, helped out

2239
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,221
with the whole thing.

2240
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:58,832
Of course, I still had
to go to Boston myself

2241
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:00,617
to hang out with
Charlie and her family.

2242
01:25:00,747 --> 01:25:03,837
Now, you thought I was goingthere to meet and impress.

2243
01:25:03,968 --> 01:25:07,450
But really, I was there tomake sure that she and Todd

2244
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,974
were indeed a perfect match.

2245
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:13,499
What kind of guy
were you looking for?

2246
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:19,462
Um, someone honest, someone kind, someone funny.

2247
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,420
Someone who knew how to listen.

2248
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:22,639
That is so Todd.

2249
01:25:22,769 --> 01:25:24,206
You have to go downstairs.

2250
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:25,120
No, I'm not going.

2251
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:25,990
Yeah, go get her, Todd.

2252
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:26,904
Todd.

2253
01:25:27,034 --> 01:25:28,340
Todd, go get her.

2254
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:29,254
OK, go do it.

2255
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:30,386
OK, I promise.

2256
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:32,127
Go, go.

2257
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:33,345
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]: Personalexperience-- they can't know--

2258
01:25:33,476 --> 01:25:34,216
Oh.

2259
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:38,350
RYAN BANKS [ON TV]: As forme, I discovered that I don't

2260
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:40,091
really want to settle down.

2261
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:42,006
I'm more of a bachelor at heart.

2262
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:45,618
But I may have a
future in matchmaking.

2263
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:48,926
And thanks to Nikki, I
do believe Todd's going

2264
01:25:49,056 --> 01:25:51,363
to be with us momentarily.

2265
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:53,452
There he is.

2266
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,454
He's the reason I have a career.

2267
01:25:55,585 --> 01:25:59,328
He's my best friend
in the world.

2268
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:02,679
And I'm going to give himthe 15 minutes of fame

2269
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,463
that he never had.

2270
01:26:04,594 --> 01:26:05,421
Ha, ha, ha.

2271
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:06,900
Did you know about this?

2272
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:13,298
So, um-- do you
want to marry me?

2273
01:26:19,435 --> 01:26:20,784
I'm kidding.

2274
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,264
Yes, of course, I
want to marry you.

2275
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:23,265
- Kiss her.
- Yeah, I know.

2276
01:26:23,395 --> 01:26:24,483
I got it.

2277
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:29,184
[SINGING] Love
changes everything.

2279
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:34,232
Love changes everything.

2280
01:26:34,363 --> 01:26:35,755
Yeah.

2281
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:37,627
FEMALE SINGERS: [SINGING] Right from the start,

2282
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:41,065
it came from my heart.

2283
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,547
Love changes everything.

2284
01:26:44,677 --> 01:26:46,984
[Applause]

2285
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:49,378
Are you going to be OK?

2286
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:51,206
Oh, I'm going to be fine.

2287
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,904
And I still have my boyfriend.

2288
01:26:54,034 --> 01:26:57,037
Oh, and also, the casting fora new reality series next week.

2289
01:26:57,168 --> 01:26:59,126
It's about homeless people.

2290
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:00,171
Really?

2291
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:02,129
I can definitely do homeless.

2292
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,219
You guys are perfect
for each other.

2293
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:05,916
I still can't
believe you did this.

2294
01:27:06,046 --> 01:27:07,396
And I'm very impressed.

2295
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:09,136
You know, I'm king
of glad it happened.

2296
01:27:09,267 --> 01:27:11,356
Opened my eyes to
a lot of things.

2297
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:12,705
I'd still prefer
to be your friend,

2298
01:27:12,836 --> 01:27:14,664
rather than your manager.

2299
01:27:14,794 --> 01:27:15,752
Sounds good.

2300
01:27:15,882 --> 01:27:17,188
Todd, it's Ed.

2301
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,798
He, uh-- he wants to
offer you your job back.

2302
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,934
Hey, Ed.

2303
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:25,414
Oh, you know, I
appreciate the offer.

2304
01:27:25,544 --> 01:27:27,720
But I'm going to have
to respectfully decline.

2305
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:29,548
But I do know somebody
who can do my job

2306
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:31,289
a lot better than I ever could.

2307

Couldn't have been any better.

2313
