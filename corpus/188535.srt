1
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,500
Fight! Fight! Fight!

2
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,967
Bef ore we begin...

3
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:52,167
Settle down. I got a question
I want to ask you all.

4
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:55,900
How many people came here
to change the world?

5
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,900
How many people came here
to learn how to make a lot of money?

6
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey, we got an outreach program here
where we really tap into the community.

7
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,633
What's the point?

8
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:16,833
Hey, listen, my f riends. You are
the few, the proud, the next...

9
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,633
...incoming f reshman class
to Columbus University.

10
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,633
...unyieldina pursuit
of academic ex cellence...

11
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,100
...one university stands
out amonast the rest.:

12
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,633
Columbus University.

13
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,167
-What's up, Malik?
-What's up, dog?

14
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:29,700
-Your mama got you some school gear.
-Your mama let me use her credit card.

15
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,233
-Yeah, all right.
-We'll see you.

16
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,167
Malik, what's wrong with you?

17
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,100
What?

18
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,100
This.

19
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,633
Why you always trying to showboat?
How come you're not dressed?

20
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,100
My stomach was giving me trouble.

21
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,033
You think because you're a superstar
rookie you don't have to work?

22
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,967
I got guys on this field who'll clean
your clock in five seconds.

23
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Who?

24
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Get off my field.

25
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,767
It's like that?

26
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,500
That's how you made it.

27
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:16,967
Dig.

28
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,100
Dig.

29
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,833
Little off today, baby, huh?

30
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,567
-Hi.
-Hi.

31
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,300
-I'm Kristen.
-Monet.

32
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,500
We're roommates, huh?

33
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,433
Yep. I like this side of the room,
but I guess you got here first.

34
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,967
Yeah, I guess I did.

35
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,833
So, where are you f rom?

36
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,767
-Orange County.
-Orange County, huh?

37
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:30,500
-ls that near Compton?
-No.

38
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,500
-You're not f rom around here, are you?
-No.

39
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,033
It's near Disneyland.

40
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,300
You live near Disneyland?

41
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:47,367
-Must be nice.
-lt has its moments.

42
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,100
Yeah!

43
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,900
Go!

44
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,633
This is crazy.

45
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Come on, girls, let's go.

46
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:15,033
I am getting my own
apartment next semester.

47
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,900
These dorms are f or children.
I hate them. God.

48
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,767
-Do you want to room with me?
-Hell, yeah. My room's like this big.

49
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,900
What about you?
Want to get an apartment together?

50
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,433
-I can't aff ord it.
-No sweat. Get your parents to pay.

51
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,700
-They can't.
-Why not?

52
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,567
My dad got laid off
f rom McDonnell Douglas last year.

53
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:44,500
The IRS audited him. My parents
could barely aff ord to send me here.

54
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,633
-But you are here.
-I'm here and I'm happy.

55
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,367
My roommate's a Mexican,
I bet she got a scholarship.

56
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,900
Shut up. Well, here we are.

57
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,500
All right, come here, darling.

58
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,167
Drink! Drink! Drink!

59
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,367
-Theta Kappa!
-Hey, Chad.

60
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,300
Well, well, what do we got here?
New recruits f or our Little Sister rush?

61
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,767
No, no. Actually, I don't
know about that.

62
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,900
-Ladies, this is Chad.
-Hi, Chad.

63
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:36,167
-Hey.
-And this is Nicole, okay?

64
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,100
And this is Claudia, right?

65
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,833
-And this is, uh...
-Kristen.

66
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:46,300
Kristen. I'm sorry. They're f reshmen.

67
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,433
How do we become Little Sisters?

68
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:54,367
They probably make you drink beer
out of condoms and wet your T-shirt.

69
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:58,433
Beer out of a condom...
That's a new one. Write that down.

70
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,633
-I will.
-No, we don't do that here.

71
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,167
But I'll tell you this. There's nobody
on this campus who parties like we do!

72
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,700
Yo!

73
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,967
Man, governments
ain't running things no more.

74
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,700
Financial institutions,
they controlling the whole thing.

75
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,700
You ever hear of the World Bank
or the IMF? No, huh?

76
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,367
Y'all probably don't even have
checking accounts.

77
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,633
But y'all got them
credit cards, huh?

78
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Buy stuff out your means
and wonder why you still a slave.

79
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,567
Y'all better recognize,
I'm telling you.

80
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:05,433
Dude, when are you gonna clear
everyone out? Classes start tomorrow.

81
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,833
-lt's over when it's over, dude.
-" Dude."

82
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,167
I can't take this no more.

83
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:51,300
-Yo, man, watch my shoes.
-You got a problem, man?

84
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,567
Security.

85
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,967
Security.

86
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,633
Look at this.

87
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,900
-What's up, kid?
-They're playing their music, man.

88
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,700
Who?

89
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,300
These guys. I'm not trying to narc,
but tomorrow's the first day of class.

90
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:19,567
I got physics in the morning.
It's like f riggin' Soul Train up there.

91
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,100
You're here to study, not to party.
Head home and hit those books.

92
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,233
Glad you had a good time.
Come again on the weekend.

93
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,233
Good night. Okay.

94
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:36,500
People are trying to sleep.
Give them a little respect, huh?

95
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,033
You don't hear that down the hall?

96
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:42,833
You ain't sweating them because they're
playing that hillbilly shit, right?

97
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,967
No, no. Because I dig rock 'n' roll.

98
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,033
Then roll your f at ass
down the hall then.

99
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
That's that old bullshit.

100
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,167
Hey!

101
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,167
-Why are you walking alone?
-I don't know.

102
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
It's not safe to walk around
campus by yourself at night.

103
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,833
I just left the Row 'cause my f riends
were drinking and acting crazy.

104
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
I just went my own way.

105
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,567
Some f riends.

106
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:27,833
Yeah.

107
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:36,367
Look at all these pretty blue lights.

108
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,367
You don't know what
they're f or, do you?

109
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,833
No. Decoration?

110
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,633
No, it's the blue-light system.

111
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,833
See, there's a phone
at the end of every block.

112
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,500
That way you can call security
in case someone tries to grab you.

113
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,100
You're gonna have
to be caref ul out here.

114
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,900
Come on.

115
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,900
I just got here.
Have you met anybody yet?

116
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,167
Yeah, I just met somebody.

117
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,233
My name's Taryn.

118
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:20,100
-Junior.
-Kristen. Freshman.

119
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,367
Fresh-woman?

120
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,500
Yeah, I could tell.

121
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:29,633
Well, my first class is at 8:00.

122
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,367
-So...
-Where's your dorm?

123
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:34,833
It's right here. Holland Hall.
Real close.

124
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,300
-Thanks.
-Sure. Oh, wait.

125
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,167
Here.

126
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,500
Students f or a Non-Sexist Society.

127
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,567
We have meetings Wednesdays
if you want to come by.

128
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay. Thanks.

129
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Oh, man.

130
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,700
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

131
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,833
-lt's time f or us to talk.
-About what?

132
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,233
About your side of the room.

133
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,500
What's wrong with it?

134
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,167
Look at it, man. It's filthy,
it's f unky, it's stinking, man.

135
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,900
-What you do on that side affects me.
-All right, I'll try.

136
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,833
Let's take a trip around the world.

137
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,700
Look there, under the statue.
You see them people?

138
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,767
That's Disneyland.

139
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
And there's Chinatown.

140
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:05,300
And over there,
that's south of the border.

141
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,033
And this right here is the black hole
because we're black f olks.

142
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:14,767
So, you Fudge, huh?
I heard about you.

143
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,033
-What'd you hear about me?
-I heard you were a super-duper senior.

144
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,767
Been here six years
and still haven't graduated.

145
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,367
-She trying to play you out.
-Why is that?

146
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:32,700
Because I done already
learned the game, f resh fish.

147
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,167
Is that right, old trout?

148
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,233
Yo.

149
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,900
Y'all some trained Negroes.

150
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,233
Soon as you hear a bell,
y'all go running.

151
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,633
Welcome to the real world.

152
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,700
Or, as it states in your schedule
of courses, Political Science 101 .

153
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:09,967
I am your instructor.
My name is Professor Maurice Phipps.

154
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,033
Today I am going to give you your first
lesson in politics. Are you ready?

155
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,700
Now, I shall need one volunteer.

156
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,367
Anyone?

157
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:37,500
No wonder this nation is f alling
behind the rest of the world.

158
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,367
No one in this class
seems to have any initiative.

159
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:48,033
You, brave soul, come f orward.

160
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,900
-And what is your name, my good man?
-Malik Williams, Professor Phipps, sir.

161
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:12,700
Malik Williams. Mr. Williams,
would you be kind enough...

162
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:17,167
...to read the names
with the asterisks beside them?

163
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,633
Those persons whose names
are called, please stand.

164
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:27,367
All right. " Marvin Anthony,
Wendy Arrington, Tanya Arroyo...

165
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,900
...Chris Barlow, Skye Blue,
Jennifer Bryant...

166
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,500
Pamela Burris, Eric Cannon,

167
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,433

168
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,300
...Malik Williams." What?

169
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,967
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
You have served your purpose.

170
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,833
What's that list f or, dog?

171
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,433
Those persons whose names were
called and whom are standing...

172
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,567
...the university instructed me that
your financial bill hasn't been paid.

173
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:08,700
Leave and settle your debts. You
may not return until you have done so.

174
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,700
There are no handouts
in the f ree world...

175
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:19,100
...and, appropriately, none in
my course. Thank you and good day.

176
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,700
Shit.

177
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:31,367
Professor Phipps, I need this class
f or my major. You know?

178
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:38,167
Young lady, calm yourself and go
to the financial aid office.

179
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,367
Go.

180
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,100
What about me?

181
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,967
Don't you have
some business to attend to?

182
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,433
Yeah, but I thought
I just showed initiative.

183
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:56,567
That don't count f or nothing, brother?

184
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,900
Mr. Williams, I do not appreciate,
nor will I tolerate...

185
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:05,167
...people who try to brownnose
in my course.

186
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:11,900
Now go to the financial aid office
or appeal to the athletic department.

187
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,300
I ain't no dumb athlete.

188
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,633
That remains to be seen.

189
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:33,767
Right. I hope that all of you...

190
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:39,300
Yo, dog, take good notes.
I'm gonna need to borrow them.

191
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,900
Now that the bureaucratic nonsense
is out of the way, we'll get to...

192
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,367
...the business of real politics.

193
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:51,033
Are you sure? I mean,
I don't understand this.

194
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,567
Never leave home without it.

195
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:06,500
Looks like we got a problem
with your fee bill.

196
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,700
Like what?

197
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,967
It says you got a partial athletic
scholarship. Better talk to your coach.

198
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:17,500
Partial? That's a mistake.
I'm a f ull-scholarship student.

199
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,433
I can't help that.
That's what it shows.

200
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:26,033
-You sure your computer ain't broke?
-I'm sorry, honey. I can't help you.

201
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,767
-Go get it cleared in that department.
-Thank you.

202
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,167
Next.

203
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,700
Baby, you're just gonna have
to get a job.

204
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,433
Here's your card.

205
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,967
Come on, guys, pick it up!

206
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,433
You look like a bunch of girls!
Come on, pick it up!

207
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,833
Come on, give me some juice.
There you go.

208
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:14,433
Yeah, looking sweet.

209
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,767
-Twenty-three!
-You want a what? A full scholarship?

210
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,767
Man, you aot some nerve.

211
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,100
All riaht, I'll see what I can do.

212
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:07,100
I don't wanna hear you're lax in your
studies or fuckina up on the field.

213
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,300
You aot that?
Do I make myself clear?

214
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,300
Yeah, man, I understand.

215
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,167
Word to the mother, kid.
Have you seen that ass?

216
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,900
Hey, yo, what kind
of munchies y'all got?

217
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,700
Where are the vittles at? The eats?

218
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,100
Hey, y'all ain't got no Kool-Aid
up in this piece, man? Guess not.

219
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:57,767
I see y'all got some Evian
up in here, though, huh?

220
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:07,633
How would you feel if you had to study
and I came in and blasted my music?

221
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,833
-That wouldn't happen.
-Why not?

222
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:14,633
Because I'd whup your ass, that's why.

223
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,833
Ex cuse me.

224
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:57,833
Boy, I'm the master of Monopoly.

225
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,433
That's right.

226
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,900
You bankrupt, G.

227
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,767
Should've bought them
apartments, man. I told you.

228
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,033
Hey, why you going to this school?

229
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:16,700
Well, because that's what they say you
need to do to make it in the country.

230
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,500
-What's "making it"?
-Fudge, your printer's out of paper.

231
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:26,833
Well, then go buy some more.
What's "making it"?

232
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:31,633
You know, getting a degree.
You know, making that long dough.

233
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:37,233
Is that right? So you in it
f or the money or the knowledge?

234
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,900
Check out this situation.

235
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,367
You at a f ootball game.
There's thousands of people there.

236
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,767
All of them white.

237
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:52,967
The American flag
is right above your head.

238
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,567
They're about to play
the national anthem.

239
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:59,767
All these people turn around
and look you dead in your eye.

240
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,233
What do you do?

241
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:10,300
I stand up.
I'd probably be so embarrassed...

242
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:13,967
You know, I'd stand up.
You know what I'm saying?

243
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,167
They got you running
f or the school, huh?

244
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:32,833
-Yeah. Partial scholarship.
-You don't run, you don't get tuition.

245
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,633
That's the way the system goes.

246
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,033
Run, nigger, run.

247
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Oh, my God. Look at her hair.

248
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:12,433
-Be nice, Nicole. It's not that bad.
-She looks like a tramp.

249
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:15,833
-Hi.
-Hi. What'd you do to your hair?

250
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:19,967
-I just bleached it.
-I love it. Yes.

251
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,300
Watch me bring it up.
Watch me bring it.

252
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,633
Bam. Of all times.

253
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,833
Want to play again, man?
Come on, let's play again.

254
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,967
-Three in a row.
-You're a bastard.

255
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,700
-Want to play?
-Huh?

256
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,567
-Want to play a game of pool?
-I don't know how to play.

257
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,700
Bye.

258
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,300
Okay, who's the genius
who matches roommates up?

259
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,500
They moved me in
with a psycho dickhead.

260
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,433
It's like the Bates Hotel
over at my place.

261
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,633
My days are numbered, Wayne.

262
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,300
-He's probably just quiet.
-Okay.

263
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,167
Hey.

264
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:37,500
-Hey, man. Say, where's the party?
-Up here, man.

265
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,633
Is that right? Cool.

266
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,967
Here she goes.

267
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,233
Nice job. Hello! Good night.

268
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,433
Down the hatch.

269
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,767
Talented, I see.

270
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:03,300
-I never usually swallow.
-You're a dirty girl.

271
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,300
-Hey, let's get one f or her, huh?
-Give her a shot.

272
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:11,433
Kristen!

273
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:14,900
Kristen! Kristen! Kristen!

274
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Drink! Drink! Drink!

275
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,100
All right!
What a big girl you are, huh?

276
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,700
-I can't walk.
-Please, come on.

277
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:35,100
-All right. Where are we going?
-We're going to my house.

278
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,233
To the house.

279
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:44,700
When you say that you look really bad,
like, you're perfect, you know?

280
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Hey, do you think we should've
let Kristen go with Billy?

281
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,433
-Because she doesn't even drink.
-Billy who?

282
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,900
I love you!

283
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:21,767
Billy, you've gotta get a rubber.

284
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,500
Billy, we should be using a condom.

285
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:31,900
Just a second.

286
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,433
Billy, come on.

287
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,367
-One second.
-No. Get a condom.

288
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,967
Just wait a second.
Shut up!

289
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:47,900
Billy, no! Stop it! Get a condom!

290
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,100
No! Stop it!

291
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,767
Billy, get off of me! Get off of me!

292
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,233
-Fuck, man!
-No! Stop!

293
00:31:57,367 --> 00:32:00,700
Stop! No!

294
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,233
You f ucker!

295
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:07,633
Kris, what the...? Wait!

296
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,633
Wait a second! Goddamn it!

297
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,300
Kristen.

298
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,367
Kristen.

299
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,900
Fuck!

300
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,833
Say, man.

301
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:55,367
-Did you give it to her?
-What?

302
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:58,100
You f ucked her, right?
Did she like it?

303
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,500
What the f uck are you talking about?
How the f uck do you know?

304
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:05,967
-Go get a beer.
-Who the f uck are you, man?

305
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,167
You just got laid, right?
You should be cool.

306
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,700
-Motherf ucker!
-What's up with you?

307
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,033
-What's your problem?
-You're my problem, bitch.

308
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:30,567
I finished my paper
and I don't have anything to do.

309
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:35,833
Kris, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

310
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:40,633
Oh, God, what have you been drinking?

311
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,767
Kris, what's wrong?

312
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,767
-Hello.
-Can I speak to Kristen, please?

313
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,567
-Who's this?
-Billy.

314
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:04,167
-Billy who? I don't know no Billys.
-Yeah, I just...

315
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,767
I just need to talk to Kristen.

316
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,567
-You want to speak to Kristen.
-No. No.

317
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,300
She's not here.

318
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,167
Even if she was here, I don't think
she'd wanna talk to you.

319
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:20,167
I know she's there. I can hear her.

320
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:24,433
-Can you put her on the phone?
-Didn't I just tell you she's not here?

321
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,633
Put her on the phone,
you black bitch!

322
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:31,767
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

323
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,300
Why are y'all so quiet?

324
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:08,233
-Let's go.
-To kick some ass, nigga?

325
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Just get away f rom him
and come home with me.

326
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,500
What do you think they make
you do to get into this f rat?

327
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,167
You know?

328
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,100
You don't?

329
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
I bet you they make you do something,
right?

330
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,633
Like things.

331
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,367
Crazy stuff.

332
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,033
I'd do it.

333
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,900
Which one?

334
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:14,500
-Yo! Get the f uck up!
-Piece of crap. Get his ass.

335
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,700
What's up, bro? What did I do?

336
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,100
-Come on!
-Man, let me go!

337
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,900
-Chad, what's up with these guys?
-Call security now!

338
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,300
-What'd I do?
-I'll just put my boot in your mouth.

339
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,967
I heard you been disrespecting
black women.

340
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,967
No, man, I haven't either...

341
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,833
You called me a black bitch,
and you gonna get your ass kicked.

342
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,567
Come on, man, listen. I'm sorry.

343
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,500
-I'm sorry, okay?
-Apologize to her!

344
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,900
Sorry! I'm sorry! Look, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

345
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,900
Fuck that!
We need to just bust his shit!

346
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:54,767
-No, listen. Please, man.
-Here's what I want you to say.

347
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:58,967
I want you to say,
" I apologize, beautif ul black woman...

348
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,767
...mother of the Earth,
queen of the universe."

349
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,300
I'm sorry.
I apologize, black mother...

350
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,033
-Get it right!
-I can't remember all that.

351
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,100
I'm sorry.

352
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,833
What's going on?

353
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:21,767
These gang members
dragged him out f or no reason.

354
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:25,167
What the f uck you talking about,
white boy?

355
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:28,233
Gang members?
We go to school here too!

356
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:32,500
-Enough of this stuff.
-I'll rip your ass off them stairs!

357
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:36,233
Don't I know you? Everybody else,
come out with the I.D.'s.

358
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:39,300
You don't need to see nobody I.D.
Don't show them.

359
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:43,433
Wait. Everything's okay now.
It was just a misunderstanding.

360
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,500
We're cool now, right?

361
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,367
We're cool, right?

362
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:59,633
Hope you gonna break up their party
like you did ours.

363
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,700
-ls everything cool here now?
-Very f ucking cool!

364
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,100
What's up?

365
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,567
Pussy.

366
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,433
Punk-ass motherf ucker.

367
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,300
I don't understand why they always
have to start all this trouble.

368
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:41,300
-You okay, Billy?
-Yeah.

369
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,500
Come on.

370
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,767
We need to get past just complaining
about university security.

371
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,033
You know?

372
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,833
I'm tired of hearing women cry
f or someone else to save them.

373
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:05,167
Think what that means.

374
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:08,033
Why do you need someone else
to save you?

375
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,633
Think about saving yourself.

376
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,567
-Hi.
-Hi.

377
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,100
Hi, everybody.

378
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,300
-Join us.
-Okay.

379
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,567
Hi.

380
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:31,367
We were talking about security on
campus, in light of a recent survey...

381
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:35,167
...that showed one out of f our women
has been raped...

382
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,167
...or survived an attempted rape,
since the age of 14.

383
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,367
Do you have any ideas or thoughts
you want to share?

384
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,833
No.

385
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,900
Fudge, you got some e-mail
coming through.

386
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,167
Is that right?

387
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:09,300
Need to start charging y'all f ools,
like the university.

388
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,367
Twenty-five cent a page.

389
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,367
Y'all could pay f or my laundry.

390
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,100
You got the autobiography
of Frederick Douglass?

391
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,100
Yeah.

392
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,967
Biographies are up there.

393
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,433
-Damn. You read all these?
-Most of them.

394
00:40:57,633 --> 00:41:00,167
Hey, how you get turned on
to Douglass?

395
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,767
Need it f or a class.

396
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,700
For a class. That's the only
reason you're reading it?

397
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,167
-Yeah. Why else?
-To feed your brain, f ool.

398
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,567
I thought you was a smart one,
but you ain't. So you got to go.

399
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,767
-Can I borrow this book, man?
-Yeah, go ahead.

400
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:25,767
Read it f or yourself
and not f or no damn class, though.

401
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,900
-Thanks f or the book, dog.
-Run along.

402
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:47,633
-What's up, brother?
-What's up, man?

403
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:52,100
Reading in the dark
is bad f or the eyes.

404
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:58,100
-I got good eyes.
-What book you reading?

405
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,500
-Iliad.
-That's a good book. Great battles.

406
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,233
Yeah, it's all right.

407
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:09,167
Me and a couple f riends,
we were gonna go get a drink.

408
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,633
You wanna come along?

409
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:18,567
I said, me and my buddies were gonna
go get a drink. You wanna come along?

410
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,433
What are you,
some queer or something?

411
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:27,367
-What? What are you talking about?
-I should kick your ass, man.

412
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:31,633
First off, don't ever touch me again.

413
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:35,900
I will beat you
to the f ucking ground, boy.

414
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Secondly, you know,
I ain't no f aggot.

415
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:43,633
I just wanted to know
if you wanted to get a drink.

416
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:54,033
-Sorry, man. It's a new city.
-That's okay. I understand.

417
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,567
We'll f orget about it,
have a drink...

418
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:00,033
...with good people.
We'll have a good time.

419
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,300
-What do you say?
-All right, man.

420
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,833
Pick up your stuff. Come on.

421
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,767
I mean, we're white, in America,
what more do you need?

422
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:12,567
We're white, in America, what more
do you need to have a good time?

423
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,767
Right?

424
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,633
All right, here we go.

425
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,900
-What's your name again?
-Remy.

426
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,633
-What's your name?
-I'm Scott.

427
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,500
-So, where you f rom, Remy?
-ldaho.

428
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:32,233
-ldaho, huh? Where in Idaho?
-Boise.

429
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:35,633
That's the Big Sky State, huh?

430
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,567
-I think that's Montana.
-That's right. It is Montana.

431
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,900
These are my brothers here.

432
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,567
Fellas, hey.

433
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,900
This here, this is Erik.

434
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,100
-What's up, man?
-This is Knocko over here.

435
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
-This is James here.
-Hi.

436
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,700
-Everybody, this is Remy.
-Hey, Remy.

437
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,100
What's up?

438
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,700
You should know that democratic
theory did not begin...

439
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,967
...with Rousseau's contract. No.

440
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,100
Its origins, in f act, lie in
the subject of landownership.

441
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,500
The common people became aware...

442
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:20,100
...that the upper classes owned the land
upon which they lived and laboured.

443
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,833
This incensed them...

444
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:27,633
...inspired them to seek sovereignty
of their own homelands.

445
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:31,633
However,
the social order of the day...

446
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:37,167
...did not permit landownership
by the common man.

447
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:40,767
Theref ore, these people...

448
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:44,833
...felt the need to leave
their homelands...

449
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:51,100
...to flee in an eff ort to escape
political and social persecution.

450
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,567
Hence, the creation that is America.

451
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,233
Theref ore, the basic premise...

452
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,767
...of democratic theory...

453
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:10,500
...is that each and every citizen
living within that society...

454
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,367
...is entitled...

455
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,367
...to what?

456
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,233
We are entitled to life...

457
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,633
...liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.

458
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:38,833
What you people have to realize
is that despite having these rights...

459
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:41,833
...very few people ex ercise them.

460
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:48,700
It is that type of apathy that
corrodes our country f rom within.

461
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:58,500
Your assignment f or the semester
is as f ollows:

462
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:04,233
To f ormulate
your own political ideology.

463
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:09,700
This will be dictated by your sex,
background...

464
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,300
...socioeconomic status...

465
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:16,167
...personal experience,
et cetera, et cetera.

466
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,767
This course will be like
anything in life.

467
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,633
It will be what you make of it.
I am not a babysitter.

468
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not waste my time.

469
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,167
Remember...

470
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,433
...no one is going to treat
you special...

471
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:38,633
...just because you are black.

472
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,633
Right. Or white.

473
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:48,567
Or Hispanic.

474
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,700
Or Indian.

475
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,633
Or Asian.

476
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,567
Or because you are a woman.

477
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:06,633
Or because you f ailed to get
sufficient rest last night.

478
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Or because you are...

479
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,033
What are you?

480
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,967
-I don't know.
-Right.

481
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,167
Don't sweat it.

482
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,100
Come on.

483
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,767
Watch it.

484
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,967
-Watch out.
-Watch it. Watch it.

485
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,033
-Damn.
-Let's see your I.D.

486
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,433
No, let us see your I.D.

487
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,100
Forget these guys.

488
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,633
Thought so.

489
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:57,433
You know what that's all about?
They hate me 'cause they ain't me.

490
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:14,033
Can you hand me another one
of those mayonnaise?

491
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:30,567
-Do you want to report it?
-lt's not gonna do anything.

492
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,033
They're just gonna make me
feel like shit...

493
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:39,300
...and make me look like
I asked f or it.

494
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:46,833
I didn't ask f or this.
I just wanna go to school.

495
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,900
Come here.

496
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:03,367
This ain't cool, dog. A " B" on
content, and then I get a " C" f or...

497
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:08,233
Punctuation mistakes,
misspellings...

498
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:13,233
...grammatical error,
et cetera, et cetera.

499
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:21,567
You probably didn't even read it.
TA graded all of these, right?

500
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:27,500
If you could spell as well as you run,
it would be better, Mr. Williams.

501
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:36,233
-Sellout.
-Mr. Williams.

502
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:43,167
So Mr. Williams
thinks I am an Uncle Tom.

503
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,633
Well, well, well.

504
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:54,633
What does that have to do with your
ability to place a comma properly...

505
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:58,033
...or put a period
at the end of a sentence?

506
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,500
-Look...
-Would you care f or a peppermint?

507
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,433
No, thank you.

508
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,567
You're using
that reverse treatment...

509
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,100
...'cause I'm one of the only
black f aces in your class.

510
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:15,633
Mr. Williams, I treat everyone
in my course exactly the same...

511
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:19,567
...and I will continue to give you
a difficult time...

512
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,433
...until you have proven
that you deserve otherwise.

513
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:28,233
-Those are the rules of the game.
-lt's a f ucked-up game.

514
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,567
Please watch your language.

515
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:35,167
Rid yourself of this attitude
that the world owes you something.

516
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,433
You must strip yourself of that
mentality. It breeds laziness.

517
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,700
It is laziness that has kept
black people down in this country.

518
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:50,500
I don't think like that.
All right, man, it's just...

519
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:56,633
Look, I don't need one of my own
trying to treat me like I'm the enemy.

520
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,367
The enemy? Who is the enemy?

521
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,633
One man with a white beard
who sits behind his desk...

522
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:06,300
...pushing buttons that control
the f ate of the entire world?

523
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,300
No, that is not reality.
That is The Wizard of Oz.

524
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,300
No, man, I mean anybody.

525
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,700
White, black, anybody
who gets in the way of my progress.

526
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21,633
I am not in your way.

527
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:24,833
I did not ask you
to come to this university...

528
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:27,433
...nor am I here to motivate you.

529
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:31,633
Your own presence
should be motivation enough.

530
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,900
I have nothing to prove,
unlike you.

531
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,967
I don't have anything to prove.

532
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:41,367
Who do I have something to prove to?

533
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,033
Yourself.

534
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,500
Good afternoon, Mr. Williams.

535
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,500
Ladies and aentlemen,
the next race on the track...

536
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,433
...will be the 4x100-metre relay.

537
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:19,500
In lane three, the non-scorina B-team
from John Paul Colleae.

538
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,300
Lane number four, the scorina team
from Columbus University.

539
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,700
Lane number five, the scorina team
from John Paul Colleae.

540
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,500
And in lane six, the non-scorina
B-team from Columbus University.

541
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:39,367
On your marks!

542
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,833
May we have quiet for the start.

543
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,300
Set!

544
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,433
We have a fair start.

545
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:05,500
Adam Bailey out very well
in lane four for Columbus University.

546
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:09,233
Gettina ready now for
the first ex chanae.

547
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:11,633
Stick!

548
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:18,567
Down the backstretch they ao.
Columbus in four, John Paul in five.

549
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,433
A tremendous effort
by John Paul Colleae...

550
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:27,500
...moves them into the lead as we
aet ready for the second ex chanae.

551
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:33,700
In the far turn, John Paul in five,
Columbus in four, neck and neck.

552
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,967
Gettina ready
for the anchor lea.

553
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,433
Stick! Stick!

554
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,500
Tyrene Jay for John Paul...

555
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,967
...and Robert "The Rocket" Simmons
for Columbus.

556
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,367
-It is John Paul followed by Columbus.
-First place, 39.58.

557
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,967
Second place, 39.60.

558
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,967
-Second place, 39.60.
-Correct.

559
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:05,500
The next race on the track
will be the 1500 metres.

560
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:10,300
That event is scheduled in 10 minutes.
Visit the concession stand...

561
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:13,433
Ain't no next time.
All I'm saying is this.

562
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,500
I got a lot riding on this. I'm not
about to let my stats get blown.

563
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:21,633
You the only weak link on this team.

564
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:26,033
You listening to me?

565
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:31,433
Fool, all you is, all you ever gonna
be, is a runner. Like a horse.

566
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:34,367
You're a slave,
too ignorant to know it.

567
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:37,233
-Who you calling ignorant, bitch?
-Hey!

568
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:39,700
-We're a team, man!
-Fuck that shit!

569
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:42,433
We gotta stick together, black men!

570
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:47,367
Get your shit together, bitch!
Stupid bitch!

571
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:49,567
I like that.

572
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:53,633
I like your beautif ul hair,
your eyes, your lips.

573
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:59,633
Look at this f ool with his cave bitch.
It's a damn shame, man.

574
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:03,700
Don't that make you upset
as a black woman?

575
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,367
I don't want him.

576
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,433
Yeah, I can dig that.
He's weak anyway.

577
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:14,633
Miss Deja.
Where you f rom? Texas, right?

578
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:19,633
-I see you did your research.
-Not enough.

579
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:25,433
-God.
-I could always know more.

580
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,500
What, you shy?

581
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,567
-No. Are you?
-I stepped to you, didn't I?

582
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:44,367
I've been seeing you on the track,
having a little attitude.

583
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:47,567
I seen you too,
acting like you all that.

584
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,567
-I'm not acting like...
-Mr. Big Stuff. Yes, you do.

585
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,233
You be like:

586
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:57,033
-Running f or your life.
-So you be looking at me?

587
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,567
-I don't look at you.
-You just imitated my f orm.

588
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,767
You be looking at me, right?

589
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,900
A little bit,
but we're on the same team.

590
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:16,433
-I been looking at you too.
-God.

591
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:21,700
-What dorm you staying in?
-Why you wanna know where I live?

592
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,167
-I wanted to get you home safe.
-I'll be okay.

593
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:28,233
-There's a lot of crazies here.
-Goodness.

594
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:31,367
I'll guard your body.
Be your bodyguard.

595
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,033
How do you feel knowing this country
doesn't belong to you any longer?

596
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,100
I mean,
what do you think of that?

597
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:49,233
How do you feel knowing that
when you graduate f rom college...

598
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:53,233
...you might not get a job because
of your skin colour?

599
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:55,100
Because of some quota.

600
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:59,633
People don't realize how f ar down
the drain America has gone.

601
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,633
What do you think about that, Remy?

602
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:09,367
I guess I never thought
about that, man.

603
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,633
It's different here than I thought
it was gonna be.

604
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:20,233
Seems like everybody's
sticking to their own...

605
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:23,033
...taking up f or their own.

606
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:28,567
I don't know anybody down here.

607
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:34,700
It's different, man. You know.

608
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,433
-All I got is me.
-No, man.

609
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:43,500
And me. We're brothers by blood.

610
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,767
Yeah, you got me too, Remy.

611
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,367
I think I'm gonna cry.

612
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:55,567
Shut the f uck up, Knocko.
Show the man some respect.

613
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,167
That's cool, Scott.

614
00:57:57,367 --> 00:58:00,700
That's pure Aryan blood
you're talking to.

615
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:03,167
No, no, no, you're right.

616
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:08,100
This is brotherhood, Remy.
Welcome home.

617
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:11,700
-Thanks.
-See, Remy, this is your f amily now.

618
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,767
And if there should be anything at all
that you wanna talk about...

619
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:19,833
...then I want you to come to me
or to us.

620
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,900
If there's one thing I want you
to leave thinking about tonight...

621
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,100
...it's that we take care of our own.

622
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,433
Thanks, man.

623
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,900
Thanks, Scott.

624
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:45,500
Run-on. Run-on.
Fragment. Fragment. Fragment.

625
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:50,033
-ls this a period or a comma?
-That's a lot of red ink.

626
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,500
-Do you want help?
-I'm here.

627
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:01,233
Malik, you gotta get this to flow,
and right now it's not flowing.

628
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:04,500
Right here,
that's a really good point...

629
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,700
...but you gotta f ollow it up
with a concise explanation.

630
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,100
What do you mean?

631
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:17,767
Malik, when you write an essay,
you gotta f ollow a certain f ormat.

632
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,700
You start with your thesis statement...

633
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,633
...and you have to always use
transitional phrases.

634
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:28,367
And don't use the same word
every single time.

635
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:31,167
Change it up.
Professors hate that.

636
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:35,300
You should use a thesaurus.
And where's your outline?

637
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,233
We got a lot of work to do.

638
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,900
-ls something wrong?
-No.

639
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,767
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

640
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:13,633
I'm fine.

641
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,033
I am af raid it is unclear.

642
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:31,100
But... I don't understand.

643
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:37,033
Miss Connor, you don't appear to take
any kind of position in this paper.

644
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:43,100
I thought that, when you write, you're
supposed to be as objective as possible.

645
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:45,700
That is a rule of journalism.

646
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,833
It is often taught
and very rarely practised.

647
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:52,433
This, however,
is a political science course.

648
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,900
If you wish to write
about objectivity...

649
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,633
...write about its use in modern
politics in your view.

650
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:04,567
That'd make a good paper.
I'll write that down.

651
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,633
Oh, Christ Jesus.

652
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:10,833
What?

653
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,833
In f uture, Miss Connor,
please find your own thesis.

654
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,300
I am looking f or evidence
of original thought.

655
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:25,233
You are not here to simply recycle
dates and f acts f rom the past.

656
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:28,433
One's primary purpose
at university level...

657
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:31,967
...should be to learn how to think.

658
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:38,833
Now, question:

659
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:43,367
Did you write this paper?

660
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,367
You really feel like insulting
my intelligence, don't you?

661
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,900
I worked my ass off on that paper.
I rewrote it three times.

662
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:59,500
-Shouldn't be one misspelled word.
-Okay, Mr. Williams, I believe you.

663
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,300
Are you having problems
here at Columbus?

664
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,100
It's all right.

665
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:16,833
I got a problem with the way f ools
be tripping when they see a black f ace.

666
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:21,700
Someone spit in your f ace
when you first came to campus?

667
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,567
Was there a cross burned
outside your dormitory?

668
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,500
No. I know what you're
trying to get at.

669
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,767
Just 'cause it ain't up in my f ace,
that don't mean it's not happening.

670
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:34,300
It's less physical now.
It's more mental.

671
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:37,567
I gotta run and study, man.

672
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:43,367
I don't see these white f olks worrying
about nothing but going to class...

673
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:47,433
...talking about skiing.
They don't have the same worries.

674
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:53,833
Then your problem is financial.
Not racial, but economic.

675
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:58,300
These type of problems
can be worked out.
