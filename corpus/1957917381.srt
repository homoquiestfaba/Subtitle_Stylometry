NARRATOR:
'Twas the night before Christmas,

3
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,582
and I've got a tale to tell.

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:31,207
In the very near future,
things have all gone to hell.

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,832
In 2027, it was made illegal
to take drugs or to drink.

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,333
A puff, sniff, or sip
will land you straight in the clink.

7
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,707
Except for one night,
The Binge, as it's known,

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,875
where it's perfectly legal
to get drunk, high, or stoned.

9
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,832
But something else happened
that no one could anticipate.

10
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,041
Spending Christmas with family sober
would make you irate.

11
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,624
So this year they did
what you wouldn't believe.

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,999
They brilliantly moved
The Binge to Christmas Eve.

13

So grab some mistletoe, kids,
and prepare to get hyped.

177
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:52,499
And, Andrew, I don't think
you should be threatened at all by me

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,582
or my relationship with your mother.

179
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
ANDREW:
Are you kidding me with this fucking guy?

180
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,291
What the hell is going on?

181
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,874
I am so excited
to be spending the holiday

182
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,082
with you and your family.

183
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,332
Get the fuck outta here!

184
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,624
[giggles]
I love a family that goofs around.

185
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,082
I'm into it. [continues giggling]

186
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,166
I'm not so sure
you're gonna like Christmas with us.

187
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,707
[smoke alarm beeping] - [yelling]
Can you guys shut the fuck up, please?

188
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,667
Andrew, what the hell
took you so long to get home?

189
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,999
[yelling] I was getting presents, Mom!
What the fuck?

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,124
The only present I ever got
was the human papillomavirus

191
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,416
from a retired jockey in Ronkonkoma!

192
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,291
Nobody wants to hear
your fucking stories!

193
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,624
Actually, I kind of do.

194
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,582
Will you shut the fuck up, Craig?

195
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,832
Don't you tell my Craig to shut up!

196
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,874
I will burn this house to the ground
and make it look like a fucking accident!

197
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,832
You're upsetting Craig
with all the yelling!

198
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,041
He is a very sensitive man!

199
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:44,374
I apologize. I apologize all around.

200
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,999
Don't apologize!
How many times have I told you?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,124
I'm not sorry for anything.

202
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,999
- You're not sorry?
- You're not sorry for anything?

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,582
Are you fucking kidding me? Are you crazy?

204
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,999
What kind of person are you?

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,707
I'm indifferent.
I'm just Indifferent Craig.

206
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,749
Indifferent Craig, fix this!

207
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,207
Oh, I'll put a cinnamon glaze on it.

209
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,917
Mr. Martin! Good to see you, sir.

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,292
Nice of you to dress up, Hags.

211
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,666
Uh, w... what are you working on?

212
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,542
Ah, it's a little thing I've been
working on for the past two years.

213
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,666
Wow, sir! You have quite the talent.

214
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah.

215
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,207
I mean, this is basically
a flawless gingerbread man.

216
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,082
- It's a self-portrait.
- Really?

217
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,291
What an amazing piece.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,250
Next up, can you sculpt me
like one of your French girls?

219
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,499
You know, like in Titanic.

220
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,957
The shipwreck in 1912
that killed 1,500 innocent people?

221
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,042
That Titanic?

222
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,874
I meant the movie.

223
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:01,583
You know as well as I do,
movies are just pictures with sound.

224
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,374
Uh, well, I'm happy you're out here

225
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,957
'cause I wanted
to talk to you about something.

226
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,832
You know, um,
Sarah and I have been dating each other

227
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,124
for about three and a half years now.
- You're a good kid, Hags.

228
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,166
I know it's been hard holding off
being intimate with my daughter.

229
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,625
Yeah, right. [laughs]

230
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,832
Yeah, right!

231
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,041
Yeah... Yeah, we're waiting until marriage.

232
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,999
We might even wait
a couple years after marriage.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,374
We could just
love each other from a distance.

234
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,707
But since you brought up marriage though,

235
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,457
uh, I wanted to ask you, Mr. Martin...

236
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,249
Oh, no, please.
Mr. Martin was my father.

237
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm Dr. Martin.

238
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,207
One of the first things
I learned in medical school

239
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,166
is how to cut through the bone
cleanly and swiftly.

240
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,167
You're a foot doctor.

241
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:42,457
Feet have bones, Hags!

242
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,082
That's the second thing
I learned in medical school.

243
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,499
Let me show you.
[chainsaw buzzing]

244
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Please don't.

245
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,707
Hags hasn't been Hags lately.

246
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,666
He's been acting, like, super weird.

247
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,291
Has Andrew said anything about him?

248
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:59,332
Andrew and I had a conscious uncoupling.

249
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,791
How is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

250
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,166
Well, we haven't really talked
since I've been away at college.

251
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,624
And to be honest,
as insufferable as my mom is,

252
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,874
she did offer to give me a job.

253
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,667
And she thinks
that Andrew could ruin her image,

254
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,082
mainly his two dads.

255
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,541
So what?
Literally, everyone's parents are gay now.

256
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,874
If anything, I think
that'll help her win the election.

257
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,749
No, like, he literally has two dads.

258
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,166
He's a twin from two separate fathers.

259
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,457
It's... It's actually pretty common.

260
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,541
His mom had sex with two men
in a short window of time

261
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,582
who got her pregnant at the same time.

262
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,332
Like a Rube Goldberg system
of having sex...

263
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,332
- Gross.
- ...where the egg gets knocked into one or another,

264
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,249
and then you get two
for the price of one, even if...

265
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,375
HECTOR:
Eyyy! Is that Andrew I hear?

266
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,666
Merry Christmas, son.

267
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,833
Merry Christmas, Dad.

268

[speaking Spanish]

269
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,374
Dad? Did someone say my name?

270
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,749
No, nobody said your name.

271
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,707
If I remember correctly,
it's almost time for me and your brother

272
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,125
to make you eat
all the tinsel off the Christmas tree.

273
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,624
ANDREW:
I... I haven't...

274
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,166
I haven't eaten all the tinsel
from the Christmas tree in... in years.

275
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:06,082
Well, I think
it's always sad to see a tradition die.

276
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,291
But The Binge starts in two hours,

277
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:14,124
and I'm gonna get ass up
on this motherfuckin' dale, dale!

280
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:23,124
Hopefully, Hector doesn't puke
on the pussycat again.

281
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,957
You know that cat ran away.

282
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,416
See what you did, Hector?

283
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,957
You know I have
a lactose intolerance, Rigo.

284
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,749
Oh, yeah. Hector,
that excuse ain't gonna fly on The Binge.

285
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,916
Tonight, all the rules are out the window!

286
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:38,082
That's not really
how irritable bowel syndrome works.

287
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,832
Well, then I guess you're gonna
shit your pants at the dinner table.

288
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,541
I guess I am.

289
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,916
Oh. My. God.

What does an owl even have
to do with Christmas anyway?

296
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,832
I've got a hunch a similar thing
was said about bunnies and Easter,

297
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,332
but we all collectively seem
to have moved past it.

298
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,167
Have we not?

299
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,874
- I guess.
- You guessed right!

300
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,457
And do not play games with me,
not tonight,

301
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,749
because I am not Hasbro,
and this ain't Monopoly.

and brought Christmas and tourism back

314

928
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,833
I had it taped to the wall of my cell
right next to my bed,

929
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,207
and, um, I was remembering
when your dad passed away

930
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,833
how hard it was on the family.

931
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,624
And how your mom,

932
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,874
you know, she just
kind of threw herself into her work

933
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,999
and kind of at the expense
of your upbringing.

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,832
So I just... I don't know,

935
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,332
I always kind of saw myself
as kind of a de facto dad,

936
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:24,916
you know, even though I, you know,
I'm not the normal uncle or whatever.

937
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:28,624
But I just wanted you
to know that I love you very much.

938
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,250
And I'm really happy
to be with you on Christmas.

939
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,457
And I, you know, I just wish

940
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,958
everything could go back
to the way it used to be, you know?

941
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,457
I don't think
that's possible, Uncle Kris.

00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,791
No, no, no. It is!
It is. I'm telling you!

but I was far away. Just say that.

is cheating on me! I know it!

- Obviously!

950

He is so, so, so scared of you, and...

hiding behind the Christmas tree?

00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,832
You seem happy. How's your dad?

00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,541
Uh, you know, staying out of jail.

956
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,124
No way! It's hard to do.
Trust me. [chuckles]

957
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,916

959
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,333
Uh, anyway, you guys go back
to your girl problem. [laughs]

960
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,291
Let me just say
from the bottom of my heart, Sarah,

961
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,832
I'm so glad you're not the DEA. Seriously.

962
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,208
- Right. Me too.
- Yeah.

UNCLE KRIS:
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

964
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,916
Yeah, he used to dress like Santa
every Christmas,

965
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,916
but somewhere down the road,
it became full-time.

966
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,707
SARAH:
Some people are so crazy.

967
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,749
Anyway, I have a tracker
on Hags' phone and iPad.

968
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,707
I pinged all the cell towers
at every location he's been to today,

969
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,707
cross-referenced it
with the location of his laptop,

970
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,749
which I also have bugged,

971
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,333
so triangulation
should be fairly straightforward.

972
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,541
We need to follow him
and see where he's going.

973
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,832
KIMMI:
Yeah, that's totally normal and healthy

974
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,374
and not at all psychotic,
but, um, I can't.

975
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,624
Uh, I have to be
at Winter Wonderland at 09:00,

976

You know what?
It's more than fine. Merry Christmas!

983
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:31,124
It's just... The neighbors, I think,
recognized me and called the cops

984
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,749
while I was decorating my sleigh.

985

986
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,083
Right.

00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:36,707
Look, again, everything's totally fine.

00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,457
We just probably wanna leave

Maybe. I don't know.

1006
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,207
Yeah, okay,
so I texted somebody for a ride,

1007
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,332
but they haven't gotten back to me yet.

1008
