180
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,140
and stomp on us.

181
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,908
That's how they
get their jollies.

182
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,471
You're paranoid.

183
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,413
Paranoid!

184
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,347
Paranoid!

185
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,017
l'm speaking truth
here brothers.

186
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:48,849
Look at yourselves.

187
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,910
You're all in denial.

188
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,047
Emotion, you're out
of line!

189
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,257
Out of line.

190
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,451
Out of line?

191
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,089
You're all
out of line!

192
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,894
Men, l warned you
this would happen

193
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,127
if we failed to
meet deadlines.

194
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,129
Conscience is right.

195
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,797
(Cynically)
Conscience is right.

196
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,863
Memory, you're
killing me man.

197
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,966
Stop living
in the past.

198
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,840
lt's time you got on
the right team

199
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,379
and stop siding
with this guy.

200
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,914
Emotion, you need
to calm down!

201
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,007

202
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,108
Heart?

203
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,119
What are we going
to do now?

204
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,928
Ah...now, we're
getting somewhere.

205
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,588
What are we
going to do?

206
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,232
l'm not sure.

207
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,238
Heart,
how do you feel?

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,432
l will tell you
how he feels.

209
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,909
Grief.

210
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,275
Despair.

211
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,938
Anger.

212
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,880
Outrage!

213
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,418
Will, am l right?
Am l right? Am l right?

214
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,578
l've got an idea.

215
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,178
Call Wendell back.

216
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,586
Mind you have to talk
some sense into him.

217
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,419
l tried, but--

218
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,015
But what!

219
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,582
Will, do it!
Do it! Do it!

220
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,288
He wouldn't listen.

221
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,853
He said the decision
was already made.

222
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,955
So that's it.

223
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,627
Mind,
this isn't fair.

224
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,960
Will, you got
to do something!

225
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:13,594
l can't.

226
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,913
When we get hit,
we hit back.

227
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,177
We have to at least make
Wendell feel our pain.

228
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,116
Heart, don't
listen to him.

229
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,619
Don't let Will burn
any bridges here.

230
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,655
Was l talking to you?

231
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,051
This is between
me and him.

232
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:34,990
Stay out of this.

233
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,972
l'm sick of this!

234
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,473
No one ever
listens to me!

235
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,634

239
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,019
l'm sorry.

00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,621
l'm sorry.

241
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,627
Thank you, Will.

242
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,995
Look, gentlemen, we've had
a traumatic experience.

243
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,364
We've actually had a lot
of traumatic experiences.

244
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,528
Ok, Memory,
a lot of them.

245
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,062
Let's calm down and
reason with ourselves.

246
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,578
Mind, l'm interested
in your assessment.

247
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,410
Well, l used to know what to do
when faced with a dilemma

248
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,249
but l've got to admit,
l'm confused.

249
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,220
Let me help
you out, Mind.

250
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,482
We're cursed.

251
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,079
No.

252
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,124
Yes.

253
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,159
We've been cursed by God.

254
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,195
How else are you
going to explain it.

255
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,695
We were living the dream
until a year ago,

256
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,255
then it turned
into a nightmare.

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,327
All of this clamor isn't
accomplishing anything

258
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,960
except upsetting Emotion.

259
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,535
Hey.

260
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,338
Remember when you had the guts
to face problems head on?

261
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,145
So that's it?

262
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,239
You're just going
to walk away?

263
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,011
What happened
to you Heart?

264
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,109
What made you
so weak?

265
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,984
You're weak!

00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,663
There is something
missing in all of this.

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,469
Like what?

271
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,305
l've heard
from everyone.

272
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,275
Mind will make
his assessment

273
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,743
and we'll plan
a course of action.

274
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,281
Now let's give
him some space.

275
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,581

from everyone.

Can you read it to me?

284
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,669
Why don't we have
Mommy read it?

285
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,468
ls Daddy too tired
to read?

286
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,701
No, l just love
watching you read.

00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,735
Don't forget.

After considering
our options,

to start over.

What about

00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,355
Heart, think of it
this way.

feelings have changed toward us.

Because she blames us.

have nearly crippled us.

00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,288
Heart, l hate to say it,
but l believe we can trace

330
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,820
all of our problems back to when
we began this journey of faith.

331
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,695
ln the beginning we
studied the Bible

332
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,565
and l was convinced
that it was true.

333
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,433
We prayed consistently,

334
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,405
and l thought if we got
involved in ministry

335
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,374
we could please God.

336
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,875
But circumstances
have proven

337
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,311
that no matter how much we did,
just the opposite happened.

338
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,542
Mind is right.

339
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,208
We need to start over.

You know like escape.

00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,689
l mean there's no
creativity here.

343
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,386
We're being stifled.

344
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,449
Mind can't think.

345
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,586
Will can't draw.

346
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,856
And you've lost
your passion.

00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,008
You're making decisions based
solely on circumstances.

353
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,809
We need some
spiritual direction.

354
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,017
And here comes
the judge.

355
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,349
l heard you down the hall
and it's obvious

356
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,894
that you are not thinking about
the spiritual implications.

357
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,452
How do you know that
this job opportunity

358
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,399
is not some kind of
divine intervention?

00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,366
What?

360
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:52,867
No.

Oh yeah!

You are going in
the wrong direction!

375
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:33,540
My desire is to get things back

lt can never be
like it was.

380

The sooner you
except that fact

381

the better we're
all going to be.

382
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:49,917
Every time Amy looks at us,
she remembers what happened.

383
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,429
There's no way
of overcoming it.

384
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,058
There's no way
of undoing it.

385
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,967
Leaving her is the only
solution that makes sense.

386

lf you won't do it for you,
do it for Amy.

387
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,880

(Heart) What do you

390
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,001
l want you to see
what's happening to us.

391
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,596
Why this light is not
as it once was.

392
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,609
You know this reveals
our true condition.

393

Who we really are
or what we've become.

394
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,913
And it never lies.

395
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,782
That's the problem.

396
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,379
What?

397
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,386

All l see is me.

00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,605
That's the problem.

401

The light of life used to shine
through this glass.

402
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,876
But now it's clouded over
by your grief and guilt.

403
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,541
What does that have to do
with winning my wife back.

404
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,777
Heart, examine
yourself.

405
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,945
You're spiritually weak
and this proves it.

406
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,457
l'm trying
to make you see

407
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,153
you're in no condition
to win her back.

408
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,661
l did it once.

409
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,129
And l can do
it again.

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,641
(Mind) She sure
<i>is beautiful.</i>

414
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,183
(Emotion) Do l have to remind
<i> you that she hates us? </i>

415
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,548
We've grown apart,

416
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,783
but l have no memory of us
ever thinking she hated us.

417

Take it easy Emotion.

a tornado ran through it.

What happened in here?

423
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,097
Nothing.

arguing earlier.

What are you

429
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,182

Shut up, Mind!

437
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,211
Michael, did you
hear what l said?

438
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,549
You never
listen to me.

439
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,814
Just drop it.
All right? l'm fine.

440
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:03,650
Obviously not!

441
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,954

Ok?

00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,756
lt's over.
l'm finished.

443
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,818
l'm sorry.

444
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,233
So, what are you
going to do now?

445
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,800
l don't know,
maybe l'll go draw a sign

446
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,068
and panhandle
by the interstate.

447
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:24,631
How about that?

448
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,972
Look, l know
you're upset,

449
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,069
but you don't have to get
sarcastic with me.

450

You know what l came
in here to talk to you,

but obviously this
is the wrong time.

453
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,010
Let's be honest, you never
respected what l do.

454
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,919
We are not going
to do this right now.

455
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,616

complete strangers

456

than my own wife.

457

meet your expectations.

Because you treat me
like a child.

713
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,983
All l said was...

714
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,025
That you don't think
l'm a Christian.

715
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,082
l didn't say that.

716
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,788
Daddy.
Mommy.

717
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,387
Ellie not now.
Don't interrupt.

718
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,862
(Ellie)
<i> We're back on air!</i>

719
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,768
l'm Ellie Sinclair and l'm
<i>interviewing Daddy.</i>

720
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,636
Daddy, what was your favorite
<i>thing at work today? </i>

721
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,733
(Michael) Well, l drew another
<i>Ginger Snaps cartoon.</i>

722
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,368
(Ellie) About what?

723
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,072
(Michael) Well, do you
<i>remember last week </i>

724
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,947
when you licked the ice cream
<i>and it fell on the floor? </i>

725
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,848
(Ellie) Yes.

726
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,749
ln the ice cream shop?

727
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:29,808
Yes.

728
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,787
l drew that.

729
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,584
[slap]

730
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:33,646
That was based
on you little girl.

731
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,091
Daddy and Ellie fell asleep.

732
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,822
This is the cutest thing.

733
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:42,562
[clearing throat]

734
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:44,557
[television turns off]

735
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,046
l got on the laptop today

736
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,519
and your email account
was still open.

737
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,826
l saw that you had
an email from Ray.

738
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,893
Again?

739
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,992
Why won't you
talk to him?

740
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,196
lt's complicated.

741
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,495
l thought he was
your friend.

742
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,476
Chicken's good.

743
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,070
What's Media 1 1?

744
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,706
Why are you reading
my emails?

745
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,148
l wasn't reading
your emails.

746
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,216
You shouldn't be
in my email to begin with.

747
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,148
l'm sorry.

748
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,886
l just saw those two emails
and clicked off, ok?

749
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,772
ls it a job opportunity?

750
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,670
Yes.

751
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,809
Where?

752
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,675
Connecticut.

753
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:06,706
When were you going to tell
me about us moving?

754
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,178
We're not moving.

755
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,555
l am.

756
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:25,101
What are you saying?

757
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,002
l haven't made
a decision yet.

758
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,630
They haven't even officially
offered me the job yet.

759
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:33,074
But you want it?

760
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,113
You want to leave?

761
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,172
l don't know
what l want?

762
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,845
Why haven't you talked
to me about this?

763
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,582
l'm your wife?

764
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,284
Let's not kid
ourselves.

765
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,526
What's that supposed
to mean?

766
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,823
lt means we are more like
roommates than spouses!

767
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,169
And whose fault
is that?

768
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,685
Why did you do that?

769
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,049
She was asking
for it, Heart.

770
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,850
lt's true.

771
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,323
We are more
like roommates.

772
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,752
We haven't slept in
the same room...

773
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,556
Heart.

774
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,893
There's no use
fighting it anymore.

775
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,159
Fighting what?

776
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,134
The inevitable.
lt's over.

777
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,295
Don't listen
to him Heart.

778
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,169
Shut up Conscience.

779
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,003
This is what
l warned you about.

780
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,566
Every one of us is being
motivated by fear.

781
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,804
That's ridiculous.

782
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,039
l'm not afraid
of anything.

783
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,081
You?

784
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,275
You're the one who
fears the most.

785
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,944
Oh, yeah?

786
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,216
l'm not afraid of you,
you old bag of wind.

787
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,655
You want to see
some rage?

788
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,022
Just keep it up
Lady Justice.

789
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,220
l don't know what this
has to do with anything.

790
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,024
Wait.

791
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,156
Conscience is right.

792
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,359
Mind,
it's obvious to me

793
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,125
that fear has changed
your way of thinking.

794
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,228
So how do
we fight it?

795
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,001
With perfect love.

796
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,633
What?

797
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,701
Perfect love.

798
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,680
Love that drives a wedge
between you and your wife.

799
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,342
Love that steals
your dream job.

800
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,114
Love that buries
your child.

801
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,711
Mind!

802
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,950
Do you hear what
you're saying?

803
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,219
You are the one that
taught us the truth.

804
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,851
And now you're
believing lies.

805
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,691
l've had enough!

806
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,856
l can't stand
this anymore.

807
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,231
Conscience,
one more word.

808
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,236
Silence.

809
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,101
That's the word.

810
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,333
[suspenseful music]
[fighting sounds]

811
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,765
What's gotten us
to the point

812
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,141
that we are destroying
each other.

813
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,112
We chose to follow Him.

814
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,411
And the consequences haven't
been very good, now have they?

815
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,917
Mind, remember why
we followed Him.

816
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,146
You were convinced
by the --

817
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,778
(Mind)
<i>Reason.</i>

818
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,346
lt <i>was reasonable to</i>
<i>believe the  Word of  God</i>

819
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:11,360
because the evidence could
not be explained away.

820
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,123
ln the same way
it was reasonable

821
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,961
to focus our career
on cartooning.

822
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,002
That's our skill
and interest.

823
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,094
lt was reasonable
to marry Amy.

824
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,867
She is beautiful.

825
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,307
We have a lot in common, and
from the first time we say her

826
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,504
we desired to spend
our life with her.

827
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:33,011
All of our choices have
been based on reason.

828
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,177
And so l'm
asking you Heart.

829
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,848
What is the reasonable
thing for us to do?

830
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,859
Should we continue in
an unhappy marriage?

831
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,886
Following a God who took away
everything that matters to us?

832
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,525
Or isn't it reasonable
to give Amy her freedom

833
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,531
and start over
<i>in a new place? </i>

834
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,339
When was the last time
you were in there?

835
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,876
These vines -- our old nature,
they've corrupted Mind

836
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,285
and poisoned
he rest of us.

837
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,317
You can't fight
those three alone.

838
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,418
You know that
don't you?

839
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:22,295
You've become weak
and they've become strong.

840
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,558
Their arguments
may seem persuasive

841
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,235
but there's
no truth in them.

842
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,001
Why couldn't you find
the memory of our first love?

843
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,240
lt's not where it's
supposed to be, all right?

844
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,872
How can that be?

845
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,315
Someone must
have taken it.

846
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,943
But why?

847
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,478
Those three have lost
faith in God and in you.

848
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,253
They are afraid of the future
so they've taken over.

849
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,126
Heart, finding that memory
is everything.

850
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,464
Emotion....

851
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:02,062
He has a memory orb.
l saw it.

852
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,438
Will must have
put him up to it.

853
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,533
(Memory)
<i> Will? </i>

854
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,512
l caught him coming out
of your chamber.

855
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,846
He's orchestrated
all of this.

856
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,249
You have to
get it back.

857
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,222
Conscience.
Go to Will's Domain.

858
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,884
Make sure he hasn't
taken the memory.

859
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,451
Try to talk some
sense into him.

860
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,031
l'll take care
of Emotion.

861
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,938
You come
with me.

862
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,064
Wait.

863
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,940
Remember no matter what
happens to me, don't give up.

864
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:48,451
When you find it, you must
repent and return to Him.

865
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,077
His power will
overcome them.

866
00:44:50,154 --> 00:45:00,394
[suspenseful music]

867
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,563
Will?

868
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:17,608
[crying]

869
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,155
What are you
doing here?

870
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:29,955
Uh, we've come
for the memory?

871
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,039
Are you lost,
Conscience?

872
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,273
You know
why l'm here.

873
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,371
You've come to join
forces with me.

874
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:52,540
Very funny.

875
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,675
Now give me
what l want.

876
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,344
You can't have it.

877
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,614
Why not?

878
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,417
Because l have
to hold on to this.

879
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,550
lt's all l have left.

880
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,151
You and Heart
have already lost.

881
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,025
That's not true.

882
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,222
The decision has
been made.

883
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,264
Not by all of us!

884
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,526
The majority rules.

885
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,398
l know right
from wrong.

886
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,527
And what you're
doing is wrong.

887
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,969
But it's not as black
and white as you think.

888
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,509
Don't make me
take it from you.

889
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,240

Stop it!

896
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,245
You leave him
alone right now.

897

Don't do this!
Will, stop!

902
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,206

things our way.

You must
believe that.

What should l do?

948
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,256
(Mind)
Choose reason.

949
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,464
Should we continue in
an unhappy marriage.

950
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,022
Following a God --

951
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,394
Who took away everything
that matters to us.

952
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:20,034

to give Amy her freedom.

953
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,299

l'm just concerned
about your faith.

966
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,849
Why don't you
believe me? Ok?

967
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:46,021
l told you l believe
in Jesus.

(Michael)
<i> l know.</i>

969
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,394
But the Jesus you believe
in doesn't exist.

(Ellie) Mommy, l want
you to read this!

Ellie, sit down!

There's a cab
in front of the house.

Where are
you going?

978
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,806
l thought you'd left.

979
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,047
You got the job.

980
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,027
Were you just going to
leave without telling me?

981
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:57,800
Michael, look at me.

982
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,105
Don't you think we should
have discussed this first?

983
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,106
This affects me too --

984
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,643
l don't have time
to talk right now.

985
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,178
l've got to catch
a plane.

986
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,110
l'll call you
from Connecticut.

987
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,580
What are you saying,
Michael?

988
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,516
Michael,
what about me?

989
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,745
What about us?

990
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,809
We'll talk
about it later.

991
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,048
No, you are going
to tell me right now!

992
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,459
l'm setting
you free.

993
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,087
What does
that mean?

994
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,756
You could have
studied in Paris.

995
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,596
You could have
had a career

996
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,693
but you sacrificed all
that to be my wife.

997
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,566
That's ridiculous!

998
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,128
l don't have to go
to Paris to paint!

999
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:38,605
l became a teacher.

1000
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:39,573
That was my choice!

1001
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,168
How dare you decide
what is best for my life!

1002
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,110
Would you just
look at us Amy!

1003
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,738
Look at us!

1004
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:49,012
We can't talk without it
turning into a battle.

1005
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,017
So it's my fault.

1006
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,146
No, it's my fault.

1007
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,724
l just thought our lives would
be different, you know?

1008
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,759
l prayed and prayed
and l thought that things

1009
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:09,134
would get better but it's been
a year and nothing has changed.

1010
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,172
l want us to be
happy again...

1011
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,143
You mean l don't
make you happy.

1012
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,678
l didn't say that.

1013
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,611
l'm sorry if l don't
please you anymore.

1014
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,781
So you are
giving up.

1015
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,981
That's it?

1016
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:27,921
Amy.

1017
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,982
What?

1018
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,584
You don't
understand do you?

1019
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,653
What, because l don't go
to church with you

1020
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,823
or because we don't
talk anymore--

1021
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,866
That's not
the main reason --

1022
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,025
What is
the main reason?

1023
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,033
Tell me Michael!

1024
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,228
lt's guilt!

1025
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,966
Guilt, Amy.

1026
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,880
l can't do
this anymore.

1027
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:00,946
When l look at you,
l see Ellie.

1028
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,016
And l'm reminded
of what l did,

1029
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,562
and l know that you
blame me for what happened --

1030
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:07,789
l never said
l blame you --

1031
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,731
l blame myself!

1032
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,931
What?
What do you mean?

1033
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,031
lf l would have just
stopped arguing with you.

1034
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,135
lf l hadn't been following
that truck so closely.

1035
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,839
lf l would just have been paying
more attention to the road.

1036
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,780
lf l would have just let Ellie
give you that book!

1037
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,317
She wouldn't have
unbuckled her seatbelt.

1038
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,882
That stupid book.

1039
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,631
l play it over and over again
in my head a thousand times

1040
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,932
and every time l come
to the same conclusion.

1041
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,700
l caused the death
of our daughter.

1042
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:56,076
Stop...Stop.

1043
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,119
l'm so sorry.

1044
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,850
l'm sorry.

1045
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,050
Michael.

1046
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,720
Michael,
don't do this.

1047
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,061
Don't give up
on me.

1048
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,327
Don't give up
on us.

1049
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,068
We used to be happy.

1050
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,939
Do you remember that?

1051
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,743
All that changed when l started
pushing my faith on you.

1052
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,086
l made a mistake.

1053
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,355
And some mistakes you
never stop paying for.

1054
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:56,929
l got to go.

1055
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,175
No! No!

1056
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:06,011
Michael!

(Ray) <i> Where is Ellie</i>

1059
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,825
Heaven.

1060
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,125
Do you believe that?

1061
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,903
When is God
most glorified?

1062
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:34,433
When things are easy
or when things become hard?

1063
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,445
And through the deepest
grief and agony

1064
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,481
we find the supernatural
strength to say,

1065
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:42,912
''God is all l need.''

1066
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,112
God is my life.

He's who l live for.

1068
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,785

Him Mind.

1245
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,503
You need
to remember.

1246

trying to do Heart.

1247
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:07,253
lt's not
going to work.

1248
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,791
You can't
hide it forever.

1249
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,695
lt's mine now.

1250
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,788
You'll never
get it from me.

1251
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,730
lt never belonged
to you.

1252
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,133

researched the gospel.

1253
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:24,730

was convinced.

made the decision.

Don't tell me that
it doesn't belong to me.

1256
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,778
Simply knowing Jesus died
on a cross is not enough.

1257
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,285
There's one thing you lack and
this is why you have doubts now.

1258

This is what concerned
us about Amy.

1259
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,621
The memory you're
holding is not yours

1260
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,784

our first love

of historical facts.

1262

All of us
were involved.

But this decision was
not yours to make.

1264
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,202
Because this decision
was a matter --

1265
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,929

1285
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,893
You have a Heavenly Father
who loves you,

1286
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:37,370
and He proved it by sending His
son to die for you.

<i>in a court of  law.</i>

1293

The judge just found you guilty
and fined you a billion dollars.

Now look, before you
go off to prison,

1295
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:08,833

and pays your fine.

1296

is accept the payment...

charges are dismissed.

1298
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:16,039
But if you don't
accept this gift,

1299
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,807
you will suffer
the judgment.

1300
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,815
How do you
receive this gift?

1301
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:27,186
By faith, you must repent
and ask Jesus to save you.

1302
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,280
So that's it?

1303
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,257
lt's just a prayer?

1304
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,385
No, salvation
is not a prayer.

1413
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:45,573
Can l borrow that?

1414
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,116
''She went on a trip to see
<i>what she could find</i>

1415
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:06,847
and her little baby lamb
<i>followed her close behind.''</i>

1416
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,821
That's like you
<i>and me, Mommy.</i>

1417
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,120
You're the mommy sheep
<i>and l'm the baby lamb.</i>

1418
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:22,198
''But one sheep loved the
<i>world and just wanted to play.</i>

1419
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,597
'' So she stopped following
<i>the good Shepherd</i>

1420
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,105
and just wandered away. ''

1421
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,035
He always put me first.

1422
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,638
Why don't you come to
church with me and Daddy?

1423
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:41,087
Oh... Remember Ellie,
we've talked about this.

1424
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,555
Sundays are my day
to get my work done

1425
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,561
so that when you come home
we can play together.

1426
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:50,223
Ok.

1427
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:59,802
''The lamb's mother
<i>bowed her head and cried.</i>

1428
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,205
''She was sorry for
<i>not staying close</i>

1429
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,744
to the good
<i>Shepherd's side.''</i>

1430
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,541
Ellie, when you do
<i>something wrong,</i>

1431
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:08,548
you should always say
<i>that ''you're sorry.''</i>

1432
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:09,913
Ok?

1433
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,815
Daddy said
<i>that's called sin,</i>

1434
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,049
so l told Jesus that l was
<i>sorry for my sins.</i>

1435
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,613
Have you done
<i>that Mommy? </i>

ln the past
<i> year and a half,</i>

1449
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:18,072
l've experienced the
<i>darkest hours of my life.</i>

1450
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:23,914
l searched for answers
<i>but found only questions.</i>

1451
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:27,079
l concluded that the Creator
<i>of this universe</i>

1452
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:28,179
was at war with me.

1453
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:36,820
That is, until recently.

1454
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:41,767
l realize now that l was
<i>only at war with myself.</i>

1455
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:45,203
And as a result, l ended up
<i>hurting the one's</i>

1456

l loved the most.

1457
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:50,876
At the moment that l was
<i>throwing in the towel,</i>

1458
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:56,906
this same Creator that
<i> l'd been at odds with</i>

1459
01:30:56,984 --> 01:31:01,011
sent me my friend, Ray.

1460
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:08,256
Ray did what he's always done,;
<i>speak truth into my life.</i>

1461
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:14,268
That <i>truth... that this</i>
<i>is not our home.</i>

1462
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:24,870
That this Creator, my Savior
<i>and Lord is everything.</i>

1463
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:28,848
Ray taught me so many things
<i>about living and dying,</i>

1464
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:34,081
and l know that right now my
<i>little girl and my Savior</i>

1465
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:41,721
are making Ray feel welcome
<i>because he is finally home.</i>
