00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,067

00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,967
 <i>( distant siren )</i>

3
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,767
- LATTE AND MOCHA.
- THANK YOU.

4
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,500
Woman:
 <i>THANKS.</i>

5
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,434
 <i>( printer whirring )</i>

6
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,167
- Man: <i>VINCENT'S MERGER'S DEAD.</i>
- Woman: <i>DON'T WORRY</i>
ABOUT IT, L.

7
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,001
 <i>YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE</i>
 <i>IN SIX MONTHS.</i>

8
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,767
THE "UNTIL" JOB.

9
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,001
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
WORKING HERE, BEN?

10
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,834
EIGHT YEARS.

11
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,001
Woman: <i>JESUS.</i>

12
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,967
I KNOW.
PRETTY PATHETIC.

13
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,234
AT LEAST I DON'T DELUDE MYSELF
WITH HOPES AND DREAMS.

14
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:19,834
HE'S AGAINST
HOPES AND DREAMS.

15
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,600
HE'S THE ANTI-EVERYTHING
DUDE.

16
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
THE ANTICHRIST.

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,001
YOU THINK GETTING A JOB
IN A TV SERIES IS GOING
TO CHANGE ANYTHING?

18
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,900
IN THREE DAYS,
YOU'LL REALIZE IT'S
JUST THE SAME OLD CRAP

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,734
IN A NEW PACKAGE--
YOU'LL STILL BE WORKING
FOR THE MAN,

20
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,734
SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE.

21
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,167
Woman:
 <i>THE MAN?</i>
 <i>WHO'S THE MAN?</i>

22
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:41,700
L:
 <i>YOU KNOW-- SOCIETY,</i>
 <i>THE ESTABLISHMENT,</i>

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,633
 <i>THE CORPORATE</i>
 <i>SUPER-ORGANISM.</i>

24
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,567
- <i>( all laughing )</i>
- Woman: <i>OH, HIM.</i>

25
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,401
YOU'RE ONE DARK DUDE, MAN.

26
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:54,134
( knocks )

27
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,667
- <i>( sports on TV )</i>
- HE'S HERE.

28
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,867
HI, DAD.

29
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:12,267
SO WHAT'S NEW
IN SCHOOL?

30
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,067
I DON'T KNOW.

31
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,401
MATH AND STUFF.

32
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:20,201
 <i>A GURU FROM AN ASHRAM</i>
 <i>IN INDIA CAME TO VISIT US</i>

33
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,734
 <i>IN SOCIAL STUDIES.</i>

34
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:25,633
HE COULD REMEMBER
TWO OF HIS PAST LIVES.

35
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,101
 <i>THAT KID RECOGNIZES YOU.</i>

36
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:34,267
PROBABLY FROM ONE
OF YOUR C.D.s.

37
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,301
WHAT WERE
HIS PAST LIVES?

38
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,934
IN ONE
HE WAS A PRINCE.

39
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:42,700
IN THE OTHER
HE WAS A SLAVE
LEADING A REBELLION.

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,900
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH REINCARNATION--

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,201
EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS
A PRINCE OR A WARRIOR.

42
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,401
 <i>NOBODY WAS EVER</i>
 <i>A MUSEUM GUARD,</i>

43
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,034
A PARAMECIUM
OR A BED OF MOSS.

44
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,567
PEOPLE WANT TO THINK
THEY WERE SPECIAL, I GUESS.

45
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,468
 <i>YEAH, WELL,</i>
 <i>THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU.</i>

46
00:03:57,468 --> 00:04:00,401
THEY FIGURE IF THEY CAN
FILL YOU UP WITH THAT
PIE-IN-THE-SKY STUFF,

47
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,867
MAYBE YOU WON'T NOTICE
HOW MUCH CRAP YOU'VE EATEN
IN YOUR OWN LIFETIME.

48
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,533
READY?

49
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,600
I THINK
I'M A LESBIAN.

50
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,101
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU
LIKE HOCKEY?

51
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,167
I LIKE BOYS, BUT...

52
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,067
NOT TO KISS. I LIKE
HANGING OUT WITH THEM.

53
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,434
OH. I WOULDN'T JUMP
TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.

54
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:28,067
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN REACHED
PUBERTY YET.

55
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,967
YOU'RE PROGRAMMED
FROM BIRTH.

56
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,867
THEY HAVE STUDIES.

57
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:38,101
SO...

58
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,934
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YOU WANNA GO ICE SKATING?

59
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,334
DAD, I LIKE
WATCHING HOCKEY.

60
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:46,267
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO SKATE.

61
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,334
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO McRORY'S?

62
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:51,134
 <i>SURE.</i>

63
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,468
Man:
 <i>VERY GOOD.</i>
 <i>NICE-- NICE GUITAR.</i>

64
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,034
- Ben: <i>MM-HMM.</i>
- HEY, BEN, THIS JUST CAME IN.

65
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,967
BRAZILIAN.

66
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,368
SO FINE IT ALMOST
PLAYS ITSELF.

67
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:11,600
( strumming )

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,533
YOU WANT TO PLAY IT?
GO AHEAD.

69
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,167
JIM AND SWEENY ARE
IN THE BACK.

70
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,167
DO YOU MIND?
JUST FOR A MINUTE?

71
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,468
- ( strumming )
- MAESTRO!

72
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,500
ALL RIGHT. I SEE
YOU GOT THE BRAZILIAN.

73
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,034
SWEET.

74
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,500
IT'S A SHAME.

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,034
WHAT IS?

76
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:13,001
TO BE SO GREAT AT SOMETHING
NO ONE CARES ABOUT.

77
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,301
I THINK I WANT TO SLEEP
IN MY OWN ROOM TONIGHT.

78
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:37,600
IBOU SNORES TOO LOUD

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
AND I HAVE
A BIO QUIZ TOMORROW.

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,633
OH.

81
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,867
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

82
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:49,800
SHE WANTED TO COME HOME,
THAT'S ALL.

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,934
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

84
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,368
HEY, SWEETIE.

85
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:58,867
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, BEN,

86
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:02,500
SHE'S 11 YEARS OLD.
SHE STILL WANTS TO THINK
THE WORLD IS A NICE PLACE.

87
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,434
HEY.

88
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,567
SHE WANTS ME TO FEED HER 
THAT POSITIVE-THINK CRAP.

89
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:17,034
WE JUST EXITED THE BLOODIEST
CENTURY IN THE HISTORY
OF CIVILIZATION.

90
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:21,234
WE GOT TERRORISM,
ATOMIC BOMBS,

91
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:24,401
GENOCIDE OF
MYTHIC PROPORTIONS.

92
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,767
AND WHAT HAVE ALL
THESE HORRORS PRODUCED

93
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,767
AS WE GO INTO
THE NEW MILLENNIUM?

94
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,234
POSITIVE FUCKING THINKING.

95
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:32,734
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT?

96
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,934
IT'S ABOUT GRABBING
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN 

97
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,067
WITH YOUR GREEDY
LITTLE FINGERS.

98
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,034
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL WITH HER?

99
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,201
TAKE HER TO A HOCKEY GAME
OR SOMETHING.

100
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:46,934
THE ONLY CRIME LEFT IN
THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD
IS NEGATIVITY.

101
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,034
NEGATIVITY IS TREASON.

102
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,700
THEY EVEN HAVE
A PILL FOR IT.

103
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,434
IT IS A WORLD IN WHICH
THE MAN IS THE PRESIDING
AUTHORITY, HUH?

104
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,734
THE TWO WORST INVENTIONS
IN THE PAST 20 YEARS--

105
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,368
THE TV REMOTE
AND POSITIVE THINKING.

106
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:07,633
YOU KNOW, I-- I HEAR
SOMETHING ON THE RADIO TODAY.

107
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:10,067
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

108
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,900
IT WAS ABOUT
THIS GAME THEORY.

109
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,934
THEY SAY IF A MAN ACTS
IN HIS OWN INTERESTS,

110
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,667
THAT HE WOULD ACT IN A WAY
THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO
THOSE AROUND HIM--

111
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,967
IF HE ACTS INTELLIGENTLY.

112
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,468
BIG "IF."

113
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:26,301
( laughs )

114
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:29,001
I DON'T KNOW.
SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET

115
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,301
TO READ A LITTLE MORE
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

116
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,734
AND THE CAKE IS--

117
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:36,001
HOW YOU SAY?
--MUTUAL GAME THEORY.

118
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,867
THEY SAY, YOU KNOW,

119
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,468
THE GAME THEORY BETWEEN
TWO FRIENDS,

120
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:46,134
LIKE EACH ONE WANTING
WHAT IS BEST FOR THE OTHER.

121
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,301
MMM.

122
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:57,201
NO FRET, NO FRET.
GLUCOSE SPIKE, YEAH?

123
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:00,600
( grunts )

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,301
LIKE YOU ARE
MY FRIEND, RIGHT?

125
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,201
SO THAT WHICH YOU WANT,
I WANT FOR YOU.

126
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:09,567
I GO OUT OF MY WAY
FOR YOU, BEN.

127
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,167
I WOULD DO IT HAPPILY
BECAUSE I KNOW

128
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:16,001
YOU WOULD DO THE SAME.

129
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:19,401
GREAT THINGS CAN COME
FROM THIS GAME THEORY--

130
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,533
 <i>GREAT THINGS.</i>

131
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,834
 <i>YOU KNOW,</i>
 <i>THE WOLOFS BACK</i>
 <i>IN SENEGAL,</i>

132
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:28,900
WE DON'T SAY,
"THAT MAN HAS THIS"

133
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,633
OR "THIS MAN HAS THAT."

134
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,834
THAT IS WHY STILL MAGIC 
EXISTS IN SENEGAL, YEAH?

135
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,834
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC IS THAT?

136
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,900
WHEN IT RAINS, THE FISH,

137
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,334
THEY FALL FROM THE SKY.

138
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,600
 <i>THIS HAPPENS</i>
 <i>BECAUSE WE BELIEVE.</i>

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,633
IT IS LIKE-- LIKE A FORM
OF GAME THEORY, I THINK.

140
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,201
THERE'S AN OLD WOLOF SAYING:

141
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,600
( speaks Wolof )

142
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,201
"YOUR THOUGHTS ARE THINGS."

143
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,401
 <i>AND YOU'VE SEEN THIS?</i>

144
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,434
YOU'VE SEEN FISH
FALL FROM THE SKY?

145
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,867
WITH MY OWN EYES.

146
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,167
THE FISH, THEY FLAP
ABOUT IN THE GRASS,

147
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,567
TRYING TO GET BACK
IN THE STREAM.

148
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,834
I TOLD MY SISTER
ABOUT IT IN A LETTER.

149
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,633
SHE HAS SEEN IT TOO,
YOU KNOW.

150
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,867
CHECK MATE.

151
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:33,267
EVERY TIME WE PLAY,
YOU GET ME INTO ONE
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS.

152
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,533
IT'S A GODDAMN DECOY.

153
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,301
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK AT
THE WORLD AS YOUR FRIEND.

154
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:40,401
YEAH,

155
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:42,734
AS SOON AS I SEE FISH
FALL FROM THE SKY.

156
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,201
YOUR--

157
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,067
YOUR CAR IS SUPPOSED TO BE
FLUSH WITH THE POLE.

158
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,134
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
SINCE I MOVED IN.

159
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,167
IT TAKES ME FIVE SWINGS
TO GET OUT OF MY SPOT.

160
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,101
WHAT DO YOU DO?
COME OUT HERE WITH A RULER?

161
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,334
BOTTOM LINE--
YOUR CAR IS ILLEGAL.

162
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:04,800
 <i>I'M TRYING TO BE CIVIL</i>
 <i>ABOUT THIS, DUDE, YOU KNOW?</i>

163
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,001
 <i>I COULD JUST CALL THE POLICE</i>
 <i>AND HAVE YOUR CAR TOWED.</i>

164
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,800
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?
YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,633
YOU THINK YOU'RE
NEW TO THE EARTH,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

166
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,667
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR,
LIKE, 10,000 YEARS.

167
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,468
YOU WERE IN THE BIBLE.
YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.

168
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,600
YOU'RE LIKE AN INSECT.

169
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,567
AND WHEN THE NUCLEAR
HOLOCAUST COMES,

170

 <i>THERE MUST BE NO LIGHT</i>
 <i>EXCEPT FOR THE VOTIVE CANDLES.</i>

502
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:01,734
IT IS...
( speaks Wolof ),

503
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:05,867
WOLOF RITUAL,
TO MAKE HIM GET BETTER.

504
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,667
YOU HELP, NO?

505
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:19,201
OH. NO, I'LL PASS.
THANKS.

506
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,533
COME HERE, BEN.

507
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,134
SERIOUSLY,
YOU DON'T WANT ME.

508
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,301
I'LL SEND BAD VIBES
OR SOMETHING.

509
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:29,533
PLEASE,
IT IS BETTER WITH TWO.

510
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:36,967
IN WOLOF, WE HAVE SAYING:
( speaks Wolof )

511
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,600
"THOUGHTS ARE THINGS."

512
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,767
THIS SUBSTANCE
IS MY BROTHER 

513
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:45,567
WHO WE ARE LONGING
TO GET BETTER.

514
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:51,633
WE ASK HIS ANCESTORS
WHO ARE HERE

515
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,401
TO THINK THESE SAME
HEALING THOUGHTS.

516
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:59,067
IT HAS NO WEIGHT,
A THOUGHT-- NO CHARGE,

517
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:03,700
NO PROPERTIES.
THOUGHTS DO NOT EXIST,

518
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,967
NOT THE WAY
A CHAIR EXISTS.

519
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:10,800
THEY CANNOT DIE.
WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER
OF OUR ANCESTORS

520
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,500
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THEIR THOUGHTS AND
FEELINGS ARE FOREVER.

521
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,201
IT IS SALT WATER
FROM THE OCEAN.

522
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:31,234
IT IS NOW
A QUIET WAVE...

523
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:33,468
LIKE HIM.

524
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:38,001
MOVE YOUR FINGERS
THROUGH THE WATER.

525
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:44,533
DO IT LIKE IT IS
A LIVING THING.

526
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,500
BUT IT'S--
IT'S SEA WATER.

527
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,001
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE
IN MAGIC, NO?

528
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:54,434
BUT MAGIC IS EVERYWHERE.

529
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:56,900
FEELINGS ARE
MAGIC, NO?

530
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,800
THE FEELINGS
PEOPLE HAVE;

531
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,700
WHAT A FEELING CAN DO
TO ANOTHER PERSON--

532
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,633
IT IS LIKE
CHEMICAL REACTION.

533
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:11,368
PUT YOUR EYES HERE.

534
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,468
WE BOTH LOVE HIM.

535
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:15,867
LET THE FEELINGS TALK.

536
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,734
WAIT. PLEASE.

537
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:36,301
WE LEAVE NOW.
YOU MUST NOT LOOK BEHIND.

538
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,401
IF YOU LOOK BEHIND,
HE WILL NOT GET BETTER.

539
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,500
I'M SORRY.

540
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,201
I DON'T KNOW WHY I--

541
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:29,167
HMM.
MY FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

542
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,468
IBOU WALKED ME.

543
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:36,334
HE ALWAYS HELD A BIG STICK
TO PROTECT ME FROM SNAKES.

544
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:39,001
I WAS NOT AFRAID
OF SNAKES,

545
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,533
BUT I NEVER TOLD HIM.

546
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,767
YOU WERE CLOSE.

547
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,834
 <i>THAT IS FATOU,</i>
 <i>MY MOTHER.</i>

548
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,301
AFTER MY FATHER LEFT,
IBOU BECAME OUR PRINCE.

549
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:58,134
HE COULD DO NO WRONG.

550
00:42:58,134 --> 00:43:02,334
SHE SAVE FOR HIM TO
GO TO U.S. FOR A BETTER LIFE.

551
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:04,867
IT IS ALL SHE THOUGHT ABOUT.

552
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:09,434
AFTER HE LEFT, SHE WAS
FEELING TERRIBLE GRIEF,

553
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:13,267
AND THEN THERE
WAS NOTHING LEFT.

554
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:16,934
I CAN COUNT THE NUMBER
OF TIMES I WAS KISSED.

555
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:21,567
ONCE WHEN I TURNED NINE,
AND THE OTHER WHEN I TURNED 10.

556
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:25,334
I FELT A SPOT
ON MY CHEEK FOR DAYS,
AND IT MADE ME SAD,

557
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,368
TRAGICALLY SAD.

558
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:30,700
MMM. I WAS A VERY TRAGIC
LITTLE GIRL

559
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,167
WALKING AROUND
WITH MY UNKISSED FACE.

560
00:43:42,468 --> 00:43:45,500
 <i>( dog barking )</i>

561
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,967
 <i>( pan sizzling )</i>

562
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:03,633
EXCUSE ME.

563
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:06,700
CAN YOU DRIVE ME, PLEASE,

564
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,667
TO THE HOSPITAL?

565
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,900
 <i>( pager buzzes )</i>

566
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,101
JESUS.

567

( buzzing )

568
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,934
I HEARD YOU 
THE FIRST TIME.

569
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:44,101
AND YOU FIGURE
WHAT'S THE HURRY, RIGHT?

570
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,700
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE HURRY
IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT?

571
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,867
Man:
 <i>HOW CAN I HELP YOU?</i>

572
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:51,101
Ben: <i>HOW LONG HAS</i>
 <i>IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE</i>
 <i>CHANGED HIS SHEETS?</i>

573
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:54,001
WHAT DO YOU FIGURE,
"SKIP THE VEGETABLE"?
IS THAT IT?

574
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:56,301
Man: <i>I'LL--</i>
 <i>I'LL GET NEW BEDDING.</i>

575
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,734
OH, THANKS.
TERRIFIC.

576
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:06,533
I'M GETTING A SANDWICH.
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

577
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:09,468
 <i>OH, NO--</i>
 <i>NO THANK YOU.</i>

578
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:12,533
BEN?

579
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:16,468
- I, UH--
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

580
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:42,401
 <i>( objects scraping )</i>

581
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,900
- ( speaks Wolof )
- YEAH, I KNOW.

582
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,900
"THOUGHTS ARE THINGS."

583
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,101
 <i>ARE YOU ONE</i>
 <i>OF THOSE THINGS?</i>

584
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:06,067
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE IN MY DREAMS?

585
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:08,201
IT'S ALL ABOUT
EXPECTATIONS. 

586
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:10,201
SHE NEVER TOLD YOU
TO BACK OFF.

587
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,434
IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS.

588
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,900
HOW MUCH OF YOUR LIFE
IS YOUR FAULT

589
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,034
AND HOW MUCH
IS THE WORLD'S?

590
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:20,734
THAT IS YOUR
BIG QUESTION.

591
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:22,600
YOU HAVE NO CAREER,

592
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,401
YOU'VE BEEN FIRED
FROM YOUR JOB,

593
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:26,734
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER
WON'T SPEAK TO YOU.

594
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:30,134
BOTTOM LINE-- YOU CAN'T
EVEN EARN A LIVING.

595
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:34,234
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
FOR YOU, ISN'T IT? MONEY.

596
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,700
LET'S TAKE MONEY
OUT OF THE EQUATION.

597
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,001
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE IT
TO BE ALL ABOUT?

598
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,067
HEY, THERE HE IS.

599
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,134
HEY, I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

600
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,600
COME OVER HERE.

601
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,234
SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY?

602
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:54,667
CASSIE GOT
A GIG ON A SHOW.

603
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:02,434
SO I FOUND THAT WHILE
I WAS GOING THROUGH
MY KIDS' OLD C.D.s.

604
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:09,334
( laughs )
YOU'RE OUTTED, BRO.

605
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:11,567
I-- I GOOGLED YOU.

606
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:14,401
YOU WERE THE THIRD-BIGGEST
KIDDIE SINGER IN THE COUNTRY.

607
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:17,234
YOU PLAYED
THE PASADENA CIVIC CENTER.

608
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,167
GOD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

609
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:22,567
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU BACK
ON THAT KIDDIE GRAVY TRAIN.

610
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,734
ALL RIGHT,
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

611
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:27,767
"WHY ME?"
WELL, I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

612
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:30,401
UH, BECAUSE...

613
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:33,434
I HAVE NO TALENT. NONE.

614
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:37,468
ZIP. I USED TO COPY
OTHER KIDS' DRAWINGS
IN ART CLASS.

615
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:40,267
I'M NOT KIDDING--
I CHEATED IN ART.

616
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:44,334
SO THIS IS
AN EGO-FREE ZONE.

617
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,267
WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS?

618
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,034
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

619
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:52,434
IF I WANTED A PARASITE,
I'D EAT RAW PORK.

620
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:56,434
WHAT?WAIT.

621
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,934
YOU'RE BEATING YOUR HANDS
AGAINST A BOULDER.

622
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:16,500
( ringing )

623
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,368
HEY.

624
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:21,334
- WHERE'S SANDRA?
- SHE'S AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE.

625
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,234
THEY'RE DOING
A BOOK REPORT TOGETHER.

626
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,067
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU.

629
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,667
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

630
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:55,600
SHE'S AT
HER FRIEND'S HOUSE.

631
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,834
BEN.

632
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,600
- SANDRA?
- <i>BEN.</i>

633
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,167
- SANDRA!
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

634
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,767
NO, EVAN, I CAN
HANDLE THIS.

635
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,667
- LET ME HANDLE IT, OKAY?
- YEAH. OKAY, EVAN?

636
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,700
GO BACK TO THE DEN
WITH YOUR TOOLBOX.

637
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,934
- <i>I'VE GOT IT.</i>
- SANDRA?

638
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,567
THAT WASN'T VERY NICE.

639
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:12,401
WELL, I THINK THE DIRECTOR
OF ACQUISITIVENESS CAN TAKE IT.

640
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,468
DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITIONS.

641
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:17,800
DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITIONS,
VICE PRESIDENT OF GREED--
WHATEVER.

642
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,034
- YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS.
- <i>BEN, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE</i>

643
00:49:21,034 --> 00:49:24,800
- <i>OR I AM CALLING THE POLICE.</i>
- I HAVE A RIGHT TO
SEE MY DAUGHTER.

644
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,368
YOU CAN'T KEEP HER LOCKED UP
HERE LIKE A PRISONER.

645
00:49:27,368 --> 00:49:29,234
LIKE A PRISONER?

646
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:33,734
BEN, SHE IS THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

647
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:37,134
 <i>YOU-- YOU WANT</i>
 <i>TO KNOW WHY?</i>

648
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:39,934
BECAUSE YOU
MAKE HER FEEL BAD.

649
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:42,900
YOU KNOW, YOU POISON
THE AIR AROUND HER

650
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,667
WITH ALL OF YOUR COMPLAINING.
AND HAVE YOU EVER EVER

651
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:50,234
ASKED HER ONE QUESTION
ABOUT HERSELF?

652
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:54,500
I MEAN,
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE

653
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,067
THAT YOUR OWN DAUGHTER
IS HURTING.

654
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,600
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

655
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,633
SHE'S CONFUSED.

SO DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO McRORY'S?

659
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,767
NO, LET'S GO ICE SKATING.

660

DAD, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SKATE.

661
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:22,301
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU LEARNED.

662
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:28,267
DAD, I THINK
THE NEEDLE'S ON EMPTY.

663
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:32,267
OH.THAT MEANS
THERE'S A HALF GALLON
LEFT IN THE TANK.

664
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:35,334
THEY JUST DO THAT
SO YOU'LL BUY MORE
THAN YOU NEED.

665
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,667
IT'S A CONSPIRACY BETWEEN
THE CAR COMPANIES

666
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,600
AND THE OIL COMPANIES.

667
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,134
WHAT KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD
DOESN'T HAVE A GAS STATION?

I GUESS.

669
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:55,234
I'M SORRY.

670
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:59,134
I REALLY WANTED YOU TO
HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.

671
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:01,201
IT'S OKAY, DAD.

672
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:04,301
IT'S AN ADVENTURE...

673
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:05,934
SORT OF.

674
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,401

675
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,900
GOD DAMN IT.

( humming )

677
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,034
OKAY, NOW MOVE
THE POT SIDEWAYS.

678
00:51:29,034 --> 00:51:32,201
YES, AND THEN 
THE OTHER SIDE.

679
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:35,001
YES, LIKE THAT.
MMM.

680
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:42,600
WHAT DO YOU DO IN DAKAR?

681
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,067
I, UH--
I WORK IN HOTEL.

682
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:51,867

ETHNOCENTRIC OR ANYTHING,

685
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,134
MY LIFE IS ONE
OF MISERY AND PAIN.

686
00:52:00,134 --> 00:52:02,101
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

687
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,434
- I'M SORRY.
- ( laughs )

688
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:07,633
I WAS BEING SHALLOW
AND STUPID.

689
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:10,468
I WAS BEING A TOTAL
ASSHOLE AMERICAN.

690
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:12,533
MY COUNTRY IS VERY
DIFFERENT FROM YOURS,

691
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,867
BUT WE HAVE FUN TOO.

692
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,533
THERE ARE CLUBS,
WE HAVE MUSIC.

693
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,134
WE LISTEN
TO A LOT OF MUSIC.

694
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:21,301
WE SENEGALESE

698
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,301

A SPECIAL RING IN HELL

699

THE AIR MATTRESS.

700

 <i>I KNOW.</i>
 <i>IT'S GENETIC.</i>

704

SELF-CONSCIOUS.

705
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,934
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

706
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,101
OKAY.

707

THAT WAS FUN.

716
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:10,234

--YOUR MISTRESS.

723
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,234
THERE IS NO TIME
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

724
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:56,234
I HAVE TWO WEEKS LEFT
ON MY VISA.

725
00:56:56,234 --> 00:56:59,368
TO STAY HERE,
I WOULD NEED GREEN CARD.

726
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:03,934
BUT YOU-- WE DO NOT
KNOW EACH OTHER ENOUGH.

727
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:07,101
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

728
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:09,167
WE ARE LIKE
DIFFERENT SPECIES.

729
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:12,567
WE ARE LIKE LION AND
HIPPO TRYING TO MATE.

730
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:15,434
WHICH ONE IS THE HIPPO?

731
00:57:15,434 --> 00:57:17,034
YOU.

732
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,867
DO I LOOK
LIKE A HIPPO?

733
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:23,900
SO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY HOPE FOR US AT ALL?

734
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,434
NONE...

735
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,633
- MMM?
- ...WHATSOEVER.

736
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,167
I AM BAD.

737
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:35,267

AND I MUST HAVE IT.

738
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:37,267
I AM GREEDY.

739
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,301
THERE'S NOTHING BAD
ABOUT YOU.

740
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:42,967
YOU DO NOT KNOW
EVERY PART OF ME.

741
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,800
WHAT PART DON'T I KNOW?

742
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:49,567

743
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,201

744
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:58,101
AND HERE.

745
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,234
I KNOW IT A LITTLE.

746
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:03,034
GET TO KNOW IT BETTER.

747
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:22,500
HOW COME
YOU QUIT SINGING
FOR CHILDREN, BEN?

748
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,600
THE RECORD COMPANY SAID

749
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,667
THAT THEY'D PRODUCE
AN ACOUSTIC SOLO ALBUM

750
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:30,167
IF I WENT ON
A NATIONAL CHILDREN'S TOUR.

751
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,001
AND THE RECORD COMPANY
WENT BACK ON ITS WORD?

752
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:35,667
 <i>NO, THEY PRODUCED IT,</i>
 <i>BUT THEY DUMPED IT.</i>

753
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,967
THEY DIDN'T PROMOTE IT.

754
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:40,967
THEY DIDN'T ADVERTISE.

755
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,468
THEY SAID IT
WASN'T ACCESSIBLE.

756
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:46,167
BOTTOM LINE.

757
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,401
YEAH.
BOTTOM LINE.

758
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:55,134
YOU HAVE C.D.?

759
00:58:55,134 --> 00:58:58,967
THE ONE THE RECORD COMPANY
DID NOT WANT TO PROMOTE?

760
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:00,967
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THAT.

761
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,967
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT.

762
00:59:18,533 --> 00:59:21,834
YOU'RE PROBABLY
ONE OF 10 PEOPLE 
WHO'S HEARD THIS.

763
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:29,633
 <i>( guitar music playing )</i>

764
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,900
I SEE WHY
YOU GOT ANGRY.

765
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:52,001
IT IS MAYBE TOO QUIET

 <i>BE SEATED.</i>

770
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:34,468
YOU GUYS MULTIPLY
LIKE AMOEBAS.

771
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:37,633
HOW COULD THE TOW-TRUCK
DRIVER KNOW

772
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,134
THAT TOWING MR. SINGER'S CAR
WOULD LEAD TO MR. NIDIA'S-- 

773
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:41,900
N'DIYAE.

774
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,468
--MR. N'DIYAE GOING INTO
A DIABETIC COMA?

775
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:47,301
I MEAN, IS HE A DOCTOR?

776
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:49,567
IS HE A TRAINED NURSE?

777
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:53,001
THE FACT IS, BEN SINGER
WAS PARKED ILLEGALLY

778
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:56,101
 <i>AND THE TOW-TRUCK DRIVER</i>
 <i>SIMPLY DID HIS JOB.</i>

779
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:59,867
YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.

780
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:06,234
I KNOW I'M JUST A--
A JOKE TO YOU,

781
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:09,567
AND YOU ONLY DECIDED TO
HEAR MY CASE BECAUSE
YOU WERE AMUSED.

782
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:13,734
SOME CRACKPOT ACTING
AS HIS OWN ATTORNEY 

783
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:16,468
ACCUSING THE CITY
OF DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE.

784
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:20,500
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MOST CROWDED ROOM IS
IN THE GETTY MUSEUM?

785
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,767
IT'S THE ROOM WITH
VAN GOGH'S "IRISES."

786
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:28,633
WHY? BECAUSE SOMEONE BOUGHT 
THE PAINTING FOR $54 MILLION.

787
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:32,867
THERE'S A REVERENTIAL SILENCE
IN THE IRIS ROOM.

788
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:34,934
MR. AND MRS. MUSEUM-GOER

789
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:39,334
MIGHT AS WELL BE LOOKING 
AT A FRAMED PILE OF CASH.

790
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:42,800
NEWSPAPERS PUBLISH
MOVIE GROSSES.

791
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,201
IF A MOVIE EARNS OVER
$100 MILLION,

792
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,034
WE ASSUME
IT MUST BE GOOD.

793
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:50,267
THERE'S NO GOD.
THERE'S NO BEAUTY.

794
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:54,533
IF A PAINTING OR A C.D.
DOESN'T SELL, THROW IT OUT.

795
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:58,834
THE 910 FREEWAY HAS
A VERY SHARP TURN

796
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,834
 <i>AS IT WINDS INTO THE VALLEY</i>
 <i>FROM THE HILLS,</i>

797
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:06,334
AND EVERY YEAR
FOUR OR FIVE MOTORISTS
ARE KILLED ON THIS SPOT.

798
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:09,633
THE CITY CONDUCTED
A COST-AND-EFFECT STUDY,

799
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:12,900
AND THE STUDY CONCLUDED
THAT THE COST IN TERMS 
OF HUMAN LIFE

800
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,001
WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE COST 
OF REBUILDING THE HIGHWAY.

801
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,401
AND SO THIS DEADLY SPOT
ON THE HIGHWAY REMAINS,

802
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:23,500
AND IN FIVE YEARS
20 MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.

803
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,234
WELL, IF THIS ISN'T
DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE,

804
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:28,267
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS.

805
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:35,267
IBOU N'DIYAE CAME HERE
FROM SENEGAL.

806
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:39,834
HE WORKED AS A GUARD
AT AN OUTLET STORE IN CARSON.

807
01:02:39,834 --> 01:02:43,034
HE'S A GREAT CHESS PLAYER.
HE'S MY FRIEND...

808
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:49,034
AND HE WAS THROWN AWAY.

809
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:51,934
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF A WORLD DO WE LIVE IN
THAT HIS LIFE

810
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,767
IS WORTH LESS THAN
THIS NOBODY'S ABILITY
TO GET QUICKLY

811
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:57,401
 <i>INTO A PARKING SPACE</i>

812
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:59,767
OR THE CITY IMPOUND'S
NEED FOR REVENUE,

813
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:02,533
SO THAT EACH ONE
OF THESE AMOEBAS

814
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:06,167
CAN HAVE
A BEACH HOUSE IN MIAMI?

815
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:09,633
IS THAT REALLY THE KIND OF
WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN? 

816
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:12,700

HOWEVER,

820
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,734
A TOW-TRUCK DRIVER IS NOT

821
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,567
A TRAINED MEDICAL
DIAGNOSTICIAN

822
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:34,301

01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:40,301
YOU WERE PARKED

01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:15,368
- ( Khadi speaks Wolof )
- <i>OUI.</i>

839

841
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:16,301
DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU'D GET AWAY WITH IT?

842
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:18,867
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, BEN?

843
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:21,600
DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I WAS GONNA WALK
DOWN THE AISLE WITH YOU

844
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,633
WHILE YOU WERE PICKING
MY FUCKING POCKET?

845
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:26,667
JESUS, YOU'RE
REALLY SOMETHING

846
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,767
WITH YOUR BULLSHIT
AFRICAN DANCING

847
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:31,401
AND YOUR "I'M GONNA
COOK YOU A WOLOF MEAL."

848
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,934
THE WHOLE TIME,
YOU'RE NOTHING 
BUT A CON ARTIST.

849
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:37,567
I-- I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU
ARE SAYING THESE THINGS.

850
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:39,301
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT INNOCENCE CRAP.

851
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:42,234
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ME.

852
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:45,500
YOU'VE BEEN PROSTITUTING
YOURSELF FOR AN AMERICAN
CITIZENSHIP.

853
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,267
REMEMBER THAT SLAP.

854
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:55,267
IT'S THE LAST TIME
WE TOUCH.

855

858
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:39,368
THE ANGRY MAN, HUH?

859
01:07:39,368 --> 01:07:42,700
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
BACK IN THE LAND
OF THE LIVING.

860
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,900
EH, MAYBE I GO BACK
INTO COMA, EH?

861
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,633

862
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:51,967
IS SHE HERE?

863
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,867
KHADI WENT BACK
TO DAKAR.

864

 <i>YOU KNOW, BEN,</i>

865
01:07:57,633 --> 01:08:00,867
SHE WAS NOT ONLY
AFTER YOUR GREEN CARD.

866
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:05,067
 <i>IT IS POSSIBLE</i>
 <i>TO LOVE SOMEONE</i>

867
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:07,934

SOMETHING FROM THEM.

868
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:10,600
GAME THEORY.

869
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:44,368
IDEALLY, WE'D KEEP YOU
A COUPLE MORE DAYS,

870
01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:46,867
BUT MEDICAID STOPS PAYING
ONCE YOUR VITALS ARE NORMAL.

871
01:08:46,867 --> 01:08:49,134

873
01:08:51,734 --> 01:08:53,301
OKAY, DOCTOR.

874
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,800
WELL, IT'S ALL
ABOUT LIABILITY.

875
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,434
THEY'LL RELEASE YOU WHEN
YOUR LIFE IS STILL IN DANGER,

876
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:03,867
BUT YOU GOTTA BE
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

877
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:06,934
YOU KNOW, HAS ANYONE
EVER TOLD YOU THAT

878
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,533
MAYBE YOU ARE A BIT
TOO NEGATIVE, EH, BEN?

879
01:09:17,401 --> 01:09:21,234
SO DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING FROM THE COMA?

880
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,234
HMM.

881
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,567
IT-- IT--
IT WAS LIKE

882
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,301
THE WORLD WENT AWAY;

883
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:37,267
LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS
ON VACATION, YEAH?

884
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,401
IT-- IT WAS MUCH QUIETER
WITHOUT THE WORLD.

885
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:48,767
AND-- AND THEN I MISSED IT.

886
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:52,700

THE WORLD IS BACK,

887

 <i>IT IS KIND OF LIKE</i>

"THE GOOD MAN."

THAT IS HOW I WILL--
I WILL THINK OF YOU.

923
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:24,334
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK OF ME. 

924
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:27,301
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
IN THE PAST TENSE.

ME TO COME TO AMERICA

1011
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:11,234

 <i>* YOU BROUGHT THE GOOD TIMES</i>

1019
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:43,001
 <i>* YOU SAID, "AM I WELCOME?"</i>
 <i>AND WE ALL SAID, "OF COURSE" *</i>

1020
01:26:43,001 --> 01:26:45,834
 <i>* AND THEN OPENED</i>
 <i>THE WINDOWS *</i>

1021
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:50,067
 <i>* AND OPENED THE DOORS</i>
 <i>TO THE SUMMER WIND *</i>

01:27:14,368 --> 01:27:18,567
 <i>* OUT IN THE PARK</i>
 <i>WITH OUR BACKS</i>
 <i>ON THE GRASS *</i>

1028
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:22,034
 <i>* OH, AND THE CLOUDS</i>
 <i>THEY TRY *</i>

1029

1037
01:28:07,368 --> 01:28:09,401
 <i>* IN THE SUMMER WIND </i>

1038
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:13,301
