1
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,495
- Thanks so much for having us
this weekend, Jack.

2
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,497
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank Aunt Linda.

3
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,499
It was all her doing.

4
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,368
- Are her
directions crazy?

5
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,236
- They're super,
super vague.

6
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,207
- And ridiculous
bullet points.

7
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,608
But I think it's okay.

8
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,510
We'll figure it out.
We're smart.

9
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,679
Sometimes.

10
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,315
- Oh, that's such a cute
little dinky bike.

11
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,349
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

12
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,650
- Whoa.
What's this?

13
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,286
Human testing over here?
What's going on?

14
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,853
- Let's see what she says.
It's, uh...

15
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,889
Our only access
is via fence key,

16
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,724
'cause it's a gated
community, James.

17
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,627
- Oh.
- Oh, fancy.

18
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,816
- Spencer pack a bag...

19
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,352
- This is so cute,
I can't even deal with it.

20
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,888
- I think this...

21
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,490
I think this is it.
Yeah.

22
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,758
- Here?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,293
- This is it?
- I think so, yeah.

24
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,661
- This is cute.

25
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,762
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's nice.

26
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,564
- Oh, this is cool.

27
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,732
- It's gorgeous.

28
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,534
- You've been here before,
Jackie?

29
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,203
- Uh, when I was, like, six.

30
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,272
Um...
Okay.

31
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,473
- It's beautiful.

32
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,750
- You looking
for the key?

33
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,552
- Yeah, "the key to
the front door will be

34
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,587
underneath a potted plant
on the left side of the door."

35
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,988
- Well, let's just see
if it's unlocked.

36
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,290
- It's not here.

37
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,824
- Huh.

38
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,727
- Maybe it fell?
Is it somewhere else?

39
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,529
Maybe check around.
- It is definitely locked.

40
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,664
- Do you want to call her?

41
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,998
- Uh, yeah.
That's a good idea.

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,600
- It's a potted plant
for the lock?

43
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,601
- Yeah.

44
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,535
- Maybe it fell?

45
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,871
- Right.

46
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,473
- Hey, what are you doing?

47
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,475
- James, what are you doing?

48
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,609
- Hey, what are you
doing?

49
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,844
Rugged explorer.

50
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,546
- Please don't do
what you're about to do.

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,615
- I'm not doing anything,
Jacqueline.

52
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,885
- I...
- know that to be false.

53
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,420
- Your aunt
should lock the windows.

54
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,955
- This is a gated community.

55
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,658
Can you take off your shoes,
please?

56
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,794
At least?

57
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,397
Thanks for showing me.

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,631
- Constantly.

59
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,433
- Well, I guess
at least we're in.

60
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,001
- Yeah.
- I got that.

61
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,004
- That was great.
- I'll go through the window.

62
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,639
- Good job.
Oh, thanks.

63
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,973
- All right.
- Nice.

64
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,410
- Just stick it on the table
over here.

65
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,279
- They just let guys like you
into places like this?

66
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:09,317
- This is nice.
- Yeah, they just do it.

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,984
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

68
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,287
- Yeah, this is really nice.
- Yeah, it's really pretty.

69
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:14,888
- Yeah.

70
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,358
- Do we put out the sign
when we go to the beach?

71
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,527
- Yeah, and two windows.
- Jackie.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,562
- Oh, we're gonna...
we're gonna take this room.

73
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,367
That was fast.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,935
- Uh...
we're taking this one.

75
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,002
- Are we?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,604
- All right then.
See you.

77
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,675
- Okay.

78
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,844
- I guess this is us.
- Okay.

79
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,046
Oh, it's nice.
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,581
- Yes.

81
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,649
- There's your bag.
- Got the...

82
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,384
Oh, thank you for holding it.

83
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,353
You're the best bellman
I've ever, ever known.

84
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,920
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,389
- That's a...
that's a hell of a compliment.

86
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,023
- Yeah, you could have
been that guy

87
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,792
in "The Grand Budapest Hotel."

88
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,960
- No, really?
- You know, the little...

89
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,395
- Well, I wish.

90
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,496
- Soon you'll run
the whole hotel.

91
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,930
- Yeah, that's true.

92
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,333
- James couldn't even
close the window...

93
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,701
- Aww.
- When he was breaking in?

94
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,037
- He saved the day.

95
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,707
- Yeah, he did.

96
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,876
We're here.

97
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,545
Yes, we are.

98
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,581
- Ugh. Oh, and it's nice
to, like, be inside now.

99
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,915
- Yeah, it is.

100
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,885
Um... so we're going to
the beach later?

101
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,920
- Yeah, bike ride at the beach?
Are you kidding me?

102
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,655
- That's...
we're gonna do that?

103
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,557
We're not just gonna...

104
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,958
I mean, it's...

105
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,427
- Yeah, it's just, like,
right up the way.

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,596
It'll be great to go out there.
- Okay.

107
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,464
Good, good, good, good, good.

108
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,566
This is neat.
Nice little...

109
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,875
Yeah ha ha!

110
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,411
We really got time...

111
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,412
Get the...

112
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,114
- Hello, salty beach.

113
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,849
- Hello, little island.

114
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,619
- Hello, the non-gay part
of this beautiful island.

115
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,987
- We're here

116
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,457
- You're so far
away from me.

117
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,025
I know.

118
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,793
- We'll reach
across the way.

119
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:00,861
- I'll just put my pillow
on this side.

120
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,530
- Okay.

121
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,797
- And then you can put
your pillow on this side.

122
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,399
- We can just
kiss across the way.

123
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,800
Just dainty little
good night kisses.

124
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,104
- All right,
before I crash,

125
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:15,108
I'm gonna get unpacked
a little bit.

126
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,611
- Okay.

127
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,779
Good old mom.

128
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,181
- Yep, Cindy's ringtone.

129
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,516
We're here, Cindy.

130
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,784
You know, she needs
one of those

131
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,753
GPS tracking systems on you.

132
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,054
You know?

133
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,989
I have arrived.

134
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,060
So what's the plan?

135
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,662
Uh, beach.

136
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,729
- Beach?
- Yeah.

137
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,930
- All right.

138
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,738
Hey.
- Sorry, I'm...

139
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,074
Whenever she calls me, I just,
like, start thinking about it.

140
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,476
It's like...

141
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,010
- It's okay.
- In my head.

142
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,479
And it's like...

143
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,913
Sorry. I'm done.

144
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,682
- No, no, no,
you don't have to be done.

145
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,183
That's all right.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,818
- It's okay to think about it,
you know?

147
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,153
- Yeah.
Think about it out here with me.

148
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,556
You know, with us.
In the present.

149
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,557
Not just in here.

150
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,758
Come out.
Hey.

151
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,926
"Hey, Spencer,
come out and play.

152
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,695
Let's go."

153
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,996
I'm proud of you.

154
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,165
Thanks.

155
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,101
- Hey.
- Let's go to the beach.

156
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,102
- I love you.

157
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,537
- I love you.

158
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,839
I do.

159
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:19,973
- Come on.

160
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,012
You think they're ready
for these?

161
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,914
- If they're ready for these.
- Mm.

162
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,017
- Hey, guess what.

163
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,185
- What?

164
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,188
- We've been here, like,
six minutes, let's say.

165
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,223
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,059
- Um, your sister
and her

167
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,161
grandpa-sweater-wearing
boyfriend...

168
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,564
- Mm-hmm.
- Are boning.

169
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,665
Already.
- Oh, my God.

170
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,034
- Like,
really getting into it.

171
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,202
- They're in
the honeymoon phase.

172
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,672
They can't keep
their hands off each other.

173
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,874
It's gonna be the whole weekend
like this.

174
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,709
Kids.

175
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,845
- I can't believe
I just heard her have sex.

176
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,748
- I'm surprised
you haven't before.

177
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,049
- Yeah.

178
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,752
That's interesting.

179
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,253
Do you have, um,

180
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,721
like, toothbrush
and toothpaste stuff

181
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,822
you want me
to bring over there?

182
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,090
It's in here.

183
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,162
I'm so stuck.
- That's just not gonna work.

184
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,897
All right.
Well, thanks.

185
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,198
It was a good delivery system.
- You're welcome.

186
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,600
You're welcome.

187
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,868
- Chh-chh-chh-chh...

188
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,541
Um...

189
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,242
Hey, what's this doing here?

190
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,779
- Um...

191
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,180
I don't know.

192
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,247
Surprise?

193
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,616
- Yeah.

194
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,917
- It's...
- Is it the one?

195
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,018
- Yeah.

196
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,252
What else would it be?

197
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,921
- I mean, I don't know.

198
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,923
Has it been sitting in a drawer
for three years?

199
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,124
- Yeah.
- Where was it?

200
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,926
- In the bottom
of the dresser.

201
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,194
I was looking
for my bathing suit...

202
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,862
- It has a head.
Oh, my God.

203
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,798
- Well, I mean, I totally
forgot that we had it,

204
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,733
but then it was there,
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

205
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,901
- Yeah, but...
- "The rainbow dong."

206
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,569
- What possessed you
to bring it?

207
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,904
- I don't know.
I thought it'd be fun?

208
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,739
- I can't even...
I can't touch it.

209
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,940
- No?
- Anymore.

210
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,108
- Not even a little bit?
- No.

211
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,209
It's...what a weird thing.

212
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,811
Why did you bring it?

213
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,746
- Why not?

214
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,114
- Ugh.
I mean...

215
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,117
All right.
Well...

216
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,019
You want to go to the beach?
Let's go to the beach.

217
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,120
- Sure.

218
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,655
- Do you have your suit
and stuff?

219
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,289
- Um, yeah,
it's in my bag.

220
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:20,661
- I'll meet you out there.
- Okay.

221
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,599
- Got to work on my quads.
- Yeah, you do.

222
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,367
- Well, no, you're supposed to
say, "Your quads look great."

223
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,736
- Your quads look great.
You need to work on 'em.

224
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,870
Thank you.

225
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,705
Yeah, I just got to
get them in.

226
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,040
- You guys ready?
- All right.

227
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,843
- All right,
we're ready to, uh...

228
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,377
- Hey, what are you...
- What are you doing?

229
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,046
- I just want to go.
- We're going to the beach.

230
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,113
- I don't want to...
I'm going to the beach.

231
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,348
I came prepared.
- Oh, okay.

232
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,382
- Oh, okay.
- All right, buddies?

233
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,917
- Sure.
- Cool your jets.

234
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,018
- We just want to make sure.
- Hey, Liz?

235
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,186
Dougie?

236
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,187
You ready?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,856
- Bikes.
Let's go.

238
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,323
- Okay.

239
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,092
Did you bring 'em?
- Yeah, I got towels.

240
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,861
- Did you bring my SPF 100?

241
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,995
- Are we taking bikes?
- Yeah.

242
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,930
The beach is just
right up the way.

243
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,365
- Well, why don't we just...
let's just walk together.

244
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,900
- Can you help me?

245
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,168
- Okay, um, why don't
we just walk?

246
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,870
- No!
- Come on, it'll be nice.

247
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,104
- When do we ever get to be
on bikes in the city?

248
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,405
Let's go.

249
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,707
- Practically never,
but we can...

250
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,909
Um...

251
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,110
- Don't tell me you
have something for work.

252
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,311
- I just need to
send an email.

253
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,013
- No.
You're not doing work.

254
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,347
Not on beach weekend.
- It's just one email.

255
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,883
- You swore you
weren't doing work.

256
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,951
- I can't...I don't
have a choice here.

257
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,353
It's my job.

258
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,822
- You have five minutes.

259
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,024
- Okay.
I will see you in five minutes.

260
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,026
It's just down that way
and to the right?

261
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,961
- Yeah. I'm...
- Come on.

262
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:28,996
- I'm fucking pissed at you,
Dougie.

263
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,898
- Get going.

264
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,735
- Five minutes.
- You look good there.

265
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,003
Yeah!

266
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,383
Please hold my hand.

267
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,251
Go ahead.

268
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,120
- All right, baby, we'll see you
back at the house in a few.

269
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,454
- All right, baby.

270
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,290
- All right.
Bike safe.

271
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,292
- I like that suit.

272
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,127
- It's him in a nutshell.

273
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,996
How's cohabitatin'?

274
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,297
- Living together
is amazing.

275
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,331
- Yeah?
- It's amazing.

276
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,833
It's...it's great.

277
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,234
It's everything
I want it to be.

278
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,004
It's...it's great.
Um...

279
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,405
- But...
- But...

280
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,407
It's not a "but."
It's an "and."

281
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,844
He got into grad school.

282
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,012
- What?
- I know.

283
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,147
- I thought that
that was done deal.

284
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,082
- They didn't let him in
and then on that letter,

285
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,251
they said check a box
if you want to be considered

286
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,221
if someone drops out,
and he did and he got in.

287
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,789
- So it's the same program?

288
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,457
- It's the same program.
- Oh, my God!

289
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,026
- It's, like, it's the best
program in the country.

290
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,360
- Yeah.

291
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,262
- It puts him in position
to just, like,

292
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,798
get whatever he wants
when he comes out.

293
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,167
It's...it's...
I mean, it's amazing.

294
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,235
- That's incredible.

295
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,302
- It's...
It is...

296
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,171
- But he has to leave.

297
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,307
- Yeah. But...
we'll figure it out.

298
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,877
- You're putting on
a brave face.

299
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,478
- No.
No, no, no.

300
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,047
Really.
It's...

301
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,049
You know, I'm nervous,
but it's...

302
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,984
It's just amazing
for him.

303
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,518
- Yeah.

304
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,220
I want to know about you.
- What about you?

305
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,521
- Me?
- No, no, no. Yeah, you.

306
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,057
- Ah.

307
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,192
I think I pissed
Jackie off or...

308
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,360
she definitely
pissed me off.

309
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,895
- What happened?

310
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,329
What'd she do?
What'd you do?

311
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,365
- You're gonna think
this is really stupid.

312
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,133
- Yeah?

313
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,902
- I brought a dildo.

314
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,070
- Okay.

315
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,339
A rainbow dildo.

316
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,407
- Nice.

317
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,608
Colorful.

318
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,543
- That she gave to me,
like, years ago

319
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,513
and forgot about it
'cause it was a joke.

320
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,916
It was in a drawer,
blah, blah, blah.

321
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,085
But we haven't had...
- You guys use those things?

322
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,120
- I mean,
not that kind of thing.

323
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,488
We have a couple things.

324
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,190
We don't usually, though.
- All right.

325
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,559
- But, uh, it's been
a little dry recently.

326
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,561
- How dry?

327
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,964
- Like...

328
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,567
Sahara for the last
couple months.

329
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,569
- Months?
- Months, James.

330
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,105
Months.

331
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,307
So I threw it in my bag
'cause I thought

332
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,043
that maybe that would, uh,

333
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,578
bring some color
back into the world.

334
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,880
- Yeah.

335
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,115
- But she freaked out.

336
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,383
She found it in my bag
and she freaked out,

337
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:14,121
and she walked
out of the room and...

338
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,489
I guess we're pretending
that everything is okay,

339
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,491
but it doesn't feel like that.

340
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,027
There's a part of me
that just, like,

341
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,394
wants to punch her in the face.

342
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,395
Do you ever feel that way?
- Of course.

343
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,031
- Yeah?

344
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,332
I just, like, want to
hold her down and...

345
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,034
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

346
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,602
I imagine ways
that I'd fuckin' kill him.

347
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,139
But you know,
in horrible ways.

348
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,607
But then I get over it
a little and, you know.

349
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,945
- What's the longest you guys
ever go without having sex?

350
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,146
- A few weeks?

351
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,614
I mean,
you can have dry spells.

352
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,350
I mean, I've had 'em before
and...

353
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,252
- Yeah.

354
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,453
- But I don't know.

355
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,554
Then at some point...

356
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,989
- You get a boner?

357
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,924
- You get a boner.
and you know...

358
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,626
- Lesbians don't get boners.
Maybe that's the problem.

359
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,562
- That's... Yeah, you know,
you got to work around that.

360
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,231
But there's got to be
something else.

361
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,300
- I just got to talk to her.

362
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,302
It's stupid.
I'm being a baby.

363
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

364
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,671
- You just got to talk
to her.

365
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,973
- I just got to talk
to her.

366
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,540
- You just got to be
honest.

367
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,310
You know, it's been too long
to not be honest.

368
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,012
- Can you tell me
to grow the fuck up?

369
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,014
- Just grow the fuck up.
- Thank you.

370
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,149
You're welcome.

371
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,045
- Hey, get in here.

372
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,679
Get in here.

373
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,749
- Yeah, take that off.

374
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,685
Come on.

375
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,687
Look at you.

376
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,023
- Mmm!

377
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,692
- Shut up.

378
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,251
- Hi, baby.

379
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,452
- Hi.

380
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,342
- My grandmother used to do it
like this.

381
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,743
- You in?

382
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,746
- Yeah, man.

383
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,415
- Is this your aunt?

384
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:59,586
- Um, I'll take two, please.

385
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,122
No.

386
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,356
I mean... we're Greek.

387
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,791
We have... it's a big family.

388
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,659
- Oh, yeah,
the Stavros clan.

389
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,761
- Let me see?

390
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,297
- It's Christina's family?

391
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,598
- Oh.
Maybe, yeah.

392
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,433
- Oh.
- Hey.

393
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,601
- All right.
- Sexy.

394
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,536
Shut up.

395
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,138
You know what?
- You guys clean each other off?

396
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,772
- Just because
we take a shower together

397
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,741
means we care
about the environment.

398
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,675
We want to save water.

399
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,177
- Oh, very green.

400
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,445
- Oh, that's why.
- Squeaky clean.

401
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,380
- That's green of you.

402
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,782
- If you hear noises in here,
we're just saving some dolphins.

403
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,152
La-la-la-la-la-la-la...

404
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,320
- Come on, guys.

405
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,654
They're, like...
- Your sister.

406
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,655
- I like him.
- I'm just telling you.

407
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,124
I like him too.

408
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,258
I would have liked
to have seen that.

409
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,559
- I like him too,
but can he

410
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,261
keep it in his pants
for five minutes?

411
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,662
- Or could they keep it down?
- This is the first day.

412
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,197
- He can barely
keep it in his pants.

413
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,532
- We saw adapters
in the shower.

414
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,667
You guys, I mean...

415
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,202
- You guys screwed
in the shower too?

416
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,403
- Yeah.
- Screwed?

417
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,638
Eww.
But we fucked in the shower.

418
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,206
Yeah, absolutely.

419
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,774
- We made love in the shower.
- Seriously?

420
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,376
- Yes, there's a sign out there

421
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,111
that says,
"Please fuck in this shower."

422
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,546
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure Aunt Linda
put that up just for us.

423
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,747
- I, uh, missed that.

424
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,382
- "Please.
Love, Aunt Linda."

425
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,117
- Yeah, "Love Aunt Linda.
Fuck in the shower."

426
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,185
- I don't fuck.
I make love.

427
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,586
I fuck.

428
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,887
And on that note,
we're gonna cook.

429
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,356
- In this shirt
you make love?

430
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,390
- Uh, dinner team?

431
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,659
- Come on.
- All right.

432
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,726
- I missed that sign.

433
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,595
- I know.

434
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,897
- You're too vulgar.
- Animals.

435
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,733
- Hey, excuse me.
- You're all animals.

436
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,437
- Okay.
- Yeah.

437
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,306
Yeah, you might want to go
quarters at this point.

438
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,540
- All right.

439
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,509
These are pretty small.

440
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,844
- Yeah, but it's good if they're
really small, you know?

441
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,515
Not really small but, you know,
you want 'em so it's...

442
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,484
You're not getting too much
pepper with the dip.

443
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:38,851
You know what I mean?
- Yeah, okay.

444
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,487
- You don't want to
over-pepper it.

445
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,654
- Beers, anyone?

446
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,156
- Thank you so much.
- There you are.

447
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,524
Oh, this is...I already
sipped some of that.

448
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,758
All right.

449
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,859
- Yeah, cheers.
both: Cheers.

450
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,161
- Cheers to you.

451
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,398
- What's on
the menu?

452
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,832
- We're gonna get
a little salad going.

453
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,467
We got some stuff inside.

454
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,802
We're gonna get the chicken
on the grill.

455
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,470
- Peppers with the chicken.

456
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,372
- Yeah, and we got a little
crudités going as well.

457
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,208
- Crudités.
- Yeah, a little crudités.

458
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,709
Yeah, exactly.
- What is that?

459
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,244
- What is crudités?
- Yeah, I have no idea.

460
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,878
- I don't know what it means,

461
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,814
but what it is is, like, raw
vegetables and dip and whatnot.

462
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,682
It's pretty much
a fancy way of saying it.

463
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,351
It's a gay way
of saying that

464
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm gonna put out some
vegetables with dip.

465
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,423
- Hey, Al told me you got in
to grad school.

466
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,457
- Yeah.
- Congrats.

467
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,458
- He did.
Absolutely.

468
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,227
- I mean, I...yeah.

469
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,728
Yeah, I did, but I'm...
it's, like, very...

470
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:22,662
I'm not...I don't think
I'm gonna go.

471
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,730
But yeah.

472
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,198
I got in, but I'm not...

473
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,666
- You did.
Where'd you get in?

474
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,235
- Uh, University of Chicago.

475
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,702
But I really don't think
I'm gonna...

476
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,438
- It's, like, the best program
in the country.

477
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,672
He got in.
It's education.

478
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,207
- Cool.
- He wants to be a teacher.

479
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,675
He wants to be
a chemistry teacher,

480
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,410
and he got into the best
program in the country, so...

481
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,645
- That's amazing.
- Yeah. I'm not probably...

482
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,280
- To grad school.
- Okay.

483
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,714
There's a lot of things...
it's complicated.

484
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,815
It's like, you know,
we just moved in together,

485
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,451
and, like, well,
that's not...

486
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,219
But just, like, leaving the city
and everything, just...

487
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,554
- Yeah.
- It was like...

488
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,655
I don't think I'm gonna go
or anything.

489
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,290
But, yeah, thank you.

490
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,824
- There are logistics.
- Whatever you decide.

491
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,993
- But you know...
- It's still great that you...

492
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,328
that you want to do it
and that you got in.

493
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,696
- Yeah.

494
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,764
- Yeah, it's awesome
is what it is.

495
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,599
- It is.
Well, thank...thank you.

496
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,634
- You're... I...
don't thank me.

497
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,470
- Do you want to bring this...
- The University of Chicago.

498
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,704
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
bring those over...

499
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,239
- Yes, I will.
- The crudités to them?

500
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,740
- Thank you guys for everything.
- Thank you.

501
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,742
- Thanks for the beer, Doug.
- Yeah, thank you, Doug.

502
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,314
You okay?

503
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,649
You're cutting the halves
into half.

504
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,684
- They're pretty small,
I guess.

505
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,419
Hey.

506
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,421
- Be here.

507
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,957
It's all good.
- I'm here.

508
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,795
I love you.

509
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,030
Now, stop chopping those.

510
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,732
I have vegetables.

511
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,801
The boys chopped them up
for us.

512
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,903
- Speaking of vegetables,
I got to go find my beanstalk.

513
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,371
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

514
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,506
- Yeah. Jackie bean.
You two behave.

515
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,640
- Gonna climb her to the stars.

516
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,941
- Tell her to smile.

517
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,710
She's been so, like,
blah all weekend.

518
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,278
- What are you guys
talking about?

519
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,714
- Just, like, lots of...
I don't know.

520
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,416
Just relationship stuff.

521
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,883
This girl that
she used to know.

522
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,285
- Girl she...

523
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,520
Well, I'm part of
the relationship.

524
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,488
So I guess...
- Look at the sunset.

525
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:56,656
- That is nice.

526
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,425
- Isn't that amazing?
- It is.

527
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,994
I love how the clouds are,
like, dripping down almost.

528
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,830
- Oh, my God.
You're so artistic right now.

529
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,732
- Isn't that...
it looks neat.

530
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,367
- Let's go...

531
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,401
Let's go watch the sunset
on the bay.

532
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,069
- Okay.
both: Yeah.

533
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,738
- Let's go grab the bikes.
Are they just out front still?

534
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,540
- We can...
I mean, we can walk.

535
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,941
- Why would we walk to the bay
when we could bike there?

536
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,676
We'll miss the sunset.

537
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,678
- Why would we bike there
when we could walk there?

538
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,380
- 'Cause we will miss the sunset
if we don't bike to the bay.

539
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,514
- No, we won't.
We will make it.

540
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,782
We can't...I... we're not...

541
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,050
- Why are you being
super-weird about...

542
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,386
- Oh, I pulled some hair.
Sorry.

543
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,021
Um, 'cause...

544
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,790
You should probably sit
for this.

545
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:34,026
I don't want to...
Come on.

546
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,828
- I feel like
you're gonna...

547
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,497
I feel like you're gonna
tell me that you're dying.

548
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,565
I don't know
what's happening right now.

549
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,867
- It's almost that bad.

550
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,569
I love you.

551
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,404
And...

552
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,838
I don't know
how to ride a bike.

553
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,576
- What are you laughing about?
I don't.

554
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,977
- Of course you know
how to ride a bike.

555
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,580
You rode a bike
to the beach earlier.

556
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:56,416
- Ooh, you think that I rode
a bike to the beach earlier.

557
00:21:56,449 --> 00:22:00,420
I walked a bike to the beach
earlier today.

558
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,888
I mean, you wanted me to come,

559
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,123
and I was just gonna
hang out here and...

560
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,559
- Are you...
you're being real right now.

561
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,827
I'm teaching you
how to ride a bike.

562
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,995
I'm gonna teach you
right now.

563
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,963
- Oh, God,
that is not a good idea.

564
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,665
- Yeah, that's the best idea
I've ever had in my whole life.

565
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,434
- Do you want to see me fall
and crack my skull open?

566
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,802
- I mean, well, now...
kind of now that you said that.

567
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,069
- Oh, my God.

568
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,438
- No, I'm teaching you
right now.

569
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,806
No, come on.
We're going.

570
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,073
We're going.
- Okay, fine; let's go.

571
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,878
- J?

572
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:36,889
- Mm.

573
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,433
Hi.

574
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,436
- Hey.

575
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,476
My breath is stinky.

576
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,777
- I don't care.

577
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,579
How you doing?

578
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,581
I'm okay.

579
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,582
Napped.

580
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,850
- Yeah.
- Nap time.

581
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,884
- Mm-hmm.

582
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,119
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,856
What's up with you?

584
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,123
- Mm.

585
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,426
I feel a little lonely
out there.

586
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,129
- Lonely?
- Mm-hmm.

587
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,499
- You got peeps.

588
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,200
You got me.

589
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,502
- I know.

590
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:27,507
- Mm.

591
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,511
- I feel kind of...

592
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,612
I don't know.

593
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,681
- I feel weird.

594
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:35,982
- Weird?
- Yeah.

595
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:36,983
- Why?

596
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,686
- I don't know.

597
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,690
I feel like...

598
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,691
I don't know.

599
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,992
There's...

600
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:50,497
I'm sorry that
I brought that...toy.

601
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,099
- But it was...

602
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,935
My intention was for fun.

603
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:59,639
And...I kind of feel...

604
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,775
rejected.

605
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,011
Hey.

606
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:09,115
I know...I know
I responded poorly to it,

607
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,483
and I know
it was for fun.

608
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,786
I just...
It was really surprising

609
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,821
to see it there.

610
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:15,822
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,857
- And I felt like...

612
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,561
there's this black cloud
of expectation on the weekend.

613
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,795
You know what I mean?

614
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,864
- Is sex a black cloud
for you?

615
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,566
No.

616
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,738
I meant, like, inventive,
exciting, I don't know.

617
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:32,872
- And you don't want that?

618
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,574
- I do.

619
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,742
I do.

620
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,877
But, um...

621
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,514
when it's mandated
or expected,

622
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,215
that feels a little weird
for me, you know?

623
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,051
But...
- Okay.

624
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,052
- I responded poorly.
I know that.

625
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,119
And I'm sorry.

626
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,220
- No, that's okay.

627
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,689
I'm sorry I weirded you out.

628
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:54,894
I just, um, miss you.

629
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,230
I miss having sex with you.

630
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,232
It's been
a really long time.

631
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,701
- It hasn't been that long.

632
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,771
- It's been a long time.

633
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,539
It makes me sad.

634
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,308
- Hey.

635
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,778
This is a problem
with a solution.

636
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,613
It's you and me.

637
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,881
We're here.
Right?

638
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:18,017
So let's hang out.
You and me.

639
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,085
- Okay.
- Okay?

640
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,720
Tonight.
- Tonight.

641
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,022
- Tonight we'll just...
- Hang out.

642
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,256
- See each other.

643
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,925
- Okay.
- Okay?

644
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,026
- Sorry.

645
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,795
- No, don't be sorry.

646
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,829
Don't be sad.
- I love you.

647
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,631
- I love you too.

648
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,805
Tonight.
- Tonight.

649
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,640
- Okay.
- Perk up.

650
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,941
And I'll try to perk up too.

651
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,676
- Yeah.
Wake the fuck up.

652
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,578
- I'm working on it.
- You wanna come outside?

653
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:47,847
- Let me get dressed.
Then I'll meet you out there.

654
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,750
- Okay.
You want coffee or something?

655
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,954
Okay.

656
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,842
- All right, so now you're gonna
push with that one.

657
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,677
Now, when this comes around,
put your foot on it.

658
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,878
When this comes around,
put your foot on it.

659
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,346
- Okay, I am gonna...

660
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,714
- You're not gonna fall.
- Fall into you.

661
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,115
- Okay, stop.
- Liz, I'm...I...

662
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,884
I don't want to do this.
- You're so close.

663
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,385
You just went
from there to here.

664
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,154
You're basically
doing it on your own.

665
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,122
- I don't want to do this.
I'm going home.

666
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,323
- No, come on.
We're just gonna go...

667
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,859
- Can you just...
I'm going back.

668
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,093
- Are you seriously
leaving right now?

669
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,762
- I am.

670
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,631
- Dougie, come back here.

671
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you kidding me?

672
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,117
- And you've all been there;
there's, like, those nights,

673
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,186
full moon night, you know,
like you're just, like,

674
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,655
feeling this intense
desire to, like...

675
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,657
you want to hit something,
but you don't know what to hit.

676
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,726
I was like lying in, like, the
slime of, like, New York City.

677
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,294
I mean, it's like the worst
my life's ever been.

678
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,830
Like I'm...I'm,
like, drunk, depressed,

679
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,366
covered in toxic shit,
and I could die at any second.

680
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,335
I walk down...there's little
steps on the West 4th stop.

681
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,204
You'll see them
on the north side.

682
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,674
They'll be down on the railroad
tracks or the subway tracks.

683
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,843
So I went down.
I was, like, 100 yards in.

684
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,778
- Into the actual subway.
- Into the actual subway, yeah.

685
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,346
Thinking, like,
if I get hit right now,

686
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,981
people will say it's suicide,
but it's not.

687
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,883
It's just me being,
like, angry and dumb.

688
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:31,984
You know?
And drunk.

689
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,720
And then I...and I'm running.

690
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,688
All of a sudden, like,
the train kind of goes down,

691
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,690
but I'm in the middle
of the train track,

692
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,258
and I just, like, lose it,

693
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,060
and I slide headfirst through,
like, the...

694
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,763
like, the slime and muck.

695
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,331
It's like toxic waste.

696
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,133
I had the smell in my nose
for days after.

697
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,434
I'm not lying.
- Oh, my God!

698
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,136
- I threw the clothes away
when I got home.

699
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,271
both: Yeah.
- And, um...So I got home.

700
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,973
That's the story.
- That's good.

701
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,242
It's like I get to 14th Street,
and I jump up,

702
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,010
and, um, and I get up.

703
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,779
There was this crowd of people
waiting for the train.

704
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,113
I've had this, like,
rebirth, like,

705
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,715
I'm like, "I'm alive"
moment.

706
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,483
Like, like...and I look at them;
they look at me,

707
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,787
and all I do is, like, scream
this primal, like, "Ahh!

708
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,421
I'm alive!"
Like, just like that.

709
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,857
And the whole place just...
- Picked up?

710
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,324
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

711
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,193
And they just, like,
they part like the Red Sea.

712
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,195
Like, I just walk through
and walk home.

713
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,030
I don't sleep the... I didn't
sleep the whole night, actually.

714
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,465
But that was like a moment
where, like, I'm not...

715
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,802
"I'm not fucking a woman
ever again."

716
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,437
I am...I am gay,
and I'm gonna live my life

717
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,808
and I'm like, never touch
a vagina, lick a vagina,

718
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,810
any kind
of vagina anything...

719
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,044
- Cocks all the time.
- Only cocks.

720
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,813
- I guess I always knew
I was gay.

721
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,815
I didn't ever have to
go down to the subway.

722
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,816
But cheers to you.

723
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,184
That's incredible.

724
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,886
- Well, I always knew,
but I had to, like...

725
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,520
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No more vagina ever more.

726
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,222
I don't need...
- Dicks from here on out.

727
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,824
- Dicks from there on.
Dicks"R"Us.

728
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,392
- But licking vaginas
is the best.

729
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,960
I'm sorry; you're missing
something.

730
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,228
- I wholeheartedly disagree.

731
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,963
all: What?

732
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,800
- I mean, I agree, you are
missing out on part of it,

733
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,534
but...
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,138
- You never want to have to go
down there, like, on your own.

735
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,139
- What?
- You know?

736
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,173
- You serious?

737
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,342
- You don't like vaginas?

738
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,911
- No, I love vagi...
- Of course he loves vaginas.

739
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,478
- I very much enjoy a vagina.

740
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,948
I don't enjoy licking vaginas.

741
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,016
You know?
- Wow.

742
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,483
- Tasting them, I guess.
- Never?

743
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,119
- No, I've never liked it.

744
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,854
Like, you're down there,

745
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,155
and you can't really tell
what's happening.

746
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,323
- Okay, that's enough
talking about that.

747
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,458
Okay.

748
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,029
- Dougie can't ride a bike
I learned today.

749
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,163
That was a thing
I learned about him.

750
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,032
- Whoa!
- That was a thing I told you...

751
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,333
- Isn't that crazy?
- In confidence today.

752
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,035
- That is crazy.
- Secrets.

753
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,270
- That's...
- Well, we're breaking barriers.

754
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,239
- I don't think
that that's that weird.

755
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,507
- So did anyone try to teach you
how to ride a bike

756
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,043
when you were a kid?
- Yeah, it's not like

757
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,978
nobody ever tried.
I had training wheels,

758
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,546
and then when we took them off,
my dad tried...

759
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,314
- I just remembered.

760
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,516
You were talking about
University of Chicago, right?

761
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,286
I have this friend, Isaac,
who went

762
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,822
and got his masters there
in education.

763
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,024
Yeah, so if you want...
he's a really nice guy.

764
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,525
I'm sure if you sent him,
like, an email...

765
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,194
- Oh, that'd be great.
- Yeah.

766
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,596
I can give you his contact info.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

767
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,467
- It's also last hurrah
before hunker-down time.

768
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,002
- Yeah, before you stop
working so much, right?

769
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,971
- I'm gonna be so bored.
Oh, my God.

770
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,572
- 'Cause during winter,
you get super-slow.

771
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,374
- Just drinking.

772
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,342
- Yeah, I'm not mad about that.
- Baby?

773
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,544
- No, I'm good.
Thank you, though.

774
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,047
- Yeah, he loves the city.

775
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:17,516
- Um...
So yeah.

776
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,185
- Yeah, you've been doing
so much this summer.

777
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,088
- He loves it there.
And you have...

778
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,023
- I'm really...like,
I really want to do it.

779
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,524
- Yeah.
- I'm really excited about it.

780
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,059
- I'm sure he's gonna
talk you into it.

781
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,396
Totally help you out
with anything.

782
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,563
- Yeah, 'cause I feel like
I don't know

783
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,032
anybody to talk to about it.

784
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,166
- Yeah, he...
- What's his name?

785
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,434
- Hey, baby...
- Isaac.

786
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,535
- Oh, hey.
- You want another drink?

787
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,970
You want something else?

788
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,006
- I'm good.
- Yeah? You sure?

789
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,407
All right.

790
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,541
- All right, what's his...
what was his...

791
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,412
- No, I'm...that's okay.

792
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,080
I didn't realize that you had
told me that in confidence.

793
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:49,415
I thought that was something

794
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,649
that we were gonna
work on this weekend.

795
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,551
So...
- Well, let's keep trying.

796
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,420
Let's make it work.

797
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,423
- When I teach you, it's gonna
be at the crack of dawn.

798
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,992
I hope you're ready
to get up very early.

799
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,896
- So I saw a game in there.
- Yes.

800
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,897
all: Yeah.
- That's good.

801
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,232
- Some whiskey.

802
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,367
- This game gets
super-competitive, so...

803
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,036
- Y'all, I am going to win.

804
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,403
There is no doubt.
- I don't know.

805
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,538
- Now?
Inside?

806
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,206
- What are you doing, poker?

807
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,908
- We're really intense
about games, so...

808
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,276
- Yeah, people,
you are all going down.

809
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,277
- Let's go to the table.

810
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,012
- James, forget it.

811
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,047
- Thank you.
- Sometimes.

812
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,281
- My love.

813
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,215
- I'll meet you in there.
- Okay.

814
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,550
- Dougie, you bring any...

815
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,385
Dougie, do you have
any pot on you?

816
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,154
- Uh, there might be some
in my bag.

817
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,455
- Oh, yeah.

818
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,624
- Jackie, come on.
- I'm coming.

819
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:33,993
Jesus.

820
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,117
- Hey, buddy.

821
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,285
- Hey.

822
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,653
- What are you doing?

823
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,290
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Don't tell.

824
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,259
- Where did you get that?

825
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,196
- I found it
in Aunt Linda's drawer.

826
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:13,332
- You found it
in Aunt Linda's drawer?

827
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,967
What else was in there?
- You want to share it with me?

828
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,969
- Yes, I do.
- You don't want to know.

829
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,439
- Oh, God.
- Just like high school.

830
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,375
Oh, my God.

831
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,211
- What's wrong
with this weekend?

832
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,683
You tell me.

833
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,684
- I don't know.

834
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,154
That dinner was weird.

835
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:39,058
- Why, 'cause of Spencer?

836
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,392
- No.

837
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,531
A little.

838
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,566
- What's going on in here,
huh?

839
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,701
- I don't know.
- What color is it?

840
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,370
- I don't know.
I'm not...

841
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,471
- You don't know?

842
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,540
You don't know?

843
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:55,707
I know.

844
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:58,077
- What color is it?

845
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,047
- Scream color.

846
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,281
You want to do it?

847
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,515
- Yeah.
- You gonna scream with me?

848
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,650
Oh, yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

849
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,018
Let's do it.
- This is like...

850
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,086
Oh, this is
a gated community.

851
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,556
I don't care.

852
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,723
Ready?

853
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,093
One, two.

854
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,036
Oh, my God.

855
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,672
- That feels better.

856
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,046
Guess I'm not having sex.
I can scream.

857
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,748
- I'm sorry.

858
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,684
- I kind of talked to her
about it.

859
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,353
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

860
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,222
And I thought it was good,

861
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,058
but feels, like,
sticky and prickly

862
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:50,662
and like everyone is in a...
jar of cactuses.

863
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,663
- I love you.

864
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,232
- Click!

865
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,400
This is what Jackie
feels like right now.

866
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:55,501
- Yeah.

867
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,303
- "I love you."
Click-click!

868
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,071
It was fine,
but then during dinner,

869
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,707
she was all, like,
"No, thanks."

870
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,742
- I know.
Two glasses of wine and done.

871
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,449
- Makes me feel old
or something.

872
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,818
- Yeah.
- Scary.

873
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,855
I have an idea.

874
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,557
- What's that?

875
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,459
- We're gonna go inside...

876
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,793
- Yeah.

877
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:25,464
- And we're gonna
be in the moment.

878
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,498
- We're gonna be present.

879
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,134
- We're gonna be present.

880
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,368
- And that's gonna make them
be present.

881
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,469
- Yeah.

882
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,104
Stop worrying about
everything.

883
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,273
Everyone's so worried
about everything.

884
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,807
I'm worried about everything,
and I don't...

885
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,477
- When did that happen?
- I don't know.

886
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,481
- We didn't worry about shit
this much.

887
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,650
- I don't remember worrying
about shit this much.

888
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,122
- You guys are gonna
be fine.

889
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,358
- I know.

890
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,826
- It's just a rut.

891
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,496
- You guys are gonna
be fine too.

892
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,233
No matter what happens.

893
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,435
I can see it between you.

894
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,603
- Yeah?
- You know?

895
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,506
There's the vibe.

896
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,208
- Good.

897
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,211
- Do you feel it?

898
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,612
Here?

899
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,681
- Yeah.

900
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,516
It's gonna be all right,
right?

901
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,684
- Yeah.

902
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:19,885
Let's have some fun.

903
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,253
- Let's have some fun.

904
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,225
Forget about...
all that.

905
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,559
- Forget about it.

906
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:41,240
- You're my best friend.

907
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,642
- You're mine.

908
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,676
- I love ya.

909
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,313
- I love you.

910
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,482
- Okay.

911
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,484
- Let's do it.
- Let's go do it.

912
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:56,655
- Dougie.
- Blank.

913
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,524
Bet you can't have
just one.

914
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,359
Shaquille O'Neal's
acting career.

915
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,960
Bet you can't have
just one.

916
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,662
The clitoris.

917
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,197
Bet you can't have
just one.

918
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,198
- Ooh.

919
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:07,633
- Battlefield amputations.

920
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,336
Bet you can't have
just one.

921
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,770
- Ooh.
That is dark.

922
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,905
- Tom Cruise.
Bet you can't have just one.

923
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,741
And altar boys.
Bet you can't have just one.

924
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,977
Man.
- That went down a dark...

925
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,512
- Yeah.

926
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,548
- Altar boys
or battlefield amputations.

927
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,915
- Battlefield
amputations.

928
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,384
- I think it's
battlefield amputations.

929
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,453
Oh, my God.

930
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,787
You've gotten all of
the ones that I've...

931
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,988
- You won every round.

932
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,957
Bet she can't have
just one.

933
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,659
- I'm really proud of myself.

934
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,727
- You and I are, like,
right on this.

935
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,962
- Wait.
That's the one you won.

936
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,497
You got to pick one
from the pile.

937
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,234
That's already happened.

938
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,235
- Oh.

939
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,370
- Ladies and gentlemen...

940
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,604
Cheers to that.

941
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,005
- I am drunk.

942
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,409
"'That's right.
I killed blank.'

943
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,944
"'How?' You ask.
Blank."

944
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,313
- Wow, it's a two-carder.

945
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,448
- Two cards.
Two cards.

946
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:58,317
- "That's right.
I killed blank."

947
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,951
"How?" You ask.
"Blank."

948
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,254
- We have...you have to keep
our cards separate, right?

949
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,889
- Oh, God, I got such a good
fuckin' one for this.

950
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:04,890
- Okay, so...
- Wait.

951
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,458
So how do we give it to you

952
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:07,959
so you read it
in the order that we think?

953
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:11,363
- I would do the one you want
first on top, right?

954
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,299
- The first one...
No, on the bottom.

955
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,666
'Cause you pick it up.
- No, 'cause she's gonna...

956
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,268
Oh, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

957
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:19,271
- Yeah, bottom first.
- This is too little.

958
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,939
- I got it, baby.
- That's right.

959
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,342
I killed a salty surprise.

960
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,643
"How?" You ask.

961
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,646
The taint, the grundle,
the fleshy fun bridge.

962
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,749
Wow.

963
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,451
I killed the milkman today.

964
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,052
"How?" You ask.
- Hilarious.

965
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:38,824
- Killed my collection
of high-tech sex toys.

966
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,025
- No.

967
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,427
- Puberty.

968
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,728
- With puberty?

969
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,663
- She's reading them
all backwards.

970
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,664
- That was a good one.

971
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:46,998
- I killed
finger painting...

972
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,667
- You're reading them
all backwards.

973
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,370
- Okay, well,
then fuck this.

974
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,538
You win.

975
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,672
- Wait.
- Whoa, no.

976
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,541
- You have a different point.

977
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,544
- I killed authentic Mexican
cuisine with finger painting.

978
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,812
- I killed Michael Jackson
with Robert Downey Jr.

979
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:01,913
- What?
- Wow.

980
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:02,981
- That totally makes sense.

981
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,483
- Very literal.
- All right.

982
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,617
Who wants another?

983
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:06,985
- Gimme.
- Let's top it off.

984
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,887
- Gimme, gimme.
- Gimme, gimme one more time.

985
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,489
- Gimme more.
Gimme.

986
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:11,957
- Gimme, gimme.
Isn't that another Britney song?

987
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,359
- Yeah.
- Gimmies!

988
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,793
- I thought pointy nipples.
- Yeah?

989
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,495
- Or was that Bruce?

990
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,996
- Bruce who?
Willis?

991
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,431
Bruce Wayne?
- Wait.

992
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,699
When did the
pointy nipples come up?

993
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:21,867
What are you
talking about?

994
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,435
- What are you
talking about?

995
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,338
Straight out the bottle.

996
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,477
- Holy shit.
Have we had that much of it?

997
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,044
- Where you going, baby?

998
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:35,013
- Getting ready for bed.

999
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,382
both: Bed?
- What?

1000
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,116
- Bed head.
- What time is it?

1001
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,885
- Yeah, bed head.

1002
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,588
- Where I come from,
bed doesn't even start until...

1003
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:44,856
- My girlfriend
wants to go to bed.

1004
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,991
- Yeah, hit me.
Hit me, baby.

1005
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:46,992
- One more time?

1006
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,362
- Yeah.
- Ooh, Britney.

1007
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,898
- You dress...
- James and I used to both...

1008
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,067
dress like Britney Spears.
- Oh.

1009
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,571
- And...
- The fucky-fucky again.

1010
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:00,972
- And sing her songs.

1011
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,743
- Hey, where did, uh...
Where'd Jackie go?

1012
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,912
- I don't know.

1013
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,847
- Yeah, let's just do it.
Let's...

1014
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,916
- Cheers.
- Down the hatch.

1015
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,753
Oh.

1016
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,455
- Mm.

1017
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,823
Okeydokey.

1018
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,626
- "Okeydokey" what?

1019
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,860
- I think that was it
for me.

1020
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,830
- Oh, my God.
You're going to sleep?

1021
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,097
- I love you guys.

1022
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,499
- Giggles, come back.
- I love you.

1023
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,767
- And we love you.
- Giggle...hey.

1024
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,901
Don't go to sleep.

1025
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:30,902
- You're my favorite.

1026
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,571
- What?

1027
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,473
- Think bad things are gonna
start happening now.

1028
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,574
- What are you talking about?

1029
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,808
- I don't know.

1030
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,944
- What?
- See you tomorrow.

1031
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,479
- What is she
talking about?

1032
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:43,181
- She never used to go to s...
bed early.

1033
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,650
That's a new thing.

1034
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,485
- Yeah?

1035
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,886
Why did everybody go to sleep?

1036
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,790
Come here.
Hold on.

1037
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:52,891
- Mm.

1038
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,093
- We're not going to sleep.

1039
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,063
We're on a frickin' fun island.

1040
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,965
- Want to go skinny-dipping?

1041
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,967
Ooh.

1042
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:27,859
Hi.

1043
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,828
- Hi.

1044
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,764
- What were you doing
in there?

1045
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,833
- I'm... my routine.

1046
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,538
- It takes forever.

1047
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,540
- Yeah.

1048
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,708
Bedtime?

1049
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,476
- Mm-hmm.

1050
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,814
I just got so tired.

1051
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:49,815
- Okay.

1052
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:50,816
- I love you.

1053
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,552
- I love you.

1054
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,488
- I'm gonna
miss you over there.

1055
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:58,790
All the way on my island.

1056
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,058
- Mm-hmm.

1057
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,159
It'll be lonely.

1058
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,865
- All right.
Sleep well.

1059
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:07,933
- Okay.

1060
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:02,253
- That was fun.

1061
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,158
Ooh!

1062
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:40,852
*

1063
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,967
- Good morning

1064
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,268
Good morning

1065
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,074
One little teeny
cup of joe for you.

1066
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,108
- Yes. Thank you.
Thank you for this.

1067
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,843
- Mm-hmm.

1068
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:13,879
- These are the daintiest
little cups.

1069
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:14,946
- Of course it is.

1070
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,115
- Thank you.

1071
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,817
- Of course.

1072
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,986
Let's go for a walk.
It's beautiful out.

1073
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:21,987
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1074
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,221
- Okay.

1075
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,189
- Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.

1076
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,057
- All right.
All right.

1077
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,425
Watch the nipples.

1078
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:32,397
- I feel like over here's
gonna be a good spot.

1079
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,132
- Lot of houses
right here, Liz.

1080
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:35,433
- It's the end of September.
There's nobody here.

1081
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,902
- What do you mean
there's nobody...

1082
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,036
- There's nobody
in any of these houses.

1083
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,504
- We're here.
- Come on.

1084
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,206
Nobody's gonna see you.
Stop being such a worrywart.

1085
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,507
The thing that
you weren't getting

1086
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,508
was getting
your second foot on.

1087
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,043
- Yeah.

1088
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,277
- So what we're gonna
focus on today

1089
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:49,147
is picking a...
like, a point of focus.

1090
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,315
- Okay.
- Uh...

1091
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,549
and headed
straight for it,

1092
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,251
but you want to
put your second foot on.

1093
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,786
You're gonna get this.
It's gonna be great.

1094
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,387
- I hope so.
- Ready?

1095
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,923
Follow me.

1096
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,057
I can be your point
of focus if you want.

1097
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,225
- Okay, yeah.
I like that.

1098
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,559
- All right,
come to me then.

1099
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,861
It's like...

1100
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:03,962
- Come on.
You're stalling.

1101
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,097
Let's go.
- All right.

1102
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:08,066
- All right, push.
Get your second foot on.

1103
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,300
Go, go, go.

1104
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,036
Get your second foot.
Just put it on.

1105
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,004
Put this foot on the pedal.
- I'm trying to get my...

1106
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:14,205
- Okay.
Whoa. All right.

1107
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,273
- It's harder
than that...

1108
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,908
- I know. I know.
I know.

1109
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,177
It's...it's...
riding a bike is hard.

1110
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,478
- Don't make fun of me.

1111
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,247
- I'm not.
Honey, you are so close.

1112
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,281
I'm extremely proud of you.

1113
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,482
You've gotten really far.

1114
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,884
- I really
don't want to do this.

1115
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:26,918
Can we please
just go back?

1116
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,419
- Well, that's too bad,

1117
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,421
because you are so close
you're gonna do it anyway.

1118
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,522
Give me a kiss.

1119
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:32,523
- You can be
very patronizing.

1120
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:33,558
You know that?

1121
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:35,060
- Well, I'm not trying to be.

1122
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,194
I'm just trying to
get you to ride a bike.

1123
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,295
All right, let's go.

1124
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,064
Back to start.

1125
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,221
- Morning.

1126
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,323
Or should I say
"afternoon."

1127
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,625
What time is it?

1128
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,061
- Uh, I think
it's like noon-30.

1129
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:11,329
- Really?

1130
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,298
- You're missing
valuable beach time.

1131
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,399
- Sorry.

1132
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:15,466
- Can you get
my back, please?

1133
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,902
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1134
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,038
- I think I drank
a little too much,

1135
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:23,408
but that's what
vacation is for, right?

1136
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,877
Sure.

1137
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,245
I guess some vacations.

1138
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,313
- Mm.

1139
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,148
I'm sorry I fell asleep.

1140
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,549
- It's okay.

1141
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,127
Am I done?

1142
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,129
- Mm-hmm.

1143
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,130
- Okay.

1144
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,264
Put your suit on.

1145
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:47,532
- Okay.
- Meet you out there?

1146
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,533
- Righty-o.

1147
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,534
- Okay.

1148
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,902
- You want this?

1149
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,403
- Sure.
Thank you.

1150
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,618
- So you were talking to Jackie
last night about it...

1151
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,988
- Yeah, yeah, she has
this friend Isaac

1152
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,157
who, like, went to
the exact same program.

1153
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,558
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,460
She connected us all
on email.

1155
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:16,661
- Wow.
- And she emailed me last night.

1156
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:18,229
And then this morning,

1157
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:19,998
we had a five-minute
conversation already.

1158
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,399
- Wow.
And he's a nice guy?

1159
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,301
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1160
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:27,305
He's, uh...he's living in...
living in Chicago.

1161
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,640
He's a math teacher...
high school math teacher.

1162
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,010
- So he stayed there?

1163
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:34,445
- Yeah, you don't have to stay
there, but, like, yeah, he...

1164
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,481
They help you with placement
and everything, so...

1165
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,184
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1166
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:43,021
- That's really great.

1167
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,322
- You okay?

1168
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,423
- Yeah.

1169
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,193
I'm just tired.

1170
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,527
I didn't sleep very well.

1171
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,629
Ugh.

1172
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,663
- Mom, stop calling.

1173
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,734
- What'd she want?

1174
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,206
- Uh, she wants to talk about
finances and stuff if...

1175
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,042
If I end up, uh...

1176
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:05,443
If I end up going,
she wants to...

1177
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,146
talk about helping me
out a bit.

1178
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,547
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

1179
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,050
If I'm going,
which I'm, you know...

1180
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,384
Who knows?

1181
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:14,485
- All right, you see
how that foot is on?

1182
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,187
- Yeah, I see.

1183
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,388
- I'm just gonna set
the other one on quickly.

1184
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,656
- Great.

1185
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,991
- And it's gonna, like,
help me balance

1186
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:21,426
just by getting
that second foot on.

1187
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,760
- That's all it takes
is the balance, huh?

1188
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,662
- Look, I know
that you're competitive,

1189
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,231
but I'm not trying to best you.
- It's not about competition.

1190
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,232
- I'm not trying to
show you up right now.

1191
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:28,599
- I'm just trying to...

1192
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,201
It's not helpful
to see somebody ride a bike.

1193
00:49:30,235 --> 00:49:32,237
- Well, if it's not helpful,
then you show me.

1194
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,372
- You want to see
how this is done?

1195
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,641
Watch a master at work.

1196
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,543
Okay, here you go.
- Yeah, fine, go.

1197
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,312
- I just got to get
my second foot, right?

1198
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:42,380
- Yeah.

1199
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:43,581
- I got it.
- Holy shit.

1200
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,715
Yeah, just like that.

1201
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,417
- That was amazing!
Yes!

1202
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,718
- I almost went right
off the edge there, though.

1203
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,054
- Yeah, you, like,
put both of them on

1204
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,388
and then you take them off.

1205
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,090
- It doesn't feel
that close, but...

1206
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:53,391
- Come on, back, back, back.
That was...Oh, my God.

1207
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,592
That was so close.
That was so close.

1208
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,394
- Chicago's a cool city.
- Yes.

1209
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,728
It is.

1210
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,130
It's a great city.

1211
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:02,267
- Yeah.
- It's a great city.

1212
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,734
So is New York.

1213
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,404
- It is.
- Yeah.

1214
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:07,738
- It is.

1215
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,577
Jesus.

1216
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,678
- I know.

1217
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,280
- She really wants
to talk.

1218
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,415
- Yeah.

1219
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,117
You okay?

1220
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,285
- Yeah.

1221
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:22,220
Just tired.

1222
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:24,089
- You seem kind of
closed off.

1223
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,597
- That's funny.

1224
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,833
'Cause I feel like...

1225
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,535
I feel like when
we were talking to Dougie

1226
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,571
last night about grad school,
you were...

1227
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,507
totally disingenuous
to him.

1228
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,243
- What do you mean?

1229
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,344
- I mean, you had
your foot in your mouth

1230
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,213
the whole conversation.

1231
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,481
I mean, he asked you about it,
and you couldn't even say

1232
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,783
like you were excited
that you got in.

1233
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,220
- I'm excited about
getting in, yeah.

1234
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,754
I just told him I don't know
what I'm...what I want to do.

1235
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,389
It's like,
the guy should assume...

1236
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,125
- I mean, he didn't ask
for your plans.

1237
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:02,760
I think he just wanted to know
how you felt about it.

1238
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,462
- I just told Doug that
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1239
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,696
That's the truthful thing.

1240
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,465
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1241
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,734
- But you want to go.

1242
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,369
- I don't know
if I want to go or not.

1243
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,870
I'm excited that I got in.

1244
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,572
That's what I...
that's all I know.

1245
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:15,806
- I don't know.
- What?

1246
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,442
- I just feel like
you were, like,

1247
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:19,810
not saying something on purpose,
and like you were,

1248
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:22,147
like, trying to protect me
and not say something...

1249
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,181
- Protect you?

1250
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,449
- In front of me
or something

1251
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,651
or to...or actually say
how excited you are.

1252
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,686
- Can you look me in the eyes?
I feel like you're...

1253
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,188
What...what...what do you
want me to say?

1254
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:32,190
I don't know what I...
what I want to do.

1255
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,724
That's the truth.
- This morning, today, you...

1256
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,561
See, you're actually
fucking excited about it,

1257
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,595
and that's all I want.

1258
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,197
I just want you to be excited

1259
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,798
or just be whatever
you're feeling and not...

1260
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,467
- Like, I'm obviously
excited I got in,

1261
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,801
but I don't know
what I'm gonna do with it.

1262
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,370
- So say you're excited
about that.

1263
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:46,571
Just say...
- Okay, I'm excited about going.

1264
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,839
I'm excited about
maybe going.

1265
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,641
- See, that's it right there,
that "maybe."

1266
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:52,443
Just say you want to go.
- I don't know if I want to go.

1267
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,312
- Just say
that you want to go.

1268
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:55,313
- Why?
I don't know if I want to...

1269
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,847
- Just say it.

1270
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:58,916
'Cause you do.
- I don't know if I want to go.

1271
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,451
- Spencer, don't...
Just say that you want to go.

1272
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,752
Just say it.

1273
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,221
Just be fucking honest
with yourself.

1274
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,356
- Okay, I want to go.
I want to go.

1275
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:11,696
- Finally.

1276
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,937
- Baby, I'ma get this,
and then...Two seconds.

1277
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,939
And then we can talk about it.
- Yeah, two seconds.

1278
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:22,940
- No, I...
- All right.

1279
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,343
Tell her I say hi.

1280
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,411
Yeah, Mom?

1281
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,215
- Yeah, I'm on...
I'm on an island right now,

1282
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,249
so, like, what...

1283
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,785
- I know you've been
trying to call me, Mom.

1284
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:35,953
I know that, because my phone's
been vibrating

1285
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,788
every five minutes.

1286
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,324
- All right, fast.
- We're turning right around.

1287
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:40,558
- I just want to beat you
at something.

1288
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,293
- You always beat me
at everything.

1289
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,594
- Okay, we're gonna race
when I'm done with this,

1290
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:44,962
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

1291
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,764
- Why do you think
that's half the battle?

1292
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,433
The reason I'm, like,
trying to teach you right now,

1293
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,667
'cause it'll give us
a new thing to fight over.

1294
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,436
Right, let's go.
- All right.

1295
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,737
You're not as bad a teacher
as I thought, I guess.

1296
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,372
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1297
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,640
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yep, I got 'em on.

1298
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,941
- Great, great, great.
- Yeah, baby!

1299
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:57,975
- Yeah, perfect.
- Oh!

1300
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,412
- Holy shit.
Dougie?

1301
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:43,921
- Spencer?

1302
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:47,558
Spencer?

1303
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:53,998
Damn it.

1304
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,475
- You having
a good time?

1305
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,678
- Yeah.

1306
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,382
- I'm not convinced
by that answer.

1307
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,083
- I'm having
a good time.

1308
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,020
You know, I'm trying to...
relax on cue, which is hard.

1309
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,856
But I'm getting there.

1310
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,791
- Okay.

1311
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:54,792
- Hey.
- Hey.

1312
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,327
- Hi.

1313
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,695
What's up?

1314
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,564
I lost Spencer
in the fucking woods.

1315
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:00,731
- What?

1316
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:01,866
- It's fine.
- You lost him?

1317
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,000
- Just got to
get my phone.

1318
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,068
- You need help?
- Do you need help?

1319
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,503
- No, it's fine.
Relax.

1320
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,508
Jeez.

1321
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,412
Doesn't sound good.

1322
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,416
So dramatic.

1323
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,586
- Do you not
like my friends?

1324
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,421
- I love your friends.

1325
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:24,822
That was just a...

1326
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,891
I love your friends.

1327
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,559
- Okay.

1328
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,405
How come you walked out
on game night?

1329
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:44,842
- I didn't...

1330
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,011
I wasn't intentionally
walking out on game night.

1331
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,915
I just wanted to...
spend some time with you.

1332
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,083
I thought we had a plan
to hang out,

1333
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,619
so I wanted to...

1334
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,622
- So you left
in the middle of the game.

1335
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,457
- It seemed like
a good time.

1336
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,459
I don't know.

1337
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,160
- Jackie,
we were playing a game

1338
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,762
and everyone
was having a good time,

1339
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,564
and you just got up
and left in the middle,

1340
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:07,665
and I thought
you were mad at me.

1341
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,699
- I was having
a good time too.

1342
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,867
I wasn't mad at you.

1343
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,403
I gave you the sexy eyes,
the cue.

1344
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:16,874
- I thought those
were angry eyes.

1345
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,410
- Well, that's a blow
to the ego.

1346
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:20,911
Um...

1347
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,783
- I mean, I wanted
to have sex this morning,

1348
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:29,086
but you seemed
really not into that.

1349
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,921
- You tried to have sex with me
this morning?

1350
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,423
- Yeah.

1351
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:34,124
- You mean at noon
when you woke up?

1352
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:35,660
- Okay, fine.
At noon when I woke up.

1353
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:37,962
- When?
Why didn't you say anything?

1354
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,196
- Why didn't you say anything
last night?

1355
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,698
- Because we had a plan.

1356
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,600
- Yeah, but there wasn't
a specific time.

1357
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,669
It wasn't like, "All right,
at 10:30, we're gonna...

1358
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:46,437
"no matter what's happening,

1359
00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:48,105
we're gonna get up and
walk into the room and"...

1360
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,140
- But when else
was it gonna happen?

1361
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,609
- Any time.
Right now.

1362
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,143
Why not?

1363
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:56,681
I just feel like
something is going on here,

1364
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,583
and we need
to be able to connect.

1365
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,084
And it's not
about the beach

1366
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,719
and it's not about
all this other stuff,

1367
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,053
and it's about you and me

1368
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:06,991
and we just have to
figure that out somehow.

1369
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,959
- You keep presenting me
with all these problems

1370
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:15,533
that I can't possibly
solve alone, and...

1371
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,835
you got to meet me somewhere.

1372
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,470
- I'm trying.

1373
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:21,539
I just...
what do you want me to do?

1374
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:22,740
- I don't know.
We're fucking...

1375
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,575
We're off
every step of the way.

1376
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:28,178
It's like, "Oh, I didn't
react right to every"...

1377
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,180
The fuckin' dildo in your bag.

1378
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:33,117
I'm the killjoy.
I don't want to have any fun.

1379
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,855
I'm not doing it right
or at the right time or...

1380
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,190
It's just problem after problem,
and I'm trying to fix it.

1381
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,660
I'm trying to find
a solution, but...

1382
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:44,028
- I don't know, Jackie.

1383
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,196
It just feels like
you're on this path

1384
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,032
and you've got it all
laid out in front of you,

1385
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,567
but you won't
let me in on that,

1386
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,569
so I don't know
how to follow you.

1387
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:52,970
I don't know how
to be there with you.

1388
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,939
It's not...
it's not where I am.

1389
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,874
- You need to help me
find a solution.

1390
00:57:56,907 --> 00:58:00,210
- Okay, so what
would you like me to do?

1391
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,184
I don't know.

1392
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,190
I don't know.

1393
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,734
- We're stuck.

1394
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,274
- Mm-hmm.

1395
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,847
Well, I don't...
I don't really know what to say.

1396
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,784
And I feel like
anything I do say

1397
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,786
is not gonna be
productive, so...

1398
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,053
I just need a moment.

1399
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:02,873
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1400
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,809
I got...I got your message.
Okay.

1401
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:05,843
Where are you?

1402
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:08,846
At the fence.

1403
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,048
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1404
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,717
Hey, I got to go.
I'll see you there.

1405
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,718
All right.
Bye.

1406
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,919
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1407
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,020
- Sit down on the couch.
- Hey...whoa.

1408
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,287
- I can... I can do that.

1409
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,823
- Hey...

1410
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:20,224
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.

1411
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:21,759
Um...

1412
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,661
Fuck. Sorry.
We had a little accident.

1413
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,062
- Yeah, is... are you...
hey, are you okay?

1414
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,297
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1415
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:29,066
It's... it's... yeah.

1416
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,300
I'm gonna get an ice pack.

1417
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:31,669
- No, sit...sit down.

1418
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:32,803
I can get you an ice pack.
God.

1419
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:34,104
- Thank you.

1420
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:35,673
- Can I get you...
What...what happened?

1421
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,308
- Oh, it's just...
I fell off a bike.

1422
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,711
- You fell off your bike.
- Yeah.

1423
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,713
- I'm sorry, bud.
You okay?

1424
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,814
Relax, man.

1425
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,382
- Oh, fuck me.

1426
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,383
- No, no, no.
It's not bad.

1427
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,652
Don't look at it.

1428
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,086
Yeah.
- It's fine.

1429
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,187
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

1430
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,989
- You got to get
some ice on there.

1431
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,891
- Ice. Yeah, right there.
Oh, that feels good.

1432
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,059
- Okay.
Great, great, great.

1433
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,694
- You need anything?
- No, no.

1434
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:57,895
- He's big. He's tough.
He's strong.

1435
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,163
- Yeah, yeah.
- He's great.

1436
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,831
- All right,
I'm gonna go get Spencer.

1437
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:02,299
He's locked out, and...
- Yeah, no problem.

1438
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,034
Yeah, we're totally set here.
Thanks, James.

1439
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,370
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

1440
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,641
- God...
All right, babe.

1441
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:12,409
- Oh, God.
I need to find aspirin.

1442
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,912
I want to get some...
- I can find you aspirin.

1443
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,313
- I can get
some aspirin, Liz.

1444
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,649
I don't need your help
to do everything.

1445
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:19,817
Can I...
- Where is it?

1446
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,185
- It should be
in this front...

1447
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,887
Liz, I don't need you
to look for me.

1448
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,088
- Well...

1449
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,155
- Shit.

1450
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,927
- Can you just let me
help you?

1451
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,928
- Fuck!

1452
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,664
I didn't bring any.

1453
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:36,033
Do you have some in your purse
or your suitcase?

1454
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,234
- No, I don't.

1455
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:38,903
I am gonna go
find some for you.

1456
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,204
- What, you don't have any?

1457
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,772
- No.
Can you just stay here?

1458
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,140
- Yes.
- I'll be back. Five minutes.

1459
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,842
- Can I come?
- No.

1460
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,746
Can you just sit here,
and I will go find you aspirin.

1461
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,066
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1462
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,768
- How are you?
- Okay.

1463
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:11,836
- Hi, I'm Liz.

1464
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,070
- Um, Angela.
Nice to...

1465
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,238
- Angela.
Beautiful day.

1466
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:16,073
- Yeah, it is.
- Right?

1467
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,008
Uh, do you happen to have
any painkillers?

1468
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,076
- Painkillers.

1469
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,878
Um...uh, sure.
I must.

1470
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,079
Everything okay?

1471
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,782
- Oh, yeah,
just headaches.

1472
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,316
- Oh.
- I...he...

1473
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,952
My boyfriend.
Headache.

1474
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,920
- Sure. Come on in.
- Thank you.

1475
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,259
Ow.

1476
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:39,897
- Dougie?

1477
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:47,805
This fuckin' weekend.

1478
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,841
- I'm so sorry
to bother you.

1479
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,443
It's just really...
- Oh, no bother at all.

1480
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:55,112
Just let me see.

1481
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,783
In here.

1482
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,220
Hmm.
- Your house is awesome.

1483
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,989
- Oh, thanks.

1484
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:07,758
Just I'm not sure
where it would be.

1485
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:09,293
Let's see.

1486
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:11,996
Oh, maybe in here?

1487
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:12,997
Oh, whoa.
Oop. Jeez.

1488
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,298
Whoa.

1489
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,466
Oh.

1490
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:19,937
- Are you okay?

1491
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,839
Um, yeah.

1492
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:24,842
It's just, um...
My dog is, uh...

1493
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,976
around somewhere.

1494
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,311
I just...
I'm not sure where.

1495
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,415
- Oh.
- Uh, ibuprofen, not aspirin.

1496
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:32,883
Uh, yes.

1497
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,051
Yes.

1498
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,419
Thank you.
- Great. Great.

1499
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:37,054
- Do you want help...
Is your dog lost?

1500
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,956
Do you want help
finding him?

1501
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,190
- Oh, no, I'm sure he's around.
He'll show up.

1502
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:41,191
- Okay,
I'll keep an eye out.

1503
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:42,492
- Thanks.

1504
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:43,794
- Thank you.
I'll bring them back.

1505
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:44,929
- Sure.
- Great.

1506
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,063
- Thank you.

1507
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:49,867
- Hey.

1508
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,435
- Hey.

1509
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:54,972
How's your weekend going?

1510
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,874
- Fantastic.
And yours?

1511
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,475
- Great.

1512
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:06,016
Dougie?

1513
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,008
Wanna take a ferry?
I'll get it.

1514
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,109
- Yeah.
- Here.

1515
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,144
Okay, okay.
- Okay, 4:30.

1516
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,913
- 4:30?
- Yeah, what time is it?

1517
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,014
That's the last one.

1518
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,382
- Here.
- Fuck.

1519
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,484
It's...it's 4:27.

1520
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,252
- Oh, shit.
We got to hurry.

1521
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:43,520
- There's no way we can
make it in three minutes.

1522
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,521
- Yeah, there is.
We can make that.

1523
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,156
- Are you kidding?

1524
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,357
We can't make the ferry
in three minutes.

1525
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:48,525
Can you just
lie back down for me?

1526
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,860
Oh, my God,
look at your toes.

1527
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:51,161
Dougie.
- I know.

1528
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,162
- No, no, no.
We are not making it.

1529
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,430
We are not going anywhere.

1530
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:54,564
You're lying back down
right now.

1531
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:55,933
- Okay, fine.
- Look. Here.

1532
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,035
I got some of this for you.

1533
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,336
- I need...
- Where are you going?

1534
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,938
- I need water.
- I can get you wa...

1535
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,240
Let me take care of you.

1536
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:05,242
- Okay.
I just...

1537
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,044
- Hey, look at me.

1538
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:11,415
I'm here to help you.
Let me be here with you.

1539
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,083
- Okay.
I'm sorry.

1540
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:16,253
- I'll be right back.

1541
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,422
- Okay.

1542
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:19,456
- Okay.

1543
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,424
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1544
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,598
- Hey.

1545
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,267
- What took you so long?

1546
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:34,371
Dougie fuckin'
broke his arm or something.

1547
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:35,906
I don't know.
- Dougie broke his arm?

1548
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,542
- Yeah, he fell off his bike.

1549
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,645
- There's a moron.
- He's a fucking idiot.

1550
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,413
- It's a crazy...
Doug breaks his arm.

1551
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:46,383
I'm behind, like, the western,
like, Berlin Wall.

1552
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,619
It's so fuckin'... yeah.

1553
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,922
This is the stupidest... Okay.

1554
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:53,991
- Can you get it...

1555
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,159
Can you get over or something?

1556
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,426
Or if you stand...
- No. What?

1557
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,295
- I don't know.
- You bring the key?

1558
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,563
- Bring a key?
No, I didn't bring a key.

1559
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:00,697
You didn't tell me
to bring a key.

1560
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,199
I didn't know
there was a key.

1561
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,500
- What did you think
I was doing here?

1562
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,235
Does it look like
I wanted to have a chat?

1563
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,971
- Relax, okay?
Let me...let me call Jackie.

1564
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,338
- Yeah, please
come down to the fence.

1565
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,274
- All right, relax.
I get it, okay?

1566
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,493
- This is Jackie Stavros.

1567
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:32,196
- Voicemail.
- Of course.

1568
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,965
Does nobody answer their phones
on this island?

1569
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,667
It's like a policy like,
let's just, like...

1570
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,569
- Well, most people leave
their phones in their room

1571
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:40,670
when they go
on a beach weekend.

1572
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:42,339
- Oh, okay.

1573
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,673
Sarc...I got that.
Thank you.

1574
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:47,144
- You're welcome.
- Sarcasm, yeah.

1575
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,678
It was a two-minute
conversation.

1576
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,180
That's what it was.
A two-minute conversation.

1577
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,448
That's all it was.

1578
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,217
- Why'd you take the call,
though?

1579
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,220
- 'Cause...
Ugh.

1580
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,754
It was a two-minute call.

1581
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,156
- It's not about
how long it was.

1582
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,357
- Yes, it is.

1583
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,758
It was, like,
a two-minute call

1584
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,693
that you freaked out on
and you left.

1585
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,462
- We were in the middle
of something.

1586
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,497
- Yeah, well, we could
continue right afterward,

1587
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,233
but you, like,
abandoned me.

1588
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:10,467
- I was fuckin' pissed
at you.

1589
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,136
- You were pissed at me?

1590
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,370
- Yeah.

1591
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,372
You finally were
fucking honest with me,

1592
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,707
and you decided to take
the call from your fuckin' mom.

1593
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,709
- Okay, all right.
Forget the mom, okay?

1594
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,446
Maybe I should have not...
Okay, whatever, but...

1595
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,148
- No, you shouldn't have
taken the fuckin' call

1596
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,016
from your mom
right when you fuckin'...

1597
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,718
- Can we drop the call thing?
Can we drop the call thing?

1598
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:30,320
I wish I could tell you...

1599
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:31,788
Like, I wish I could
share this with you.

1600
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,190
I really...

1601
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:34,791
- So share it with me.
That's...

1602
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,693
- No, I really can't, though.
I really can't.

1603
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,428
I want to tell you
how I feel,

1604
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,730
but then as soon as I do,
I feel like you freak out.

1605
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,232
- You're not giving me
a fuckin' chance.

1606
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,134
You'll talk to anyone
but me.

1607
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,802
You'll talk to Jackie.
You'll talk to Jackie's friend.

1608
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,671
You'll talk to
your fuckin' mom.

1609
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:49,239
You probably talk to
the fuckin' bum on our street.

1610
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:50,407
But you won't
fuckin' talk to me.

1611
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,541
- James,
I want to talk to you.

1612
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:52,776
- So do it!

1613
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:54,244
Just tell me
how you fucking feel!

1614
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:56,280
- I'm scared to.

1615
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,415
I'm scared to 'cause
I don't know how you'll react.

1616
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:00,417
- I'm me.
You know fuckin' me.

1617
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,219
It's not a fuckin'
surprise.

1618
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,453
All I want to know is what

1619
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:04,754
you're actually
feeling about it.

1620
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:06,423
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1621
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,492
'Cause I'm so fuckin'
happy for you

1622
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,594
and I'm so goddamn
proud of you.

1623
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,062
You understand that?

1624
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:13,530
- Are you really?
- Yeah, I am.

1625
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,599
- You are excited,
but you're also terrified.

1626
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,301
And that part
you don't talk about ever.

1627
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,802
And so I'm here,
stuck with, like...

1628
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,105
with, like, all this, like,
these things in my head,

1629
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,307
and I don't know
who to talk to.

1630
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,142
So I talk to my mom,
the bum on the...

1631
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,810
I never talk to the bum
on the streets ever,

1632
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,745
but, like, I would...
I mean, I would.

1633
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,347
Okay, I don't know
what we're talking about.

1634
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,549
Why... This is...
I want to touch you right...

1635
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,818
Fences!

1636
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,723
It's like Romeo and fuckin'
Juliet right now.

1637
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,459
That's... like, you're on the
other side of the fence.

1638
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,328
This is... Oh, I don't know.

1639
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:46,330
I can't... I don't even know.
I don't even know.

1640
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,564
- That was a balcony.

1641
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,167
- Okay, it...Okay.

1642
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:52,769
I'm gonna do it.

1643
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:57,807
I'm gonna go.

1644
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,443
That's two years of our lives

1645
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:03,647
that we're not gonna
be together, and I...

1646
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,482
And how could you really be
excited about that?

1647
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:08,285
You know, how...
and that's why I don't...

1648
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:10,420
That's why I can't tell you
these things and...

1649
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:11,788
- But you're not
giving me any credit.

1650
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,290
- That's true; I'm not.

1651
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:14,458
- Of course
I'm excited for you

1652
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:15,725
and I'm happy for you.

1653
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,261
But, yeah,
you're gonna be gone,

1654
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:19,829
and I'm gonna be
fuckin' left alone.

1655
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,598
You get that?
I'm just doing me.

1656
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,801
I'm doing the same thing.
I'm not changing shit up.

1657
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,835
You're gonna fuckin' leave.

1658
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,771
Don't you get that?

1659
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:31,675
You're gonna fuckin' leave,
and I'm gonna be left here.

1660
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:36,146
Can't you fuckin'
understand that?

1661
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,182
And I'm not trying
to make you feel guilty.

1662
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,683
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad

1663
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,551
for getting in
or for being happy,

1664
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:42,752
but can't you just
put yourself

1665
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:45,189
in my fuckin' shoes
for a minute?

1666
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:52,829
Fuck.

1667
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:13,883
- Hey.

1668
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,264
I can't do this shit.

1669
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,598
Just...

1670
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:34,438
Do you know how to get back
to where I left you?

1671
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:35,572
- Come back here.
- Huh?

1672
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:37,274
- Come here.

1673
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,243
- Just...do you know
how to get back?

1674
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:45,449
Yes or no?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

1675
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:47,484
- All right,
I'll meet you there.

1676
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:25,255
- I can't believe you busted up
your feet like that.

1677
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,491
That's just crazy.
- I know.

1678
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:30,360
They hurt
like a motherfucker.

1679
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:34,798
Is your sister
still out there?

1680
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:35,965
- No.

1681
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:37,000
- Okay.

1682
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,868
- Why?

1683
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,439
- 'Cause she came in earlier,
and I kind of ducked her.

1684
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,274
- Why would it matter
if you saw her right now?

1685
01:10:44,308 --> 01:10:45,809
Why don't you
want them to know?

1686
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,511
- I know
it doesn't make sense.

1687
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:50,514
It's not like
they're not gonna find out.

1688
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:53,350
But...

1689
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,352
I don't know.
I don't...

1690
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,987
I don't want to be made fun of.

1691
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,824
- Who would make fun of you
for hurting yourself?

1692
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,926
- I...
I don't know.

1693
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:07,964
I get worried that
you will think less of me...

1694
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,637
If I'm not...

1695
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:19,008
I don't...I...
I strive for this...

1696
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:23,547
feeling that I can help you.

1697
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,715
- You're not wanting this
to be a partnership.

1698
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:29,085
I mean, in a relationship,
it's 50/50, buddy.

1699
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:33,857
It's you and me, and
we're gonna help each other.

1700
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,693
So if you're gonna...
if I'm gonna let you help me,

1701
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:38,695
then you have to
let me help you.

1702
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:40,597
- I know.
I know.

1703
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,399
And...

1704
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:45,569
I want your help.

1705
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:48,872
I just don't want to admit it.

1706
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,741
- I think one of
the sexiest strengths

1707
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:55,412
is recognizing
when you're scared.

1708
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:56,813
- Yeah?

1709
01:11:56,846 --> 01:12:00,116
- And I think you're
doing that right now.

1710
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,720
And I think
that's really attractive.

1711
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:06,656
- Yeah?
You getting off on me right now?

1712
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,592
Mm.

1713
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,893
- Thank you for sharing.

1714
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,895
- Thank you for helping.

1715
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,431
- God, I didn't fuckin' help.
I did this to you.

1716
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,732
- Oh, it's fine.

1717
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,935
- I was just, like,
so pushy and so...

1718
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,670
aggressive.

1719
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:24,007
And you know that
I get so competitive and...

1720
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,376
And I...I broke your wrist.

1721
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:27,477
I broke your wrist.

1722
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,380
- You didn't break my wrist.

1723
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:32,616
That fuckin' sidewalk did.

1724
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:35,852
- I know, but I kept mak...

1725
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,488
but I kept making...

1726
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:41,758
- Come here.

1727
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,461
- Baby, I'm really sorry.

1728
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:46,763
- You don't have to be.

1729
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,765
Come here.

1730
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:50,500
- I'm really sorry.

1731
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:51,768
- Hey.

1732
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,637
What I love the most about you

1733
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,573
is that you always
want to push me.

1734
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,108
- That you want
the competition.

1735
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:02,045
It makes me better.

1736
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:06,115
You make me try new things.

1737
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:07,951
And I can never fault you
for that.

1738
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,627
- Hey.

1739
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:19,496
Hey, little man.

1740
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:22,966
What's going on?

1741
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:25,669
Where's your owner?

1742
01:13:25,702 --> 01:13:26,703
Huh?

1743
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:33,510
Want to go on an adventure?

1744
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:35,812
Come on.

1745
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:38,147
Let's go.

1746
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,684
Al?

1747
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:22,959
- What are...

1748
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:24,794
Wait, wait, wait.

1749
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,596
Stay where you are, otherwise
this is really gonna hurt.

1750
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,968
- What are you doing
right now?

1751
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,037
You're...
you're falling apart.

1752
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,204
What are you doing?

1753
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,874
- I...

1754
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,976
am doing something
I've never done for you.

1755
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,811
- Is this just
because of last night?

1756
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:42,812
- Oh, no.

1757
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:44,981
This is because of today...

1758
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:47,216
and last night.

1759
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,619
- This is insane.
- Hey.

1760
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:53,289
I'm gonna need you to tell me
if I'm doing this right.

1761
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,658
Okay?

1762
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,960
- Can you help me
through it?

1763
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,896
These are not gonna work.

1764
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:12,308
- Uh...

1765
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,778
Is this anything
like it's supposed to feel?

1766
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:17,781
- That's exactly
how it's supposed to feel.

1767
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,182
- Okay.

1768
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,238
Hey, Alley cat?

1769
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:48,578
- Jackie?

1770
01:15:48,612 --> 01:15:51,114
- Um...

1771
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:52,215
- Jackie?

1772
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,053
Um...

1773
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:59,923
- Wha...
- I...

1774
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,230
- I...I got to go.
- Hey, Jackie.

1775
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:08,364
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Don't walk away...

1776
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,332
from me, please.

1777
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,269
Fuck!

1778
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:45,001
- Where'd you get a dog?

1779
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:47,103
- I don't know.
He was wandering around.

1780
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:49,873
So I thought I'd grab him
before some...

1781
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,307
I don't know.

1782
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,848
- He's cute.

1783
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,987
- Come on.

1784
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,321
It's back this way.

1785
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,892
- Hey.
- Hey.

1786
01:17:55,805 --> 01:18:00,076
I need you to know that...

1787
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:05,414
I understand you might be
pretty angry at me right now.

1788
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:07,784
And I understand that.

1789
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,218
- I'm not angry.

1790
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,757
- What are you feeling?

1791
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:22,431
I'm sad.

1792
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,067
And...

1793
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:32,141
Feel...guilty.

1794
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,142
- Why?

1795
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:34,878
- And I feel...

1796
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:40,950
We really have a problem.

1797
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:49,292
It just...

1798
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,795
became apparent to me.

1799
01:18:55,865 --> 01:19:00,003
- I don't think
we have a problem.

1800
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:01,838
- You know what
keeps popping in my head

1801
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:07,010
is that article
that Janine wrote.

1802
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:10,847
And how...
- That's not us.

1803
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,482
- I don't know.
I thought it was such BS.

1804
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:18,855
And now...

1805
01:19:18,888 --> 01:19:21,490
I don't know.

1806
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,492
Are we bed-dead?

1807
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:25,494
- Mm-mm.

1808
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:28,497
I want you all the time.

1809
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,999
- I want you.

1810
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,506
I want you always.

1811
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,042
- And forever.

1812
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:42,045
- And forever.

1813
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:43,546
- Hey, come here.

1814
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,452
- Hi.

1815
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,121
- You are the most...

1816
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:55,191
beautiful person
I have ever met.

1817
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:02,165
And I promise that
I will look at you every day.

1818
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,136
- I love you...
- I love you.

1819
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,905
- With every fiber of
my being.

1820
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:11,307
- Mm-hmm.

1821
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,910
- We just got to...
get over this hump.

1822
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:15,211
- Yeah.

1823
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,380
- That's all it is
is a hump.

1824
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:21,317
- Uh-huh.

1825
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,386
I need to say things out loud.
- Yeah.

1826
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:27,323
We need to be intentional with
each other and obvious.

1827
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:31,560
And maybe it's gonna take some
of the mystery away,

1828
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:33,629
but I think we got to do it.

1829
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,398
- Better than
being in the dark.

1830
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,100
I know.

1831
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:38,634
- Asleep and alone
in the dark.

1832
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,237
Yes.

1833
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,239
You're right.

1834
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,307
- Hey.

1835
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:46,575
Get it.

1836
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,944
Make a wish.

1837
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:53,950
I got a couple.

1838
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:58,321
All right.
Let's make a deal.

1839
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,956
- Okay.

1840
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:04,260
- From now on,
we're gonna be intentional.

1841
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:06,195
And honest with each other.

1842
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:07,263
- And obvious.

1843
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,597
- And obvious and blatant.

1844
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:11,134
Even if it sounds stupid.

1845
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,468
- It's gonna sound
really stupid.

1846
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,037
But we'll get through it.

1847
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,072
I think we can make it...
we can make it sexy.

1848
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:18,407
We'll make it, like,
a role-playing thing.

1849
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:20,509
- Well, once we're doing it,
it doesn't matter.

1850
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,045
- That's true.

1851
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:23,379
- Just the getting there
might be a little...

1852
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:25,614
- I know.
Bumpy.

1853
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:28,151
I'm in a mosquito cloud.

1854
01:21:28,184 --> 01:21:31,154
- You're in a beauty cloud.

1855
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:37,260
- Come here.

1856
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,228
I want to smash my face
into your face.

1857
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:43,666
- I want to dig my teeth into
your guts and rip 'em out.

1858
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,301
- But I need them.

1859
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:46,936
- I'll put 'em back.
- Okay, good.

1860
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,938
- After I'm done
chewin' 'em.

1861
01:21:48,972 --> 01:21:50,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

1862
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:51,640
- So we have a deal?

1863
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:52,641
- We have a deal.

1864
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:53,642
- Maybe...yeah.

1865
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:54,643
- And...
- And...

1866
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:57,313
- Jackie.
- What?

1867
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,649
- I really want to
have sex in that boat.

1868
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:02,018
- That...that boat?

1869
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,319
Yeah.

1870
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:04,487
- I don't know
whose boat that is.

1871
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,322
- I don't care.

1872
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,490
- You want to break
onto a boat?

1873
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:08,657
and fuck on a boat?

1874
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:09,725
I do.

1875
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,328
- I at least
want to try it.

1876
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,496
- Okay.

1877
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:14,697
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1878
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:18,334
You are turning me
into a scalawag.

1879
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,503
Okay.

1880
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,338
- All right, let's go.

1881
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:23,973
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

1882
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,613
- What do you think
his name is?

1883
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,515
- Jack.
- Jack?

1884
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,050
- Mm-hmm.

1885
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,220
- You love the name Jack.

1886
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:38,321
- Jack.

1887
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:46,529
Do you fetch, Jack?
- What's that?

1888
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:47,763
- Look at this.
- You gonna get it?

1889
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,365
- Look what I found.

1890
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:50,533
Yeah?
- Go on.

1891
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:51,567
Go get it.

1892
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:23,099
- I love you.

1893
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,371
I love you too...

1894
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:34,243
Like, a lot.

1895
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,816
Don't milk my thumb.

1896
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:41,817
- Mm.
- Stop it.

1897
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,552
I hate that.

1898
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,300
- I'm really sorry.

1899
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,434
- I was just gonna say that.

1900
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:15,151
Have you ever taken
the Amtrak?

1901
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:17,553
It's a nice train

1902
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,622
to Chicago on the Amtrak.

1903
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:22,325
- Yeah, I might take a flight
over a train.

1904
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:23,326
- Oh, yeah?

1905
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,161
- Yeah.
- Huh.

1906
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:26,395
Less romantic.

1907
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:29,465
But a lot quicker.

1908
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:40,409
- Is this my shirt?

1909
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:41,744
- Maybe.

1910
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,614
- This is definitely
my shirt.

1911
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,150
- You have better
T-shirts than me.

1912
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:48,817
- I've been looking
for this shirt.

1913
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:55,824
- I'll be keeping it.

1914
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,738
Come here.

1915
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,308
- Ow!

1916
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:13,542
Okay.

1917
01:25:13,576 --> 01:25:15,511
Hold on. Let me stash that.
- Uh.

1918
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,846
How does...

1919
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:26,622
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1920
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:27,790
- Ow.
- You okay?

1921
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:29,258
- Yeah, I'm good.

1922
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,168
- What the fuck?

1923
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:58,581
- Oh, my goodness.
There he is.

1924
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:00,583
Oh, you found him!

1925
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,718
Oh, thank you.

1926
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:06,955
Where have you been?
Oh, you had me worried all day.

1927
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:08,957
You know, this time of year
no one's around.

1928
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:10,859
I didn't think
I would see him till...

1929
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,695
I don't know...
tomorrow morning.

1930
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:13,996
I was just so scared.

1931
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:15,364
- I found him
over by the beach.

1932
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:17,300
- Oh, oh.
- He's sweet.

1933
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,634
- Oh, I do appreciate it.
- Yeah.

1934
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:19,902
- I wouldn't have known
what to do.

1935
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:21,837
Yeah.

1936
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:23,306
- He's a cutie.
- Really, thank you.

1937
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:24,773
- That's amazing.
- Oh, hi.

1938
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27,510
Yes, yes, your friends here
found him, actually.

1939
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:29,445
- Yeah.
- You guys found her dog?

1940
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,579
- Yeah.
- They did. They did.

1941
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:32,448
- Nice.

1942
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:34,717
- Again, thank you.
- Oh, I brought these for you.

1943
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,519
Thank you so much
for letting me borrow them.

1944
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:37,520
That was so nice of you.

1945
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:38,854
- Great.
Everything okay?

1946
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:42,057
Yeah, headache all gone.
- Good, good, good.

1947
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,460
You're staying with...
at the Gregorys'.

1948
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,429
You're friends of...

1949
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:47,663
or family?

1950
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:50,666
- Yeah.

1951
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,001
- Friend...fam...
Family friends.

1952
01:27:53,035 --> 01:27:54,437
- Family friends.
- Family friends of them.

1953
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,671
both: Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1954
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:56,972
- The Gregorys, yeah.
- Way back.

1955
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,007
Okay, good.

1956
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:01,043
- Well, again, thank you.

1957
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:02,745
- Of course.
You have a good night now.

1958
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,380
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

1959
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:06,415
- Bye-bye.
Come on.

1960
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:07,983
- Jackie's last name
is not Gregory.

1961
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,818
- Yeah, let's just go.

1962
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:11,720
Come on, let's go in.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1963
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:12,955
- Let's go.
- Later.

1964
01:28:12,988 --> 01:28:14,690
- We got to warn them.

1965
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:15,958
Let's go find Jackie.

1966
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:17,693
- All right, you get them.
- Now. Al?

1967
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:19,995
Hey, Jackie?

1968
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:24,733
Okay, uh...
- Fuck.

1969
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:27,570
Our bags and then
cleaning the house.

1970
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:32,040
Jackie?

1971
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:33,476
Girls, are you in here?

1972
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:34,510
Guys?

1973
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:36,979
- Um...

1974
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,614
we're busy.

1975
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,350
- Okay, now's not
the time for that.

1976
01:28:41,384 --> 01:28:42,818
Well, sorry to interrupt,
but, Jackie,

1977
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:44,086
this is not your
Aunt Linda's house.

1978
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:48,090
- Wait. What?

1979
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:49,392
- Come...can you come out here,
please?

1980
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:50,893
- What?

1981
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:52,127
- This is a family
named the Gregorys' home,

1982
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,829
and now we are
trespassing.

1983
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:56,799
So we have to get out of here
right now, okay?

1984
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,601
The boys have already
started packing.

1985
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:00,369
We have to leave,
'cause we're breaking in.

1986
01:29:00,403 --> 01:29:01,604
- Yeah, let's go.

1987
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:03,572
Fuck!

1988
01:29:03,606 --> 01:29:05,608
- Yeah, I got the dishes.

1989
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:06,942
- I don't know.

1990
01:29:06,975 --> 01:29:08,577
I don't think
we should keep this.

1991
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:10,446
- Putting dishes over here,
if that's...

1992
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:11,847
- All right, that's great, Doug.

1993
01:29:13,482 --> 01:29:15,751
- Oh!
- Oh!

1994
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,386
- Sorry, Gregorys!

1995
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,687
- Good old Gregory.

1996
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:53,689
- Got it?
- I got it.

1997
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,090
- Don't let it slam.

1998
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:57,726
- Do you guys know
where we're walking?

1999
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,127
- Sorry, baby.

2000
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:45,941
- Jackie, you fucked it up.

2001
01:30:49,077 --> 01:30:50,913
- Thank you.
- Well done.

2002
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,915
Well done.
Let's drink to that.

2003
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,249
- There's gonna be
police waiting for us,

2004
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,484
like, outside of the ferry.

2005
01:30:55,518 --> 01:30:56,785
- I wonder who the Gregorys are.

2006
01:30:56,819 --> 01:30:58,521
I feel like I know them so well.

2007
01:30:58,554 --> 01:31:00,723
- Anybody strip their sheets?

2008
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:03,559
- Oh.
- Boo.

2009
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,794
- 'Cause we definitely
made 'em dirty.

2010
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:07,195
- Yeah, ours is...

2011
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:08,263
- All right.

2012
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:11,033
- Um, to...fucking it up.

2013
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:13,001
- Yeah, hey,
but recovering gracefully.

2014
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:14,703
Huh?

2015
01:31:14,737 --> 01:31:16,505
- You're sentimental.
- Oh, my God, guys.

2016
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:17,773
I love you better
for it.

2017
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,207
all: Cheers.

2018
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:21,143
- This is big.

2019
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:22,144
- I have to prepare myself.

2020
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:23,145
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

2021
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,681
- God, you guys
all did that in one?

2022
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:26,815
- Oh, yeah.

2023
01:31:40,262 --> 01:31:42,698
Hi.
- Hi.

2024
01:31:42,731 --> 01:31:46,068
- Um, so...

2025
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:47,836
So...

2026
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:49,972
- Just...

2027
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:54,076
wanted to say that...

2028
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:56,779
uh...

2029
01:31:56,812 --> 01:31:59,014
I, uh, want to know...

2030
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,852
Communication, communication.
- My little weirdo.

2031
01:32:03,886 --> 01:32:05,788
Do you want to have sex?

2032
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:07,022
- Um...

2033
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:10,025
- What are...
what are you thinking?

2034
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:11,193
What are you...

2035
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:13,896
- I think that I am so tired.

2036
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,331
- Happy, but so tired.

2037
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,933
- Yes, me too.

2038
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:19,735
- And I just kind of
want to go to sleep.

2039
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:21,937
- Yeah.
We had a long day.

2040
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,939
- We broke into a house.
- Yeah, we did.

2041
01:32:23,972 --> 01:32:26,274
- Then we broke
into a second one.

2042
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:27,743
- All right.
- Okay.

2043
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,945
So...
- Thank you for asking, though.

2044
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:32,280
That was lovely.
- Sure thing.

2045
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:33,281
I'll do it every night.

2046
01:32:33,315 --> 01:32:34,617
Okay.

2047
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:35,818
It'll be a part of
our ritual.

2048
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:36,952
- Okay.

2049
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,722
- I love you.
- I love you.

2050
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:45,961
- I'm gonna put my strip...
- Okay, do it.

2051
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:48,831
- And my guard.

2052
01:32:48,864 --> 01:32:50,298
Stop it.

2053
01:32:50,332 --> 01:32:51,767
- You're kind of like
a football player.

2054
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,968
You're such a bitch.

2055
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:54,837
- Like a sleep
football player.

2056
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:59,307
- We should get you
some eye black too.

2057
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,309
- Okay.
Surprise me in the morning.

2058
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:04,079
Okay.

2059
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:05,681
- Good night.
- Okay, I love you.

2060
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:08,383
I love you.

2061
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,696
- Prevent further intruders.

2062
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,999
- You got the smiles
this morning.

2063
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:29,171
- Yeah.

2064
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:31,006
I think I figured
something out.

2065
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:32,908
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, maybe.

2066
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,042
- Yeah, you want to write
a book about it?

2067
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:35,778
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah?

2068
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:37,412
- I'm gonna write a whole book
of poems about it.

2069
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,947
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

2070
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:40,749
- Just a whole book
of lezzie poems.

2071
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:45,020
Do you want to be
a contributor?

2072
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:47,823
- Oh, yeah, I think I got some
real good stuff for you.

2073
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:49,424
- Got some good ones this
weekend?

2074
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,693
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

2075
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:52,360
- Yeah.
Real emotional.

2076
01:33:56,398 --> 01:33:57,800
- Do you need to scream?

2077
01:34:01,003 --> 01:34:02,037
- I don't think so.

2078
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,371
- Okay.

2079
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:05,373
- Do you?

2080
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:06,742
- Mm-mm.

2081
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:11,113
- I think we're good.

2082
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,317
- All right, that's it.

2083
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,219
See you, Gregorys.

2084
01:34:17,252 --> 01:34:18,754
It's been real.

2085
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:25,060
Let's do it, baby.

2086
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:26,228
Oh, hey!

2087
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:28,130
Oh, look at you.
- Look at this.

2088
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,197
- Doug, you're really
milking it.

2089
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:31,066
- Oh, yeah.

2090
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,768
- You're really milking it
for everything it's worth.

2091
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,402
Yeah.
- Don't worry.

2092
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:36,071
Jeeves will get a great tip
when we're done.

2093
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:38,006
- Yeah.
- Shit.

2094
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,407
Move along.
One second.

2095
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:40,943
- Hey, we got
the ferry in five.

2096
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:42,377
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be back.

2097
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,922
Yeah.

2098
01:34:53,956 --> 01:34:55,023
- Yay!

2099
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:11,439
- Isn't it
just like the sea

2100
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:15,811
To come between you and me

2101
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:20,282
On the water you'd be

2102
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:24,052
As I watched with anxiety

2103
01:35:24,086 --> 01:35:28,757
You'd say don't hate the sea
from the shore

2104
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:34,262
The ocean was here
long before

2105
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:39,301
The land

2106
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:44,472
Take my hand

2107
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:48,777
Come out here with me

2108
01:35:48,811 --> 01:35:53,148
Of course I'd never leave

2109
01:35:53,181 --> 01:36:01,156
And you'd float out to sea

2110
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:03,558
Ah-ah-ah

2111
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,161
Ah-ah

2112
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:10,165
Ah-ah-ah-ah

2113
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:14,236
Ah-ah-ah

2114
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:18,473
Ah-ah-ah

2115
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,978
Ah-ah-ah

2116
01:36:23,011 --> 01:36:27,049
Ah-ah-ah-ah

2117
01:36:27,082 --> 01:36:31,353
Ah-ah-ah

2118
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:11,526
Isn't it just like the sea

2119
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:15,898
To come between you and me

2120
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:20,368
Out on the water you'd be

2121
01:37:20,402 --> 01:37:24,106
As I watched with anxiety

2122
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:29,277
You'd say don't hate the sea
from the shore

2123
01:37:29,311 --> 01:37:35,417
The ocean was here
long before
