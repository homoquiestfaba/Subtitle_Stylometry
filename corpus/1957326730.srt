- Yeah.

7
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,555
- Yeah.

8
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,039
- This isn't one of
those stories where like

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,884
everybody does the right thing.

10
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,319
- The whole thing happened once.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,409
Literally once.

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,329
- And here we are still talking about it.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,639
- We met at Coachella.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,459
- So there was this big party.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,039
- I had literally just
gotten out of a relationship.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,499
- I was actually there with another girl.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,999
- His ex.
- But then I saw her.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,729
- Went to a gig for my
friend Doug's new album.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,509
Totally over the top.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,749
- It was one of those sexy,
slow motion kind of things

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,589
where we looked into each other's eyes

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,469
and it was across this sea of drunk people

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,909
with flower crowns, and we just clicked.

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,770
- End up going home with a random guy

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,879
and having the best sex of my life.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,739
In the morning I wake up
and I realize it's Sean.

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,799
- Me.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,181
- The guy I had just broken up with.

29
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:26,629
- And we ended up staying
until three in the morning,

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,549
just talking.
- We slept under the stars.

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,519
- Drinking.
- Dancing.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,845
- Everything just kind of glowing.

33
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,141
- And we spent the whole day boning.

34
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:37,777
- You know, it's weird.

35
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:40,589
Sometimes you meet somebody
and it's just easy.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,549
- That was three years ago.

37
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,649
- And we've been together ever since.

38
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,619
- She ended up moving to
Kansas City two weeks later.

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,909
- But we're not one of
THOSE couples, you know.

40
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,419
People don't look at us and think

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,849
I'll have what they're having.

42
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,009
- We're not perfect.

43
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,669
We haven't figured it out.

44
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,259
- You know, we're grateful. We got lucky.

45
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,883
We had that one perfect night.

46
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:06,429
♪ You know I'm talking about love ♪

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
- Fuck.

48
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,569
- Bad day?

49
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,879
- Uh, yeah, something like that.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,159
- What happened?

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,579
- My boyfriend broke up with me.

52
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,379
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
- Yeah.

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,871
The worst part is that he
was sleeping with my best fr-

55
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,559
- I'm sure you'll
find the right guy.

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,929
- It's not about the guy.

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,829
- Yeah. Being single sucks.

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,307
I feel like I'm just waiting for someone,

59
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,699
but then that one special
guy will come along

60
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,409
and everything will be different.

61
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,849
- Yeah, doesn't that
seem kind of unrealistic?

62
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,683
- What do you mean?

63
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,759
- I mean, don't you think
it's unfair to act like

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,109
one person is going to change
your life and fix everything?

65
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,029
Well, what are the odds that some guy's

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,619
just gonna materialize, right?

67
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,419
He's gonna show up out of nowhere...

68
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,253
- Sorry.

69
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,253
Didn't realize this was the ladies room.

70
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,720
Hey.

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,553
- Oh.

72
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,553
- I'm Chris.

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,719
- Hey Chris.

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,179
- Hey.
- Do you know each other?

75
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
- No.

76
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,563
- I hope this isn't too
forward, but you're beautiful.

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,529
You remind me of my mom.

78
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,530
She's dead.

79
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,483
- That's so sweet.

80
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,363
- I like your dress.

81
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,653
- I like your shirt.

82
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,929
- Wow. We have so much in common.

83
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,229
- Okay. I would not say that...

84
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,543
Okay. Wow.

85
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,083
Sorry.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,793
Don't even think about it.

87
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,670
- You're popular.

88
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,114
- Yeah, I really wouldn't
fuck with me right now.

89
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,846
- Who's Bryn?

90
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,829
- Don't you need to make ice or something?

91
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,830
- You're feisty.

92
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,019
I like it.

93
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,403
- Just make me a drink.

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,389
Oh, that's it.

95
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,029
Do it to me.

96
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,920
Do it, Gary.

97
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,860
- Knock it off!
- Oh!

98
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,429
What?
- Seriously?

99
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,630
What are you, 12?
- No.

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,749
But he is.

101
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,720
- No, he's not.

102
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,449
- Yes he is.

103
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,969
- No, he's not. They're like at least 16.

104
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,539
- 16?

105
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,489
No way, that kid is still
waiting on his balls to drop.

106
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,323
- They're kind of cute.

107
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,260
- No.

108
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,999
I'm serious, he wouldn't even
let her order her own salad.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,279
- Maybe he knows what she likes.

110
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,599
- Or maybe he's a chauvinistic asshole

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,779
leveraging power in an
attempt to objectify her

112
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,089
as an homage to his own social privilege.

113
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,409
Did you ever think about that?

114
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,319
- Or maybe he's just being nice,

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,779
'cause they're in love and
he wants her to be happy.

116
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,669
- Nobody's that happy.

117
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,550
- Some people would disagree.

118
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,000
- Some people can eat a dick.

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Okay.

120
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,030
- 79 and 80.

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,853
- Surprise.

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,953
- What are you doing here?

123
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,299
- I wanted to stop by and see my girl.

124
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,859
Here.

125
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,083
- What's the occasion?

126
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,229
- Can't a guy treat his girlfriend?

127
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,319
- Yeah, he can but the last time

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,209
you were this civil it's
because you ran over Mittens.

129
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,989
- That was an accident.
- What's with the flowers?

130
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,073
- I'm being romantic.

131
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,129
Forget it.

132
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,149
- No, look, come on. They're pretty, okay?

133
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
Thank you.

134
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,029
Do you want to get lunch or something?

135
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,049
- You mind driving?

136
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,529
- Yeah. Sure, um let
me just get my charger.

137
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,530
It's in your car.

138
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,332
- Oh, oh. I am, I am so sorry.

139
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,543
Are you okay?

140
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,833
- Busted. Where's your hair thingy?

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,149
- Shit.

142
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,983
- Just grab another one.

143
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,937
There's a whole bag in the store room.

144
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,899
- You said we only got one.

145
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,639
- Yeah, because certain employees

146
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,479
were abusing their privileges.

147
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,489
- Those things are foul, okay?

148
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,959
Why can't we just wear name
tags like normal people?

149
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,710
- But I thought you guys
liked the hair thingies.

150
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,544
- No.

151
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,699
The hair thingies makes me
look like Molly Ringwald, okay?

152
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
Anyways, I'm sorry.

153
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,449
Can we please talk about
my idiot boyfriend?

154
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,859
What is with the romantic shit?

155
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,519
- He's trying.

156
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
- I know.

157
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,610
Love ya.

158
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:10,623
- Later, "Molly."

159
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:50,739
- Yeah, it's super good, too.

160
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,947
No, I know...

161
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,599
- What are we talking about over here?

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,729
- Oh, Jude was just telling me about-

163
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,563
- Fascinating.

164
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,099
Did you know he uses the
word "penis" during foreplay?

165
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,233
As in "honey, my penis is so hard."

166
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:07,079
- All right?

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,029
- No, I don't think we've
been properly introduced.

168
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,259
Jude, this is Jessie.

169
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,939
Jessie, Jude is the
guy you've been banging

170
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,719
in the back of a '97 Subaru.

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,109
- You think I've been screwing him?

172
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,269
- I don't even know her.

173
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,259
- Fine, then what the fuck is that?

174
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,789
- It's probably yours.

175
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,529
Just because you can't
keep track of your shit.

176
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,363
- Oh, it's not mine.

177
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:24,549
- How do you know?
- I just do.

178
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,859
- It doesn't matter whose it is.

179
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,866
- You're taking her side?
- Nobody's taking sides.

180
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:28,700
- No, of course not.

181
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,419
We're just politely
listening to two people

182
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,599
exchange their sides of a story

183
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,209
in which one of them fucked my boyfriend.

184
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,140
- You need to calm down.

185
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:35,259
- Is that what we'd be doing

186
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,886
if somebody took a shit on your love life?

187
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,629
- You don't love him.

188
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,649
- What?

189
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,569
- I said you don't love
him. You hardly like him.

190
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,669
- What do you know?

191
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,139
- Everybody knows.

192
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,169
You treat him like shit,
you hate his family,

193
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,299
and the only reason why you're with him

194
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,649
in the first place is
because he has Amazon Prime.

195
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,889
You don't deserve him.

196
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,469
- And that makes it okay for
someone to just take him?

197
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,586
- Nobody took him.
- Okay well somebody did.

198
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,609
Somebody-
- I didn't take him, Harper.

199
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,943
He just didn't want you.

200
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,210
Harper-
- Don't.

201
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,383
- We never meant-
- Shut up.

202
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:15,579
You know, you were supposed to be cool,

203
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,279
now it turns out you're
just some old slut.

204
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,173
- You're fired.
- Good, 'cause I quit.

205
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,149
- Hey. Aren't you forgetting something?

206
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,409
- God, you know, fuck you.

207
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,243
Okay?

208
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:34,589
And for the record, I hope
you give each other HPV.

209
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Yeah.

210
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,679
- Hey, sorry I missed your call.

211
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,939
Leave a message and I'll give
you a shout as soon as I can.

212
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,583
Thanks.

213
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,090
- Why does this always happen to me?

214
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,570
- There are plenty of fish out there.

215
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,903
- What, like Jude?

216
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,499
I shouldn't have been such a dick to him.

217
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,579
You know, he's a totally nice guy.

218
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,673
He's very nice and...

219
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,833
Nice.

220
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,589
I should probably go home and apologize.

221
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,749
- It sounds like you guys had bad sex.

222
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,583
- What?

223
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,573
No, it was fine.

224
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,399
- Well, there's your problem.

225
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
See a better man would
leave you begging for it.

226
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,269
I know a guy.

227
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,839
- I'm not looking for a guy.

228
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,859
- Whatever.

229
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,089
Girls like you act all tough,

230
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,382
say you don't care what people think-

231
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,549
- I don't care what people think.

232
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,579
- And how's that working out for you?

233
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,439
- Look, I'm pissed at Bryn, not Jude.

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,859
She was my best friend.

235
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,923
I need friends, not some
guy to fuck my brains out.

236
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,219
- That sounds like a challenge.

237
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,053
- I'm sorry.

238
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,559
You know, believe it or
not, women can be single

239
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,501
and also into you.

240
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,002
- Okay, all right.

241
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,879
So are you doing anything later?

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,299
- I am just not interested.

243
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,389
- Oh, come on.

244
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,029
Something tells me we'd have great sex.

245
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,763
- Yeah, and I'm gonna go.

246
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,770
- You're gonna die alone.

247
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:24,714
Fucking bitch.

248
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,969
- Why is my shit in the yard?

249
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,070
- I'm kicking you out.

250
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,123
- Do you have any idea
how selfish you are?

251
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,369
- You should be thanking me.

252
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,879
- For sleeping with my boss?

253
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,860
- For breaking up with you.

254
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,469
- Are you fucking kidding me?

255
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,839
- You didn't want to
date in the first place.

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,449
- That is not true.
- But you wouldn't end it

257
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,469
because you didn't want to be the bad guy.

258
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,209
Nothing bad is ever your fault, right?

259
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,829
It's always someone else.

260
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,719
Last guy loved you too much.

261
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,349
But the guy before him was too clingy.

262
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,349
Your mom was never involved.,
your dad had to go-

263
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,369
- You fucked my best friend.
- She was your boss.

264
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,720
- She was my friend.
- Well she's not anymore.

265
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,341
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:38,899
- Hey, I'm calling about
the Johnson property.

267
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,009
Yeah, uh, references?

268
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,889
Yeah, I'm calling about the apartment.

269
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,049
Well, my last landlord was my ex, so...

270
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,959
Oh yeah. I love cats.

271
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,219
Cats are great.

272
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,699
Yeah to be honest, I
don't own any handguns,

273
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,309
but I would be open to purchasing one.

274
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,759
Yeah, even if they're...

275
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,939
How many?

276
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,979
No, I'm not saying we didn't have sex.

277
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,369
I'm just saying most of the time it was...

278
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,370
Hello?

279
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,949
- Thank you for holding.

280
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,150
Please stay on the line.

281
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,739
Thank you for holding.

282
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,000
Please stay on the line.

283
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,671
- Ow.

284
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,847
Ugh.

285
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,963
- Uh, excuse me.

286
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:49,963
What are you doing here?

287
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:52,523
- Pizza.

288
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,985
- What?

289
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,436
- There's pizza in your yard.

290
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
- Um...

291
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,533
What happened?

292
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
- Um...

293
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,170
Hard to say.

294
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,259
Raccoons these days.

295
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
- Uh huh.

296
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,403
Why are you in my yard?

297
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,003
- I heard you're looking for a roommate.

298
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,620
- Here.
- Thank you.

299
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Thanks.

300
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,909
- Are you okay? Do you
need me to call someone?

301
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,229
- Look, I thought the
house was empty, okay?

302
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,400
If you want me to go, I'll just-

303
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,829
- Babe.

304
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,993
I'm leaving.

305
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,030
Who's she?

306
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,289
- Harper.

307
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,489
- What's she doing here?

308
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,063
- I tried to
break into your house.

309
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,543
- Cool.

310
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:22,063
Hey, call me.

311
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,663
- Is she your...

312
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,663
- Friend.

313
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,779
- Do you have a lot of friends?

314
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,969
- Yeah.

315
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,319
I mean, no. I mean I don't-

316
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,300
- Are they all that hot?

317
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,909
- No.
- Are you sure?

318
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,229
- Yes. I have a lot of extremely
average looking friends.

319
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,230
- Wow.

320
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,999
That is very evolved of you.

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
- Thank you?

322
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,560
- So are you going to show me around or...

323
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,839
- Uh, yeah.

324
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,289
Um, well, you've seen the living room.

325
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,119
Two bedroom, one bath,
pool, two car garage.

326
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,163
- Is this you?

327
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
- Yeah.
- Hm.

328
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,119
How do you afford this place?

329
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,059
- I know a guy.
- Who's that guy?

330
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,749
- My mom.

331
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,989
Washer and dryer are right here.

332
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,109
This is the bathroom.

333
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,319
You'll be in the master.

334
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,537
There's no bathroom, but the-

335
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,371
- What's this?
- The closest is massive.

336
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:20,204
Um, no I-
- Oh, God.

337
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:21,163
- I wanna show you the, don't...

338
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:23,819
- What is this?
- Don't touch that, please.

339
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,419
- Oh my God.

340
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,469
- Don't laugh.

341
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,659
- Oh my God. Okay, I'm sorry.

342
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,159
But the fact that you have this photo,

343
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,529
not just kept it but
framed it in your house.

344
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,459
- Okay.
- You didn't even win.

345
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,089
- People don't usually
go through my stuff.

346
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,379
- Oh, maybe you should be more careful

347
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,783
who you let into your house.

348
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,180
Awe.

349
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,109
- I think you should go.

350
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,793
- What?
- You should go.

351
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,106
- Okay.

352
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,420
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

353
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,779
My personality tends to attract assholes,

354
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,330
so I'm not used to...

355
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,639
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Okay?

357
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,049
And for the record, I think
you were an adorable child,

358
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,209
even if you were not cool.

359
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,393
I'm still not cool and I was
like a very ugly child, so.

360
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,390
- He sucked.

361
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,659
This kid, he wasn't adorable.

362
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,819
He was just shitty.

363
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,319
- Why?

364
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,139
- Because he was weird and awkward

365
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,299
and everybody hated him.

366
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,419
- Yeah, but I bet he
stayed up like all night

367
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,070
working on that...

368
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,503
- Pneumatic defamation sensor?
- Yeah, exactly.

369
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:01,816
I have no idea what that is.

370
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,079
- It's a um, it's a soft air bladder

371
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,789
connected to an electrical pressure sensor

372
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,473
and a microcontroller that
offers real-time feedback.

373
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,663
It was cool, I promise.

374
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
- Told ya.

375
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,210
- Hey.

376
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,388
What are you doing for dinner?

377
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,153
So what do you do?

378
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:29,639
Are you a student or-
- Graduated.

379
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,291
- Major?
- Art history.

380
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,125
- Because?

381
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,349
- Because it was the
second thing in the catalog

382
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,870
and I didn't want to be an accountant.

383
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:36,446
You?

384
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:37,279
- Uh, business.

385
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,359
I'm a freelance programmer at IndieCorp.

386
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,619
- Mm, sounds pretentious.

387
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,489
- Most people just
congratulate my brilliance.

388
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,739
- Is this your way of flirting?

389
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,429
- No. Why, do you have a boyfriend?

390
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,869
- No.

391
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,969
Why, do you?

392
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,803
- Have a boyfriend?

393
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,349
- Yeah, or whatever.

394
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,880
- No, I don't have a
boyfriend or whatever.

395
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:55,499
- And the girl today?

396
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
- Just a girl.

397
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,409
- I'm getting very slutty vibes from you.

398
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,243
- What does that mean?

399
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,803
It means: how many?

400
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,010
- Excuse me?
- Women.

401
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,519
How many?

402
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,979
- Why would I tell you that?

403
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,659
- Uh, because you're the kind
of guy who wants me to know.

404
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,989
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Fine.

405
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,040
How many girlfriends?

406
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,703
- 12.

407
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:19,570
- 12?

408
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,420
- What's wrong with dating?

409
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:22,219
- What's wrong with being alone?

410
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,053
- Nothing.

411
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:23,886
It's just the worst thing that could

412
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:24,969
possibly happen to a person,

413
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,309
and I'd rather it didn't happen to me.

414
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,749
- Oh, but I bet you're fine with marriage.

415
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,199
- Yeah.
- And kids,

416
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,449
raising another human.

417
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,499
- Sure. Why not?

418
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,409
- Okay, so what you're
saying is you're fine

419
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,749
bringing life into the world,

420
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,569
but you're afraid of eating dinner alone

421
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,320
because that would make you
some kind of moral failure?

422
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:44,119
Mm, you're one of those people.

423
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,589
- What people?
- The "love" people.

424
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,580
- What's wrong with that?

425
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:51,919
- Nothing. Nothing,
it's just um, not real.

426
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,949
Okay, you're going to
spend the rest of your life

427
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,339
chasing after girls you don't know,

428
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,839
trying to have this big, special thing

429
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,199
that Hollywood duped you into believing

430
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,629
would make you happy when the reality is

431
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,589
love is just attraction,

432
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,299
attraction is just sex, and
sex isn't going to make you

433
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,429
happy for more than like
six minutes at a time.

434
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,969
So really what's the point?

435
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,049
- First of all, you underestimate me.

436
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,883
- Whatever.

437
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,669
- Second of all, do you
seriously believe that?

438
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,579
- Do you seriously believe you're destined

439
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,383
to hang out with one person until you die?

440
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,859
- Yeah.

441
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
I do.

442
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,803
- Wow. I guess that makes one of us right.

443
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,876
Let me know when you figure out who it is.

444
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,219
Well thank you for dinner
and showing me around.

445
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,739
Um, if you want to just send
over that paperwork, I will-

446
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,573
- Take it.

447
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:48,406
- What?

448
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:50,219
- The room, it's yours. Take it.

449
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,207
- We didn't talk about money.

450
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,276
- What were you paying at your old place?

451
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:55,843
- $750, but-
- Great, works for me.

452
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,779
- That's super nice, but your parents-

453
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,529
- Look, they don't care.

454
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,259
The roommate thing wasn't even their idea.

455
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,239
- You know how this sounds, right?

456
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,629
Seemingly innocent young man
invites beautiful stranger

457
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,774
to spend the night and then-

458
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:10,019
- Are you waiting for me
to gouge your eyes out

459
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,900
and put them in a jar?

460
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,449
- Well, maybe not a jar, but yeah.

461
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,283
- Look, you've seen this place.

462
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:16,699
It's massive and like super depressing.

463
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,159
In college I always lived
with groups of people,

464
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,554
so this just seems sad.

465
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:22,544
- Yeah, this is where
I go back to the jar.

466
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,348
- Just think about it.

467
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,293
Why me?

468
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,290
- I don't know.

469
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,759
You're loud and weird and have no respect

470
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,549
for other people's
property and not to mention

471
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,393
you're totally not my type,

472
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,583
but you're smart and different.

473
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,540
- When can I move in?

474
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,179
I don't even know your name.

475
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,163
- Oh, um, it's Jackson.

476
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
- Cool.

477
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,090
- See you tomorrow.

478
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:05,749
Oh um, but do me a favor.

479
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,293
Use the front door this time.

480
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,929
- Uh, we were actually never together.

481
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,819
- Yeah, not TOGEHTER together.

482
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,019
- Right.

483
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,329
I had brought her to my grandmother's

484
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,649
birthday party, actually,

485
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,169
and everybody like just
about lost their shit.

486
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,249
My mom kept talking about how
precious my little friend was.

487
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,090
- I don't think they got

488
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,679
that we were a couple.

489
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,499
- Yeah, but we weren't
actually like dating.

490
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,639
- Oh, we just were hanging out, you know?

491
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,039
- Yeah.

492
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,709
Oh man and you had those,
like, those nice cotton sheets.

493
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,543
- Yes.

494
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,899
And we watched Jimmy Fallon

495
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,169
and talked about our favorite music when

496
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,003
we were kids-
- Kids, yeah.

497
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,519
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

498
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,209
- We were good together.
- Yeah.

499
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,669
- I guess it's easy to forget about that

500
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,239
when it didn't last and
people are so weird.

501
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,459
Like the second things end,

502
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,179
the only thing they remember
is you just broke up.

503
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,809
- Yeah.

504
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,909
She was my first love, though.

505
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,319
- Psh, no.

506
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,153
- Yeah.
- Stop.

507
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:28,589
- No, it's true.
- You're so lame.

508
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,490
- It's true.

509
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:30,979
- Okay, I was totally crazy about her.

510
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,657
- Oh, stop it.

511
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:34,491
I don't know.

512
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,789
And that went on for like eight months?

513
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,299
- Mhm. And then it was over.

514
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,363
- Yeah, just like that.
- Just like that.

515
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,929
Don't even.

516
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,719
- But then a friendship of a lifetime...

517
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,179
- Ah, took it over.

518
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,693
For the best.

519
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,229
- Is that everything?

520
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,600
- Yep.

521
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,632
- Cool guitar.

522
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,069
- Thanks.
- You play?

523
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,070
- No.

524
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,850
- Cool.

525
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,277
Well, if you need anything, let me know.

526
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,833
- Dude, you are never
going to believe what happened.

527
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,839
- Oh my God, are you serious?

528
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,768
- It was insane, man. I wish
you could've been there.

529
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,309
'Cause Scott got this whole DJ set up

530
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,450
and his parents' backyard
is like just mountains.

531
00:27:22,451 --> 00:27:27,371
It was so beautiful.

532
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:10,936
- Hey.
- Hey.

533
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:12,714
I just wanted to let you know

534
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,426
you're totally welcome
to come to the party.

535
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:17,069
People are swimming, we made some nuggets.

536
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,737
Scott brought a shark balloon which...

537
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,086
Everybody would love to meet you.

538
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:25,087
- Yeah, uh, maybe later?

539
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:27,687
- Okay.

540
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:55,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,029
I didn't realize you were-
- No, it's good.

542
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,063
- Still awake.

543
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,923
- Sorry, pardon my reach.

544
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,057
Do you mind if I...

545
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,933
Thank you.
- Mhm.

546
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
You should come to the party tonight.

547
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,459
- Trust me, I'm not good
at that kind of thing.

548
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,683
- Parties?
- People.

549
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,199
- I like you.

550
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,240
You're interesting and I
think we should be friends.

551
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,019
- I don't do guy friends.

552
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,729
- Why?
- It doesn't work.

553
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,280
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

554
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,439
Look, this is just temporary, okay?

555
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,559
Anyways, I hardly know you.

556
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,279
- Ask me anything. I'm an open book.

557
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,440
My birthday is October 10th.

558
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,393
I went to a Catholic middle school.

559
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,380
I'm allergic to Pomeranians.
- No, you're not.

560
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:08,549
- I could be.

561
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,203
- Goodnight, Jackson.

562
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:32,620
- Where's the meeting?

563
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,489
- Uh, it's not a meeting.
It's an interview.

564
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,899
Server position.

565
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,089
- What restaurant?
- Some Italian place.

566
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,413
- What's it called?
- I'd have to check.

567
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,279
- Margherita.
- Hm?

568
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,839
You know, tomato, basil.

569
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,339
- No, I know what a Margherita is.

570
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,859
- It's my favorite kind of pizza.

571
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,399
- Okay, so?

572
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,369
- So I'm helping you learn things about me

573
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,843
so that we can be friends.

574
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,353
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you have to tell me

575
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,353
something about you now.

576
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Come on, anything.

577
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,970
What's your favorite kind of pizza?

578
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,179
- I don't like pizza.

579
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
It's too salty.

580
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,220
Anyways, I'm gluten-free.

581
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,493
- No, you're not.
- I could be.

582
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,399
- So what's your deal?
- You wanna psychoanalyze?

583
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,869
- No, I just, tell me something

584
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,889
I wouldn't know about you.

585
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,319
- Um...

586
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,339
I'm an only child.
- That's a no brainer.

587
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
- What?
- No, no, it's good.

588
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,889
It just means you have a certain vibe.

589
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,549
Like I have the little brother vibe.

590
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,989
- Meaning you're
adorable and everybody loves you?

591
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,569
- Meaning I
want people to like me.

592
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,550
I want to be the good guy.

593
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,589
- Yeah, I uh, I
don't give off that vibe.

594
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,439
- No, you're just
the person who you are.

595
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,869
- Thanks.
- No, it's a compliment.

596
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,676
Seriously. I wish I
could be more like that.

597
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,632
- Um, I wish people
liked me, so we're even.

598
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:55,969
- I think it's just my face.

599
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,999
- That's true. You
have a very likable face.

600
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,899
And judging from the
traffic in our bathroom...

601
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,419
- Okay.
- I'm assuming you have

602
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,899
other deeply likable qualities.

603
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,819
- I don't like kicking
them out right after we...

604
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,089
It's the right thing to do.

605
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,932
- Just big,
massive, hugely likable.

606
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,249
- I hate you.
- I know, you nerd.

607
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,583
I hate you, too.

608
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,279
No.

609
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,329
- Yes.
- No fucking way.

610
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,163
- Why not?

611
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:34,049
- Because like 99% of the population

612
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,129
would be a virgin if that were true.

613
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,839
- Sex doesn't count unless you both come.

614
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,519
- It doesn't count? According to what?

615
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,118
- Science.

616
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,310
Let's go to a movie.

617
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,199
- I shouldn't.
- Come on, my treat.

618
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,229
- I don't need you to pay for everything.

619
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,550
- If it makes you feel better,
you can pay for the popcorn.

620
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,709
- Let me guess.

621
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,299
Hot blonde from yoga.

622
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,943
- Cute Korean from the drive-thru.

623
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:02,777
- Ugh.

624
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:03,939
She was cute.

625
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,899
You should invite her over.

626
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,733
- Do you mind if I-
- Hey, as long as I

627
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,489
don't have to see it or hear it,

628
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,649
you can do whatever you want.

629
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,859
- Breakfast tomorrow?
- You got it.

630
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
- Wish me luck.

631
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
- Make good choices.

632
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:41,710
Down, please.

633
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,153
Come on, you guys.

634
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,610
- Knock, knock.

635
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,859
- Where's your friend?

636
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,099
- She left.

637
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,789
- That bad, huh?

638
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,240
- You wanna go get breakfast?

639
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,269
- It's the middle of the night.

640
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,670
- And I know just the place.

641
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,169
- Are we there yet?

642
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,170
- No.

643
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,949
- Are we there yet?

644
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,950
- No.

645
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,249
- Remind me again why this was necessary?

646
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,755
- Which part?

647
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:58,849
The part where you woke me up at 3:00 AM

648
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,619
for shitty breakfast food halfway across-

649
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,245
- You don't know that it's shitty.

650
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,419
- And what other kinds of breakfast place

651
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,263
is open at 3:00 AM?

652
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,769
- Okay. Ask me again.

653
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,170
- Are we there yet?

654
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,159
- Best waffles in town.
- No.

655
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,120
- No, seriously, they're great.

656
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:29,689
- No seriously, can we,
can we go someplace else?

657
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,359
- Why?
- Does it matter?

658
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,339
- Yeah, because I'm starving.

659
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,239
- Jackson, I...
- Harper.

660
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,279
Come on, we're already here.

661
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,059
Last one in has to pay.

662
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,255
- Jackson.

663
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,044
Jackson!

664
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,130
- What do you like here?

665
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:48,809
- Oh gosh, I love everything.

666
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,749
Mostly the customers, though.

667
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,594
- Really?

668
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:52,427
Thank you so much.

669
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:53,469
Your name is Jessie?
- Yeah, it's Jessie.

670
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,492
- Awesome, great to meet you.

671
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:57,707
- Yeah, it's good to meet you, too.

672
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,297
Yeah, it was, it was really good to you.

673
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:09,158
- It's really nice to meet you.

674
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,859
Ugh, really?

675
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,693
- What? I wasn't.

676
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:12,853
- You totally were.

677
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm not hungry.

678
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,759
- You have to get something.

679
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,119
I'm telling you, the Belgium waffles here-

680
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,480
- God, don't look over there.

681
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,648
- Where?
- Shh.

682
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:27,500
- Do you know that guy?

683
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,333
- No. Yeah.

684
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,166
Yes I do.

685
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,849
- He's looking at you.
- Don't look back.

686
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,610
- He's coming over here.
- Stop looking at him.

687
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:33,843
- I think he's-
- Harper?

688
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,770
- Hello.

689
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:43,219
- I was just, well I saw you and I thought

690
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,569
you're eating breakfast.

691
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,089
- Yeah.

692
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,629
- What are the odds, right?

693
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,723
- Comically low.

694
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,419
- Be right back.
- No, stay.

695
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,059
- I don't want to intrude.
- Oh, you're really not.

696
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,000
- He really is.

697
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,859
- Look, if you want to say something,

698
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,289
why don't you just say it?

699
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,419
- I want to apologize for kicking you out.

700
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,499
That wasn't cool.
- Yeah, some people

701
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,139
might describe it as the
exact opposite of cool.

702
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,303
- I just want you to know...
- I do not care-

703
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:11,638
- If you wanted to be friends...

704
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,113
- We're not friends.

705
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,339
- Bryn misses you.
- I don't care.

706
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,173
- I just think that maybe-

707
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:21,689
- I don't want to be your
fucking friend, okay?

708
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,173
Just leave me alone.

709
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,320
- You all right?

710
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
- No.

711
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:43,629
- Why'd he kick you out?

712
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,129
- Because he was fucking someone else.

713
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,189
No, look, it sounds bad
when you say it like that,

714
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,989
but, things had been
weird for a long time.

715
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,049
I don't even know why we were
dating in the first place.

716
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,150
I think I just liked how much he liked me.

717
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,343
I do that sometimes.

718
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,083
Is that normal?

719
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,519
I mean, what does it say about you

720
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,299
if the only thing that you find attractive

721
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,767
in other people is that
they're attracted to you?

722
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,690
- I don't know.

723
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,077
Wah-wah.

724
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,325
- Come on.

725
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,389
You're so fuckin'
stupid, do you know that?

726
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,790
I like hanging out with you.

727
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,039
- Me, too.

728
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,483
- Thanks for making us be friends.

729
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,989
It's really nice to have a guy

730
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,413
who's not angling for anything, you know?

731
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,930

Wait, so two parts...

761
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,323
Hm.

762
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,156
Quiz me.

763
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,989
- What?

764
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:10,989
Oh um...

765
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,859
John Collins.

766
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,129
- Um, three part gin, two part lemon,

767
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,413
one part sugar, four parts soda.

768
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,639
- How about a...

769
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,749
Hanky panky?

770
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,279
- Um, one part gin,

771
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,233
one part for vermouth, dash of bitters.

772
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,410
- You're golden.

773
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,330
- Oh, I know.

774
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:38,379
Before you know it you'll
have a certified bartender

775
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,664
and food service personnel
all under one roof.

776
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,799
- Doesn't dairy make you phlegmy?

777
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,710
- Fuck off.

778
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:49,029
- I'm just saying,
nobody wants a waitress-

779
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,870
- Slash bartender.

780
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,903
- Nobody wants to waitress
slash bartender with TB.

781
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,220
- Fine.

782
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:10,639
Are you happy?

783
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,883
- Ecstatic.
- Good.

784
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,789
I'll see you later.

785
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,840
- Hey Harper?
- Mhm?

786
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,853
- You look nice.

787
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
- Okay.

788
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,639
- Paul is my man.

789
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,019
- We met in Ms. Dillon's
third grade class.

790
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,890
- Back row.
- Yeah.

791
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:43,179
Well, as soon as I saw
his Spiderman lunchbox,

792
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,669
I knew I found my guy.

793
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,409
- It's all about looking
out for each other.

794
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,199
Making sure you have your buddy's back,

795
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,649
'cause shit goes down.

796
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,139
Work.

797
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,090
- Kids.

798
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,923
- Girlfriends.

799
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,299
- Girlfriends with kids.

800
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,599
- Yeah. It's cool to have somebody there.

801
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,159
- Yeah. He's like my guy.

802
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,359
Um, well, not that I
haven't had girlfriends,

803
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,909
like dating and shit, but it's different.

804
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,139
- Yeah, no, he gets it and he gets me.

805
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,973
- Yeah.

806
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:07,806
- Everyone should have someone like this.

807
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,869
- Yeah. Someone you can be real with.

808
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,719
Someone who you can get down with

809
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,109
and say hey, I love you, man.

810
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,493
- I love you, too.

811
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,698
- Okay.

812
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:19,698
- Okay.

813
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,590
- Who needs a chick when you got this?

814
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:16,609
- Hey, sorry I missed your call.

815
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,610
Leave a message-

816
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
- I need help.

817
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,213
I think I'm dying.

818
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,540
- Have you been like this all day?

819
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,620
Jesus.

820
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,620
Here, ahh.

821
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,635
You're so hot.

822
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:57,500
- Thanks.

823
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,329
- No, I mean...

824
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,469
Why didn't you say anything?

825
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,433
- I didn't want to bother you.

826
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,913
- Why don't you go hop in the shower?

827
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,470
- Why are you being so nice to me?

828
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,970
- Just go get in the shower.

829
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
- Jackson?

830
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,980
- Sorry, I, here.
- Thanks.

831
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,909
It's warm.

832
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:37,910
- Dryer.

833
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,590
- You didn't have to-
- I know.

834
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:58,559
- I'm not gonna bite you.

835
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,600
- That's...

836
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,249
Not what I was thinking.

837
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,250
- I'm cold.

838
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,753
- I don't think we should-
- Please?

839
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:30,763
That feels nice.

840
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,500
- What are you thinking?

841
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,420
- Nothing.

842
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,793
Just feelings.

843
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:44,769
- What kind of feelings?

844
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:45,770
- They're stupid.

845
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,900
- Try me.

846
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,327
- I don't know, just feelings.

847
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,983
About moms.

848
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,579
Yours sounds so nice.

849
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,623
Right? I bet she does all
this stuff when you're sick.

850
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,483
She changes the sheets.

851
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:12,003
- My family is not exactly
what you'd call involved.

852
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,483
- I was an accident.

853
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,110
That's what my mom tells people.

854
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,223
At parties.

855
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,440
Like I was the kid they never
wanted in the first place.

856
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,459
- That's messed up.

857
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,510
- It's okay.

858
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:51,686
That's how she is.

859
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
- And your dad?

860
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
- Kind.

861
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Really kind.

862
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:10,021
You're a good friend.

863
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,650
- Sorry.

864
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,490
I've just...

865
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,223
Wanted that for a long time.

866
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:25,277
- What?

867
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,175
- You.

868
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:35,314
- Oh.

869
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,093
- Is that a new shirt?
- Hm?

870
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,094
Uh, yeah.

871
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,379
- I like it. You look great.

872
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
- Thank you.

873
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:48,509
- Oh, you're so tight.

874
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,409
- You know I'm actually,
I'm just gonna go, um,

875
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,499
just lie down.

876
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,579
- Okay, do you wanna watch a movie or-

877
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,413
- No, I'm good.

878
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:58,877
I'm just, I'm just gonna
go sleep, uh, alone.

879
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,960
I have to tell him, don't I?

880
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:46,735
- Brad, seriously.

881
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:48,819
We can't just be friends.

882
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,354
I don't want it.

883
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,948
- Last slice.

884
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:03,093
- Oh, it's yours.

885
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,850
- Hey Harper?
- Mhm?

886
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:11,709
- Is everything okay, um, with us?

887
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,710
- Yeah.

888
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,109
- Are you sure?

889
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,229
- Yeah, ya nerd.

890
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,483
Everything's fine.

891
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,329
Okay? Now Shut up and eat
your weird foot pizza.

892
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,270
- Okay.

893
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,889
I have a surprise for you.

894
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,619
- I hate surprises.

895
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,129
- I know.

896
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,130
Come on.

897
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:50,268
Okay, wait.

898
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:53,102
And, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

899
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,909
Okay.

900
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,910
Open your eyes.

901
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,010
Ta-da.

902
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,360
That bad, huh?

903
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,800
- No, it's...

904
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
It's beautiful.

905
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,349
- Total overkill, right?

906
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,860
- No, God, Jackson, it's...

907
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,493
It's perfect.

908
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:35,883
You did all this for me?

909
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,019
- I felt bad about the other night.

910
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,119
I know it was unexpected,

911
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,886
and I think I freaked
you out and I'm sorry.

912
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:49,683
I know I can be kind of a, you know.

913
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,045
- A ho.

914
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:53,959
Right.

915
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,993
I can be kind of a ho,

916
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,513
but you're not like any
of those other girls.

917
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,263
You're not like anyone at all.

918
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,890
I think I'm in love with you.

919
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,809
And I know that it's
only been a few months

920
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,409
and that you don't believe in
love or feelings or whatever,

921
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,069
but I'm crazy about you.

922
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,939
You're one of my best
friends and I love you,

923
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,679
and I just needed you to know that.

924
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,853
So now you know.

925
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,233
Please say something.

926
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,999
I'm sorry.

927
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,559
This is weird.

928
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,783
Shit, I'm sorry.

929
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,279
Maybe we shouldn't be friends.

930
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,169
I just don't know if we can, if,

931
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,823
if there's going to be this, this, this-

932
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,943
I love you so fucking much.

933
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,367
How was that?

934
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:10,368
- Great.

935
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:12,175
- Good.

936
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,559
- Uh, sometimes it's just
like easier, you know,

937
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,509
to go along with things.

938
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,259
Like if a guy's like, like if
a guy asked for your number,

939
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,389
you know, it's gosh,
maybe he's not so cute,

940
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,229
and maybe he's not so funny,
but he has his phone out,

941
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,949
and he's just like, gosh, he's like,

942
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,409
I just want to hang out, you know?

943
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,699
I'd love to grab a drink sometime,

944
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,209
and you just don't want to be a dick,

945
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,879
so you give him your number, you know?

946
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,173
Your actual number.

947
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,299
I've never actually given
a guy a fake number before.

948
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,689
I've never...

949
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,809
I don't think he's going to like come back

950
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,740
and punch me or something.

951
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:01,709
I think it's just, maybe I
can't come up with a fake one,

952
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,973
but I just put it in.

953
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,669
It's just easier to be nice.

954
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,973
Really, it is.

955
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,413
That is so what my mom
would say, you know?

956
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:13,479
Be nice.

957
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,149
Pretend for his sake.

958
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,719
Don't be a bitch.

959
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,653
I mean, at the end of the day, it's like,

960
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,960
what's the worst thing
that could happen, right?

961
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,399
- Well, sometimes you just have to take

962
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,202
what you can get.
- That's terrible.

963
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:36,659
- Well it's true.

964
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,659
I mean, when I got out
of school, I worked what?

965
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,079
50 hours a week and didn't
sleep for two years.

966
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,689
It sucked, but sometimes that's
just what you have to do.

967
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,369
- Preach.

968
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,429
- What about you Harper?

969
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,949
How's your gig? You still bartending?

970
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,419
- Yeah. No it's great.

971
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,269
Second month is definitely
easier than the first.

972
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,429
- Plus we're drinking twice
as much for half as cheap,

973
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,719
so really it's a win-win.

974
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,299
- Don't talk like that around mom.

975
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,409
You so much as offer her a mimosa

976
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,238
and she's gonna be going on
about your drinking problem.

977
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,072
- Him?

978
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,869
He can hardly finish a beer.

979
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,149
- Right.

980
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,509
Um, but there was this one time...

981
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,659
- I was 16.

982
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,422
- He got drunk at a Christmas party.

983
00:56:11,423 --> 00:56:12,256
- It was when-

984
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,379
- And he puked mulled
wine all over the porch.

985
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,359
- Martha got pissed because it left

986
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,489
this huge stain in the wood.

987
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,400
- You were there?

988
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,233
- Oh yeah.

989
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:23,049
Dev and I have been on and off
together since high school.

990
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,539
- She's the
unofficial favorite child.

991
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,939
Yeah.
- Oh uh, here.

992
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,940
Look.

993
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,319
- Wow.

994
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,038
Bold choice.

995
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:35,259
You guys were adorable.

996
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,563
- Yeah, we really were.
- Ah, we kinda still are.

997
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,049
Uh...

998
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,969
Should've seen Jackson's prom pics.

999
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,339
What a dork.

1000
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,700
I guess mom's cotillion
lessons never paid off.

1001
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,749
Oh my God, you have to tell
them about what happened

1002
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,423
when we were on our way to prom.

1003
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:00,770
- You okay?

1004
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,780
- I'm fine.

1005
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,113
- You sister seems cool.

1006
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,490
- She can be kind of a handful.

1007
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,713
- Family is hard.

1008
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,843
Let's do something fun.

1009
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,569
- What do you think?
Blueberry or original?

1010
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,570
- Whatever you want.

1011
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,620
- This.

1012
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,659
So you got any plans for the weekend?

1013
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,919
- Probably not.

1014
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,753
- Cool.

1015
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:53,849
I was thinking we could have a party.

1016
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,575
Introduce you to some of my friends.

1017
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,409
- Okay.

1018
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,299
- Devon will drop by.

1019
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,469
Maybe my parents.

1020
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,529
- Your parents?

1021
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,289
- Yeah. They're in town for a few days.

1022
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,639
- You're inviting your
parents to a house party?

1023
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,299
- Is that a problem?

1024
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,729
- No, I just don't understand why

1025
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,942
you'd invite them to our party.

1026
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:14,079
- I want them to meet you.

1027
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,189
- Oh.

1028
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,529
- They're gonna love you.

1029
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,967
- Your parents?

1030
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:18,968
- Everybody.

1031
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:25,979
I got it.
- No, I really, I can-

1032
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,980
- Let me.

1033
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:48,063
You're amazing.

1034
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:02,775
♪ Oh oh oh ♪

1035
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:06,616

- Wow, great fucking job.

1040
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,339
I would clap, but you know, the wings.

1041
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,769
And it's, it's the rubber thing.

1042
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,989
Don't look at me like that.

1043
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,599
You're the one who doesn't
know how to pick men.

1044
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,988
You were totally using that guy

1045
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:38,162
and you won't be real with yourself,

1046
00:59:38,163 --> 00:59:39,005
you won't be real with us.

1047
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:40,241
Like just tell him, you know?

1048
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:41,242
I'm usin-

1049
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:58,039
- You look great.

1050
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,040
- So do you.

1051
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,670
- We're pretty cute.

1052
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:09,388
You ready?
- Let's do it.

1053
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,075
- Hey, you made it.

1054
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,249
- You think I'd miss a
chance to get free booze

1055
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,135
from my little brother?

1056
01:00:28,136 --> 01:00:30,263
- Whoa, who said anything about free?

1057
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,629
Are mom and dad here?

1058
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,637
- Yeah, kitchen.

1059
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:34,559
- You want a drink?
- Um, you know...

1060
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,279
- So you ready to meet the parents?

1061
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,939
- Um, well, I mean, I do drink, swear,

1062
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,859
and support the gays, so
hopefully that doesn't

1063
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,757
cause a rift in your family?

1064
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:45,249
- No. Our mom's gonna love you.

1065
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,357
- 'Cause of the gays?

1066
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:48,049
- 'Cause you're at least twice
as smart as the last one,

1067
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,259
and he actually had the balls

1068
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,929
to tell us you were dating.

1069
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:51,930
- Dating?

1070
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:55,209
- I swear, Jackson can't keep
a secret to save his life.

1071
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:58,576
- When did he say that?
- Oh my god, you look so good.

1072
01:00:58,577 --> 01:01:00,805
- Thank you.
- Girlfriend material.

1073
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:04,033
Oh, have you met the parents?
- Uh, no actually.

1074
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,509
- This is Harper.

1075
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,983
- Such a pleasure.

1076
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:08,533
- We have heard so much about you.

1077
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,270
- And we are so glad to see Jackson

1078
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,739
this happy with someone
who's worth his time.

1079
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,471
- Has he told you about the cruise?

1080
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:15,719
- The cruise?

1081
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,100
- Next summer.

1082
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:17,934
- Bermuda.

1083
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:19,939
- Oh, it's supposed to be gorgeous.

1084
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,349
- And let me tell you,
those tickets? Not cheap.

1085
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,379
- Oh my God. I couldn't possibly-

1086
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,249
- Oh nonsense. It's our treat.

1087
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,409
- You should come.

1088
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,036
- Devvy's bringing Bonnie,

1089
01:01:28,037 --> 01:01:30,109
and you can think of it
as a romantic getaway.

1090
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,681
- So you'll come?

1091
01:01:31,682 --> 01:01:33,054
- Um, I...

1092
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,176
- Wonderful.

1093
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:35,859
- Oh, and Christmas.

1094
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,854
- Oh, the Alps.

1095
01:01:36,854 --> 01:01:37,687
Stunning this time of year.

1096
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:40,019
- I think what they're trying to say is

1097
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,509
we're just really happy to
have you as part of our family.

1098
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,343
- Wow.

1099
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:47,359
Uh, well thank you for considering me.

1100
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,053
Um, would you excuse me for just a minute?

1101
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:57,069
- It's like a heroin addict

1102
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,709
can ask about their family,
but Chelsea was like no-

1103
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:00,859
- Can I, can I borrow him for a second?

1104
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,693
- Can it wait? I was in the middle-

1105
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,827
- It'll totally just take one second.

1106
01:02:06,294 --> 01:02:07,294
- Hey.

1107
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,359
- Everything okay?

1108
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,923
- What's the deal with this party?

1109
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:12,757
- What do you mean?

1110
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:14,259
- I mean what the hell is going on?

1111
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,269
We mess around for a few
weeks and now your parents

1112
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,999
are booking me into the family calendar?

1113
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,019
Why does your sister
think that we're dating?

1114
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,509
- Why are you so upset?

1115
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,279
- I'm not upset.

1116
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,719
I just don't understand why you're

1117
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,519
parading me around like this.

1118
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,909
- I'm showing off my awesome girlfriend.

1119
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:29,743
Is that a crime?

1120
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:30,740
- No, it's not.

1121
01:02:30,741 --> 01:02:32,199
- Do you care about me?
- Of course, yes.

1122
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,789
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1123
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,313
You're my best friend.

1124
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,859
Okay.

1125
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,093
You know that.

1126
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,759
Why do you have to be so insecure?

1127
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,136
- Insecure?
- Yes, insecure.

1128
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:47,019
- You think I'm insecure?

1129
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,119
- You are the textbook
definition of insecure.

1130
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,859
Okay, you're like the fucking
insecure poster child.

1131
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,059
You can't go more than five
minutes without validation

1132
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,649
from a vagina or you shrivel up and die.

1133
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,650
It's exhausting.

1134
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,157
- I'm sorry my friendship
is such a burden.

1135
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:05,199
- No, this is not about
our friendship, okay?

1136
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,209
Our friendship is great, but this?

1137
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,299
Whatever you're doing right
now, this is pissing me off.

1138
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,588
- So you're saying I'm the problem?

1139
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:12,659
- No.
- The problem is that

1140
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,739
I want you in my life-
- No, I'm not saying that.

1141
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,261
- But I'm so insecure that-
- No!

1142
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:17,095
- I'm this asshole who
wants to have a future-

1143
01:03:17,096 --> 01:03:18,370
- You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1144
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:19,204
- With the person I'm in love with.

1145
01:03:19,205 --> 01:03:20,389
- Jesus, Jackson, we are not in love.

1146
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,269
- I know you don't
believe in it or whatever.

1147
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,089
- No, there is no but.

1148
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,419
I don't love you, Jackson,

1149
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,049
and I'm not your girlfriend
and we're not together

1150
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,519
and we're never going to get married

1151
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,783
or vacation in fucking Bermuda, okay?

1152
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,510
Hey, uh, where do you
want me to put these?

1153
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,610
Jackson?

1154
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,390
Jackson?

1155
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,520
Are you just gonna ignore me now or?

1156
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,840
I do still care about you, you know.

1157
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,419
Even if it's not in the way you'd like,

1158
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,663
you're still important.

1159
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,839
- Is that it?

1160
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,989
- Is that what?

1161
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,019
- Is there anything else you want to say?

1162
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,263
Maybe, I don't know,
I'm sorry for starters?

1163
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,730
- I'm sorry I ruined your party.

1164
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,260
- Fuck you.

1165
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,363
- Excuse me?

1166
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,519
What is it you think I did exactly?

1167
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,679
- Aside from being a colossal bitch?

1168
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,539
How about you lied to my face, Harper?

1169
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,239
You acted like we were a couple

1170
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,999
with all of the kissing and
the cuddling and the sex.

1171
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,039
Why didn't you tell me what was going on?

1172
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,199
- I tried.

1173
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,033
- When?

1174
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:06,119
- I don't know. I didn't know how.

1175
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,099
It just happened and
that it kept happening

1176
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,829
and I wanted to say something

1177
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,219
but you seemed happy and
I didn't wanna ruin it.

1178
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,291
- Right, it's not like you were getting

1179
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,260
anything out of the situation.

1180
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:15,989
- I never wanted anything.

1181
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,129
- Really?

1182
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,799
What about the room and the rent?

1183
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,219
What about the movie tickets?

1184
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,379
- I never asked you for any of that.

1185
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,626
- But you knew I was in love with you.

1186
01:05:23,627 --> 01:05:25,339
- And you knew that I wasn't.

1187
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,929
Did that even matter?

1188
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:28,159
All that time on top of me,

1189
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,400
did you ever ask if it was okay?

1190
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,359
Really?

1191
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,260
That's not fair.

1192
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:36,309
- Nothing about this is fair, Jackson.

1193
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,649
The whole thing sucks. Okay?

1194
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,789
I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings,

1195
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,669
but I don't owe you anything.

1196
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,470
- Just three months of my life back.

1197
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,660
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.

1198
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,769
I'm sorry you spent all
that money on a girl

1199
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,429
who didn't want to babysit
24/7, but you know what?

1200
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,530
It's okay, because this means I was right.

1201
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,000
Men and women can't be friends,

1202
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,189
but it's not because sex ruins friendship,

1203
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,429
it's because men aren't interested

1204
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,823
in friends they can't fuck.

1205
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,539
- Hey there,
looks like I missed your call.

1206
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,571
Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

1207
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,853
- Hey dad, it's me.

1208
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,791
I know you won't call me back.

1209
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,528
Mom thinks I'm an idiot for
even keeping the line open.

1210
01:06:44,529 --> 01:06:46,089
Uh, um...

1211
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,469
I guess I just needed to talk to someone

1212
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,029
and most people would
phone a friend except

1213
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,680
I don't really have any of those.

1214
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,833
And the one person I had,

1215
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,133
I just wanted him to be happy, dad.

1216
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,299
We were so good together
at the laundry and dishes

1217
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,050
and breakfast and it was easy and perfect.

1218
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:18,223
Seriously, we were perfect,
and that should count, right?

1219
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,590
I shouldn't have to be
with him for it to matter.

1220
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,559
But then we're in bed and I
can feel him needing that,

1221
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,869
expecting me to play
that, to make it easy,

1222
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:31,039
to love him back, which
should be fine, right?

1223
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,490
I could just fuck him. It
doesn't have to matter.

1224
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,293
And then it was too late,

1225
01:07:35,294 --> 01:07:36,990
and I didn't know what else to say.

1226
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,599
Because even if I didn't like it,

1227
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,373
I started it and I ever said no.

1228
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,530
I never said anything.

1229
01:07:45,515 --> 01:07:48,229
And now it's over and
he's gone and he hates me.

1230
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,273
He was my best friend and he hates me.

1231
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,269
I know I said at the funeral
that I didn't believe in God

1232
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,999
or whatever but if you
know anybody up there

1233
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,763
that you think could help me
out, that would be really cool.

1234
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:09,066
I'd just like to be wrong
about something for once.

1235
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,983
Anyways, I love you.

1236
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,270
I wish you were here.

1237
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,589
- What do you want?

1238
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:46,840
- Can I buy you a coffee?

1239
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,973
- So that was it? You
just got up and left?

1240
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:57,269
He told you he loved you?

1241
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,240
- Yeah.

1242
01:09:58,241 --> 01:09:59,273
- Do you?

1243
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,959
- No, I...

1244
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,960
I don't know.

1245
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,709
Anyways, you know, I don't
believe in that stuff.

1246
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:09,610
- It's not about believing in anything

1247
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:13,539
- What am I supposed to do?

1248
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,369
- If you wanna have
decent people in your life

1249
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:18,370
you have to believe that people
are capable of being decent.

1250
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,979
It's okay to expect things.

1251
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,453
- Like what?
- Like connection.

1252
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,769
- What if I don't want that?
- Everybody wants that.

1253
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,173
- Well, what if I don't?
- Come on, Harper.

1254
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,260
Being happy doesn't make you an idiot.

1255
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:40,139
Maybe that kind of love is bullshit,

1256
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,569
but most love isn't like that.

1257
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,099
It's stupid and weird and inconsistent

1258
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,560
and maybe it doesn't
make you together, but...

1259
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:50,650
He loves you.

1260
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:56,870
- I should go.

1261
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,643
- I really am sorry.

1262
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,820
- I know.

1263
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,493
Say hi to him for me.

1264
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,390
- We actually aren't together.

1265
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:11,219
I don't know that we ever were,

1266
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,580
but whatever it was it was good, you know?

1267
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,570
- Yeah.

1268
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,445
Bryn?

1269
01:11:32,712 --> 01:11:33,545
I'm not your kid, you know.

1270
01:11:33,546 --> 01:11:35,963
- Sure you are. You're my rent-a-child.

1271
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:37,970
Now get out of here.

1272
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:38,804
- You're such a freak.

1273
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,017
- Don't you have somewhere to be?

1274
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:43,118
Like a big, romantic gesture or some shit?

1275
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,469
- Hey.

1276
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,470
Harper.

1277
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:47,913
- How's your night going?

1278
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:49,199
- Fantastic.

1279
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,736
- Will these be together or separate?

1280
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:52,173
- Separate.

1281
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,330
- Cute shirt.

1282
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,679
- It's mine.

1283
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,729
- Yeah, he gave it to me right
after he called me a bitch

1284
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:04,821
because I wouldn't fuck him.

1285
01:13:04,822 --> 01:13:06,222
Can I have my candy, please?

1286
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,940
- Sorry, I owe you.

1287
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:24,579
Harper.

1288
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,580
Harper.

1289
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,370
Are you gonna stay pissed at me?

1290
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,320
I thought we were friends.

1291
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,799
- Yeah, well you said you
didn't want to be my friend.

1292
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,719
- Well, I lied.
- Whatever.

1293
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,073
- I'm sorry. Okay?

1294
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,673
I'm sorry.

1295
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:38,673
I was just...

1296
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:41,010
Hurt.

1297
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:44,460
I mean it sucks when
the person that you're

1298
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:49,683
sleeping with tramples your
heart into a million pieces.

1299
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,593
I'm sorry I was an asshole to you.

1300
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:56,731
- Yeah, me too.

1301
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,090
- Truce?

1302
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:01,350
- Truce.

1303
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,240
What are you doing?

1304
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,230
- I thought we were good.

1305
01:14:06,231 --> 01:14:09,169
- Did you not listen to a single
thing I said at the party?

1306
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:10,719
- You just apologized for that.

1307
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,609
- Yeah, for being an asshole, okay?

1308
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,519
I apologized for hurting your feelings,

1309
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,403
not for not being your dream girl.

1310
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,669
God, what the hell is wrong with you?

1311
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:21,670
- I just want...

1312
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,119
What is wrong with me?

1313
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,529
- Nothing.

1314
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,582
You're sweet and funny and-

1315
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,699
- I swear to God if you say nice.

1316
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,979
- You are nice.
- I don't wanna be nice.

1317
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,099
I don't want to be interchangeable

1318
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,228
with all the other nice guys
who are too boring to...

1319
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:39,229
- To what?

1320
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,320
- To love you.

1321
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,781
- You're not boring.

1322
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,210
- What am I?

1323
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,400
- You're...

1324
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
You're my friend.

1325
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:02,894
- I don't get it.

1326
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,169
You like me, right?

1327
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,039
I mean couldn't we just-
- Look, it would be easier

1328
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,499
for everyone if we
could just like make out

1329
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,919
and call it a day.

1330
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,170
Okay, trust me, I get it.

1331
01:15:12,412 --> 01:15:13,712
But I don't feel that way.

1332
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,133
And it's horrible, and I'm sorry.

1333
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,510
But that's how I feel.

1334
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,320
- Okay.

1335
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:26,916
- I'm so sorry, I...

1336
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,334
- It's all right.

1337
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:32,570
- Jackson.

1338
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,730
Come on, don't do that.

1339
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,089
Jackson.

1340
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:38,090
Come back here.

1341
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,540
Jackson.

1342
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,470
Jackson!

1343
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:46,812
- Shit!

1344
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:47,989
What the fuck, Harper?

1345
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,139
- You are not a nice guy Jackson Summers.

1346
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,079
- Get off me.
- Shut up!

1347
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,499
You're not some random
guy I moved in with, okay?

1348
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,630
You're not a rebound or a
fuck boy or a drinking buddy.

1349
01:15:57,631 --> 01:15:58,906
- Look, you don't have to pretend-

1350
01:15:58,907 --> 01:15:59,897
- Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

1351
01:15:59,897 --> 01:16:00,730
- I get it, you're trying to be nice.

1352
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:01,876
- I am not, I am not
trying to be anything.

1353
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:02,843
- I know what you're gonna say.

1354
01:16:02,844 --> 01:16:03,893
- I fucking love you.

1355
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,840
- What?

1356
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,199
- I said "I love you," you asshole.

1357
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,593
And if I could be in love
with anyone, it would be you.

1358
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,893
But I'm not. And I'm sorry.

1359
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,433
But please, please don't take
my best friend away from me.

1360
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:30,469
- Do you know how hard this is?

1361
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,470
- What?

1362
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,999
- Being in love with you.

1363
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,449
- No.

1364
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,863
It sounds terrible.

1365
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,660
- It's pretty bad.
- I'm sorry.

1366
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,480
- I know.
- I wish...

1367
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:44,490
- I know.

1368
01:16:52,116 --> 01:16:53,116
Fuck.

1369
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,520
- Love is weird.

1370
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,716
- Love blows.

1371
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:07,710
- No.

1372
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,860
I bet it's pretty good.

1373
01:17:11,179 --> 01:17:13,989
I hope I get to love
somebody as shitty as me.

1374
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,990
- You will.

1375
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,210
- Do you promise?

1376
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,073
- I promise.

1377
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,439
It's a terrible story
when you think about it.

1378
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,569
- Oh it's so boring.

1379
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:48,199
- No blood.
- No guns.

1380
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,748
- No vengeful
robots or killer sex mutants.

1381
01:17:51,581 --> 01:17:53,029
- Well, and I guess a lot of people

1382
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,049
just aren't going to get it or like it,

1383
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,439
'cause it's not how these things
are supposed to go, right?

1384
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,229
And after all, like how do
two people love each other

1385
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:04,533
this much and fuck it up that bad?

1386
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,039
- Um...

1387
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,409
You can only say I'm sorry so many times,

1388
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,439
but I really am sorry for making you feel

1389
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,719
so trapped or obligated.

1390
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,660
- It's okay.

1391
01:18:16,661 --> 01:18:18,533
- I just-
- It's really okay.

1392
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:24,259
And I guess at the end, I, I do think that

1393
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:27,939
it's a happy story about us.

1394
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,209
- Yeah, how we were always going to be

1395
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,149
better friends than anything else.

1396
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:33,219
- It was about growing up.
- Having space.

1397
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,329
- It was about waffles.

1398
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:38,999
- Yeah, and it was a
love story or something.

1399
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,853
- Yeah, or something.
