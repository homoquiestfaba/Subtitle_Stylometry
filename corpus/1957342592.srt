698
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:19,364
Well, the short story
 is that Richard Kline

699
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,268
from Calamity Records is
 interested in meeting...

701
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,338
Richard Kline...
Wait! What?
JR! Hold on.

702
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,109
Hello?
I can't hear you.

703
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,944
Can you hear me?
Dude, I'm on a fucking beach,
I can't... Hello?

704
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:33,912
Hello?
I'm losing you. Hold on!

705
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:34,612
Sam?

706
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,715
Hello? JR!

707
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,152
Dudes! I just
got a record deal!

708
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:42,220
That's great.

709
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,090
Congratulations.
No, I'm serious, dude.

710
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,292
JR just called,
and Calamity called
and, like...

711
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,827
I didn't hear
the whole thing but, like,
I think I got it.

712
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,394
I'm serious.
Sweet.

713
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,063
Fuck. We gotta go back!

714
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,132
We just got here.

715

Ok, hold on. I'm just,
like, processing.

a heart attack.

Okay.

gonna be on MTV?

playing frigging music again.

727

though, right?

would be
really cool.

What was that?

731
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,494
SAM: A serial killer.

732
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,262
Shut up.

733
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:58,964
It's just an owl, dude.

734
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:03,168

Washington State is famous
for its serial killers.

the Green River Killer,

736

was caught up in Bellingham.

So, I'm just a little
concerned, that's all.

739
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:14,212
Concerned about what?

740
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,914
Uh, just all that shit that
happened here last March.

741
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:20,418
What happened here in March?

742
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,087
Oh, whatever. Come on,
you guys know, right?

743

No, I don't.

Shut the hell up.

around a campfire,

scary story to
get us freaked out.

to believe it, that's
totally fine with me.

Makes no difference.
OLIVER: Whatever.

751

Probably better
if you don't know.

752
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,077
Tell us.

753
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,816
Dude, it's no big deal,
all right, there was a family,

754
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,950
and they came up here to
go camping last March.

755
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,420
And they didn't come back.
Blah, blah, blah.
That whole thing.

756
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,487
What happened?
What? The murder
weapon or what?

757
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,890
They were murdered?
Yeah, brutally.

758
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,027
Yeah, it was a whole family.
It was a mom and dad,
and, uh,

759
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,933
two boys and a girl.
And they were murdered
and mutilated.

760
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,300
It's weird, actually, when
the police found their bodies,
the killer, had, like,

761
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:15,106
sliced open their cheeks from
mouth to ear and kind of,
like, pulled their faces up

762
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,474
in like a frozen scream.

763
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,476
Sick!
Yeah, totally sick.

764
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,813
Did they catch the killer?

(SIGHS)
No, I don't think so.

766
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,152
But it's not like
the murders were right here.

767
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:30,221
It was two or three miles
up the beach, so...

768
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,022
That's still pretty close.

769
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:33,524
Yeah. Guess it's
all relative.

the facts as they are.

we would have heard
about it in the news

773
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,904
or something, or read it
in the papers.
I read tons of stuff about it.

so many details?

just not let him out of

you're homophobic.

I think you're homophobic.

seen a man and
a kid around here?

No, man. I mean,
that's kinda
hard to say.

a man and a kid?

Yeah.

freeze to death?

going to freeze to death.
Shut up with the freaky shit.

a fire here?
SAM: No way.

lost in the woods to stay put?

943

I've never been
lost in the woods.

not screwed.
Yes, we are.

Look, I have a plan.

947
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,529
We're gonna forge
a bow and arrow
out of that tree,

948
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:25,102
and kill us up
a good-sized Sasquatch.
Suck on the meat.

949
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,573
We'll wrap ourselves up
in the bloody hide
for warmth. All good.

Hey, I'm sorry
I called you a fag.

1048
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:47,050
Nice.
Hey.

1049
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,251
Yo.

1050
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:55,925
Are you gonna tell
my mom what happened?

1051
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:56,993
Uh, let's see.

1052
01:14:58,628 --> 01:14:59,563
You went for
a walk on the beach.

1053
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,600
I went looking for you,
I got everybody lost.

1054
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:05,935
And...

1055
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:09,773
I don't know.
That's pretty much
what happened, right?

1056
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,174
I guess.

1057
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,549
So, you know,
the whole, like,

1058
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,052

it's, like,

1059
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:25,655
totally normal.

1060
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,091

iron it out.

I know. You don't have
to say anything.

1063
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,022
What is there to say?

1064
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:42,658
I'm just grateful
no one's dead.

1065
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:47,030
Yeah, it's not
for lack of trying.

1066
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,070
You know, Sam. Actually,
it sounds to me like you
might have saved his life.

1067

spin on things, but...

Hey, guys. How you doing?
It's good.

1070
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:15,058
So, uh, here's the deal.
Okay.

1071
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:18,962
Before we get
all into that stuff.
I just want to take a second.

1072
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,300
Kinda just want to apologize
to you guys for my behavior

1073
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,037
as of late.
I haven't really been,
like, a team player.

1074

I just want to say I'm sorry.

What we didn't tell you is
that Marcel and Chad and I

1078
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,256
have been working
on a side project
for about a year now.

1079

Wait, what?
Yeah, and we didn't...

1080
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:54,063
We didn't tell you
because we didn't want to
freak you out needlessly,

1081
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:55,331
but that's the demo that
Kline's calling about.

different direction.

Did you get
a record deal?

1091
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:51,921
No. They kicked me
out of the band.

1092
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,125
Yeah.

1093
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,962
But it's...
It's cool, I...

1094
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:02,031
Yeah.

1095
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,268
You could start a new band.

1096
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:05,835
Yeah, maybe.

1097
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:09,338
I don't know.
In the long run, though,

1098
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,011
I might be more like
a music fan than like
a musician, you know.

1099
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:18,181

in a record shop.

(CHUCKLES) No, that's
definitely not for me.

of plans you have this summer

like, hang or something.

Um...

1108
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:54,483
I have something
stupid for you.

1109
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:57,020
Found this on the beach.

1110
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,024
It's a sea urchin.

01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,127
There was a bunch of
shitty broken ones, um,

1112
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:08,464
but this one was, like,

'round the bend.
