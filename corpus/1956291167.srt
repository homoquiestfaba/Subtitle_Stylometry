00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,210
and that is my point.

173
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,090
[music continues playing]

174
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,717
[music stops]

175
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,728
[doorbell chimes]

176
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,024
- Hello, sir. Brooks Rattigan.
- Brooks Rattigan.

177
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,443
Reece told us all about you.

178
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,071
Just your name, but that's all I needed
to run the background check.

179
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,406
[man laughs]

180
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,658
No, I actually know
that you ran a background check.

181
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,453
- I found out when I ran one on you.
- [guffaws]

182
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,914
- Jerry Lieberman. Come in, Brooks.
- Sure.

183
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,249
Before you have a chance
to change your mind.

184
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,043
I'm kidding.

185
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,171
I like to joke about things.

186
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,508
- So, welcome to our humble abode.
- [young woman] This is stupid!

187
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,528
- As you can see, all original flooring.
- [young woman] Get out!

188
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,721
I swear, Jerry, the wrinkles
that girl has caused me

189
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,640
in places I didn't even know
could wrinkle.

190
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,266
Honey, our guest has arrived.

191
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,434
Hi.

192
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,678
- Brooks Rattigan.
- Lillian Lieberman.

193
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,107
She won't wear the shoes.

194
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,362
There are no "the shoes,"
there's just shoes. Is she wearing shoes?

195
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,365
[Jerry] It's a miracle
she agreed to do this.

196
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Good evening.

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,163
- I am...
- Reece's bitch?

198
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,291
- Celia!
- Relax, he knows I'm kidding.

199
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,626
Right, slum?

200
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,128
Oh, sweetie, you look so beautiful.

201
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,964
I'm not wearing the shoes.

202
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,882
- But they go.
- Listen to yourself.

203
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,053
Well, I happen to think
that heels are an outmoded display of

204
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,013
female oppression.

205
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,975
Fine.

206
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,185
Thanks, Mom.

207
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,729
Let's do this, so we can stop doing this.

208
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,440
[Jerry] You kids have fun.

209
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,070
- Thanks for the assist back there.
- Yeah, no, just part of the job.

210
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,532
Reece let you use his car.

211
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,118
Man, he was really desperate
to get out of this, wasn't he?

212
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,081
No, he wanted to go with you. He thought
<i>we</i> would have more fun together.

213
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,121
- Uh-huh.
- Here.

214
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,832
There you are.

215
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,166
Oh, that's cute,

216
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,669
but I can open my own doors.

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,421
Thanks.

218
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,381
[car door closes]

219
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,468
Okay.

220
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
Shall I put on some music?

221
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,228
[music starts]

222
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,649
Wow, you provide quite the service.

223
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,944
Don't tell me you've got
individually wrapped Mentos

224
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,738
and Tyler water bottles in your glove box.

225
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,864
Oh, my God, you do.

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,752

- No, don't listen to robots, listen to me.

<i>In 200 feet, make a right.</i>

231
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,381
You need to make a left here.

232
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,216
Okay, so now pull over,

233
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,345
and here we are.

234
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,545
This is not your high school.
Wouldn't it be weird if it was?

235
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,685
Okay, so you can swing back
and pick me up in a few hours.

236
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,229
You're telling me
that you would rather hang out at a...

237
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,815
café book store
than go to a high school dance?

238
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,899
Yes.

239
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
Oh, my God. Yes.

240
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,819
Yes, I would.

241
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,571
- Celia.
- Gigolo.

242
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,074
- Brooks. My name's Brooks.
- Sure.

243
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,410
Look, you are my responsibility,
and I cannot let you out of this car.

244
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,204
Okay, let's define terms here.

245
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm not your responsibility, because
Eisenhower isn't in office anymore.

246
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,544
Secondly, you're being paid
to hang out with me.

247
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,174
Imagine how that makes me feel.
Like, really, really imagine it.

248
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Now do as I say.

249
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,013
Compensation aside, I think that you and I
could have a really good time tonight.

250
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,100
You've clearly never been
to my high school.

251
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,895
[sighs]

252
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,939
Fine.

253
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
Wow.

254
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,277
What?

255
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,990

- Center for culinary participation.

Don't let the glossy sheen fool you,

259
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,346
the food still sucks.

260

I admire your ability to ruin moments.
You do it with panache.

00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,105
Why is nobody dancing? What, is dancing
just a poor person thing now?

263
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,524
You think people actually
go to a dance to dance?

264
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,727
No, they come here to take photos
for their Instagram.

265
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,570
I'm sure that's why
people have babies too.

266
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,448
- Okay, let's go shred some hardwood.
- No.

267

- Yes.
- No, no, no.

What do you got going on over here?

272
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,845
I can't tell if you're doing Chandler Bing
or Napoleon Dynamite.

273
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,722
Definitely Bing.

274
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,348
It's a good choice.

- Come on.
- No.

Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

Oh! Funny.

- No.

It should be.
I'm telling you, you're really good at it.

chaperone, it could be big business here.

You really think so?

No, I'm joking. But, wow,
you are super serious about it, huh?

Wait, come on. Hold on.

I insist. You shouldn't have to walk
to that door by yourself,

especially not with that ankle,

to the other leg.

to get you packs of ice.

- You're a sadist.
- One of my more likable qualities.

00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,828
I cannot believe that I missed Shelby's after-party
because of your dumb, fake ankle injury.

339
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,444
My fake ankle injury was not dumb.

340
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,989
My fake ankle injury was strategic
and adorable.

341
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,075
You should be thanking me.
You do not belong at Shelby's party.

Look, I'm not good at apologies,

518
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,905
but I feel I owe you one,
because you're a gentleman

519

and pretty fun to be around.

520
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:38,326
You were just doing your job, but you were pretty smug too,
so it shouldn't be a whole apology, but a half apology,

521
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,205
so I'm half sorry, is that cool?

So do you accept my half apology or not?

straight,

It seems a little boring, I give you that,

and insult me at the same time.

- What? - Before our date.
What? Franklin asked you out? That's great.

No, actually, I asked him out,

655
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,866
because I am the master of my universe,
and yeah, it's pretty great.

656
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:59,162
Oh, separate but related, it gives us a pretty good reason for our breakup.
- I see your game, you meet someone new. - Hit it and quit it, baby.

Okay, there's this huge birthday party
that's supposed to happen in a few weeks,

and everyone's gonna be there,
including your girl, Shelby.

Just the breakup has to be public,
like very public.

and get into Yale?

that would be my dream come true.

Oh, God, I feel bad for you.

663
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,978
You're just relying on external factors
for your happiness,

664
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,315
waiting for people to accept you
instead of accepting yourself.

665
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,983
I mean, what could go wrong?

666
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,653
Isn't that exactly
what you're doing with Franklin?

667

- You're just jealous.
- Of what?

668
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,702
Um, my connection with Franklin.
It's more cerebral.

Please.

'cause he's hot.

671
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,375
Whoa, his brain is hot, okay?

672
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,252
I can just picture his gorgeous
frontal lobe.

673
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,925
- Gross.
- Yeah, that was unintentionally gross.

674
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,805
Fine, I like him because of his brains
and, you know,

675
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,528
the beautiful face that's attached to it.

676
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,850
There you go,
so we're both shallow teenagers.

677
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,018
It would appear so.

678
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,270
- You're really sweet.
- Yeah.

679
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,898
- Can I have some of that, please?
- Whoa! No! No way.

680
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,906
[laughs] So, I might be able to help.
My dad knows the president.

681
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,117
- Of what country?
- Of Yale.

682
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,619
Um, they've been playing poker,
like forever,

683
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,330
and I guess my dad's been losing to him
for ten years,

684
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,665
in case I ever wanted to go.

685
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,959
So, the fact I don't wanna go
is kind of a sore point.

686
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,922
I don't get it,
rich people all know each other.

687
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,815
- I don't even know who my barber is.
- Okay, do you want my help or not?

688
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,048
Yes. A hundred times, yes.

689
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,509
Well, no promises,
but I can check with him.

690
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,761
What? Are you serious? Wow.

691
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,098
Thank you. All I got for you is wow.

692
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,683
Well, I'm a woman of much wow.

693
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,227
Hey, man,
I'll give you 50 bucks for your car.

694
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,353
[giggles]

695
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,232
- Oh, you think that's funny?
- Yeah, I do.

696
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,445
- Hey.
- Hey.

697
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,529
Whoa.

698
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,864
What's with the get-up?

699
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,368
Uh, I figured if I'm going to Yale,
I'd better start stepping it up.

700
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,246
Hey, what's going on
with all the late nights lately?

701
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:05,877
Uh, you know, the usual teenage stuff,
school projects, dances, 24-hour raves.

702
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,545
Hm. Atta boy.

703
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,923
Do you think you could clean up one day?
I mean, it's starting to look a little...

704
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,134
condemned in here.

705
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,385
I'm gonna get to it.

706
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,262
I could help you, if you want.

707
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,388
I think I do.

708
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,099
And actually, you have helped.

709
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,810
I submitted a collection
of my short stories of this fellowship,

710
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,938
because you were
so terribly and vividly mean to me.

711
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,608
So, thank you for being a supportive

712
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,109
asshole.

713
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,110
Anytime.

714
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,698
- Good night, Pops.
- Good night, buddy.

715
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,243
[sighs]

716
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,501
Hey, look, little Brooks is almost
a third of the way to his goal.

717
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,129
If I keep getting business like this, I'm
gonna be at little Yale by the summertime.

718
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,673
That's great, man. Really.

719
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,383
What is that? What...

720
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,344
You seem distant.

721
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,722
Well, I guess I am.

722
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,726
We just usually have stuff to talk about,
because we spend time together,

723
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,186
or we used to.

724
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,856
So, distance is making us distant,
which makes sense to me.

725
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,608
Huh.

726
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,570
But it's fine, really. We're gonna grow
apart when we go to college,

727
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,697
so we might as well
get the process started now.

728
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,449
Okay, well,

729
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,701
how about this?

730
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,537
I'm totally
booked out tonight and tomorrow,

731
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,957
but I am completely free on Saturday
and I will make sure it stays that way,

732
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,917
if you promise to go to Tino's with me.

733
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,001
Count me in.

734
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,103
Oh, hey, can we hit that new
zombie-themed escape room afterwards?

735
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,257
Yes, I am in.

736
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
All right.

737
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Hello again.

738
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,054
- Hey, I'll take a...
- Tuna melt on seven grain.

739
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:40,972
Yeah.

740
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,350
- Uh, thanks.
- Murph is my given name.

741
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,936
Oh, I guess I gotta give you this.

742
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,564
I just remembered that
this is when you usually come by.

743
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,441
- Yeah.
- We get paid a dollar above minimum wage,

744
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,111
so we're encouraged
to provide top service.

745
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,489
Uh, well, thanks, Murph.

746
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,871
- What?
- You were blushing.

747
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,998
Who is that? Huh?

748
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,917
Hey, yo, I work at White Castle, okay?
You know what that means,

749
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,461
I see some of the finest bitches
in the world every damn day,

750
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:17,049
and, Pops, I gotta tell you
with the utmost respect,

751
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,508
your daughter,

752
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,597
she's got to be one of the finest bitches
I have ever seen in my entire life,

753
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,309
and I've been to the Westminster Dog Show,
okay? All right.

754
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,477
[cell phone vibrating]

755

[grunting]

756
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,408
I have to take the browns
to the Super Bowl,

757
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,775
and by that I mean
I gotta take a hot deuce, right?

758
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,402
Daddy-o, where the bathroom at?

759
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,738
It's down the hall on the left.

760
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,821
Ooph.

761
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,700
I love you, baby.

762
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,206
Hey, Celia.

763
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,166
<i>What's up, Vanilla? What are you up to?</i>

764
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,877
I'm getting paid to be a douche
to a girl's parents,

765
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,106
so that they're more accepting of her real
boyfriend when they actually meet him.

766
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,090
<i>Um, parents have it hard.</i>

767
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,927
<i>What are you doing tomorrow?
Like early afternoonish?</i>

768
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,096
What, for my best customer?
I'm totally free. Why, what's up?

769
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,681
<i>I may have got you an interview</i>

770
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,476
<i>with the Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions at Yale.</i>

771
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,394
Oh, my God, Celia,
I don't know what to say.

772
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,729
<i>Well, why don't you try?</i>

773
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,191
Celia Lieberman, you make flowers blossom.

774
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,985
You are the reason trees have leaves.

775
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,321
You are a goddess.

776
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>Aw! That is absolutely correct.</i>

777
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,785
- What time should I pick you up?
<i>- You shouldn't.</i>

778
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,704
<i>This is your day, but it's my rules,
so I'm gonna pick you up at one.</i>

779
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,082
I'll text you my address.

780
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,750
<i>Bye.</i>

Woo hoo! Yo, man, that number two
turned to a number five real quick.

785
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,976
Where the plunger at?

[door closes]

787
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,989
What? I'm trying to look smart.
Do I look too smart?

788
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,783
It looks like someone
took a J. Crew store,

789
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,952
put it in a cannon
and shot it at your face.

790
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,162
Thank you, so much.
I mean, what do I do?

791
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,330
I don't understand clothes.

792
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,499
They're completely irrelevant
yet somehow important.

793
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,709
Lose the glasses.

794
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,919
Go on, give it to me.
Okay, that's better.

795
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,643
Do you need the cardigan?
I'm gonna answer that. You don't need it.

796
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,314
- I like the cardigan.
- No one likes it.

797
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,552
- Intellectual people wear cardigans.
- You do not look intellectual.

798
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,345
For the love of God, come on.

799
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,641
Oh, you know, what you do need though,
you need a mani.

800
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,060
That is a fight for another day,
my friend.

801
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,564
Wow, who would have thought that
Celia Lieberman could be so comforting?

802
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,900
It's like underneath all these layers
of angst and sarcasm,

803
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,902
there might actually be a human being.

804
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,323
Oh.

805
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,451
Thank you.

- Hi.
- Hi.

826
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,655
- [Celia] Hey.
- Yeah?

827
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,448
You're gonna kill it.

unless you don't.

830
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,421
Mr. Rattigan, a pleasure to meet you.

831
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,214
- Take a seat.
- Yes, sure.

832
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,594
So, tell me about yourself.

833
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,304
Yeah, I'd love to.

834
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,141
What says more about a person
than numbers, right?

835
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,227
So, the first time I took the SAT
I got a 1510,

836
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,980
and that was because I butchered
the math section, but

837
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,108
I knuckled down,
and I put work over parties,

838
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,903
and I managed to bump it up to a 1570
on my second time around.

839
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,564
- That's too bad.
- I'm sorry?

840
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,286
Well, that you missed out on parties.
Parties are fun.

841
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,789
It's important to enjoy life,
especially at your age.

842
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:03,502
With respect, it's not exactly the message
that we get from our parents and teachers.

843
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,045
I grant you that, yeah.

844
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,921
Well...

845
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,634
Mr. Rattigan, academically speaking, you
seem like the perfect candidate for Yale.

846
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,097
Thank you, sir.
Coming from you that means a lot.

847
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,890
But I want to know
a little something about you.

848
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,601
Tell me something about yourself,
activities, hobbies.

849
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,855
Sure, well I'm in French Club,
I'm a National Honors Society, and...

850
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,938
No.

851
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,692
No, I don't mean the things that you do,

852
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,986
because you think they look good
on an application.

853
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,239
What are some of your interests
outside of school?

854
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,866
Outside of school?

855
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,536
Example, I had a kid in here yesterday,
right there,

856
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,499
and he breeds trash-eating microbes
in his spare time.

857
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,834
It's fascinating stuff.

858
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,380
I don't... breed trash-eating microbes.

859
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,051
I don't really breed microbes at all,
but I do have hobbies,

860
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,095
and interests. I mean, so many of those.

861
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,145
There is this thing,
but I think you'll find it stupid.

862
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,897
No, what? What is it?

863
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,982
Well lately, I've been getting into

864
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,860
honey bees.

865
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,196
I don't...

866
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,989
I'm sorry,

867
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,534
did you just say, "Honey bees?"

868
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,535
Yeah.

869
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,120
Yeah, I'm a bit of an amateur beekeeper.

870
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,749
- I know, it sounds silly.
- No, it doesn't sound silly at all, to me.

871
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,919
I'm a bit of an apiarist myself.

872
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,005
- No kidding.
- Yes.

873
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,633
Wow, what a small world.

874
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,367
Tell me, what's your bee of choice?

875
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,053
I used to be all about the Russian bees,

876
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,099
but then I found that their swarminess
tended to be a little too...

877
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,183
Unpredictable.

878
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,562
Unpredictable, that's right.
So, now I'm a Buckfast man all the way.

879
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,398
- They have so much more foraging zeal.
- Yes.

880
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,696
Uh, and, you know, don't get me started
on their resistance to tracheal mites.

881
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,864
Huh.

882
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,658
Tracheal mites.

883
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,944
As soon as you get that application done,
you bring it into me personally, okay?

884
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,414
- Not my secretary.
- I will, sir.

885
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,207
- Sir, call me Delbert, please.
- Okay.

886
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,876
And when you come by,
don't forget to bring a jar of your honey.

887
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,280
As long as you bring a jar of your honey,
we can have ourselves a little honey swap.

888
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,007
Honey swap.
[chuckling]

889
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,300
I love it.

890
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,219
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Rattigan, truly.

891
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,887
The pleasure was mine, Delbert.

892
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:28,314
Thank you so much for setting this up. It
went better than I could have imagined it.

893
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,232
Well, happy to help. Just...

894
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,860
just one little tiny question.

895
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,030
Why exactly are you guys swapping honey?

896
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,366
What, is that unusual?

897
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,576
I can't believe you.

898
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,662
What? I did some research
before my interview, okay?

899
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,017
Hold on a second. What is the difference
between me spouting a few beekeeping facts

900
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,710
and any of the Stand-In dates
that I've been on? Huh?

901
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,463
You know that I'm not an art historian
or a douche, right?

902
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,883
No, actually I don't know that,
and this is completely different.

903
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,386
Those girls paid you to lie to them,
and this time you did it all on your own.

904
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,056
Look, it is hustle, baby, pure hustle.

905
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,819
Oh, God, please don't ever say that again.

906
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,602
It did sound a little bit better
coming out of Reece's mouth.

907
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,647
Wait, Reece? My cousin, Reece?
What does he know about hustle?

908
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,898
It's how he got his BMW.

909
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,984
Brooks, Reece got his car
because his dad started having an affair

910
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,820
with his sister's JV tennis coach,
and his mom found out about it,

911
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,784
so she starts sleeping with the dude
who owns a bunch of BMW dealerships,

912
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,533
hence the BMW.

913
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,620
- What, so no hustle?
- No.

914
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,954
You're telling me

915
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,041
that Reece got a brand new BMW i8,
because

916
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,460
his parents are shitty people?

917
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,672
Yeah. So, maybe you should rethink
who your role models are.

918
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,344
- What about Shelby and Franklin?
- What about Shelby and Franklin?

919
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,847
You don't know the first thing about
vinyl, and I am certainly not from Darien.

920
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,352
Okay? These are the lies that both of us
made up to get what we want.

921
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,732
Hmm.

922
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:58,612
Storming off, fantastic. That's what
people who're right and not hypocrites do.

923
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,781
Speak more words and I'll hurt you.

924
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,784
[music playing from car radio]

925
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,373
[sighs]

926
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,837
- Maybe you're right.
- About which thing? There were a couple.

927
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,005
Maybe I am a hypocrite, okay?

928
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,761
My parents say that I stomp around

929
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,596
in my boots looking tough...

930
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,349
to push people away,

931
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,017
because

932
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,356
I'm too scared to show people
who I really am.

933
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,904
Oh, God, if anyone actually heard me
saying this.

934
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,120
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

935
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,872
You are Celia Lieberman.

936
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:53,751
And being weird and confident are not
mutually exclusive elements to life.

937
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,586
You happen to be a master of both of them.

938
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,297
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.

939
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,593
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

940
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,805
So, I can Brooks' house
from across the street,

941
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,349
and sitting beside the outgoing mailbox,

942
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,351
there's this big flimsy cardboard box,

943
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:16,023
with like 20 postage stamps stuck to it
and just one word written across the top,

944
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,149
Idaho.

945
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,736
So, the mailman picks it up,
and immediately the box gives out,

946
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,239
and little six-year-old Brooks
slips out the bottom,

947
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,866
and hits the pavement like, "Bam!"

948
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,203
I'm hiding across the street
watching it all, like...

949
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,374
- Just laughing my ass off.
- Okay, wait, so what did you do?

950
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,628
I mean the only thing that I could do is
"Good afternoon, Mr. Postman,"

951
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,047
and I grabbed my backpack
and went back inside my house.

952
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,467
I can't believe you tried
to mail yourself to Idaho.

953
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,928
- Thanks, Brooks.
- Thank you so much. I got this.

954
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,429
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

955
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,431
- Nice guy.
- Fancy man.

956
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,266
[Celia laughs]

957
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,770
Okay, so of all places, why Idaho?

958
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,439
It's where his mom lives.

959
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,901
Yeah, she's married
to some rich pediatrician

960
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,655
or rich plastic surgeon,
rich pediatric plastic surgeon.

961
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,074
And they have two kids together

962
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,953
and every year they send Brooks
and his dad a Christmas card

963
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,956
with a picture of her whole new family.

964
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,125
You know, which to me,
seems totally screwed up.

965
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,384
[Brooks] See you, Tino!

966
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,509
[Murph] Tino!

967
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,888
[cell phone vibrating]

968
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,475
- Was that tuna melt on seven grain?
- If only.

969
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,187
- Uh? Tuna melt on seven grain?
- It's nothing.

970
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,816
Murph here has a little crush
on one of the Sub shop regulars.

971
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,943
We don't know his name,
so we call him by his order.

972
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,570
He hasn't been in the shop for a week.

973
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,322
I think I scared him off
by pre-making his sandwich.

974
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,324
Aw, you pre-made his sandwich?

975
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,785
- That is adorable.
- Listen, you're gonna be fine.

976
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,370
He'll show up, and if not,

977
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,788
who cares, right?

978
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,834
You are going to find the right sandwich
one day, my friend.

979
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,627
That is the lamest thing you've ever said.

980
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,755
- Yeah, but you're laughing, aren't you?
- Get away from me, get away.

981
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,341
I'm glad someone's getting
something out of my dating life.

982
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,425
Yeah.

983
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:12,389
All right, Godspeed
to you on your date tonight.

984
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,515
Are you ready to

985
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,226
get some zombies?

986
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,936
I am.

987
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,190
But you seem unenthusiastic.

988
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,444
No, man. I got a request
while we were eating.

989
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,361
Take it.

990
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,613
What? Are you serious?

991
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,696
Really.

992
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,533
All right, thank you.
You're a really good friend.

993
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,118
Hey, good to meet you.

994
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,286
Yeah, you too.

995
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,205
[sentimental music playing]

996
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,587
- It was what?
- It was, it was…

997
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,259
[dance music playing]

998
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,638
- [Brooks] Your insurance must be so high.
- [Celia] Yeah.

999
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,932
[both laughing]

1000
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,475
[Celia] You know what?

1001
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,728
Does the master have any advice for me,
for my big date?

1002
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,851
Yeah, I do actually.
- Good. - Don't dance.

1003
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:07,527
- That is so offensive. Get out of my car.
- I was just trying to help you.

1004
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,655
You know, today was horrible

1005
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,531
until it wasn't.

1006
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,824
I agree.

1007
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:19,039
Do me a favor, would you have fun tonight?
Seriously, you're gonna dazzle him.

1008
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,376
Unless you don't.

1009
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,878
Get out of my car.

1010
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,214
- I will drive off.
- Okay.

1011
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,758
- Right now.
- I'm out. Have a good night.

[Franklin] <i>The truth about coffee,</i>

1013
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,099
it's all in the grind.

00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,772
it seeps through the filter too quickly,
and you end up with a weak-ass brew.

1016
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,734
Wow, you know a lot about coffee.

1017
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,695
Pour Over is an art form.

1018
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,197
It's not like that overly processed
swill you've got.

1019
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,118
I don't know,
I kind of like my overly processed swill.

1020
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,744
I'm sorry.

1021
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,082
I didn't mean to insult you.
I ramble when I'm nervous.

1022
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,543
Wait, did you just say you're nervous?

1023
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,169
- Of course I am.
- Why?

1024
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,007
I don't know if this is a date or not,
because you have a boyfriend.

1025
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,758
Oh, Brooks is not...

1026
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,512
Um, he is my boyfriend,
and we are dating hard.

1027
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,724
We're dating hard,
but, you know, we have, um,

1028
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:23,895
one of those advanced modern
relationships.

1029
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,564
We don't belong to anyone.

1030
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,191
I watched this <i>Nat Geo</i> doc
about dung beetles,

1031
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:32,070
how they find their mates by analyzing the
movements of a prospective mate's wings,

1032
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,992
and if they move in the same specific way,
they know they found their mate.

1033
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,912
Watching you and Brooks,
you move the same,

1034
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,582
like a couple of adorable dung beetles.

1035
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,168
Well,

1036
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,464
we're not shit-eating beetles, though.

1037
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,969
We're actually gonna be breaking up
very soon. In fact, very soon.

1038
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,095
- Okay.
- Um-hmm.

1039
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,056
So, I'm encouraged.

1040
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,892
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

1041
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,146
So, you're into vinyl,

1042
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,816
and you're obviously very passionate
about coffee.

1043
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,401
What else are you into?

1044
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,530
I'm passionate about a lot of things,
most of all, my art.

1045
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,033
That's cool, I like art.

1046
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,285
- What's your medium?
- The street.

1047
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,454
No.

1048
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,208
Actually, you may have seen some
of my stuff, like, around town.

1049
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,042
What?

1050
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,671
- Oh.
- [whispering] I'm...

1051
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,755
Don't say it.

1052

I'm Trashbug.

1053
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
You said it.

1054
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,054
You said who you are.

1055
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,806
- Are you familiar with my work?
- Uh-huh.

1056
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,558
Okay, you know how I did like
a baby in a gas mask,

1057
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,477
and I did like an old man in gas mask.

1058
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,478
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,148
Right now, I'm working on something
that is going to blow those away.

1060
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,442
A cat in a gas mask.

1061
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,531
It's a commentary on itself and on
Dr. Seuss. I mean, cats don't wear hats.

1062
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,117
That is

1063
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,578
a very creative idea.

1064
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,090
Dude,

1065
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,343
Saturday night was insane. I just can't
tell if it was in a good or bad way.

1066
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,597
You think high school parties are crazy,
they have got nothing on office parties.

1067
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,350
I saw a drunk guy snort a line
of printer toner.

1068
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,188
Thanks again for letting me off the hook.

1069
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,276
Wow, what a great image of our friendship.

1070
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,735
I'm a fisherman,

1071
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,238

to your death.

1072
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,782
That's not how I meant it.
How was your night?

1073
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,536
I was alone, so I got paired with
this group of drunk Germans.

1074
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,454
They didn't speak a word of English,

1075
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,583
so I wasn't included in any of the puzzle
solving, and to top if all off,

1076
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,002
a zombie,
it got me in like the first ten minutes.

1077
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,880
- The zombie actually bit you?
- No.

1078
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,882
One of the Germans did.

1079
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,306
It's not funny, sorry, just...

1080
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,686
[chuckling] It is a little funny.
It's funny, if you think it's funny too.

1081
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,062
But only if you...

1082
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,398
- It's funny. Come on.
- I gotta go to class.

1083
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,481
Murph.

1084
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,695

- Hey.
- No, you do not talk, I do the talking.

1087
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,329
Excuse me?

1088
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,412
<i>I trusted you,</i>

1089
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,625
Celia, and you chewed up that trust
and you spit it in my face.

1090
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,296
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- I'm practicing for the big show.

1091
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,549
<i>- Come on, did you forget?</i>
- Oh, yeah, our breakup.

1092
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:44,095
So, I'm thinking that Shelby and Franklin
need to be there when it happens,

1093
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,472
so when we go off on our own,

1094
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,098
<i>they're gonna wanna console us.</i>

1095
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,310
Oh, shit, I almost forgot to ask you,
how did your date go?

1096

<i>Well,</i>

1097
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,900

You're writing a breakup script?

1124
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,946
Not a breakup script,
more like breakup bullet points.

I mean, those two were being
really chummy at my party.

1183
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,205
Yeah, well I can be oblivious sometimes.

1184
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,081
Thank you for rubbing that in.

1185
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,732
- So, here's a question.
- Yes, whatever it is, yes.

1186
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,192
[laughter]

1187
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,486
Will you go to formal with me?

1188
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,576
I mean, do I have to speak or can you
read my alarming fast heart rate? Yes.

1189
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,544
Hold on, you guys have another formal?
How many does your school have?

1190
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,046
As many that are needed
to fund the new stables.

1191
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,385
Murph, you will never believe what
happened to me. Shelby kissed me.

1192
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:20,014
Oh, dude, congrats.
I always knew you could do it.

1193
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,434
- Who's Shelby?
- Toby, why are you here? Where's Murph?

1194
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,728
- We switched shifts.
- Why? Is he sick?

1195
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,439
I don't think so,
because it wasn't just for today.

1196
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,567
It was for like the rest of the year.

1197
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,570
- Did he say why?
- No.

1198
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:39,951
Oh, yeah, you know what,
he did say that you were a selfish prick

1199
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,037
and that you only think about yourself.

1200
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,293
You don't think that has anything
to do with him switching shifts, do you?

1201
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,590
[woman] I guess you think
this is pretty pathetic...

1202
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,634
going for a walk with some old lady.

1203
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,638
No, I feel like I actually needed this.

1204
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,934
My granddaughter set this up.
I don't know the first thing about apps,

1205
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,646
unless it's the Bloomin' Onion
at Outback Steakhouse.

1206
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,691
- Now that's a good app.
- Mm-hm.

1207
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,780
My husband and I did this every day
for the past 20 years.

1208
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:22,118
- He passed away in June.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

1209
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,286
Oliver.

1210
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:24,954
That was his name.

1211
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,666
He was ugly as sin.

1212
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,252
His face was weird.

1213
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,966
He had the right sized face
on the wrong sized head.

1214
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,303
Ol' smushy face,

1215
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:41,971
that's what I called him.

1216
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,848
That's real nice.

1217
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,684
I didn't care what he looked like.

1218
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,855
He made me laugh,
and I liked being around him.

1219
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,652
You want to know how you can tell
if you're meant to be with someone?

1220
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,488
- Please.
- It's simple.

1221
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,282
Just sit and have a conversation.

1222
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,202
Some people when you talk to them,

1223
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,913
it's like trying to listen to
classical music

1224
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,623
on a radio with no antenna.

1225
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,626
You can push that dial back and forth
all you want,

1226
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,252
but you only get static.

1227
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,215
But when you're meant to be
with someone,

1228
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,717
and they truly are the one,

1229
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,220
you just sit,

1230
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,763
start talking,

1231
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,183
and a Beethoven sonata
will begin to play.

1232
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,738
[text message tone]

1233
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,302
You haven't mentioned the formal, Cel.
It's tomorrow night.

1234
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,013
Do you get a cut of the ticket sales
or something?

1235
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,767
- You are going, right?
- I am actually.

1236
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,227
- With whom?
- Nobody.

1237
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,854
I'm going whom-less.

1238
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,230
What about Brooks?

1239
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,316
I thought you guys were hanging out,

1240
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,235
to use the parlance of your time.

1241
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,779
Dad, no. I don't want to go with anybody.

1242
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,032
Not Brooks Rattigan, not Franklin Volley,
nobody.

1243
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,201
- Okay?
- Honey, listen...

1244
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,536
No, Mom, can you listen?

1245
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,540
I have the rest of my life to get hung up
on relationships and dating,

1246
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,126
and "Is he really into me?",
and "What does this text mean?"

1247
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,711
- And all that bullshit.
- Celia.

1248
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:41,634
Why is high school the time of your life that
you're expected to be good at everything?

1249
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,010
I just wanna be whatever I am.

1250
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,262
And I'm proud of that.

1251
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,849
I just wanted you to have a better
high school experience than I had.

1252
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,019
Here we go.

1253
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,480
- Group hug.
- No, that's good.

1254
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,731
- Group hug.
- Please.

1255
01:02:56,814 --> 01:03:00,067
- Yep.
- Oh, do we have to? Stop.

1256

[car door creaking]

1257
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,905
Okay.

[doorbell]

1259
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,759
Wow.

1260
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,094
You look incredible.

1261
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,387
Thanks.

1262
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,933
It only took three stylists,
two hairdressers, one makeup artist,

1263
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:35,186
Bioslimming active wrap,
two hours of pilates,

1264
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,064
and like 12 pounds of moisturizer
to look this way.

1265
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,191
Wow. I took a shower.

1266
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,945
Hold on, wait, chivalry is not dead.

1267
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,948
- All right.
- Thank you.

1268
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,573
You're welcome.

1269
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,494

We ordered our tuna crudo,
like, ten minutes ago.

1272
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,142
Yeah, it was a while ago.

1273
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:23,109
So, Shelby, do you have any plans
for after high school?

1274
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,611
I don't know, it's tough.

1275
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,406
I don't, like, have my whole life
planned out or anything.

1276
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,658
- Yeah, nobody does.
- Exactly.

1277
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,369
So, in the fall,
I'll be going to Columbia,

1278
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,580
where I'll major in applied economics
in management

1279
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,998
with a concentration in finance,

1280
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,626
and of course, I'll intern at my father's
hedge fund over the summers.

1281
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,629
Then, it's off to Harvard Business School,
where I'll get my MBA.

1282
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,757
I'll graduate, get some seed money

1283
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,135
and then open up
my own private equity firm, but...

1284
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,179
after that,
it's all kind of up in the air.

1285
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,016
You really have to get
your shit together, huh?

1286
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,434
Right, yeah.

1287
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:01,102
- Yeah.
- How about you?

1288
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,274
- Me?
- Yeah.

1289
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,818
Well, I'm applying to Yale,

1290
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:07,653
and then I'll...

1291
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,536
Well, I've been obsessing over just

1292
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,832
applying for so long, that I haven't even
thought about what I would do if I got in.

1293
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,168
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1294
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,546
Yeah, but I'm 18.

1295

I got time to figure out who I am
and what I want to do.

1296
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,845

1297
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,305

It's your ex.

01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,746
Is this gonna be weird for you?

1303
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,832
I mean, I personally don't care at all,
but maybe you should?

1304
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,125
No, it's fine.

1305

Wow, she's a really bad dancer.

- Yeah, sure.

01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,780
She is elsewhere.

1349
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,200

1351
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,082
Oh, you know, he's somewhere.

01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,794

to be an artist again.

- You guys didn't work out?
- No.

No, we didn't.
You know, he's not really my type.

1357
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,604
Right.

1358
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:15,692
Well, then,

1359
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,155
would you like to dance?

1360
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,371
No.

1361
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:29,873
No, I wouldn't.

1362
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,624

Yeah.

I see.

01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,595
And what do those two words mean
in this context?

1375
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,557
Well, I started a dating service app.

1376
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,142
- What?
- Yeah.

1377
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,226
I was the date,

I mean, it was more just really...

01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:40,361
school dances, and um...

1382
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:43,113

I'd have sold a non-vital organ,
if I'd known it meant that much to you.

1387
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,713
There's a reason God gave us two kidneys.

1388
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:03,175
That spare kidney is just a rainy day
cash cow, sitting there.

1389

It wasn't really just for the money.

1390
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,974
I went out on all these dates

1391
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:14,228
and pretended to be whatever it was
that these girls wanted me to be,

1392
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,272
because, I don't know, I thought that...

1393
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:21,485
I thought that maybe I would find out
who I am, and Miss Track...

1394
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,947
quite cruelly pointed out that
I have absolutely no idea who I am.

1395
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,323
Anyway, it didn't work.

1396
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,993
Yeah, well who the hell knows
who they are anyway.

1397
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:32,037
We are all just figuring it out
as we go along.

1398

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1399
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,958
So, the best you can do is

1400
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,711
reflect on who you were in the past

1401
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,422
and compare that to
who you wanna be in the future,

1402
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,466
and you split the difference.
That's who you are now.

1403
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,469

1404

Is being a good dad.

1409
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,861
Because of who you turned out to be.

1410

I know sometimes
you think I gave up and...

1411
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,243
yeah, maybe there's some truth in that.

1412
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,289
But I never gave up on you.

01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:17,957

- Cool.

Not used to you being alone.

1419
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,563
Yeah, well, I've successfully
pushed everyone else away, so...

1420
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,693
It occurred to me that
I never would have been able to get

1429

or my actions right now.

he's obviously better looking than you.

so you have got to make the first move.

at what we have to do.

what happened with you and my cousin,

1446
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,263

1447
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,432
I'll let you take my car for the weekend.

I hope you didn't waste
too much time on it,

1482
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,542
because based on your meeting
with the Dean,

1483
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,337
you could have drawn a picture of a bee
and gotten in.

1484
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,672
I actually didn't apply to Yale.

1485
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,134
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I accepted UCONN's offer.

Uh...

Hold on, I thought Yale
was everything to you.

1488
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,184
It was.

1489
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,687
It was and then I realized

1490
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,357
that if I have to pretend
to be someone else to get in,

1491
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,942
then I probably don't belong there.

1492
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,026
