about my life based on

I could always walk away.

494
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,927
I killed Lathan because
he was becomin' a pain,

I would feel better

from the neighborhood
we thought we could trust...

and kept track of the weight.

and broke them down into ounces.

the procaine or vitamin B
to the weight that was chopped.

would know what was
really goin' on.

each one of them
to the runners...

of what was ordered.

what we lost.
