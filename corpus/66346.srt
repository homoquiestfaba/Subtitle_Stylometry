1
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,529
It stopped.

2
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,630
What's that, Dave?

3
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,639
Nothing.

4
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,697
How we doing?

5
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,936
Oh, we're ready.

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,171
You feeling the magic?

7
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,043
Oh, I'm feeling the magic,
all right.

8
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,139
Let's hit 'em.

9
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,274
Yeah.

10
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,442
Let's do it.

11
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,450
Here we go.

12
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,781
Let's hit 'em.

13
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,379
Let's go make $30 million.

14
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,486
Good morning.

15
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,623
Before I begin, let me...

16
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,374
David?

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,238
I'll go get help.

18
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,870
Jesus. Jesus, David.

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,971
Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!

20
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,242
David?

21
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,123
Nick?

22
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,217
Vicky?!

23
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,989
Vicky!

24
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,918
Okay, it's okay.

25
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,420
It's okay.

26
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,252
Everybody else off the bus.

27
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,295
Sound waves.

28
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,134
So, if we know that sound waves

29
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:57,438
gain wavelength
and lose frequency

30
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,775
as they travel
through more dense materials...

31
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,914
...then the anomalies
in these waves

32
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,044
are the means by which
we can surmise

33
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,556
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,360
How are the nails coming,
Christine?

35
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,656
Good.

36
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,701
All right,
let's have a demonstration.

37
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,203
Mr. Acker, Veronica.

38
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,568
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,267
All right.

40
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,641
Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

41
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,839
loves walks in the park,
bedtime stories,

42
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,846
big romantic.

43
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,904
Loves Chet.

44
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,110
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

45
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,484
Watch the oscilloscope,
all right?

46
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,613
Here we go.

47
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,254
Dr. Joshua Keyes?

48
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,698
Maybe.

49
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,359
Yes or no, sir?

50
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,370
The first one.

51
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,996
Please come with us, sir.

52
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,801
Guys, wh-what's going on?

53
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,345
We don't know, sir.

54
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,438
What do you mean,
you don't know?

55
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,279
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

56
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,013
I have security clearance?

57
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,215
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

58
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,314
I have a jet?

59
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,938
Hey, Serge.

60
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,235
Ah!

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,242
Serge.

62
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,278
Serge.

63
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,437
Damn!

64
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,572
It's about time.
You're always late.

65
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,174
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

66
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,344
What am I doing here?

67
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,615
They wouldn't brief me
until you got here.

68
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,487
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military.

69
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,820
I hate them.

70
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,520
When are you going to meet
a nice girl

71
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,653
and bring her for dinner?

72
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,718
I'm married to my work.

73
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,958
So am I.

74
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,523
Which makes my wife
my mistress...

75
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,398
that's why I'm still
in love with her.

76
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,071
You were always a romantic.

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,231
I love my wife.

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,899
Yeah, I know.
I love your wife, too.

79
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,237
I know.

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,301
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

81
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,107
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

82
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,580
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

83
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,911
Ah, the cheese.

84
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,746
You're...
you're teasing me, right?

85
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,252
Oh, my...!

86
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,084
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

87
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,885
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

88
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,356
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.

89
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,360
No. If you were
in the wrong place,

90
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,259
you would've already been shot.

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,457
That's a hell of a greeting.

92
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,931
Serge.

93
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,227
Serge.

94
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,598
Serge. Yes.
Always a pleasure.

95
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,761
Same here, Thomas.

96
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,929
Dr. Keyes.

97
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,439
- I know.
- Tom Purcell.

98
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,101
Gentlemen, you do realize
that everything here

99
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,941
is totally classified, okay?

100
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,948
At 10:30 a.m. Local time,

101
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,815
32 civilians,
all within a 10-block radius...

102
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,946
died.

103
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,752
They didn't get sick first.

104
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,884
They simply hit the ground dead.

105
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,892
Nerve agent?

106
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,893
Our first guess. No.

107
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,827
They all died
at the same time?

108
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,161
As far as we can tell,
to the second.

109
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,564
This hits CNN in one hour.

110
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,896
I need a reason.

111
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,437
Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

112
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,132
They all had pacemakers.

113
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,896
Under a minute.

114
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,340
Your reputation is
well deserved.

115
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,340
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How did you guess?

116
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,814
Without any clues
from the victims?

117
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,815
No, that's...

118
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,044
Serge and I are the clues.

119
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,246
I mean, he specializes
in high energy weapons.

120
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,253
I do geomagnetics.

121
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,789
So calling us means you suspect

122
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,348
an electromagnetic
pulse weapon.

123
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,189
If these are
the only fatalities,

124
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,252
they must be people
susceptible to...

125
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,661
electronic interference.

126
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,755
QED pacemakers.

127
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,527
You're spooky sometimes, eh?

128
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,829
Now I need to know,

129
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,234
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

130
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,362
The power that you would need

131
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,906
to create an EM pulse
strong enough...

132
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,635
I mean, that's...
that's not a weapon that

133
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,801
- I've ever heard of.
- No.

134
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,141
Okay, we're done.

135
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,146
We're not done, sir.

136
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,739
There's nothing on the other
side of the equal sign.

137
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,875
I agree with Joshua...

138
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,248
Thank you.

139
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,651
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

140
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,984
but since it's not,

141
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,854
I think we can all breathe
a little easier, can't we?

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,941
Look at my hat.

143
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,683
What is it, sweetheart?

144
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,086
It's okay, son.

145
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,857
These things happen
all the time and...

146
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,235
Let's, go, let's go!
Come on!

147
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,848
Justin!

148
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,520
Watch out, you bloody idiot!

149
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,595
Hurry! Run!

150
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,676
Daddy!

151
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,653
The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,

152
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,095
but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.

153
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,030
Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds

154
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,796
were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...

155
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,770
And it's not just this time.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

156
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,362
But seemed to be confused
and flying blind.

157
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,101
The FOrtean Times reported
violent bird swarms

158
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,642
twice last month in
Australia and Japan.

159
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,678
Five people are confirmed dead
and dozens injured

160
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,270
in the panic that followed the
bizarre and terrifying incident

161
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,872
in London's historic
Trafalgar Square.

162
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,076
- Weird.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,448
Quite strange, also.

164
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,508
Mm. Strange, indeed.

165
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,952
Mm!

166
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,223
How do birds navigate?

167
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,419
By sight?

168
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,121
No, no, no,
the long range stuff.

169
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,163
Magnetic fields.

170
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,561
Little ions in their brains

171
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,759
align with the magnetic field
of the Earth.

172
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,235
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

173
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,396
Acker.

174
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,406
Hit the 'Net, do a search for...

175
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,237
oh, two years ought to do it.

176
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,209
Any and all, like, "weird news",
you know...

177
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,472
bizarre animal migrations,

178
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,945
specifically birds.

179
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,378
Whale and dolphin beachings.

180
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,508
Unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

181
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,677
you know,
just use your imagination.

182
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,243
That is a huge search.

183
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,448
You can use our T-1 line
to look up Sailor Moon crap.

184
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,854
You're up to this.

185
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,392
Danni, Danni,
get me the brightest kids

186
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,688
from the Field Theory Class,

187
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,922
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

188
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,089
What are we doing?

189
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,756
I need a 3-D computer model
of the Earth

190
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,765
to lay the field over.

191
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:35,926
Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?

192
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,596
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

193
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,536
Map out the anomalies
that Acker finds

194
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,130
and grunt out the equations.

195
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,197
And, uh...

196
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,936
grab those smelly kids

197
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,410
from the Non-Linear
Diff class, too.

198
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,071
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

199
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,513
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

200
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,777
- Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded.

201
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,512
Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.

202
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,492
Be wrong. Be wrong.

203
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,917
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.

204
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,418
Give me some drag, will you?

205
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,252
Roger that.

206
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,765
We are in attitude and ready
for an entry interface.

207
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,097
Nice work, Major.

208
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,501
I have the controls
now for E.I.

209
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,302
I could take us in.

210
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,636
You could...

211
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,801
but you won't.

212
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,935
I'm ready for this, Bob.

213
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,376
Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

214
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,539
You're trained,
and you're certified...

215
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,378
doesn't make you the commander.

216
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,315
And the commander
lands the bird.

217
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,649
You got to be the youngest
person ever in space.

218
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,450
You should say,
thank you, be happy.

219
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,319
Now.

220
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,860
EndeavOur, Houston,
at this time

221
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,588
we show you go for reentry.

222
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,187
Houston, EndeavOur descending
through 400,000 feet

223
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,596
coming upon entry interface.

224
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,963
EndeavOur, this is Flight.

225
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,661
Weren't able to annoy
the commander

226
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,670
into letting you
bring her in this time?

227
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,670
That's a negative, Stick.

228
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,967
I'll have to be
more annoying next time.

229
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:55,836
Is that even possible?

230
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,841
EndeavOur,

231
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,605
we see you in
good entry config.

232
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,872
Roger, Houston.

233
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,911
Advise.

234
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,576
I'm seeing those
plasma trails now.

235
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,586
All right, mark 241/2.

236
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,917
So, a minute to air.

237
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,683
I don't believe in belts.

238
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,730
Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.

239
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,934
Com dropout.

240
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,079
Start the I Com.

241
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,741
Let's wait till the...

242
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,580
Com restored.

243
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,020
Quiet!

244
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,361
We are out of position here.

245
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,233
Guidance shows us
on energy and on course.

246
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,739
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

247
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,240
We're not where we should be.

248
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,435
Where the hell are we?

249
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,310
EndeavOur, guidance is bad.

250
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,178
You are now
1-2-niner miles off course.

251
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,547
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed.

252
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,516
Is that...?

253
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,611
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

254
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,280
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

255
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,154
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

256
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,193
Doesn't make sense.

257
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,353
The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

258
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,761
We're heading straight
for downtown.

259
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,798
We're not going to crash
into Los Angeles.

260
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,231
They're going to hit
downtown L.A.

261
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,267
At 300 knots.

262
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,062
Bob, you know L.A.?
Because I have an idea.

263
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,198
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

264
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,742
Can you clear a freeway?

265
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,641
Okay, thank you.

266
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,043
Come on. Come on.

267
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,743
It's rush hour, Commander,

268
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,215
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

269
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,287
Sir, I have an alternate.

270
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,583
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

271
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,021
It's Houston's call. Houston?

272
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,159
Computers are still plotting.

273
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,388
Come on.

274
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,240
Houston, we are running

275
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,408
out of time here.

276
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,213
Sir, I have an alternate.

277
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,253
All right, Beck,
what do you got?

278
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,344
Houston, I have coordinates

279
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,353
for an alternate landing site.

280
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,354
Can you confirm?

281
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,118
EndeavOur, give them to me.

282
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,922
I show possible touchdown...
at 33.55 north, 118.10 west.

283
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,453
Bill?

284
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,159
It's theoretically possible.

285
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,030
EndeavOur,

286
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,090
that is confirmed.

287
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,138
Turn right, heading 1-7-5.

288
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,229
Expect visual contact

289
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,537
with Los Angeles River
in five seconds.

290
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,179
No, that will not work, Houston.

291
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,910
We got bridges
every few hundred yards.

292
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,713
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

293
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,185
I've figured the "L"
over "D" max.

294
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,222
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

295
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,347
We're coming in high and hot.

296
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,463
290 feet, 320.

297
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,499
- 270, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

298
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,692
You're armed.

299
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,426
Gear down. Now.

300
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,264
Gear in transition.

301
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,043
240 feet, 290.

302
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,170
Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

303
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,448
210 feet, 265.

304
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,382
Get out of the way! Move!

305
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,746
Derotate.

306
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,951
Inward.

307
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,088
230... 210...

308
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,531
Speed brakes!

309
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,863
100%.

310
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,198
Oh, we're way too fast.

311
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,362
Deploy the chute.

312
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,236
No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.

313
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,938
Banking right.

314
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,641
Commander, that next bridge!

315
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,707
Watch it!

316
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,981
We're way too high
for that one!

317
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,987
Suck up the gear!

318
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,114
Not yet.
We'll lose all steering.

319
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,488
We hit, it's over!

320
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,621
And... gear up now!

321
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,568
Lock your harnesses.
This is out of my hands.

322
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,415
Let's get out of here!

323
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,822
Run! Let's get out!

324
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,635
Dr. Zimsky?!

325
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,864
Will you make sure
my assistant has

326
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,871
your number, darling?

327
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,872
Sure.

328
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,873
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello.

329
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,874
I'll call security.

330
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,911
No, it's all right.
It's all right. Hello.

331
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:33,909
Thank you, sir.

332
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,707
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

333
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,679
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

334
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,579
No, sir, I don't need you
to sign it.

335
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,844
I need you to read that.

336
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,249
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

337
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,584
- I'm late for the White House.
- Sir, please.

338
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,384
I need you to confirm
my results, sir.

339
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,721
Young man, do you have any idea
who I am?

340
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,852
Yes, I do, sir.
Please read this.

341
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,191
What's it about?

342
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,532
It's the end of the world.

343
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,660
No, I... this is impossible.
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,493
L-l-I can't have missed this.

345
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,555
You-You have to be wrong.

346
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,896
I mean, look, I'm sure

347
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,163
with careful comparison
to my own work,

348
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,499
we'll find that
you are mistaken.

349
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,005
No offense, but...

350
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,836
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

351
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,943
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

352
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,073
Rebecca?

353
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,733
Only you and Dad
ever call me that.

354
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,573
Well, Beck.

355
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,113
So, what brings you
to sunny D.C.?

356
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,046
The Board of Review
is next week.

357
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,350
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

358
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,547
How bad is it?

359
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,217
Your crew crashed
the space shuttle.

360
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,125
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

361
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,560
Sir, this is my life.

362
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,722
Well...

363
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,027
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

364
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,330
It still is and has always been
my life.

365
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,165
It's over.

366
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,400
It's over, Rebecca.

367
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,101
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,802
It's right down here.

369
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:19,809
Really?

370
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,776
It's like the 4th of July.

371
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,972
What the hell's the hurry here?

372
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,911
Rebecca, would you excuse me,
please?

373
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,647
Excuse me.

374
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:33,953
Purcell.

375
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:39,691
Thomas, um, look...

376
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,359
it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

377
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,320
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

378
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,057
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

379
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,220
Conrad Zimsky.

380
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,661
Herr Zimsky.

381
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,062
Superstar.

382
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,829
Oh...

383
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,405
I think I skipped drunk.

384
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,638
Went right to hangover.

385
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,704
Weren't you the one?

386
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,305
I spoke with the kids.

387
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,715
They don't sleep at night.

388
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:38,916
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

389
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,959
Is there any chance
you're wrong?

390
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,652
No. The sky, man.

391
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,356
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

392
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,829
That's high-altitude
static discharge.

393
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,798
I know.

394
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,461
Dr. Keyes...

395
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,733
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

396
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,275
Ah... it's my best buddies.

397
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,810
Hey!

398
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,743
Why don't you join
us for a drink?

399
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,373
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

400
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,246
And if I were to say no?

401
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,683
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

402
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,914
Well, we have
no sense of humor.

403
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,080
That's true.

404
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,348
Oh...

405
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,393
And we're armed.

406
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,026
Thank you.

407
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,565
Dr. Keyes, welcome.

408
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,933
Thank you.

409
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,197
Dr. Zimsky informs us

410
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,206
that you made a
useful contribution

411
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,265
to his investigations,
so he wanted you

412
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,776
to assist him
in the briefing.

413
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,539
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

414
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,911
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

415
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,951
Now, why don't you begin,

416
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,713
and I'll fill in
all the difficult bits.

417
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,786
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

418
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,052
Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

419
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,729
And let me explain why.

420
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,635
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

421
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,434
It's made up of...
electricity and magnetism,

422
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,407
so it's called...
creatively enough...

423
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,909
the electromagnetic field.

424
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,174
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

425
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,511
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

426
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,312
So this EM field is our friend.

427
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,285
But now...?

428
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,752
But now,

429
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,380
that field is falling apart.

430
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,481
Why?

431
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,150
Why?

432
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,723
This here.

433
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,065
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

434
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,732
Quick and dirty.

435
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,674
The thin skin,
that's the Earth's crust.

436
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,438
That's what we live on.

437
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,672
It's 30 miles thick.

438
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,580
The meat here,
call it the mantle.

439
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,448
And forgetting
all the-the funky transitions,

440
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,953
it's 2,000 miles thick.

441
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,455
The core,

442
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,958
the peach pit in the center...
that's a tricky one.

443
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,321
There's two parts...

444
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,861
the inner core
and the outer core.

445
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,918
Are you following me?

446
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,827
The inner core

447
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,832
is, uh...

448
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,891
well, it's a big, solid chunk
of iron,

449
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,060
we think.

450
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,501
And that's surrounded

451
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,766
by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

452
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,137
Yes, but,

453
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,177
most importantly, this liquid
is constantly spinning

454
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,303
in one direction.

455
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,644
So a trillion trillion tons
of hot metal

456
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,117
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

457
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,244
Right, so Physics 101...

458
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,788
hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

459
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,450
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine

460
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,391
that drives the EM Field.

461
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,692
And that's where
we have our problem.

462
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,129
This engine has stalled.

463
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,134
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

464
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,895
How could this have happened?

465
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,404
We don't know.

466
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,637
What's the timeline here?

467
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,239
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

468
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,342
we'll start seeing
isolated incidents.

469
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,909
One plane
will fall from the sky,

470
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,147
and then two, and then...

471
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,621
in a few months, anything...

472
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,555
everything electronic
will be fried.

473
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,092
Static discharges
in the atmosphere

474
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,060
will create "super-storms"
with hundreds

475
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,653
of lightening strikes
per square mile.

476
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,698
After that, it gets bad.

477
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,399
The Earth's EM Field

478
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,632
shields us from the solar winds,
which are a lethal blend

479
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,608
of radioactive particles
and microwaves.

480
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,113
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

481
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,545
will literally

482
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,641
cook our planet.

483
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,276
Dr. Zimsky.

484
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,081
This is the Sun.

485
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:35,923
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

486
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,824
Would you?

487
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,158
Mm-hmm.

488
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,937
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

489
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,308
A full year,
the field collapses...

490
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,677
and that.

491
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,885
May I?

492
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,920
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

493
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,160
So, how do we fix it?

494
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,093
We can't.

495
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,152
Not in my vocabulary.

496
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,630
Then you might want
to get one of those

497
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,291
Word-A-Day calendars,
General, because

498
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,300
it's impossible.

499
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,427
The core is the size
of Mars.

500
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,232
You're talking about
jump-starting a planet.

501
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,136
This is a superheated
hyper-fluid

502
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,903
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

503
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,308
2,000 miles down,
1,000 miles thick.

504
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,782
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

505
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,408
with a two-inch drill bit.

506
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,782
If we can go into space,
we certainly...

507
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,785
Well, space is easy.

508
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,616
It's empty.

509
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,656
We're talking
about millions of pounds

510
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,156
of pressure
per square inch.

511
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,490
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

512
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,462
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

513
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,125
Yes, but...

514
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,272
...what if we could?

515
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,151
Hello, Braz.

516
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,354
Why the hell
aren't you dead yet?

517
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,062
Okay, this way.

518
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,205
Well, that went better
than I expected.

519
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,365
Dr. Brazzleton,

520
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,703
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

521
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,834
Yeah.

522
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,242
20 years ago,
he stole my research.

523
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,304
After that,
we-we kind of lost touch.

524
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,042
Research that
was equally mine.

525
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,778
That's funny,
I don't remember a check

526
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,876
from any of the patents.

527
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,751
All right, Braz.

528
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,053
20 years in the desert makes
you a prophet and a martyr.

529
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,617
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

530
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,688
Okay, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

531
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,529
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

532
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,796
If you've ever seen
ultrasonic waves

533
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,862
break up a kidney stone
on the Discovery Channel,

534
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,031
it's the same deal here.

535
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,804
You can...
put your helmets on now.

536
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,175
Firing.

537
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,923
Woo-ooh!

538
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,502
Woo-hoo!

539
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,545
Yeah. Oh.

540
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,059
Okay, I'm officially impressed.

541
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,663
So, all right.

542
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,967
So you've made some progress

543
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,701
with the engine,
we'll grant you.

544
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,269
Have you begun to think
about a shell?

545
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,077
Okay, this is Alex.

546
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,550
Okay, Alex. Good.

547
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,713
Okay, here we have
a concrete block,

548
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,225
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

549
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:07,891
Okay. We're ready.

550
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,333
And we are... firing.

551
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,286
Voila!

552
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,796
That's...

553
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,491
That's impossible.

554
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,363
I combined the crystals

555
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,733
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

556
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,739
and that's what did the trick.

557
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,207
The applications
for this are just...

558
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,609
What do you call this material?

559
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,079
Well, its real name
has 37 syllables.

560
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,945
I call it Unobtainium.

561
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,575
Unobtainium?

562
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,017
Mm-hmm.

563
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,714
The Unobtainium will take
the heat and the pressure

564
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,222
and transform it to energy,

565
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,317
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

566
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,294
So the hotter
and the deeper she gets,

567
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,557
the stronger she gets...
theoretically.

568
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,098
Theoretically?

569
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,793
Theoretically, yes.

570
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,860
This... is Johnson,
don't mind him.

571
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,499
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

572
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,905
Excuse me,
Dr. Brazzleton,

573
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,876
when do you think
the ship will be operational?

574
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,437
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected...

575
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,574
12... ten years, ten years.

576
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,017
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

577
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,020
$15 billion. I...

578
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,525
Will you take a check?

579
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,234
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

580
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,393
Mm.

581
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,773
Shit!

582
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,106
Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
We have a warrant.

583
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,013
Purge!

584
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,611
Come on, purge!

585
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,098
FBI! Freeze!

586
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,214
Okay.

587
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,841
I know these
look like computers.

588
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,353
Totally not.

589
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,353
Theodore Donald Finch.

590
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,684
Carnegie-Mellon University.
M.I.T.

591
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,193
Worked at the Sun,
Lucent, Rand Corp.

592
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,887
My handle's "Rat."
Call me Rat.

593
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,487
63 computer fraud indictments.

594
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,394
64.

595
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,491
Two convictions.

596
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,799
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

597
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,839
Wait a second.

598
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,635
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

599
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,040
Because I was really,
really hoping to have sex

600
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,168
before that happened.

601
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,803
Yeah. I've been told
by the FBl...

602
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,043
whose database you crippled
last year...

603
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,210
that you are
the best in the business.

604
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,379
So you're about
to be given a choice.

605
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,513
What if I say no?

606
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,853
Excuse me, but is this really

607
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,517
the best we could do?

608
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,753
I mean...

609
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,692
How many languages do you speak?

610
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,195
Five, actually.

611
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,061
Well, I speak one.

612
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,794
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

613
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:35,601
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

614
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,073
your sexual fantasies,
your whole life,

615
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:42,545
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

616
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,046
We multitask
like you breathe.

617
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,175
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

618
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,450
Do you have any idea...?

619
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,489
Okay, hey. Hey!

620
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,890
Let's just, let's give
the kid a break.

621
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,190
Okay, it's a phone.

622
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,459
It's just a phone.

623
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:08,904
Rat, we got a big problem.

624
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,031
A lot of people
are going to die.

625
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,235
We need your help.

626
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,299
What kind of help?

627
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,810
Information control.

628
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,541
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

629
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,607
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the 'Net.

630
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,915
Could you...
with unlimited resources?

631
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,512
You want me to hack the planet?

632
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,493
He wants me to hack the planet.

633
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,290
You've got free long distance

634
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,166
on that phone... forever.

635
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,068
Okay.

636
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,871
If I decide to do this...

637
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,173
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

638
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,147
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

639
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,206
Hot Pockets?

640
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,945
They help me concentrate.

641
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,351
Sounds fair.

642
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,095
Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

643
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,338
Major Childs,

644
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,839
a clarification:

645
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,341
You and you alone
were responsible

646
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,740
for proposing
the descent vectors

647
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,799
for the shuttle, correct?

648
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,175
Yes, General.

649
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,215
We have determined that
the Class "A" landing mishap

650
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,342
experienced by
the Shuttle EndeavOur

651
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,909
was caused by biased
navigational data

652
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:33,854
from the ground due to a brief
geomagnetic disturbance.

653
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,359
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

654
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,691
in determining
the descent vectors proved

655
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,926
that you have exceptional
navigation skills.

656
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,057
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

657
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,660
the space program
and the United States Air Force.

658
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,136
Congratulations, Major.

659
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,201
You are reassigned

660
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,743
with Commander Iverson
and Flight Director Stickley

661
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,336
to a new mission
effective immediately.

662
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,938
Transportation
is waiting outside.

663
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,074
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

664
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,912
Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

665
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,911
Why?

666
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:30,912
I don't know.

667
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,482
I mean, you look so
nervous about it.

668
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,642
You look so...

669
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,913
So, how are you holding up?

670
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,281
Oh, hi. I'm good, I'm good.

671
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,289
I'm about to tell
a couple hundred people

672
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,790
the world is going to end.

673
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:41,790
Well...

674
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,791
I've had better days.

675
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
You look good.

676
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,523
Well, no, you don't look good.

677
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,531
Why did he touch his tie
like that?

678
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,567
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

679
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,466
Listen, wouldn't you
rather I did this?

680
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,527
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

681
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,664
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

682
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,675
Yes. Thomas, this is
the most important

683
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,301
scientific operation
in history.

684
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,142
And given my status, I feel that
it's my job to present...

685
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,875
Project Destiny
was your job, Zimsky.

686
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,007
And you went way beyond
authorized limits.

687
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,881
And let me tell...
And let me tell you,

688
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:13,320
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

689
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,791
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

690
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,589
Now, I have not
finished checking...

691
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,256
Excuse me.

692
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:25,268
Rebecca...
I'm so glad I was wrong.

693
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,598
Right over left...

694
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,263
No, the other left,
the other left.

695
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,601
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

696
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,902
Gentlemen.

697
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,034
Commander Iverson,
Major Childs,

698
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,409
this is your crew:

699
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,277
Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;

700
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,441
Hello.

701
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,609
Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;

702
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,617
Doctor.

703
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,551
Dr. Leveque knows
the weapons system;

704
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,747
Excuse me, ladies first.

705
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,811
Hi.

706
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,687
And Dr. Keyes...

707
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,919
Dr. Keyes built
the navigation system, so...

708
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,085
Hi. Rebecca Childs.

709
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,460
Bob Iverson.

710
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,398
These are your fellow...
fellow... what?

711
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,456
Terranauts?

712
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,934
Hello.

713
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,094
All this brain power over here

714
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,139
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

715
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,696
Y'all better come and join in.

716
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,832
Yeah.

717
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,541
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

718
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,874
Yeah. It's official.

719
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,711
I'm the least-qualified person
on this base.

720
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,410
Dr. Keyes,
I'm sure the people in charge

721
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,679
have every confidence in you.

722
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,721
Well, the problem is that
I'm in charge.

723
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,551
Yeah, I know.

724
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,715
Can I help you?

725
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,520
Yes, please.

726
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,487
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

727
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,553
Mm-hmm.

728
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,724
Is there anything you can't do?

729
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,860
Not that I'm aware of.

730
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,134
I find that
incredibly intimidating.

731
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,233
Yep. Most people do.

732
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,437
Here.

733
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,536
Thank you.

734
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,103
You're welcome.

735
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,316
Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

736
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,016
Thank you, thank you.

737
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,719
Good evening. Good evening.

738
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,228
Wow. This looks like a meeting

739
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,026
for Nobel Prize Winners
Anonymous.

740
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,091
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

741
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,467
and have come a long way
to be here.

742
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,941
So, I'll outline our program
over the next three months.

743
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,412
Dr. Brazzleton will supervise
the building of a ship

744
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,315
which is capable of reaching
the center of our planet.

745
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,876
Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge

746
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:29,051
large enough
to restart its core.

747
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,525
Dr. Zimsky will calculate

748
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,528
the scale
of the explosion needed.

749
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,464
This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

750
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,092
of nuclear detonations
on the core.

751
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,831
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

752
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,896
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

753
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,770
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

754
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,241
A thousand megatons,
give or take?

755
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,800
Tops. Because any more than that

756
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,403
would create
a core instability.

757
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,314
We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

758
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:57,377
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

759
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,083
Yeah. I can enlarge
the ejection pod...

760
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,146
Forgive me,

761
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,284
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

762
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,328
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

763
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,489
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

764
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,159
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

765
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,724
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

766
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,862
And what if the core
is made of cheese?

767
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,669
This is all best
guess, Commander.

768
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,710
That's all science is,
is best guess.

769
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,803
So my best guess is
you don't know.

770
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,110
With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,

771
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,082
and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction

772
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,711
will help save the world.

773
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,254
The ship will be powered

774
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,790
by a small experimental
nuclear reactor.

775
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,088
It will be divided
into six compartments

776
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,491
like cars on a train:

777
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,722
The locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,

778
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,925
living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment

779
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,400
and finally
the weapons-control module.

780
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:49,166
Up to a 45 degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

781
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,208
by these gyro control gimbals.

782
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,971
But if we do breach a section,

783
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,979
bulkhead doors engage
automatically,

784
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,345
seal off the section in red,
and eject.

785
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,783
Is ejection really
the best option?

786
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,013
Only option.

787
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,421
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

788
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,891
The objective is simple.

789
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,928
The obstacles are gigantic.

790
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,792
We're going to need
all the help in the world,

791
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,661
but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,

792
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,931
the world at large can never
know what's happening here.

793
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,198
Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.

794
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,205
It's called Virus-bot.

795
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,935
It's a computer virus
that will seek out files

796
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,170
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

797
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,234
and wipes them out.

798
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:33,477
This is my Kung-Fu,
and it is strong.

799
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,317
Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,

800
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,946
and we have three months
to solve them.

801
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,752
We have a committed
and ingenious team.

802
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,917
We have every resource available
to us,

803
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,324
and we have the best

804
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,228
of the world's scientific and
technical talents on our side.

805
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:51,632
With your help we can,
we must... succeed.

806
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,231
Feedback in the resonance tube.

807
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:57,967
Talk to me, gentlemen.

808
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,939
We are losing

809
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,941
structural integrity.

810
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,102
No, it's not feedback.

811
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,839
It's an impeller malfunction,
I believe.

812
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,505
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

813
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,709
For God's sakes, Braz,
make the call!

814
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,615
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

815
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,517
65 knots.

816
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,453
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

817
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,354
Look, guys...

818
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,627
It's a disaster!

819
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,764
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

820
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,634
For the 22nd time in a row,

821
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,367
everyone on Earth is dead.

822
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,342
Let's take a little quiet time,

823
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,344
and you all are going
to try this again.

824
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,374
Hi.

825
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,810
Hi.

826
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,878
What is this?

827
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,552
Well, it's...
I invented it.

828
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,426
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

829
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,964
It's, um...

830
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,760
not very good reception.

831
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,268
Well, you're looking

832
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:02,499
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

833
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,835
it ain't bad.

834
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,365
It's like a CAT scan
at a hospital,

835
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,912
but it's-it's souped-up.

836
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,344
I invented it

837
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,507
for Deep Earth surveying.

838
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,017
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

839
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,679
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

840
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,518
I'm sorry,
this is really delicate.

841
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,490
And I have it
just the way I want it.

842
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,493
So... excuse me.

843
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,926
Uh, yeah.

844
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,487
Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

845
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,693
and... boom...
you know, I'm Apocalypse Boy.

846
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,169
Apocalypse Boy?

847
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,935
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts
made up.

848
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,043
Well, hats sell better.

849
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,806
You know, it's funny,
because that is...

850
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,472
right where it should be.

851
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:45,480
Well...

852
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,414
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

853
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,611
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

854
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,177
This is really cool,
but can I just...?

855
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,223
Well... mm-hmm.

856
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:07,060
It's better.
It's better. Uh...

857
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,599
God, I hate this sky.

858
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,010
Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

859
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,774
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

860
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,405
You can practice all you like.

861
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,076
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit in that seat.

862
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,916
So you keep reminding me, sir.

863
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:31,920
You know, I doubt

864
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,388
you're even going
to listen to this,

865
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,981
but I'm going to give it a shot.

866
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,227
Being a leader
isn't about ability.

867
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,162
It's about responsibility.

868
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,722
Got it, sir.

869
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,927
No, you don't, Beck.

870
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,558
I mean,
you're not just responsible

871
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,763
for making good decisions.

872
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,272
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

873
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,106
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

874
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,076
What makes you think
I'm not?

875
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,442
Because you're so good.

876
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,971
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

877
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,108
I mean, hell,

878
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,881
you were the one who figured out
how to save the shuttle.

879
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:07,013
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

880
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,186
It's just that
you're used to winning...

881
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,791
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

882
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,530
$20 billion has been spent
developing this system...

883
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,666
Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...

884
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,905
I want wine!
I need wine!

885
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,675
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

886
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,979
Whoa!

887
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,119
That's high-level
static discharge.

888
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,126
I think we should
check this out.

889
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,786
This doesn't look so good.

890
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,461
It's a lightning superstorm.

891
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,234
Popping up all over the world.

892
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,673
Got 'em. Tracking.

893
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,908
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

894
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,423
This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

895
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,757
It's just the start.

896
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,764
Soon they'll be EM spikes

897
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,062
and microwaves will break
through the weak spots and...

898
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,365
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

899
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,404
Ah! Summer in the Pacific.

900
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,200
Yeah, the world is inside out.

901
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,929
I was saving this for later,
but...

902
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,727
this is the time for...

903
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:12,729
Josh, do you mind?

904
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,963
No, not at all. Yeah.

905
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,667
We should have a name
for this baby.

906
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,731
Oh, she's called virgil,
actually.

907
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,107
Virgil... the poet that led
our man into the depths of hell?

908
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,270
That's it.

909
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,437
That's appropriate, I guess.

910
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,639
Well, here's to virgil.

911
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,410
To the planet.

912
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,451
- To virgil.
- To virgil.

913
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,751
No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering.

914
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,160
It's... weird.

915
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,133
Let's go.

916
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,878
Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.

917
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,444
Check.

918
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,820
ECS cabin repress open.

919
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,689
And repress VLV closed.

920
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,091
Check.

921
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,356
Fluid dump valve.

922
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,057
We are about to begin
our journey

923
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,929
into the heart of the cosmos,

924
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,093
into the very core
of our own planet.

925
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,431
Close.

926
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,529
- Where we find therein...
- Check.

927
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,040
The secrets of the universe...

928
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,302
...3.5 PSI.

929
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,139
...the mysteries of time...

930
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,236
LM circuit lockup.

931
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,406
- Check.
...hope for the future.

932
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,414
And signal.

933
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,916
Deep Earth Control,
this is virgil.

934
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,384
Signal check.

935
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,284
This is Deep Earth Control.

936
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,755
I have thumbs-up
across the board.

937
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,258
You are clear
to initiate power-up.

938
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,397
Reactor power confirmed.

939
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:58,669
At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown
to launch. On your mark.

940
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,573
Pad leader, stand by for launch.

941
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,037
All right, virgil.

942
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,079
Mark.

943
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,210
Gantry count. Ten, nine,

944
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:15,247
eight, seven, six, five, four,

945
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,759
three, two, one...

946
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,920
launch.

947
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,229
500 feet.

948
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,094
Leveling out.

949
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:10,940
Okay, guys,
let's swing forward.

950
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,347
800 feet.

951
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,218
Light 'em up, Beck.

952
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,093
Gyro leveling operational.

953
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,925
Hull integrity holding.

954
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,590
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

955
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,696
Oh, my goodness.

956
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,057
They're singing to us.

957
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,821
Virgil's resonance tubes
are powered up,

958
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,328
so they're vibrating
sub sonically.

959
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,421
Actually, we're singing to them.

960
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,107
What's our depth?

961
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,774
1,600 feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

962
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,873
Hull integrity is good.

963
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,349
You sure?

964
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,385
Let's increase impeller speed.

965
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,216
I think we'll be needing
additional control.

966
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,618
Stick, I'm getting
a seismic reading.

967
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,660
What's happening?

968
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,720
T-phase.
Underwater earthquake.

969
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,628
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

970
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,674
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

971
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,336
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

972
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,537
4,000 feet.

973
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,645
You see that rock?

974
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,910
That is not good.

975
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,784
We're losing steering here.

976
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,259
There's some kind
of crosscurrent.

977
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,490
14,000 feet.

978
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,939
Okay, guys, fasten
your seat belts.

979
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,811
We're turning into the skid.

980
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,484
18,000.

981
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,189
18,500.

982
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,754
They're going way too fast.

983
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,511
21,000 feet.

984
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:32,513
We hit the wall,

985
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,606
we're rabbits on the highway.

986
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,150
Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

987
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,515
What do you mean, pressure?

988
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,076
I thought you said this
thing was indestructible!

989
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,246
I said the pressure
makes us stronger.

990
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,414
We just don't have
enough of it yet.

991
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,255
We're at 25,000 feet.
Pull out, sir.

992
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,259
Can't.

993
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,727
- What?
- We're locked in.

994
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,424
Go to full throttle.

995
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:53,492
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

996
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,834
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

997
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,668
Just give it
a couple more seconds.

998
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,002
The lasers will fire.

999
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,475
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

1000
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,452
27,000 feet.

1001
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,215
The lasers will deploy.

1002
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,286
29,000 feet.

1003
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,020
- Do it!
- And...

1004
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:20,995
Do it! Now.

1005
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,268
And we've got a signal.

1006
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,505
- All right.
- Yeah!

1007
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,576
All right.

1008
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,885
Switching on electron spin burst
transmitters.

1009
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,357
Plotting through
lowest density material,

1010
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,985
reconfiguring
every five minutes.

1011
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,657
Hull integrity 100%.
Reactor power 100%.

1012
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,790
All green
on the bomb compartment.

1013
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,630
Speed is 60 knots.

1014
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,863
Hot damn.

1015
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,532
All right, we'll be through
the crust in 15 minutes

1016
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:38,699
and into the mantle.

1017
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,868
24 hours to the core, and
then assuming we survive...

1018
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,208
Assuming?
Yes, assuming.

1019
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,510
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

1020
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,017
They're doing well.

1021
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,780
The crust is just rock.

1022
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,151
Now it gets interesting.

1023
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,689
Virgil, can we get
a status check?

1024
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,918
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

1025
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,457
Come on, come on.

1026
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:46,198
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds

1027
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,742
per square inch.

1028
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,607
And hull integrity is 100%.

1029
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,410
It is as if we we're diving
through the memories

1030
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,575
of the planet.

1031
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,881
But we are about to pass
from memory

1032
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,818
into madness.

1033
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:02,688
Are you going to be doing
that Carl Sagan narration

1034
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:03,851
all the way to the core?

1035
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,394
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

1036
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,657
l-I have an obligation to
my students, to my readers...

1037
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,289
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

1038
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,924
Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

1039
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,629
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

1040
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:15,693
Oh, really? Really?

1041
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,034
When did you learn how to read?

1042
01:01:37,157 --> 01:01:38,419
People.

1043
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:40,790
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

1044
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:46,959
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

1045
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,467
What do you make of this?

1046
01:01:48,535 --> 01:01:49,968
The mantle
is a chemical hodgepodge

1047
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:52,403
of... a variety of elements...

1048
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:56,967
Say it with me:
"I don't know."

1049
01:01:57,044 --> 01:01:58,636
Well, Commander,

1050
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:01,306
wise men say, "When in doubt,
you should go around."

1051
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:02,007
No. It's too big.

1052
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:03,413
We turn too slow.

1053
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:06,078
Anything that
we can't go through

1054
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:07,245
displays as black.

1055
01:02:07,321 --> 01:02:08,515
So what's... what's static?

1056
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:10,921
It's nothing.

1057
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,390
What do you mean?

1058
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:15,360
It's nothing.

1059
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:18,296
It's empty space.

1060
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:20,928
I...

1061
01:02:22,536 --> 01:02:24,470
I never taught the computer
how to read empty space.

1062
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:25,800
And I never taught virgil
how to fly.

1063
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:27,936
Oh, God!

1064
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:51,562
Oh, no, man!

1065
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:06,268
Oh, dear God.

1066
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:00,397
Serge, you all right?

1067
01:04:02,035 --> 01:04:04,230
Yeah.

1068
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,400
Anybody hurt?

1069
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,673
No. You okay?

1070
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:14,679
Yeah.

1071
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:16,306
What's that?
What is that?

1072
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,907
From the cooling system.
Shut that down.

1073
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:19,849
Shut it down.

1074
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,820
I told you to go around her.

1075
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:23,356
Nobody listens to me.

1076
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:24,549
Where in God's name are we?

1077
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,525
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers.

1078
01:04:26,593 --> 01:04:27,582
Shut 'em down.

1079
01:04:30,664 --> 01:04:32,859
We're not going anywhere.

1080
01:04:36,403 --> 01:04:37,836
Powering down.

1081
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:47,313
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

1082
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:48,348
Nope.

1083
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:51,976
Whatever it is, it's also inside
our MRI cameras.

1084
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:54,852
We have to go outside.

1085
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:55,854
What?

1086
01:04:55,923 --> 01:04:57,185
Believe me,
I hate to admit it,

1087
01:04:57,257 --> 01:04:58,349
but I think he's right.

1088
01:04:58,425 --> 01:04:59,949
I'm coming.
I want to collect samples.

1089
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:01,289
Wait, hang on, hang on.

1090
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:02,726
Wait, wait,
the first problem is,

1091
01:05:02,796 --> 01:05:05,060
the only way out of the ship...
is the way we came in,

1092
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:06,599
which is through
the impeller outlet...

1093
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:07,725
Which is still
at 5,000 degrees.

1094
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:09,325
Exactly, I mean...

1095
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:11,735
I'll just flush it
with liquid nitrogen

1096
01:05:11,805 --> 01:05:12,897
from the cooling system.

1097
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,166
Wait. The cooling system

1098
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,869
that's keeping us from
roasting to death in this ship?

1099
01:05:16,944 --> 01:05:20,471
Well, just a small part of it.

1100
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:25,479
Alternatives?

1101
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:27,281
Anybody.

1102
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:44,270
Whoa, whoa, that's it.

1103
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:47,933
It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

1104
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:49,373
Where the hell are we?

1105
01:05:49,443 --> 01:05:50,933
Well, the good news is,

1106
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:52,945
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

1107
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:56,940
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

1108
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,278
We just...
we got to hope,

1109
01:05:58,352 --> 01:05:59,478
if we can cut it loose,

1110
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:00,713
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

1111
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:03,654
Okay.

1112
01:06:03,724 --> 01:06:04,782
Got it.

1113
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:07,122
Beck, try the lights, will you?

1114
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:08,422
Lighting up.

1115
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:13,663
Oh, it's magnificent.

1116
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:16,225
Oh, my God.

1117
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:19,431
Aladdin's cave.

1118
01:06:19,506 --> 01:06:21,997
It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

1119
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:39,256
I think it's a geode.

1120
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:40,759
But I don't understand

1121
01:06:40,827 --> 01:06:43,318
how it could have survived
down here.

1122
01:06:43,397 --> 01:06:44,762
Cobalt shell, maybe?

1123
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:45,923
No. L-I mean,

1124
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,433
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

1125
01:06:48,502 --> 01:06:50,595
Something would have
to protect it.

1126
01:06:50,671 --> 01:06:51,729
Unbelievable.

1127
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:52,737
Zimsky.

1128
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:54,068
Yeah?

1129
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:57,440
We're inside
a giant gem bubble,

1130
01:06:57,511 --> 01:07:00,139
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

1131
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:03,046
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

1132
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:06,178
Hell of a day.

1133
01:07:07,454 --> 01:07:09,718
Yes, it is.

1134
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,882
I'll start cutting.

1135
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:12,116
Okay, Braz.

1136
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:13,124
I'm going to check the hull.

1137
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:14,285
Call me if you need me.

1138
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:15,885
Okay.

1139
01:07:23,303 --> 01:07:24,827
Oh, no.

1140
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:26,770
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

1141
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,000
Zimsky, look!

1142
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:29,633
It's an amethyst.

1143
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,302
Oh, God,

1144
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:33,312
we've breached the shell.

1145
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:50,928
Guys, you don't have to be here!

1146
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:52,623
I want you back inside!

1147
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:54,530
Well, I think that means me.

1148
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:56,091
Orders are orders.

1149
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:06,142
Wait, Josh.

1150
01:08:06,213 --> 01:08:08,875
The problem is
I'm losing oxygen.

1151
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:09,675
Braz, what can I do?

1152
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,274
Check the feeds for me.

1153
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:14,718
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

1154
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:19,381
Quick!

1155
01:08:19,459 --> 01:08:20,687
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

1156
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:21,887
Hey, guys, at this rate

1157
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:23,792
we have three minutes
before the lava gets to us.

1158
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:24,888
Come on, guys.

1159
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:26,226
Come on.

1160
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:33,838
It's not going to work
without oxygen!

1161
01:08:33,907 --> 01:08:35,898
We're losing oxygen!

1162
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:46,185
I fixed it. Now cut!

1163
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:47,845
That's good. It's working now.

1164
01:08:47,921 --> 01:08:49,218
It's working well now!

1165
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,018
That's good, Josh!
