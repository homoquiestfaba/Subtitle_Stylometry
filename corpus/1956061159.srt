showed up at my work,

shoved me into a van,

360
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:54,615

these horrible photos.

- What do you mean,

You're not gonna deny to it?

364

were photoshopped or anything?

you broke up with me?

are paying for?

your taxes for three years.

Hey, look,
Sebastian, I'm really sorry

1384
01:03:24,715 --> 01:03:26,279
I didn't give you
the drive at that cafe.

1385
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,948
Nah. No, I understand.

1386

Drew told you
to keep it safe.

1387
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:33,847
Can you at least tell us
what's on that drive?

1388
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:37,312
All we know is,

1389
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,412
it was made by an
international terrorist group

1390
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:40,914
named Highland.

1391
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:44,215

planning a series of attacks.

1392

we'd know how to stop them.

Why have we been spending all of
this time talking to the men,

1401
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:11,880
when this being has been
floating through the halls

1402
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,914
of the building?
Oh, my God!

1403

- That is the Beyonce of the government.

for you that it has

into objectification.

was closer to treason.

merely trying to help.

your arm would take to heal?

1413
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,714
Um, three months
for the bullet wound,

1414
01:04:43,716 --> 01:04:45,914

- Fantastic.

1415

Take four months' leave.

1416
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:48,814
Oh, no. I assume he meant

1417
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:50,513
the two would
heal simultaneously.

1418
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:51,882

going through your mind

down the toilet?

because of this.

Great. You two laugh.

how many people have died

1435
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:25,250

because of your stupidity.

I'm sorry. Just let me
get this straight.

1438
01:05:30,315 --> 01:05:32,313
So you wrap your hands
in toilet paper,

1439
01:05:32,315 --> 01:05:33,547
and then you poop
into that,

1440
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:35,280
and then that
whole contraption

1441
01:05:35,282 --> 01:05:36,614
is what you drop
into the toilet?

1442
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:38,715
- That was just a metaphor.
- You know that the toilet is designed

1443
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,447
to take the work
out of it for you, right?

1444
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:41,881
No, that's not
what I was saying.

1445
01:05:41,883 --> 01:05:44,047
I was say...
I didn't say that.

1446
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:45,881
I poop normally.

1447
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:49,016
Of course, yes. I know.
I'm sorry. Okay.

just give us a chance,

a major resource for you.

Hey, Morgan, I think that we
should probably just head out.

1475

this is just dumb luck.

wanna go home

something like that?

know all this?

is in my vagina.

saying that it was so important,

1500

and I wasn't gonna flush something
that important down the toilet.

know what to do with the drive?

somewhere safe.

swallowed it.
