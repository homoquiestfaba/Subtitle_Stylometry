She always makes me one of
her special drinks when I fly.

00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
It's like teleportation.

You knock one back, and
the next thing you know

8
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,243
you're in Paraguay or Guam or Utah.

- What were the two of you doing in Utah?

12

- I can't tell you.

(laughing)

14

- You never tell me the beginning
or the ending of a story.

15

It is always a headlong plunge into drama.

16

When do I get to meet Solange?

17
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,030
Maybe she can tell me
some of your secrets.

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,043
- Over my dead body.

I recognized her immediately

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,130
from her low budget Italian horror films.

you driving at your son's funeral.

Kevin never got tested for HIV.

54

When he was diagnosed with
lymphoma, being who he was,

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,743
it wasn't surprising that he
ended things the way he did.

I was just going through his stuff.

just wanted something

It's so strange we never met before.

- Not really,

65
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,820
he liked to keep his
friends in different boxes.

You weren't in my box sweetheart.

67

boring childhood friend's box?

What do you know?

- Well, from what they could tell he

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,893
went to the beach, walked
out as far as he could

76
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,893
onto the sandbar and pulled the trigger.

77

They have no idea how he got a gun.

They didn't find it.

Well, I was in Rome
filming "Decapitator 2",

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,590
and Kevin was screwing the producer,

85
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,300
this so-called Italian Mafioso.

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,590
He would parade Kevin around

87

and dare people to give him shit about it.

88
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,843
Kevin loved the attention and the drama.

89
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,190
He stayed with me a
while when producer guy

90
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,653
ran off with the money, bastard.

for Italian criminals.

Solange seemed to need to
make a connection with me.

I needed that.

113
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,370
Darla slept most of the weekend.

114

like she had absorbed

116

some of Kevin's energy before he left.

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,923
I had always liked how she
treated us like real people.

On our last day on the cape,

Solange said she wanted to
talk to me about something.

- [Kevin] Promise me one more thing.

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,631

Go travel though.

130
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,400
Get out of this fucking country.

- [Solange] Great!

134
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,840

stupid boring cubical job.

I won't be coming in to work tomorrow

matter, thanks, bye.

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,170
- [John Voiceover] She was
vague about the details

142
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,493
of her food-magazine-lifestyle show.

143
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,270
When I tried to ask her questions about it

144
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,190
she would go off on some tangent

145
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,160
about how she did a show just like this

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,840
in Northern Ireland or Morocco,

147
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,983
as if that would reassure me somehow.

148
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
All I could get out of her

149
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,603
was that she wanted to call
it the un-tourist guide.

150
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,820
Welcome to Paris and your new life.

151

About flying?

It's a quirk.

172
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:43,815
- Okay.

173
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,536

make a little change,

178
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,473
Look I got a camera.

179
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:03,834
The guy at the camera
shop said it's the best.

180

- Okay.

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,010

00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:14,570
- Good good, look I know
I should have waited

185
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,811
and let you pick it out
but I was way too excited.

186
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,010
And you know what, we should
film something tonight.

187
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,843
- Tonight?

188
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,870
- Yeah, just a little
something something, no biggie.

189
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,140
So you think you can figure
it out, get it to work?

190
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,100
- Yeah, no problem.

191
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,703
- Wow, you are good.

192
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,650
Hey love can you go get some ice?

193
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,120
I need to shower and get changed.

194
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,391
- Sure.

195
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,224
- Thanks.

196
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,125
(light instrumental music)

197
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,743
- I couldn't find any ice.

198
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,443
- John, this is Alain.

199
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:08,531
- Bon soir.

200
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,364
- Hello.

201
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:11,280
- [Solange] He's a big
fan of my one-hit wonder

202
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,770
from back in the 80's.

203
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,773
- Robots are un-American.

204
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,293
- I love it.

205
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,533
It was a big hit in
Europe, but not in America.

206
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:22,479
- Look.

207
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,880
- Oh my God, where did
you get this picture?

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,820
- Oh I always travel with
my press stuff just in case.

209
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,960
When you are as obscure as I am,

210
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,820
your fans tend to be die-hard.

211
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,809
- Ro-ro-robots.

212
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,990
Ro-ro-robots.

213
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,573
- Sweetie, that's the dance mix vocals.

214
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,623
Apparently, they are playing
it in all the hit clubs here.

215
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:51,530
"I'm a revival, revival, my survival."

216
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,873
That was my follow up, not quite a hit.

217
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,930
Alain do you know that one?

218
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,763
- No.

219
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,230
- That was the day.

220
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,490
Too bad I never saw a dime for it.

221
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,543
In those days you were
paid in cocaine, literally.

222
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,453
John, did you ever see that video?

223
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,401
- No.

224
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,234
- Oh it was hot.

225
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:12,433
Know what, I gotta find
that eyeshadow again.

226
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:17,601
- You want some more coffee?

227
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:18,434
- Sure.

228
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,303
- I found it!

229
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,890
Alain invited us to a party.

230
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,956
Tell him about it sweetie,
momma needs to concentrate.

231
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:32,690
- It's this group of art
terrorists, terror artists.

232
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,636
They are called Panic Culture.

233
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:35,676
- Okay.

234
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:37,920
- No what could be more
un-tourist than that?

235
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,670
Hey, you think you can get
that camera to working?

236
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,183
We need to start filming.

237
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,173
- Sure.

238
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,612

239
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:53,012

244
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,353
Come on lets go party!

245
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,570
Hey, make sure you get a
good shot of us entering.

246
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,933
- [John] Okay, hold still.

247
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,323
Okay.

248
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,480
- How's that camera working?

249
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,680
- It's good, don't talk
though, I'm filming.

250
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:19,785
- [Solange] Oh yeah right.

251
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:20,618
Do I look okay?

252
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:21,590
- [John] Yeah, you look good.

253
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,260
- We go? Action?

254
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,380
- [John] Yes, action.

255
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,792
(in foreign language)

256
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:43,682
(pulsing dance music)

257
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:52,371
- Get him!

258
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,790
Capitalist bitch, shit eater.

259
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,690
That is the robot woman, get her!

260
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,113
- See, they recognize me, keep filming.

261
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,002
(mumbling)

262
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,025
- You eat shit?

263
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,380
Look at that shit-eating grin.

264
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,523
Shit eater.

265
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
- Did you get any good shots?

266
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,925
Did you get my reaction?

267
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:46,925
- [John] I did.

268
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,215
- Would you like a drink?

269
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,528
- Yes, please.

270
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:53,952
- [Woman] You can drink my piss.

271
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,535
Drink my pee, scum.

272
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:03,848
- Beer.

273
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:10,610
- [Woman] Hey, have
you heard of this thing

274
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,010
called disco dumping?

275
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,320
- [John] No.

276
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,850
- I thought it was a New York City thing.

277
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,290
- They used to do that
back in the eighties.

278
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,681
It's when someone blows coke up your ass.

279
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,553
You have to be empty though
if you know what I mean.

280
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,580
- Alain said you were from New York City.

281
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,042
- Yeah, I mean no, I'm
from Boston, it's close.

282
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,515
- And do you say New York City or NYC?

283
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,539
I think NYC sounds cooler.

284
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,539
Put him with the others.

285
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,557
(pulsing dance music)

286
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:58,314
- Thanks.

287
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,343
Great party.

288
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:12,436
- Yeah, I told you there were cool, no.

289
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:13,269
- Yeah.

290
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,903
- Sorry.

291
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,026
- I could use a drink,
do you have a free hand?

292
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:27,026
- Oui.

293
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,523
- Thanks.

294
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,910
- Cindy is a bit messy tonight.

295
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,900
Her performance, not so good.

296
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,680
- A little more?

297
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,185
- That good?

298
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:16,168
- Hey.

299
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:24,995
- Are you all right?

300
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:25,828
- No.

301
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:34,600
Just pull right up top now.

302
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,433
Go to the top.

303
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,793
- Ready?

304
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:39,626
- Yeah.

305
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:46,003
- You all right?

306
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,037
- That's good.

307
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,010
- Are they gonna come back?

308
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,443
- I hope so, but then again I don't.

309
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,514
(in foreign language)

310
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,720
- That's Giles, Cindy's boyfriend.

311
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,743
He is a bit crazy.

312
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,130
It's okay, he doesn't understand English.

313
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,470
(in foreign language)

314
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,303
- What's wrong?

315
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,286
- I have to go.

316
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,119
I am going to go talk to
him for a few seconds.

317
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,500
I'll be back.
- Okay.

318
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:41,610
- That Cindy, she has
been doing that thing

319
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,843
she was talking about.

320
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:44,676
- What?

321
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:45,650
- The disco dumping.

322
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,483
Well she has dumped and now

323
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:47,750
she is sliding all around in there.

324
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,397
- Oh God.

325
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,420
- Giles is threatening to kill her

326
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,329
and all his boyfriends have left

327
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,246
and it smells terrible.

328
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,600
Fucking bisexuals.

329
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,099
(in foreign language)

330
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,815
(laughing)

331
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,296
- Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,379
Give me that camera back.

333
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,370
- There's some great stuff on here.

334
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,497
- There had better be.

335
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,033
- Oh my God, she filmed herself shitting.

336
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,800
- The Germans will love that.

337
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,233
- You look perplexed.

338
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,670
- I'm just waiting for my synapses

339
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,620
to have trouble recognizing each other.

340
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,743
- [Kevin] Oh darling I
live for that moment.

341
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:09,310
- You've been in that moment
for quite some time now.

342
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,152
- Well yeah, why not?

343
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:13,233
Anyway, I didn't mean for
this to become a pity party.

344
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,963
I just want to burn through
whatever life I have left.

345
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,490
- Is drinking a good idea?

346
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,753
- Now that is a real question.

347
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,770
I don't feel sufficiently
plastered to answer it though.

348
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,603
Chin chin.

349
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,080
God I love the beach.

350
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,500
Why do we have to sit next
to the fucking hippie art?

351
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,600
It's like burning man.

352
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,070
Let's tear that fucking
hideous thing down.

353
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,725
(laughing)

354
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,292
(knocking on door)

355
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:08,969
(knocking on door)

356
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:11,910
- [Alain] Bon jour.

357
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,743
- Hey.

358
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,753
- I thought you could use some breakfast.

359
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,493
- Thanks.

360
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
That's really sweet.

361
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,363
- Sweet?

362
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,433
- Yeah, nice?

363
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,470
- [Alain] So, you had fun last night?

364
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,203
- Yeah I did, did you?

365
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,757
- Yeah, pretty weird
people but they are fun.

366
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,653
- Interesting, interesting people.

367
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,670
I had a good time with you.

368
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,467
- So, what are you doing today?

369
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:00,812
- I don't know.

370
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,203
I thought Solange would
be here, she's not.

371
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,313
I just woke up actually.

372
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,543
- I still can't believe I met her.

373
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,216
I've got to get back to work.

374
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:18,870
- [John] Uh-oh.

375
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,083
- Enjoy your breakfast.

376
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:22,014
- Thank you.

377
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,079
Will I see you later?

378
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:29,912
- Oui.

379
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:42,206
(phone ringing)

380
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,059
- Hello?

381
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,640
- Bon jour sleepy head.

382
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,060
You like your new phone?

383
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,430
I got it so I could keep track of you.

384
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,800
- Where are you?

385
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,520
What time did you get up?

386
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
- Oh baby I never sleep,
being un-dead and all.

387
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,653
- I'm beginning to think
you're not joking about that.

388
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,040
- Look, great news, I set up
a shoot for this afternoon.

389
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,540
It's this old restaurant
that is suddenly hip again.

390
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,600
Apparently everything old is new again.

391
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,900
I texted you the address, did you get it?

392
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,733
- Let me see.

393
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,950
Yeah I got it.

394
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,973
- Okay great, so I'll see you later, ciao.

395
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:33,890
- [John Voiceover] When I wasn't filming

396
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,343
Solange for the show.

397
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,863
I was busy falling in
love with Alain and Paris.

398
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,467
Alain worked at the hotel during the day

399
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:45,850
but was also in a band
called Plateau Repas,

400
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,323
which I think translates to Dinner Plate?

401
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,960
I fantasized about staying in France

402
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,840
and making a movie with Alain,

403
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,883
or at least a music video for his band.

404
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,884
He totally changed onstage,
it was amazing to see.

405
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:03,021
- [Alain] One two three, kick it!

406
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,188
(in foreign language)

407
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:10,548
(upbeat electronic music)

408
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:16,315
(in foreign language)

409
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:10,721
(audience cheering)

410
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,908
- Hey you.

411
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:25,741
- Hey.

412
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,520
- Can I see the frame?

413
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,353
- Sure.

414
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,100
- [Solange] Oh fantastic!

415
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,933
- Yeah.

416
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,490
- I love this place.

417
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,633
It's so touristy that
it's become un-touristy.

418
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,910
- Hey do you want me to
film you saying that?

419
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,743
- Yeah, great idea.

420
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,403
How do I look?

421
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:55,950
- Great, just let me re-light.

422
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,590
- Oh don't worry about
it, we'll fix it in post.

423
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,543
Just film me.

424
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,402
- Okay.

425
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,260
- I love this place, it's so touristy

426
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,370
that it's become un-touristy.

427
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,590
How was that?

428
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,250
- Great, just don't say "how was that?"

429
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,970
- Oh John don't worry we'll just dub it.

430
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,670
Besides this is just for the pilot,

431
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,920
you know to raise some money.

432
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,350
So it's no big deal, just do whatever.

433
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,523
Film anything.

434
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,440
- [John Voiceover] Alain's band started

435
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,790
getting a lot of attention.

436
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,750
Even that crazy performance artist Cindy

437
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,400
started hanging around them more.

438
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,540
They were playing every
night at cool venues.

439
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,453
To quote Solange, in some of
the most un-tourist places.

440
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:44,510
I guess that's what gave
Alain the idea to have Solange

441
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,683
perform her European one-hit-wonder
after them one night.

442
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,990
She was totally flattered and excited

443
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,290
and spent a whole day trying
to remember all the lyrics.

444
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,043
She kept joking that it was
gonna be her big comeback.

445
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,080
We had no idea that it would
also be Cindy's big debut.

446
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,174
She was hell bent for the big time.

447
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:08,007

(gun firing)

474
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,010
- [John Voiceover] Solange
and I spent three hours

475
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,700
with the police.

476
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,473
She spoke to them in French.

477
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,683
I have no idea what she
said, but they let us go.

478
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,810
Solange assured me that
everything was cool,

479
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,883
whatever that meant.

480
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:27,033
- It's like violence is
always lingering around me.

481
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,220
I was five years old

482
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,150
when the first gun was
pulled in my presence,

483
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,733
and not long after that I
had seen my first dead body.

484
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,620
By the time I was thirteen I
had been in two car accidents,

485
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,063
a bank robbery, and had
fallen off a damn bridge.

486
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,649
Don't worry nothing physical
was permanently damaged.

487
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,573
I can't say that about my personality.

488
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,873
When I was little I used to cry a lot,

489
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:03,250
a big crybaby,

490
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,217
and my mother would say,

491
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:09,627
"breathe Solange, breathe, relax."

492
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:14,170
But she knew damn well my childhood

493
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,243
was no place for relaxation.

494
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,920
It was like an ice cube in the sun.

495
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,130
Look, I know I should
have explained this to you

496
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,713
before we left, but I didn't
want to frighten you off.

497
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,500
And don't get me wrong, I am not bragging,

498
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,353
or trying to seem tough or worldly.

499
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,300
It's more like the wrong person

500
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,033
at the wrong place at the right time.

501
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,273
You know, I think that's
what attracted Kevin to me.

502
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,950
He was always convinced that something

503
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,750
was gonna blow up and he
wanted to be there when it did.

504
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,583
Come on, let's go to Italy.

505
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,723
I'm taking a shower.

506
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,703
Damn I knew that girl Cindy was crazy.

507
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,993
So much for my big comeback.

508
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,630
Hey babe if you see Alain tonight

509
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,473
say goodbye to him for me okay.

510
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,373
And listen, don't miss the train tomorrow.

511
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,650
- [John Voiceover] I
didn't mention the gun.

512
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,800
I kept putting it off,

513
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,310

that big black bag of hers

514

00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,570
- [John Voiceover] I couldn't figure out

544
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,590
how to say goodbye to Alain.

545
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,140
But then he made it easy for me.

546
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,730
- Oh shit.

547
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,563
- What is it?

548
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,300
- My boyfriend.

549
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,620
- Boyfriend?

550
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,600
You've gotta be kidding me.

551
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,767
(in foreign language)

552

(bright pop music)

553
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:05,983
- I love trains.

554
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,903
Sometimes I wish I could
stay on a train forever.

555
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,943
- It would get boring
after a while, though.

556
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,463
- Yeah maybe, but real fast.

557
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,200
How do I look?

558
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,033
- [John Voiceover] You look great.

559
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,363
- [Solange] Come on, don't lie.

560
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:30,610
Ruggero was my make-up
artist from the drama years.

561
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,470
- [John Voiceover] Drama years?

562
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,760
- [Solange] Yeah, Italian
horror movie star years,

563
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,088
he specialized in zombie drool.

564
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:36,921
- Really?

565
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:38,220
- Yeah, and Giacomo should be here too.

566
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,017
He was my modeling
agent from the eighties.

567
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:42,990
He had like a small
agency like a boutique.

568
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,160
And, matter of fact now
he's in the restaurant game.

569
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,980
You know what, he just
opened up a new one.

570
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,940
We should do a segment on him.

571
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,803
- Sure.

572
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:50,636
- Ciao Ruggero.

573
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:52,980
- Ciao, how are you Solange?

574
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,651
John, Solange talked so much about you.

575
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:59,362
- Nice to meet you, thank you.

576
00:40:59,362 --> 00:41:02,779
- No, no, no, let me fix your face first.

577
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,993
- Johnny John, this is Giacomo.

578
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,435
- John, Ciao.

579
00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:13,123
- Ciao Giacomo, how are you?

580
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,820
- How are you finding Italy?

581
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,760
- I found it, love it.

582
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,873
I feel like I've been here before.

583
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,370
My mother's family is from Italy.

584
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,800
- You must feel it in your blood no?

585
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,423
- Yeah yeah, I guess so.

586
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,170
- [Giacomo] Where is your family from?

587
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,610
- My grandmother's family is from Naples

588
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,180
and my grandfather was born in Rome.

589
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,463
- So you are Southern.

590
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,820
- Yeah, by the long way around.

591
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,940
- [Giacomo] Good.

592
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,773
- Why?

593
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,988
- The northerners have colder hearts.

594
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:51,637
You have a very marketable smile.

595
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:52,470
- Huh?

596
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,330
- Your smile, it's very commercial.

597
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,130
I manage models, Solange once.

598
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,136
- Okay, what could you sell with it?

599
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:02,270
- A smile?

600
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,730
A good smile sells food and furniture,

601
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,710
print ads, not every model

602
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,883
is on the runway for Gucci or Prada.

603
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:13,121
- That's just what I want to hear.

604
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:16,870
I can sell grapefruit and sofas.

605
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,720
No, no, it's just a typical story for me.

606
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,310
I could be in a glamorous
profession like modeling

607
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,130
but I would be hawking ravioli and desks.

608
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,783
- Desks can be very glamorous.

609
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,393
- I'm sure they can be.

610
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,640
So I inspire domesticity?

611
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,453
- Si and trust,

612
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,013
a good smile says trust me.

613
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,980
- [John Voiceover]
Giacomo was half-Italian,

614
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,690
half-French, raised in Paris.

615
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,380
So there was pretty much
no inoculation against him.

616
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,820
I was totally at his mercy here.

617
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,753
- So how's it going, anything good?

618
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,419
- I haven't really been filming.

619
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,690
- No, I'm not talking about that.

620
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,483
I'm talking about you
and Giacomo, any sparks?

621
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,820
- Yeah, I think you
know the answer to that.

622
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,337
- Yeah, I think you're right.

623
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,690
- What a beautiful place
where I will never live.

624
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,523
- Che cosa?

625
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,760
- Nothing, just being flip.

626
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,423
- Okay flipping guy.

627
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,241
Let me put some music.

628
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,390
This is the living room.

629
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:49,600
Here is the kitchen.

630
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,673
- Very nice.

631
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,048
- I have money to spend
on stuff I will never use.

632
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:56,921
There is a bathroom here.

633
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:03,864
Another living room.

634
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:07,960
Here is another bathroom.

635
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,793
- Another bathroom.

636
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:09,626
- Yes.

637
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:11,650
This is my mother's bedroom

638
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,198
when she visits from Romagnese

639
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,221
which is north of here.

640
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,185
- Romagnese?

641
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:18,171
- Romagnese.

642
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:19,588
- Romagnese.
- Si.

643
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:27,270
Here is my bedroom, which
doubles as a guest room.

644
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:34,821
(upbeat pop music)
(lyrics in foreign language)

645
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,933
- My wife.

646
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,000
- You're married?

647
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,790
- A long time ago.

648
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,633
You are the first guy I've
had sex with in this bed.

649
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,690
- Well technically we haven't
had sex in the bed yet.

650
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,813
- The first guy I've had in this bed then.

651
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,530
- And how long have you had this bed?

652
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,253
- One week.

653
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,680
- [John Voiceover] There should
be a word for infatuation

654
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,450
that links lust and love more closely.

655
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,510
I bet there is one in Italian.

656
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,000
That feeling that you are in love,

657
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,400
but you are just completely
sucked into the gravity well

658
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,100
of someone else's gaze.

659
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,783
Romantic yes, real no.

660
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,410
- This place is beautiful isn't it?

661
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,360
Do you think I should get a place here?

662
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,060
I like how it's handy to the city

663
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,323
but it still has like a small town vibe.

664
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,701
- Yeah, that would be beautiful.

665
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:01,480
- Yeah, but it would be
hard to get any work done

666
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,980
with all the fucking and
eating going on in Italy.

667
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:05,830
- I wouldn't mind.

668
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,110
- Oh this is the life, not
my life, but a good life.

669
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:20,027
(upbeat funky electronic music)

670
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:04,294
(phone ringing)

671
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:12,133
(in foreign language)

672
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:24,130
- They are having problems
at the restaurant.

673
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,200
Nothing is ready for the opening.

674
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,710
I have to get going.

675
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,880
- No problem.

676
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,780
- It is a problem.

677
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,593
I wanted to stay here with you.

678
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:51,775
I will drive you to
Ruggero's, it is on the way.

679
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,150
- [John Voiceover] I felt more fuck-high

680
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,560
and in touch with my Italian
heritage than ever before.

681
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,943
And with an all too familiar
pang I felt in love as well.

682
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,260
Oh, is Solange here?

683
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,720
- No, she is shopping or something,

684
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,250
I cannot keep track of her.

685
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,083
- Okay.

686
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,938
- [Ruggero] Was the sex good?

687
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:17,402
- What?

688
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:19,915
- Was the sex very good?

689
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:22,980
- Ummm yeah, thanks.

690
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,900
- Giacomo is charming.

691
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,350
He's a charmer when he wants to be.

692
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,650
That is how he gets all
the boys to the bed.

693
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,630
- Oh really?

694
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,690
- [Ruggero] Yes, oh by
the way Solange left you

695
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,313
some money on the table.

696
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,430
- Wow.
- [Ruggero] She said you

697
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,230
should buy some clothes for tonight.

698
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,733
Would you like me to
help you with something?

699
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,112
- Just a second.

700
00:51:49,112 --> 00:51:49,945
(phone ringing)

701
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:51,362
- [Ruggero] Okay.

702
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:54,303
Another boyfriend?

703
00:51:54,303 --> 00:51:55,590
- I'm sorry, do you mind?

704
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,423
- Of course not.

705
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,530
- Hello.
- Where are you?

706
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,650
- Italy.

707
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,800
- When are you coming back to France?

708
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,513
- I can't, remember, I'm working.

709
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,513
- I need you.

710
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:15,630
Since that thing at the club

711
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,780
I haven't been able to
leave the apartment.

712
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,760
- What about your boyfriend?

713
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,970
- He has left me.

714
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:21,803
- I'm sorry.

715
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,070
- I'm not, I mean yes I'm sorry.

716
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,220
I want you Johnny John.

717
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,937
I need to see you again.

718
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,743
- I don't know if or when
we are coming back to Paris.

719
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:36,253
- I understand but I
hope you will come back.

720
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,610
- Me too.

721
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,810
- Really?

722
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:40,980
- Yes.

723
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,813
- Thank you.

724
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,541
- I have to go, call me later?

725
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:46,440
- No, wait there is
something else I have to say.

726
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,693
There was this man who came
to look for you and Solange.

727
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:53,090
I said you left me and I
didn't know where you were,

728
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,800
which wasn't a lie by the way.

729
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,730
- Was he with the police?

730
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,093
- No, definitely not.

731
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,320
- What did he look like?

732
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,860
- Some Italian guy with long hair.

733
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,360
He wouldn't take his sunglasses off.

734
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,160
- Okay, thanks for telling me.

735
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,560
If he comes back don't
tell him we are in Italy.

736
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,633
- I won't.

737
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,220
- I will come back to Paris soon.

738
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,298
- I hope so.

739
00:53:15,298 --> 00:53:16,131
- Bye.

740
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:27,886
(upbeat dance music)

741
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,580
- You are American aren't you?

742
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,200
- Yes, how can you tell?

743
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,070
- Uff, you aren't smoking.

744
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:00,903
- No.

745
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,210
- I heard that in America

746
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,270
you can't smoke anywhere anymore.

747
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,103
- That's true.

748
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,253
Actually, I don't think you
can smoke in here either.

749
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:15,140
- Nonsense, as you get older

750
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,420
smoking becomes a necessity,

751
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,226
at a certain age cancer

752
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:23,893
can be welcomed with open arms.

753
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,423
- [Solange] Hey, send
more drinks this way.

754
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,763
- [John] That guy has been
staring at you all night.

755
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,700
- No biggie,

756
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,440
I might know him from
somewhere or vice versa.

757
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,050
- Alain said there was a guy who came by

758
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,780
when we left Paris looking for us.

759
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,450
The description fits.

760
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,500
- No, I'm sure he is fine.

761
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,333
Hold on.

762
00:54:52,064 --> 00:54:54,564
(funky music)

763
00:55:03,243 --> 00:55:05,140
- I am sorry that I cannot
spend more time with you.

764
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,990
- Don't worry about it.

765
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,140
Things are going good right?

766
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,360
- So far, yes.

767
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:16,598
I must get back.

768
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,190
(dissonant electronic music)

769
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,840
- No, I don't know him and
I'll make a point to never.

770
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,773
Come on let's go.

771
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:34,798
- We haven't eaten yet.

772
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,614
- We'll get a pizza someplace.

773
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:37,640
- What about the filming?

774
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,490
- We have enough.

775
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,890
Look he'll be here all night.

776
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,590
You stay with me tonight, all right?

777
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,990
We'll see him in the morning.

778
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,373
Come on let's go.

779
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,983

(lyrics muffled)

797
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:26,848
- [Ruggero] Hello.

798
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:29,908
- Buongiorno sunshine, want some eggs?

799
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,498
Good hangover food.

800
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:32,331
- Sure.

801
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:37,058
- Here is an article about
Giacomo's restaurant.

802
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,545
- Oh, what does it say?

803
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:42,108
- It's a bit scandalous,
also in the way it's written.

804
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:45,398
It says twelve people were made sick with,

805
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:46,708
I don't know how to say it in English,

806
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:49,640
it's the food that made them sick.

807
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,023
Very, very, sick.

808
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,470
But they write the article
with a lot of insults.

809
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,743
Not very objective.

810
00:57:56,922 --> 00:57:59,270
The poison is like the
stuff for injections

811
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,063
for the lines in the face.

812
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,040
- Botulism?

813
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,540
- Si, it is the Botox.

814
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,369
I'm sure Giacomo is going to
be very very upset by this.

815
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:11,893
Let me call him.

816
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:14,080
Lin, bring me the phone.

817
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,913
- [Lin] Si.

818
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,793
- Good thing we didn't stick
around for the food huh?

819
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,120
Oh that was icky wasn't it?

820
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,953
- Yeah.

821
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,603
Is it gonna be okay?

822
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,460
- It depends, I mean
the place was spotless

823
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,430
and the kitchen is state of the art.

824
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,220
I don't know how that could have happened.

825
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,243
Maybe it was the supplier, who knows?

826
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,820
Puts that part of the show
out of commission huh?

827
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,653
- Yeah.

828
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,113
- What are we gonna do now?

829
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:48,743
- I think we should pack.

830
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,650
- We're leaving Italy?

831
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,851
- Hell yeah.

832
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:53,860
I think it's a good idea
before someone offers us

833
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,840
a free dinner that ends up
in the toilet for ten hours.

834
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,197
Besides there's this party
in Berlin we should be at.

835
00:59:00,197 --> 00:59:01,803
You know, for filming.

836
00:59:04,528 --> 00:59:05,361
- Okay.

837
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,251
My stuff's at Giacomo's though.

838
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,601
- Then we should go get it.

839
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,549
- He's not there.

840
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:18,270
Or maybe he's not answering the phone.

841
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,253
Maybe he got the Botox?

842
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:22,190
- It's okay, we're going over there.

843
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,520
We'll see what's up.

844
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,580
Right John?

845
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,413
- Right.

846
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,988
- Come on, get your stuff let's go.

847
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:36,940
(banging)

848
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,670
- What is the hurry?

849
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,170
Can't we wait for Giacomo
to make sure he is okay?

850
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,080
- He'll survive, he always does.

851
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,000
Besides, the cab is waiting.

852
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,163
- So send it away.

853
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,433
- I can't, okay.

854
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:57,933
- Why?

855
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,373
- I poisoned the food
at Giacomo's restaurant.

856
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,153
- What?

857
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,413
- The chef, the chef at
Giacomo's restaurant,

858
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,113
I was hired to ruin him.

859
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,650
See he fucked with this girl,

860
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,890
and this girl's fiancé and her uncle

861
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,030
hired me to destroy him.

862
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,333
It's a basic revenge job.

863
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:31,843
And in about eight months,
he's gonna get killed.

864
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,613
- Solange, what the fuck?

865
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,240
- I do jobs.

866
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,073
- Jobs?

867
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,600
- Jobs that most people don't want to do.

868
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,150
I get paid to fuck with
people and sometimes,

869
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,240
well actually most times,

870
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,403
people get hurt.

871
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,023
- Oh God.

872
01:00:58,023 --> 01:01:00,420
Chefs kill themselves over
their reputations all the time.

873
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,464
Something like this is a career stopper.

874
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,663
- What about Giacomo?

875
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,883
- You know what, he's a dangerous man.

876
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,910
He got his money in a
hundred different ways

877
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,030
you do not want to hear about.

878
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,110
I did more than model
for him back in the day.

879
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,190
We should get out of here
before he comes back.

880
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,803
I don't know how much he knows.

881
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,810
- I don't believe you.

882
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,930
- You had better.

883
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,093
He's a killer too.

884
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,930
- So everyone you know is a killer?

885
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,510
I mean, What is this?

886
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,880
Like some killer dating
slash escort service?

887
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,010
- He's not a killer like I am...

888
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,379
Hold on let me rephrase that.

889
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:43,080
I really don't consider
myself to be a killer.

890
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,963
- Oh, okay.

891
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,260
I really like Giacomo.

892
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:49,600
- You know what?

893
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,200
I suggest you get over that crush

894
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,290
with both knees and your dick intact.

895
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,087
So come on and let's go.

896
01:01:57,202 --> 01:01:58,035
- Solange,

897
01:01:59,011 --> 01:01:59,844
John,

898
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:01,403
what a surprise.

899
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,793
How did you get in here?

900
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,600
- I still have keys remember.

901
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,270
- Of course, you are like the cat

902
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,913
never forgetting the old tricks.

903
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,440
- [Solange] We heard about
the restaurant, sorry.

904
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,880
- Yes, I've been at
the police all morning.

905
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,230
It doesn't look good for my chef,

906
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:31,237
but do not worry, it will not touch me.

907
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:34,898
I will not let it touch me.

908
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:36,021
- That's good.

909
01:02:36,021 --> 01:02:38,610
Yeah, we ere hoping to
see you before we left.

910
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,267
See we have more shooting to do.

911
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:42,130
The show must go on.

912
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,953
So we came to get the
camera and John's stuff.

913
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,033
- That is Solange always on the run.

914
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,200
- Yeah, well the taxi is waiting.

915
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,257
So I'll give you guys some
time alone to say goodbye.

916
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,090
Ciao.

917
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:05,501
- Ciao.

918
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:10,565
(tense electronic music)

919
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:23,723
- I am so glad you are okay.

920
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,638
It was really nice to have met you.

921
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:34,880
I am sorry we have to go.

922
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:42,690
- It is ironic that Solange brings

923
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,763
both good and bad luck with her travels,

924
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:49,263
because I would not
have met you otherwise.

925
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,523
- Yeah, that is true.

926
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,293
- I wanted to take you to the beach.

927
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:03,593
- That would have been nice.

928
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,503
Maybe next time I'm in Italy.

929
01:04:17,414 --> 01:04:20,091
- She distracted me with you,

930
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:21,300
but it's okay,

931
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,520
you must sometimes take
the bad with the good.

932
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,353
- Thanks.

933
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,010
- You should go now.

934
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:45,430
(pulsing electronic music)

935
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,093
- Does he suspect anything?

936
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,370
- I don't know.

937
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,220
His tongue didn't give anything away.

938
01:05:22,747 --> 01:05:23,870
- I feel so stupid.

939
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,220
I should have never taken a job

940
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,743
so close to the people I know.

941
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:29,800
It was like a challenge.

942
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,013
It's like a rush.

943
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,653
I feel like a damn idiot.

944
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,353
- Maybe you should take up skydiving.

945
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,593
- I'm sorry.

946
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,263
- Why am I here?

947
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,380
- Well Kevin was gone and
I couldn't do everything

948
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,780
without somebody being here.

949
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,070
- Kevin knew about this, about your work?

950
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:00,427
- Yeah, he knew everything.

951
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,950
I don't know how else
to explain it to you.

952
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,963
He was like my absolver.

953
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,760
- He took your confessions.

954
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,683
So I'm his stand in?

955
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,190
I need a drink.

956
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:21,114
(upbeat electronic music)

957
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,620
- [John Voiceover] Kevin told
me once about how he would

958
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,843
pick up guys at the Tiergarten in Berlin.

959
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,380
Sometimes they realized
they were both after money.

960
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,310
They had a good laugh
and then had a contest

961
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,590
to see who could get the most.

962
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,440
Kevin won of course, but then
one of the guys robbed him.

963
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:17,010
Someone like this guy, unknown,

964
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,323
cute and most likely bummed
that I can't speak German.

965
01:07:23,587 --> 01:07:27,087
(upbeat electronic music)

966
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:43,644
(in foreign language)

967
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:14,207
- Wait.

968
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:24,947
(upbeat jazz music)

969
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:36,417
What are we doing?

970
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,863
- Getting a feel for it, checking it out.

971
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,108
- Okay what should I be filming?

972
01:08:42,108 --> 01:08:43,858
- Just get some establishing shots.

973
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:46,020
This place is cool isn't it?

974
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:46,853
- Yeah,

975
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,110
so is there even gonna be a show

976
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,950
or is that just like your cover?

977
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,735
- Oh shut up, of course
there is gonna be a show.

978
01:08:54,735 --> 01:08:55,568
- Okay.

979
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,260
- Okay, there she is.

980
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,430
I knew she'd be here.

981
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,163
- You knew she'd be here?

982
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,840
- It's my job to know
where these people are.

983
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,990
- Okay Solange, you're wigging me out.

984
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,150
Is she a hit or something?

985
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,367
- No, silly, for the show, film her.

986
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,190
- Okay.

987
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,000
- She was in Dargento's last movie.

988
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,680
You know the Italian horror master?

989
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,530
- Of course, I saw you in
his movie "Ghoul School".

990
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,600
- Yeah, that among many others.

991
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,937
But she only had one line,

992
01:09:24,937 --> 01:09:26,410
and she didn't get herself killed,

993
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,300
which to me is ridiculous.

994
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,910
If you are gonna be in Dargento's movie,

995
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,437
you at least get yourself killed.

996
01:09:33,656 --> 01:09:34,823
Ciao Isabella.

997
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,420
- Ciao Solange.

998
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:48,417
- [John] Hi.

999
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,427
(in foreign language)

1000
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:52,230
- I'm sorry, I don't speak German.

1001
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,106
- Oh you are American?

1002
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,900
Oh poor thing.

1003
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,020
Let me buy you a drink.

1004
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,860
(in foreign language)

1005
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,490
- Thank you.

1006
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,990
- No problem, you are welcome.

1007
01:10:08,253 --> 01:10:09,267
What are you doing here?

1008
01:10:09,267 --> 01:10:13,263
- We are shooting a film
about cool hip clubs.

1009
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,490
- Oh, how nice.
- Thank you.

1010
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,150
- Nice.

1011
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:28,820
- Thanks, oh I loved
you in "Hypochondria,"

1012
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,839
you are my idol.

1013
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:32,756
- Thank you sweetheart.

1014
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:39,040
- How did it look?

1015
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:39,873
- Great.

1016
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:52,300
- Thanks.

1017
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,230
- She got her tits done
too late if you ask me.

1018
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,230
Those must be producers,
the ones ogling her.

1019
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,510
- That's your acting verdict?

1020
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,090
- Uh, yeah no one wants to
see a girl with tiny tits

1021
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,590
get killed in Dargento movies.

1022
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,363
You know what?

1023
01:11:14,363 --> 01:11:15,230
I told her you were a producer too.

1024
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,613
So, she should be over
here right about now.

1025
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,833
Expect tits.

1026
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,480
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1027
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,750
- Solange was telling me all about you.

1028
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:29,750
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:33,863
(phone ringing)

1030
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:35,020
- I'm sorry I have to take this.

1031
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,200
- Oh you're American?

1032
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,540
- Yes, excuse me.

1033
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,633
- Okay I'll wait, I'll wait here.

1034
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:45,973
- Hello.

1035
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,480
- Hello Johnny John,

1036
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,313
where are you?

1037
01:11:48,313 --> 01:11:49,780
- I'm in Berlin at a club.

1038
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:52,500
- It's so loud.

1039
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,250
When are you coming back to France?

1040
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,423
- Soon I hope.

1041
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,457
- I would love that so much.

1042
01:12:02,507 --> 01:12:05,093
- Me too.

1043
01:12:05,093 --> 01:12:07,617
I think someone dosed me.

1044
01:12:07,617 --> 01:12:08,450
- What?

1045
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,820
- It's some kind of hallucinogenic,

1046
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,251
they must have put it in my drink.

1047
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:13,143
I hope it doesn't last too long.

1048
01:12:13,143 --> 01:12:13,976
- What the fuck?

1049
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:14,809
Get out of there.

1050
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,143
- I will, I will try.

1051
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:21,120
- Don't go flying out any windows.

1052
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,690
- I won't.

1053
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,963
I have to go.

1054
01:12:25,005 --> 01:12:25,838
I'll see you soon.
- Be careful,

1055
01:12:25,838 --> 01:12:27,480
wait wait,

1056
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,453
don't hang up.

1057
01:12:29,453 --> 01:12:32,536
(upbeat dance music)

1058
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:55,808
- Oh nice camera,

1059
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,683
what are you filming?

1060
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,190
Can I be in your movie?

1061
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:04,815
I've got props.

1062
01:13:07,263 --> 01:13:10,013
Come on let's go for my close up.

1063
01:13:11,352 --> 01:13:12,602
- I am America.

1064
01:13:14,077 --> 01:13:16,226
I am the statue of liberty.

1065
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:17,309
I am freedom.

1066
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:21,880
I am New York, I am beautiful
and glittery come back to me.

1067
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,060
Europe is the past, America is the future.

1068
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,730
Suck of the tit of patriotism baby.

1069
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,580
Take of my culture.

1070
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,160
Let me pull down your pants

1071
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,113
and show you what
American ingenuity can do.

1072
01:13:36,452 --> 01:13:39,202
I am America and I will rape you.

1073
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:45,252
(in foreign language)

1074
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:49,235
- No, no.

1075
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:00,038
I have to go back to Paris.

1076
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,380
I think someone dosed me.

1077
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,730
I think it's some acid
with some really good E.

1078
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:08,400
- [Solange] What is this,
a fucking love parade?

1079
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,723
I'll go get our coats.

1080
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,100
- Okay John come on, we've got to go.

1081
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,750
We haven't got a lot of
time before she gets back.

1082
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,583
- What?

1083
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,203
- Solange dosed you, quick.

1084
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,749
- [John Voiceover] I
felt like I was drowning,

1085
01:14:23,749 --> 01:14:25,199
and not because of the drugs.

1086
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,580
- You've got to get just what you need.

1087
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,030
We haven't got a lot of time.

1088
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:33,423
Man, she gave you some really good shit.

1089
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,950
Come on.

1090
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:39,710
- [John Voiceover] It was
like I was becoming Kevin.

1091
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,660
Being pulled out to sea in an undertow.

1092
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,483
I think Solange dosed me to
try to turn me into Kevin,

1093
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,693
that is what I wanted to believe anyway.

1094
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,130
I don't know what Isabella's deal was.

1095
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:00,000
She said Giacomo had sent her,

1096
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,098
which wasn't exactly reassuring.

1097
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,313
- [Isabella] Okay you ready?

1098
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,063
Let's go, come.

1099
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,090
- [John Voiceover] I
just wanted to escape,

1100
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,540
to catch my breath
somewhere safe and far away,

1101
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,337
and safe and far away was Alain.

- Who is we?

1115
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:20,796

1116

1117
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:24,246
- Are you happy to see me?

1118
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:26,683
- Yeah, you have no idea.

1119
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,320
It's so good to be back here.

1120
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,383

(dramatic instrumental music)

1122
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:00,713
- John?

1123
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,713
- No no no no no, relax.

1124
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:10,750
What the fuck are you doing here?

1125
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,450
Stop, stop, don't come any closer.

1126
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,430
- What the fuck is going on John?

1127
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:17,580
- Stay out of it Alain.

1128
01:20:21,752 --> 01:20:24,080
- [Solange] I think there is a
little more you need to know.

1129
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,670
It's a long story.

1130
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,270
- Long or short, it's not
gonna make any difference.

1131
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:36,040
- Well maybe it will after you hear this.

1132
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,983
Kevin had help at the beach.

1133
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,743
I helped him.

1134
01:20:42,427 --> 01:20:43,260
- What?

1135
01:20:54,752 --> 01:20:58,470
- Well, you use your
powers for evil so much,

1136
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:00,620
how about using them
for good for a change?

1137
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,710
- Kevin I don't exactly
call any of this good, baby.

1138
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,633
- I need this.

1139
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,580
I can't watch my mom nursing me backwards

1140
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,113
into oblivion Solange.

1141
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,113
I just want to disappear.

1142
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:21,070
- Kevin, if you care
anything about me or your mom

1143
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,240
you wouldn't ask me.
- If you care about me,

1144
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,520
you'll do it.

1145
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,960
Don't lecture me Solange.

1146
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,813
I'm dying.

1147
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:33,980
- Fine, you want the businesswoman,

1148
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:36,110
you'll get the businesswoman.

1149
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:37,170
So when?

1150
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,633
- As soon as possible.

1151
01:21:39,665 --> 01:21:42,603
If I wait too long, I won't
be able to get out of bed.

1152
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,330
I need to be able to walk out there.

1153
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,427
- You were always about the drama.

1154
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:49,413
(laughing)

1155
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:51,130
- I was thinking of you,

1156
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,213
it's less clean up.

1157
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:53,908
- Damn, now why didn't I think of that?

1158
01:21:56,313 --> 01:21:57,813
- You're slipping?

1159
01:21:58,925 --> 01:22:00,275
Maybe it is time to retire.

1160
01:22:02,137 --> 01:22:02,970
- Maybe.

1161
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,500
- [Kevin] Oh and one last thing,

1162
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,743
promise me you'll get John out
of that damn office cubicle.

1163
01:22:16,025 --> 01:22:18,230
- [Solange] I promise.

1164
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,470
- So you came here to tell me this?

1165
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,303
Why?

1166
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,750
I mean it's not really
that shocking anymore,

1167
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:25,833
knowing what I know.

1168
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,037
Is this guilt?

1169
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:32,590
- No, I don't feel
guilty for helping Kevin

1170
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:33,810
with his final wish.

1171
01:22:36,102 --> 01:22:38,013
It was upsetting though.

1172
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:42,543
I'd be a total monster if I
felt nothing, don't you think?

1173
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:45,690
- You've had a lot of practice.

1174
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,110
- Huh?

1175
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,233
- Playing monsters.

1176
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,250
- Look John, stay with me
right now in this moment.

1177
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,960
Shit is hitting the fan quick

1178
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,950
and unfortunately, it involves you.

1179
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,953
- No, no way, I'm not with you anymore.

1180
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,710
- Remember the guy at the restaurant?

1181
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:09,700
- So what?

1182
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,102
- He's after me.

1183
01:23:11,102 --> 01:23:12,950
- That Italian guy that came here?

1184
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:15,464
He knows where I live, get out!

1185
01:23:15,464 --> 01:23:16,323
I am calling the police.

1186
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:21,030
- [Solange] Okay, okay,
but first give me the gun

1187
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,050
and the money you took from me,

1188
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,723
then I'll leave you alone.

1189
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,023
- And if I don't?

1190
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,413
- I'm retiring anyway,

1191
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:38,190
but I just can't walk away
from this without protection.

1192
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,290
- Give her the things.

1193
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:00,930
- You know, I would say I'm sorry,

1194
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:05,380
but I promised Kevin I'd
get you out of that cubicle,

1195
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,577
and I did that at least, didn't I?

1196
01:24:10,839 --> 01:24:11,672
John?

1197
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:17,214
John?
- John!

1198
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,820
- [John Voiceover] Solange
didn't need the money or the gun,

1199
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,463
she needed her absolver.

1200
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,893
She needed to confess to me about Kevin.

1201
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:36,207
(dramatic orchestral music)

1202
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,367
(gun firing)

1203
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,680
I heard from Solange a few times.

1204
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,090
She wanted the footage I shot.

1205
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,053
I didn't reply.

1206
01:25:35,127 --> 01:25:37,680
I did everything I promised you I would.

1207
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,610
I got tested, got my drivers license.

1208
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,160
I got out of that damn cubicle.

1209
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,590
I almost quit smoking.

1210
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,963
But I can't live the life
you didn't get to live.

1211
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:52,630
I've got to start something new.

1212
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,947
I guess that's what you and
Solange gave me, something new.
