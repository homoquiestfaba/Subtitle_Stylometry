Will you stop off
and get some basil?

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
Sure.

183
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,320
You know what that is,
don't you?

184
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,520
That green stuff
in the produce department?

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
Mm-hmm.

186
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Jack in some kind of trouble?

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Don't worry about it.

188
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,600
If he were,
would you be there?

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,600
You bet.

190
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,840
What about me?
Would you be there for me?

191
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,760
[Snorts]
What do you think?

192
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
Hmm.

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,440
I think it's a dumb question.

194
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Gloria Lamar!

195
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
Miss Lamar?

196
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,680
[Labored breathing nearby]

197
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,920
Hey. I was supposed to meet
Gloria Lamar here...

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,400
and I was supposed
to deliver a package.

199
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
Um--

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
[Man gasping]

201
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,960
[Gasps]

202
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,400
HARRY: One thing you can
count on if you're a P.I...

203
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,040
is that any time a client says,
""You don't need a gun...""

204
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
that's when
you ought to bring two.

205
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
The guy was dead all right...

206
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
but before he was dead,
he was a very sick man.

207
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,560
As it turns out,
his name was Lester lvar.

208
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
He was a retired cop.

209
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,600
Anyway, I went to the address
on his driver's license.

210
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,960
It was a run-down joint
called the Sun Rise Court...

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
over in Monte Vista.

212
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,640
The back door was open,
so I let myself in.

213
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,400
OK, Lester, talk to me.

214
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,320
OFFlCER: Hands up!
Hold it right there!

215
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Interlace your fingers behind
your head and slowly walk up.

216
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes, sir.

217
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,280
OFFlCER: Turn around.

218
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
Don't move.

219
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,280
VERNA: It's all right.

220
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
Harry?

221
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,400
HARRY: Verna?

222
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,360
It's been a long time.

223
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,840
A real long time.

224
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
Catalina.

225
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,360
[Laughs]

226
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
Cuff him.

227
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,520
Jesus Christ.

228
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,680
What's the matter?

229
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,600
See that guy with Verna?

230
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
OFFlCER: Yeah?

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
-Hey, Harry.
-Carl.

232
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,040
That's Harry-fucking-Ross.

233
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,800
OFFlCER: So?

234
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,280
What's your worst fear?

235
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
Getting shot.

236
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Getting shot where?

237
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,200
Inglewood?

238
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Not that kind of where.

239
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, shit.

240
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,360
Goes down to Mexico,
looking for this runaway kid.

241
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
When he finds her,
she won't come.

242
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,600
She gets ahold of the dumb
son of a bitch's gun and whammo!

243
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,200
She shoots him in the dick?

244
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,400
Blew it right out of the hangar.

245
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
Captain?

246
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
Yeah.

247
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
EGAN: Harry, great to see you.

248
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,880
HARRY: Since when?

249
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,080
Hey, sure, we've had our
differences over the years...

250
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,920
VERNA: Can we get started?

251
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,560
Sure. Sure.

252
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,320
If Harry feels up
to a few questions.

253
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,280
HARRY:
If I feel up to questions?

254
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
VERNA: I'm sure Harry doesn't
want to be treated differently.

255
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,880
EGAN: I can understand that.

256
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,760
Well, then...

257
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,680
what exactly where you doing
at Lester lvar's house?

258
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
I was waiting for Lester.
I was supposed to meet him.

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,680
Why should I be treated
different?

260
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,880
My point exactly, Harry.

261
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,280
EGAN: What was your business?

262
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,520
He was doing a surveillance.
Wanted me to take night shift.

263
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
Am I missing something here?

264
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Missing? No.

265
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,040
EGAN: Work for Lester often?

266
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,160
HARRY: Now and then.

267
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,720
Mostly when his asthma kicks up,
he'll call me.

268
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
EGAN: Are you aware
Lester lvar was murdered today?

269
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,400
No. I'm sorry to hear that.

270
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,320
EGAN:
Well, here's the thing, Harry.

271
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,200
One half hour after Lester
is killed...

272
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,760
at a flophouse
over on Palmetto...

273
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,120
we find you in his apartment
which had been ransacked.

274
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,880
So that could be construed
as breaking and entering.

275
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,960
You say you were working
for Lester...

276
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
but your license expired
a year ago.

277
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,000
I better call a lawyer.

278
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,120
EGAN: Relax.
We're not after you.

279
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,400
A man with his own cross
to bear.

280
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,520
Cross...to bear?

281
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,880
You think that l--

282
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,800
VERNA: I think that'll be all.

283
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,320
If there are more questions,
we know where to find you.

284
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
Isn't that right, Captain?

285
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,360
Sure thing, Lieutenant.

286
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,440
-OK, what's going on?
-Nothing's going on.

287
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,360
-Hey.
-What?

288
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,000
We worked together, remember?

289
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,760
We were partners,
among other things.

290
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,160
-Harry, cut it out.
-My ass.

291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Nobody thinks
you killed Lester lvar.

292
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,200
Never stopped you guys
from reaming my ass before.

293
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,120
We cut you some slack this time.

294
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,680
HARRY: A little slack?

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,280
I let my goddamn license
expire a year ago.

296
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,200
All right. Everybody knows
what happened in Mexico.

297
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,800
I took a bullet.

298
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh, Harry, please.

299
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,840
EGAN: Lieutenant,
can I have a word with you?

300
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,920
VERNA: Be right there.

301
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm really sorry
about everything...

302
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
and...

303
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,280
just know
I'll always be there for you.

304
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,240
RAYMOND: You may not know this,
but when I was still a cop...

305
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,480
HARRY: Hey, hotshot.

306
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,160
RAYMOND: I had one ambition--
to get into Verna's knickers.

307
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,600
Failing was one of a series of
professional disappointments...

308
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
that drove me
into the private sector.

309
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,080
People told me
you were more fortunate.

310
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,320
Ah.

311
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
You must be confused, Raymond.

312
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,960
RAYMOND: Oh, Lord,
I do hate a modest man.

313
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,640
Care for a drink?

314
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,600
I could use a cup of coffee.

315
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,680
If we have to.

316
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,840
Jack Ames send you
to look after me?

317
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,680
The cops called the Ames house
to verify your address.

318
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,360
Jack wanted me to make sure
they hadn't electrocuted you.

319
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,920
I appreciate his confidence.

320
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Want some milk or sugar?

321
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
No, not for me.

322
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,120
You want some thinner?

323
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,360
No, thanks.

324
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,560
Back when I was working security
at the studio...

325
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,000
it was a full-time job
keeping Jack out of trouble.

326
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,080
No. Doctor's orders.

327
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,240
If there was an actress
he missed boinking...

328
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I don't know who she was.

329
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,440
They all loved him,
even after he dumped 'em.

330
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,040
The man had the gift.

331
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
HARRY: Their husbands took
a dimmer view, if I remember.

332
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,280
-Well, they would.
-Especially Catherine's.

333
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,280
Billy Sullivan.
It hurt Billy so bad...

334
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
he swam out to sea
and never swam back.

335
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,960
Of course, he also lost a bundle
gambling about the same time.

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Lose a woman like Catherine....

337
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,680
and a whole lot of money
in the same week...

338
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,080
you can begin to feel
sorry for yourself.

339
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,240
I can see how you might.

340
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Never having had either.

341
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,160
I used to think Jack Ames...

342
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,720
was about the luckiest man
I'd ever run across.

343
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,120
Looks like he's run out of luck,
though.

344
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
Cancer's what I heard.

345
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,920
Yeah, looks like we all
run out of luck in the end.

346
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,960
Your prostate started acting up?

347
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
Not yet.

348
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Something to look forward to.

349
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,680
I better get on my horse.

350
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
This is late for me.

351
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,360
Sad, ain't it?

352
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,880
You tell Verna if she ever gets
the urge to hump an old man...

353
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
she can hump me.
I'm in the book.

354
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,520
BOTH: Under "Hump."

355
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,440
[Piano music playing]

356
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,120
CATHERlNE: [Singing]
The very thought of you...

357
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,160
and I forget to do...

358
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,000
the little ordinary things...

359
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,600
that everyone ought to do.

360
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm livin' in...

361
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,600
a kind of daydream.

362
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,400
HARRY: All alone?

363
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,680
CATHERlNE: I have my thoughts.
Piss-poor company, though.

364
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
This way it don't count.

365
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,600
Oh, Harry, you're a pal.

366
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,520
[Pats seat]

367
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,560
HARRY: I was kind of hoping
to talk to Jack.

368
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,720
CATHERlNE: Oh. And here
I thought it was my company.

369
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,120
Jack took a sedative
and went to sleep.

370
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,920
Something got him terribly upset
this afternoon.

371
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,760
I have an idea that you might
know what happened.

372
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,560
That's why people hire you,
because you're mute.

373
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,080
Where's Mel?

374
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,560
She came home for 20 minutes
and then went to work.

375
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
She's got a night-shoot
on a low-budget film.

376
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,080
She asked me a very
interesting question.

377
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,480
She wanted to know why the hell
you're still living here.

378
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
What'd you tell her?

379
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,560
I was mute.

380
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,520
Did you ever hear of a guy
named Lester lvar?

381
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,280
No.

382
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,120
Somebody killed him today.

383
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm sorry. Was he a friend?

384
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,200
No.

385
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Never heard of him, huh?

386
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
No.

387
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
You're lying.

388
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,880
HARRY: You knew Lester lvar.

389
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,360
You were at his apartment
this afternoon.

390
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,920
Find what you were looking for?

391
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,800
What are you talking about?

392
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,720
HARRY:
What's that perfume you wear?

393
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,080
The reason I ask--it was still
in the air when I got there.

394
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,400
Harry, a lot of women
wear Bal á Versailles.

395
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
Smells different on them.

396
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,840
CATHERlNE: I've noticed
how familiar you've become...

397
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
with everything in this house.

398
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,240
You know what I think?

399
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,760
I think you're right.

400
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,000
What a guy. I piss you off...

401
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,920
and you're out in the time
it takes to pack one bag.

402
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,560
My husband would need vans,
a whole army of movers...

403
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,880
and it'd still take him
two weeks.

404
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,800
CATHERlNE: Got a light?

405
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,360
Thanks.

406
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,920
The thing is, we're broke.

407
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,520
HARRY: No. I'm broke.

408
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,160
You and Jack are overextended.

409
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'll explain the difference
sometime so you'll understand.

410
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,760
The thing is, we're broke,
and my husband's dying.

411
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,200
And I thought that I could
gut it out, you know?

412
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,480
Kind of hold everything
together the way...

413
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
So that there'd be enough time.

414
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,520
So that he could die in peace...

415
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,720
but that doesn't seem
like it's gonna happen.

416
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,400
This God...

417
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,160
damn fucking thing.

418
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,880
Goddamn fucking...

419
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,480
-Here. Let me--
-No.

420
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,320
OK, go. I don't know why you've
been around so long anyway.

421
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,200
You don't?

422
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,360
Don't forget your lighter.

423
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,560
CATHERlNE: I remember
the first morning I met you.

424
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,880
I opened the door,
and there you stood in an...

425
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,800
old blue shirt
with a frayed collar, and...

426
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,200
whoever cut your hair forgot
about this little part there.

427
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,240
I bet you don't even remember.

428
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,920
Well...in the first place,
it wasn't morning.

429
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,680
It was afternoon.
The maid answered the door.

430
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,840
You and Jack were having lunch
by the swimming pool.

431
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,920
He gave me a picture of Mel.

432
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,240
And I don't...

433
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,960
even think you said hello.

434
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,040
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you don't own any blue shirts.

435
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,480
No. I got a bunch of those.

436
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,880
I know.

437
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,200
I remember.

438
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,600
JACK OVER lNTERCOM:
Harry! Harry, I can't breathe!

439
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,240
I can't find Cath. Help me!

440
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,400
Jack! Jack!

441
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,640
Jack! Jack!

442
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,160
Oh, Jack.

443
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,360
Jack. Jack.

444
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,440
Live, you son of a bitch.

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,840

448
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,360
-Cath, I tried to call you.
-I know.

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,480
HARRY: I got 911.

450
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,120
-Don't talk.
-Here's the tank.

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,480
JACK: Harry. Harry.

452
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,080
You're a pal.

Son of a bitch!

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,200
CATHERlNE: Get out, Harry.
Just get out. Go!

457
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,680
Cath, how could you?

458
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,440
How fucking could you?

459
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760

Call Dr. Hayes.
Tell him we're going to Cedars.

465
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
What happened?

466
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,440
Mel, you're in the way.

467
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,680

[Ring]

470
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
HARRY: Hello.

471
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,600
GLORlA: Mr. Ames?

472
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,400
HARRY: He's not here right now.

473
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
GLORlA: When do you expect him?

474
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,440
HARRY: I can't say.

475
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,400
This wouldn't be Gloria Lamar,
would it?

476
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,200
I ask because Mr. Ames
gave me a package to give her.

477
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,040
GLORlA:
That would make you Ross.

478
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,600
HARRY: Right.

479
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,800
Mr. Ames is anxious that
Miss Lamar get this envelope.

480
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
Is there someplace we can meet
where I can give it to her?

481
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
GLORlA:
You know the Santa Monica pier?

482
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
HARRY: Yeah.

483
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,000
GLORlA: One hour from now
at the water pistol range.

484
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
HARRY:
How will I know who you are?

485
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,240
GLORlA: Blonde, big.
Mucho hair, mucho tits.

[Dial tone]

487
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,160
I can't wait.

488
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,360
HARRY: A buck, huh?

489
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,080
MAN: Yeah.
Wanna try your luck?

490
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,480
[Ding]

491
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
MAN: Your name
wouldn't be Ross, would it?

492
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,520
HARRY: Good first guess.

493
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,160
MAN: A woman called earlier...

494
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,760
told me she'd be waiting for you
under the pier.

495
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,280
GLORlA: Fuck! Shit! Piss!

496
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,080
Look at that.

497
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,200
A $40 pair of shoes ruined!

498
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,320
No good deed goes
un-fucking-punished!

499
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,560
That's what I get for...

500
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
You Ross?

501
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Hiya, Mucho.

502
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
You better have an envelope
for me, handsome.

503
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,400
I got sand in my pantyhose...

504
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,080
and that doesn't improve
a girl's disposition.

505
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
HARRY: Wait. Hold it.

506
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,160
I went to a place on Palmetto
to meet a Gloria Lamar.

507
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,080
Instead, I find Lester lvar
with bullets in his chest.

508
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,680
Hey, it's a violent world.

509
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,440
If you don't believe me,
watch television.

510
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
But I got to explain that
to Mr. Ames.

511
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,000
I'd prefer to know
what's going on.

512
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,120
I'd prefer to have met
with Mr. Ames in person.

513
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,040
I'd prefer to be
a natural blonde.

514
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,960
Let's not get started on
the subject of what we'd prefer.

515
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,240
If Mr. Ames wants me out
of his life, I get the package.

516
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,880
No package till you tell me
what you know about Lester lvar.

517
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,200
That wasn't part of the deal.

518
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,920
This is a new deal.

519
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,280
Fine. Have it your way.

520
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,400
Here.

521
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,920
Uh, hold my shoe.

522
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,080
Sure.

523
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,840
Here's something you should see.

524
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,880
I like the old deal bet--
Hey!

525
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,920
Ow! That hurt!

526
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,680
HARRY: Like I said,
no good deed goes unpunished.

527
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,440
JEFF: Ain't that the truth?

528
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,600
Remember Mexico, pally?
Mel's little friend?

529
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,000
You see? I've been takin'
lessons like you told me.

530
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,560
Did we or did we not agree you
weren't gonna show your face?

531
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,000
I know what I'm doing, OK?

Smart. Real, real smart.

533
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,040
JEFF: You know where I've been
taking lessons?

534
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
In jail.

535
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,120
Yuma, Arizona.

536
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,480
Have you ever been to Yuma?

537
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,400
That's where they put me...

538
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
after your friend,
Mr. Jack Ames...

539
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,080
had me arrested
for transporting a minor.

540
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,160
You wanna learn to kick ass,
no better place than Yuma.

541
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,560
Is this gonna take all night?

542
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,480
OK. Come on.
I need you to wake up, pally.

543
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,680
Listen.

544
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,320
I want you to tell Mr. Ames...

545
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,080
that this...

546
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,640
is just a down payment
on what he owes me.

547
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Can you remember that, pally?
Hmm?

548
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,080
Hmm?

549
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,880
Are you finished?

550
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,080
JEFF: Yes, I'm finished.

551
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,600
HARRY: Ooh!

552
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,440
GLORlA: Did we or did we not
make a plan?

553
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,640
What is the point
of making a plan...

554
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,200
if you're just gonna
say ""Fuck it""?

555
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,040
JEFF: Why are you
always so negative?

556
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh, shit.

557
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,000
Hey!

558
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
Hey, chief, wake up!

559
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,480
Hey, wake up, man.

560
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,040
You can't stay here.
The tide is coming in.

561
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,400
Harry. Harry, it's me,
your old partner.

562
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Somebody beat the shit
out of you.

563
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,640
It's lucky I came along.
Otherwise, you would've drowned.

564
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,720
But I saved your life.

565
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,120
Don't worry.
You can thank me later.

566
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,960
REUBEN: I'm sitting in the limo
at the Santa Monica pier--

567
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,240
I'm on the job.
Rich kid, sweet-16 party--

568
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
and who do I see
but my old partner Harry Ross.

569
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,360
HARRY: We are not partners.
We were never partners.

570
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm telling you
how I saved your life.

571
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,960
It's not nice to interrupt.

572
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
Where was l? Oh, yeah.

573
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,440
So I'm waiting.
I see you go to the beach.

574
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,080
I figure
you're gonna need backup.

575
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm cool. I pick my spot.

576
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,800
You what?

577
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,360
REUBEN: I wait,
just like you taught me.

578
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
After a while, I see two people
come out from under the pier...

579
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
and there was no sign of you.

580
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,480
I think to myself,
hey, this doesn't look so good.

581
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,320
I go down to the beach,
and there you were.

582
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,240
That's when I saved your life.

583
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
HARRY:
Let me get this straight.

584
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,640
I was getting
the shit kicked out of me...

585
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,880
and you were
in the parking lot waiting?

586
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,800
And you call that backup?

587
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,320
Hey, I got a good look at them.

588
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,560
I got a better look
than you did.

589
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,480
HARRY:
When are you gonna realize...

590
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,560
that I'm not
a private investigator anymore?

591
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,560
REUBEN: You can't just quit.
You were the best, the greatest.

592
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,720
OK, maybe not the greatest,
but you were good, man.

593
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,080
We were good.
We were a hell of a team.

594
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,880
Reuben, we were never a team.

595
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,360
Every once in a while...

596
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,240
I gave you some leg work,
which you usually screwed up.

597
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,680
That doesn't make us a team.

598
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Listen, you got to let me in
on this case.

599
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
I can't take this job anymore.

600
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,880
If it's not the freeways,
it's the dispatchers.

601
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,600
If it's not the dispatchers,
it's the clients.

602
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,520
Speaking of which,
where are the kids?

603
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,720
What kids?

604
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,520
The sweet- 16 kids.

605
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,800
Ay, carajo.
You think they're still there?

606
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,000
I would look.

607
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,720
Oh. Oh!

608
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,920
Listen, boss,
if you ever get into a jam...

609
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,680
you need some backup again,
then you give me a call.

610
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Any time, day or night,
I'm your man.

611
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
VERNA: Nice place you got here.

612
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
HARRY: I'm glad you like it.

613
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,320
I have to hand it to you.
You always land on your feet.

614
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,000
Verna, I live over the garage.

615
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,120
Jack Ames owns the place.
I just work here, more or less.

616
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,240
You need stitches.

617
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,600
I brought his daughter back from
Mexico a couple of years ago...

618
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,000
and I was in pretty bad shape,
so he let me hole up here.

619
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Then he got sick,
and I was helping out.

620
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
VERNA:
That's the best I can do.

621
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,640
Actually,
there's more to it than that.

622
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,840
It's time I was leaving.

623
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,800
VERNA: That's that actress.

624
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,920
Catherine Hayward, right?

625
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,120
Yeah.

626
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,760
VERNA: Didn't she used to be
married to that actor...

627
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,600
He disappeared.
What was his name?

628
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
-Billy Sullivan.
-Yeah.

629
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,800
HARRY: That was 20 years ago.

630
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,200
Bet she doesn't look
like this anymore.

631
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,680
HARRY: Hey, she's--

632
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,680
She's OK.

633
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,120
OK, Harry, what are your plans?

634
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,640
Got no plans.

635
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,040
Come on.
What are you gonna do?

636
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,640
You gonna go back to work,
renew your license? What?

637
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,480
Verna...

638
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,720
I was a cop for 20 years...

639
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,640
a private investigator for five.

640
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,440
I started out...

641
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,240
with a wife and daughter,
and I ended up a drunk.

642
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,360
Slept in the office
and showered at the YMCA.

643
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,520
You think I wanna go back
to that?

644
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,320
Besides, I'm getting rusty.
I'm a danger to myself.

645
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,040
I know.

646
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,440
HARRY:
What's that supposed to mean?

647
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,880
You used to be a better liar.

648
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
Really?

649
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,440
Lester lvar didn't have asthma.

650
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,600
He had emphysema...

651
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,000
which you'd have known
if you worked for him.

652
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,680
We're gonna have
to question Jack Ames.

653
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,960
His wife, too, probably.

654
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,280
He's really sick.

655
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,160
Come on. This is a murder case.

656
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,080
Lester lvar
was the investigating officer...

657
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,800
when Billy Sullivan disappeared.

658
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,160
Lester lvar was on the force
for 30 years.

659
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
He had a thousand cases
like this.

660
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,800
What makes this one special?

661
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,160
VERNA: You, Harry.

662
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,240
You're the guy who showed up
at lvar's house.

663
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
You're the guy who led me here.

664
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,600
Like you say,
you're getting rusty.

665
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,280
HARRY: The only person I could
think of who could help me...

666
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,920
was Raymond Hope.

667
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,360
Plus, he owed me.

668
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Or I owed him.
I couldn't figure out which.

669
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,200
It was Raymond who pulled me off
the barstool...

670
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,640
I was living on two years ago
and introduced me to the Ameses.

671
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,400
Seen in a certain light...

672
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,760
everything that had happened
since then was his fault.

673
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,200
Maybe I'd tell him that.

674
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,840
You always were a showoff,
Raymond.

675
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,080
RAYMOND: Harry?

676
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,120
I almost peed on one of the few
remaining friends I have.

677
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,360
Hotshot.

678
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,040
HARRY: Your sprinkler fritzed,
or are you just lazy?

679
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,920
RAYMOND: Don't you know better
than to walk underneath a man--

680
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,440
Jesus. Look at you.

681
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,680
Well, somebody disagreed
with me from behind.

682
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,480
RAYMOND: No shit. Let's go
find him and disagree back.

683
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,400
HARRY: [Snickers]
You any tougher than you look?

684
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,080
RAYMOND: Hell, yes.
Least I used to be.

685
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,880
HARRY: I used to be.
We all used to be.

686
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
Then have a drink.

687
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,200
You still a bourbon man?

688
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,680
Take a ginger ale.

689
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,360
Do I look like a man
who'd have a ginger ale?

690
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,720
Water.

691
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,160
That I can handle.

692
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,080
[Big band jazz playing]

693
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,480
It gonna bother you if I drink?

694
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,080
HARRY: Go ahead.

695
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,120
HARRY: Nice place you got here.

696
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,000
Sure beats Los Feliz.

697
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,840
You're above the smog.

698
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,760
RAYMOND: I like to think
I'm up above a lot of things...

699
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,080
since I retired.

700
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,720
RAYMOND: So...

701
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,880
you were playing things pretty
close to your vest last night.

702
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,320
Are you in trouble?

703
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,720
HARRY:
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

704
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,160
It's just that...

705
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,280
RAYMOND: Jack.

706
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,080
Yeah, I figured that much.

707
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,560
And you wanna talk to me
about Jack and Lester lvar.

708
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,400
OK.

709
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,240
You probably know that lvar
was the investigating officer...

710
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,200
when Billy Sullivan
killed himself.

711
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,440
Can't call it suicide.
They never found a body.

712
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,320
L.A. Times called it a suicide.
That's good enough for me.

713
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,760
HARRY: But not good enough...

714
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,880
RAYMOND: For Lester lvar.

715
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,080
Yeah, Lester didn't believe
in good luck...

716
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,520
never having had any himself.

717
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,200
Billy's suicide was good luck
for Jack and Catherine.

718
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,640
With him out of the way,
they could get married.

719
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,040
Lester couldn't believe the way
it worked out so smooth.

720
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,360
I have never been
a great believer in luck--

721
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,280
not as a way
of explaining things.

722
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,200
Anyway, he's dead now.

723
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
End of story.

724
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
HARRY: Would be...

725
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,200
if I hadn't passed those
suspicions on to Verna.

726
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,880
Forgive me, Harry...

727
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,480
but it sounds
like you passed them on to you.

728
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,520
RAYMOND: By the way...

729
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,480
I heard a rumor I didn't want
to believe was true, so...

730
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
I thought I'd ask you directly.

731
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,680
The way it was told to me...

732
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,440
when you were down in Mexico
bringing the Ames kid back?

733
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,880
She, uh, she...

734
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,840
She shot your pecker off.

735
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,160

736
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,880

RAYMOND: Harry!

738
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,560
No. I'm fine.

739
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,920
But thanks for telling me.
That explains a lot.

740
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,800
RAYMOND: I'm glad to hear it.
Keep me posted, huh?

741
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,200
Like you said,
Jack and I go way back.

742
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,560
If there's anything I could
do for him, I would.

743
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,000
And I'm glad
nobody shot your pecker off.

744
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,440
Me, too!

745
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,400

How you feeling?

748
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,520
My husband had a heart attack...

749
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,400
and the doctors ordered him
to stay in the hospital...

750
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,200
and the nurses advised him
to stay in the hospital.

751
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,120
I pleaded with him to stay.

752
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,720
So naturally,
he's on the way home.

753
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,800
That's not what I meant.

754
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,520

762
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,760
What kind of man fucks
his dying best friend's wife?

763
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,120
Not a good one.

together since I've been sick.

of decency in you...

you'd have left this house
by now.

770

you're being blackmailed?

771
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,520
There's precious little
that Catherine doesn't know.

772
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,400
What she doesn't know,
she suspects.

773
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,240
JACK:
I'm the one that never suspects.

774
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,800
HARRY: I delivered the envelope
to Gloria last night.

775
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,600
She's lovely.

776
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,200

JACK: Good.

778
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,080
So it's over.

779
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,160
It is over, right?

780
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,960
I kept the money.

781
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,120
She's got the restaurant section
of the phone book.

782
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,720
Why? Why didn't you just do
what I asked you to do?

783
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,160
HARRY: Because the first time
I did what you asked me to...

784
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,600
somebody emptied
a nine-millimeter automatic...

785

in my direction.

786
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,800

You're fired, Harry.

It's about your old man.

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,560

a couple of weeks ago.

He didn't have a job
or any money...

823
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,640
so I gave him the keys
to the ranch house.

824

he got back on his feet.

to do, right?

to forget.

You think I'm trouble?

You don't even wanna see Gloria
when she's mad.

886
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,480
Maybe this would help.

887
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,520
Yeah.
You mind if I take a peek?

888
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,240
I already got a phone book.

You know what?

00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,680
I'm all done being pissed.

Hi, Mucho.

907
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,880
Your pally needs another
line of work besides blackmail.

908

She doesn't have the knack.

Found out he had a soft spot
for Wild Turkey.

937
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,720
He went on and on about
the old Billy Sullivan case.

Said he'd have solved it
20 years ago...

if he'd had a court order
and a bulldozer.

The way he figured it...

941
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,920
the body had to be buried
at that ranch that Ames owns...

the idea to call Mel.

Get her to let me stay
at the ranch house...

945

GLORlA: I tried to explain
we didn't need the corpse.

947
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,880
We just had to convince Ames
we knew where it was buried.

have saved my breath.

01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,560
It's OK with me.

1057
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,040
REUBEN: I don't know, man...

1058
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,880
Watching that lady die tonight--

1059
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,520
I can't get it out of my head.

1060
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,000
Yeah.

1061
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,080
I know you had been
counting on me, but--

1062
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,600
I said it was OK.

1063
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,920
REUBEN: You don't think
that I'm, like...a coward?

1064
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,640
Not for a second.

1065
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,760
I guess we can still be friends,
right?

1066
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,920
We can still--

1067
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,360
[Shovel strikes object]

1068
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,920
Harry?

1069
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,200
REUBEN: Ohh.

1070
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,120
What do we do now, Harry?

1071
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,400
Cover it up.

1072
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,600
I know I'm the one that keeps
flunking the P.I. exam...

1073
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,400
but when something
like this happens...

1074
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,720
shouldn't you call the cops?

1075
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,400
HARRY: I said cover it up.

1076
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,480
REUBEN: That's a bullet hole.
Don't you wanna know who it is?

1077
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,240
HARRY: I know who it is.

1078
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,720
The thing you just don't get
about Jack and Catherine...

1079
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,520
is they live for each other.

1080
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,920
They have the starring roles
in their own lives...

1081
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,960
and you're just a bit player.

1082
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,840
Me, too.

1083
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,480
MEL: It's their love story,
not yours.

1084
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,640
You don't get to kiss the girl
in the end.

1085
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,720
She's somebody else's girl.

1086
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,800
JACK: You'll be pleased to know
I've decided to do chemotherapy.

1087
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,280
It worked before, so...

1088
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,960
you never know.

1089
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,480
At least
I thought you'd be pleased.

1090
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,800
We found Billy Sullivan
last night...

1091
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,440
or what's left of him.

1092
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,760
I guess I've been expecting that
for 20 years.

1093
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,800
JACK: Look, you can think
what you like.

1094
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,720
It wasn't murder. It wasn't
like you murder somebody.

1095
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,600
Catherine and l
had fallen in love.

1096
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,680
As you know, Catherine's
easy to fall in love with.

1097
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,480
Eventually, Billy found out
about it and came after me.

1098
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,200
I was staying out at the ranch.

1099
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,880
Suddenly, I turn around,
and there he is...

1100
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,280
so drunk he can hardly stand up,
swearing he's going to kill me.

1101
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,640
The swimming pool was empty.

1102
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,600
You should've heard the sound
his head made...

1103
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,960
when he hit the bottom.

1104
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,520
You should've seen the way
he lay there and didn't move.

1105
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,240
One second is all it took
and his life was snuffed out.

1106
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,360
You are good.

1107
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,080
You are very good.

1108
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,880
And I would've believed you,
except I saw the corpse.

1109
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,640
What are you talking about?

1110
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,440
There's a bullet hole
in the back of his head.

1111
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,680
-That's impossible.
-Nope.

1112
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,760
Did you bother to go down
and see whether he was alive?

1113
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,520
HARRY: Of course not.

1114
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,440
There was blood and a body.
You didn't want any part of it.

1115
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,680
You wanted someone to come along
and make it all go away.

1116
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,840
So you called Raymond Hope.
What'd he say?

1117
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Told me to get out of there.

1118
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,200
And he'd come clean up the mess.

1119
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,840
But Raymond...
Iived in Los Feliz back then.

1120
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,360
It would've taken him--what--
an hour to get there?

1121
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,840
Who else did you call?

1122
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,640
If you harm her in any way...

1123
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,040
I swear I'll come back
from the grave...

1124
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,200
and I won't be in
a fucking wheelchair, either.

1125
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,480
[Puts out cigarette]

1126
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,520
Quick, come look at the sun.

1127
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,320
See it hanging there
half an inch above the horizon?

1128
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,720
Looks like it's gonna be there
forever, doesn't it?

1129
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,520
You look tired.

1130
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,920
HARRY: Yeah. I am tired.

1131
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,360
I'm tired of people
getting killed.

1132
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,280
I'm tired of being lied to.

1133
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,200
When have I lied to you?

1134
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,440
When you acted
as though you loved me.

1135
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,800
Whereas, I love my husband?
That's what I'm accused of?

1136
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,440
I never made it a secret
that I love my husband.

1137
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,040
Enough to kill for?

1138
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,440
You bet.

1139
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,200
CATHERlNE: Feel better
now that we've cleared that up?

1140
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,200
I don't feel worse.

1141
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,320
Well, then...

1142
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,000
why don't you just ask me
some more questions?

1143
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,160
Feel free.

1144
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,320
HARRY:
You'll tell me the truth?

1145
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,440
CATHERlNE: Yes.

1146
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,360
Did you kill Lester lvar?

1147
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,000
No. Next question.

1148
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,760
Did you have him killed?

1149
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,280
No. Next question.

1150
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,120
Did you kill Jeff Willis
or have him killed?

1151
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,560
No. Next.

1152
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,080
Twenty years ago...

1153
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,040
and Jack called to tell you what
happened to Billy Sullivan--

1154
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,600
Did I drive to the ranch,
find Billy still alive...

1155
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,440
put a gun to his head,
and pull the trigger?

1156
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,560
No.

1157
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,760
I said I loved my husband enough
that I would kill for him...

1158
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,080
not that I did.

1159
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,720
Now let me ask you something.

1160
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,240
Do you believe me?

1161
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,640
[Chuckles]

1162
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,960
I'll tell you what I believe.

1163
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,280
I believe that you're smart...

1164
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,960
and you're beautiful and rich.

1165
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,640
I believe that life
has worked out for you...

1166
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,840
in ways that it doesn't
for most people.

1167
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,640
I think people like you get used
to having it work out for you.

1168
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,240
After a while, you begin to...

1169
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,720
think you're entitled to all
the things you got.

1170
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,880
CATHERlNE: You think I care
about anything in this house...

1171
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,520
but my husband?

1172
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,760
CATHERlNE: You think...

1173
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:32,560
You think people like me
care so much about things...

1174
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,080
that we would kill for them?

1175
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,360
Is that what you think?

1176
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,040
That I just care about things,
Harry?

1177
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,240
Is that what you think?

1178
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,840
That I care about
all these things?

1179
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,480
All these fucking goddamned...

1180
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,160
things?

1181
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,920
Then maybe people like you...

1182
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,320
shouldn't get close
to people like me.

1183
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,920
You wanna come inside...

1184
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,880
or do you like it better
out there?

1185
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,040
When was the last time
that we went fishing?

1186
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,560
You tell me.

1187
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,040
HARRY: It's too long.

1188
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,640
Let's go.

1189
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,280
Right now, you and me,
head down to Baja.

1190
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,720
Fine.

1191
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,080
Let's have a drink first.

1192
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,040
Got ginger ale in the fridge.

1193
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,520
I'll take bourbon.

1194
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,600
Things that bad?

1195
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,200
You said I might learn something
I didn't want to know.

1196
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,200
Catherine.

1197
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,000
RAYMOND:
You going to turn her in?

1198
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,840
HARRY: I thought about it...

1199
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,400
then I decided
to go fishing instead.

1200
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,480
RAYMOND: That would be
the sensible thing.

1201
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,880
I mean, screw it.

1202
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,840
Everybody pretty much got
what they deserved.

1203
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,720
If we leave soon, we could
be deep in Baja by morning.

1204
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,080
We ought to take the Explorer.
Your beater will never make it.

1205
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,160
Lester lvar was a crooked cop.

1206
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,840
It's my hunch he was
trying to shake Jack down.

1207
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,200
RAYMOND: The marlin
are running about now.

1208
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,800
I know a guy
who'll take us out...

1209
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,360
for 80 bucks a day
and a case of American beer.

1210
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,200
But the funny thing...

1211
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,240
is that...

1212
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,240
you know,
Lester lived in a rat hole.

1213
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,520
You'd think
if he was on the take, he'd...

1214
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,800
You'd think he'd have a place
that would be more like...

1215
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,280
more like this.

1216
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,040
You haven't touched your drink.

1217
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,080
HARRY:
Raymond, this is not easy...

1218
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,520
but you did a lot more
than clean up Jack's mess...

1219
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,880
didn't you?

1220
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,520
Not a lot more.

1221
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,840
Sullivan was going to wind up...

1222
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,920
in a wheelchair
the rest of his life.

1223
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,800
I ended his misery, Harry.
I did him a favor.

1224
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,280
You see, I think...

1225
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,960
that on that long drive
out to the ranch...
