1
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,455
(Speaking Russian)

2
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:06,975
(Door creaks)

3
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:13,893
(Laughter)

4
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,975
(Chatter and laughter)

5
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:15,853
(Bustling traffic)

6
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,415
(Mutters)

7
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:19,493
All right:

8
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:21,774
- (Screaming)
- I know, I know, I know.

9
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:25,419
A gun:
It's dangerous for no one except you.

10
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,103
You know what I want, don 't you?

11
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:29,338
Yes.

12
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:32,419
You're wasting time.
Don 't fuck with me:

13
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:35,459
Open it. Open it:

14
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,252
Open it:

15
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,936
- Give me what I want.
- I don 't understand, I don 't have anything else.

16
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,544
If the man 's offering you
all that money, I'd take it.

17
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,581
When I need financial advice,
I'll call my broker.

18
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,580
- I'm just saying, is all.
- Whatever.

19
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:13,263
Take off your coat.
Take off your coat:

20
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,863
- Now, how hard was that?
- Excuse me.

21
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:29,179
Mister, I thought I told...

22
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,213
What the?

23
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:36,972
(Screaming)

24
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,574
Go, go: Move: Everybody down:

00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,217

27
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,813
Go, go, go:

28
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:04,821
Suspect white or Hispanic male.
Wearing a reflective vest.

29
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,173
He's on top of the cars.
All units at Vernon Jackson.

30
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,540
- Everybody down:
- (Screaming)

31
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:19,819
Other end:

32
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:22,773
(Screaming)

33
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,461
(Groans)

34
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,018

Move, move: Everybody down:
Face down on the platform:

37
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,734
Come on, face down:
Everybody off the train:

38
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,537
Come on, face down: Get down:

39
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,495
(Shouting)

40
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:27,933
- Officer...
- Move:

41
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,895
Come on, guys, get down:

42
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,253
Y owww! Aaccoe odoowwwn! GGoet odoowwwn!

43
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:35,182
Get down: Search the tracks:

44
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:38,534
He went down the tunnel?
Check the tunnel, check the roof.

45
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:47,293
Come on, people:
Face down on the ground now:

46
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,097
(Man) He jumped: He was on the roof:

47
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:53,500
(Policeman)
This train is closed. Nobody gets on.

48
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:55,660
Sir, I need you to calm down.

49
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,615
Get these people moving.

50
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,615
Stop right there.

51
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,294
The punk's got balls...

52
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,494
but no positive identification.

53
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:18,456
No. There's another camera
pointing at the platform.

54
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,703
Michaels, stop it right there.

55
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,097
You see what I see?

56
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:31,578
- Maybe.
- That's him, lieutenant.

57
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,659
That's who?

58
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:35,582
- How long have you been a detective?
- 11 months, sir.

59
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,376
I'm 22 years in robbery and homicide.

60
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:40,541
One of your subcategories
of robbery is art theft.

61
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:43,815
There's a lot of that in the Apple.
Are you aware of that, Michaels?

62
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,422
- I guess so, yeah.
- I wasn 't.

63
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:48,103
When I was your age, I was happy
with regular murder and mayhem.

64
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,704
Lieutenant Weber
minored in art history at Fordham.

65
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:51,733
Oh.

66
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,537
Anyway, the Chief
starts calling me Lieutenant Picasso

67
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,223
and puts me in charge
every time there is the theft

68
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,697
of as much as an Etch A Sketch.

69
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:02,578
Two decades,
I've been putting 'em all away.

70
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:05,263
Everybody but him, Keith Ripley.

71
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:08,455
He's the best there is. Howdy, Keith.

72
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,378
You've been bad boy.

73
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:43,381
- Perhaps I could give you 15.
- No.

74
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,016
That is not possible.

75
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:46,702
I wouldn 't take less than 100.

76
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:47,893
(Sighs)

77
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,379
I'm just saying, is all.

78
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,654
- You...
- Mind if I borrow this?

79
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:57,934
- Well, I may have wanted to use it.
- Mm.

80
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,497
But yours will do:

81
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,063
Will you please put down my gun?

82
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:04,937
There's one thing
you should be aware of, Gabriel,

83
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,293
or do you prefer Seññor Martin?

84
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:09,938
The police cannot arrest you
for armed robbery,

85
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,383
if your gun isn 't loaded.

86
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:12,573
Your point?

87
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:15,218
You think I'd walk around
with a loaded shotgun?

88
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,095
- Let's see.
- (Gun clicks)

89
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,857
- You could have checked.
- Why?

90
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:24,260
You have my diamonds,
my score, my money.

91
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,898
Enjoy: Nice meeting you both: Bye:

92
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:31,299
By the way,
I was going to ask for 125.

93
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:35,057
I am just saying, is all.

94
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:37,095
- Gabriel, stay.
- Why?

95
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,817
What else do you want?
You gonna shoot me now?

96
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:43,260
Well, in as much as
you did steal the diamonds,

97
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:46,660
I figure it's only fair
to share the proceeds with you.

98
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:49,218
So to what do I owe
this act of generosity?

99
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,702
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss with you.

100
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,097
So...

101
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:01,180
how did you know
I would come here,

102
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,577
as well as my name?

103
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,216
It's part of the proposition...

104
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,333
(Tyres screech)

105
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:08,142
Oh, shit:

106
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:12,177
- Come on:
- All right, take it easy, take it easy.

107
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:15,376
Nicky would like his money.

108
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,855
- Ask him.
- Thank you:

109
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:23,778
This is between you and them:
Got nothing to do with me:

110
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,860
Everything does now.

111
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:31,136
Call this interest.
Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

112
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,173
(Speaks Russian)

113
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:34,620
(Groans)

114
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,935
(Tyres screech)

115
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:43,854
You must have very bad karma.

116
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,737
I actually don 't believe in it.
Still, about this propo...

117
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:50,493
No, no, no, no:
You are totally out of your mind:

118
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,102
Good night:

119
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,378
(Groans)

120
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,823
- Hey.
- What?

121
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,741
Here's your karma.

122
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:06,383
- What was in the other envelope?
- Your cut.

123
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,618
Y owww yyoouuvvoe ggoot mmm noe

124
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:13,892
Whatever.

125
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:16,538
- Think about it.
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

126
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,982
(Sighs)

127
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,576
Hmm.

128
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,453
Y owww wwwmaat odoo yyoouu wwwaant??

129
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,617
A partner.

130
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,735
What do you think
I was doing on that train?

131
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:59,223
- I was watching you work.
- Hm.

132
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:02,574
I've been your shadow
ever since you got to town.

133
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:06,299
So why were you in my town
robbing subways?

134
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,580
It's hurricane season in Miami.
I don 't like hurricanes.

135
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,422
Or you didn 't feel like
going back to Angola.

136
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,935
It's over. Lesson learned.

137
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,303
Look...

138
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:20,141
Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

139
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,257
So why were you holding
open -mike night on the subway

140
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,896
for a lousy 100 grand?

141
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,539
Wwwoo rroeaasssoonsss

142
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,973
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

143
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,333
And perhaps you can relate to this.

144
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,412
Sometimes...

145
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,334
Sometimes you just need
to feel the rush.

146
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,861
The juice.

147
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,383
Yeah.

148
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,857
You know what I mean.

149
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:50,095
Yesterday,
you took down two jewellers

150
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:52,135
for a few stones from Romanov's.

151
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,818
My idea is Romanov's itself.

152
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:58,094
(Sniggers) Please:

153
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:02,422
Specifically, two Fabergé eggs
worth $20 million.

154
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,262
Each.

155
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,182
It's a two-man job.

156
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,855
Do I have your attention?

157
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,900
(Bustling traffic)

158
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,213
Wait here.

159
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:40,055
I hear they prefer cash...
or your first-born.

160
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,899
Why don 't you try
The Standard instead?

161
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,095
Jealous?

162
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,372
Of who?

163
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,576
The mystery bandit.

164
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,058
I'm afraid that type of thing
is not my style.

165
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:24,263
Well, I think this guy's
got panache, guts.

166
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,821
And a passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

167
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,536
(Laughs)

168
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,701
Well, you don 't have
to rob trains to have panache.

169
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:38,056
Or guts. But you've gotta admit that
kind of thing immediately brands you.

170
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,494
(Speaks Russian)

171
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:46,299
My treat. Too painful watching you
attempt to read Cyrillic.

172
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:49,302
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just looking at the picture.

173
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:50,618
So you are jealous.

174
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,416
Yes. You got me there. Absolutely.

175
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,420
(They laugh)

176
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,217
I've gotta get
this Chinese food to my boss

177
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,220
so, um...

178
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,220
some other time.

179
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,017
- When some other time?
- I'll call you.

180
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:11,056
But you don 't have my number
or know my name or anything.

181
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,457
I guess that could be a problem.

182
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,573
(Ripley) Gabriel:

183
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,863
- Oh, shit:
- Are you with him?

184
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,974
I don 't know. Should I? More or less.

185
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,333
Er... yes, I am.

186
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,817
What do you want?

187
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,219
Can 't I bring my goddaughter
a birthday present?

188
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:27,663
My birthday was last month.

189
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:30,172
It was two weeks ago
and I'm sorry it's late.

190
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:33,739
Alex, it's just a present.
No strings.

191
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:36,213
No thanks.

192
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,540
It was nice to have almost met you, Gabriel.

193
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,142
- Gaby.
- Gaby.

194
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:46,384
It's a shame you don 't keep
a higher class of company.

195
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:56,373
- Don 't even think about it.
- Think about what?

196
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:59,382
Going anywhere near her.
I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

197
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:02,655
It looks like it's your heart
she's not so fond of.

198
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,536
You were warned. Let's go.

199
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,535
(Gabriel) I thought you said
the target was Romanov's.

200
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:11,462
- This is research.
- Research?

201
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:12,983
Oh, wow:

202
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,135
They're absolutely stunning.

203
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,661
(Ripley) They are.

204
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:27,457
Between 1885 and 1916,

205
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,655
Fabergé produced 50
of these Easter eggs for the Empress

206
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,172
and her daughter-in -law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

207
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,055
Should I take notes?

208
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,935
Will there be a quiz?

209
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:40,101
No quiz but there will be a test.

210
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:45,537
OK. The Fabergés are all made
of precious metals and fine jewels.

211
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:49,213
- Every one a unique masterpiece.
- Indeed.

212
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:51,494
Most are on display in the Kremlin.

213
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:55,219
The rest in private collections,
museums or lost.

214
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,653
In this case, at Romanov's.

215
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,660
Who is your buyer?

216
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,296
You don 't want to know.

217
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:05,495
Oh, I'm stealing $40 million worth
of eggs so I want to know.

218
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,978
I also want to know
why these particular eggs

219
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:09,616
are even worth $40 million.

220
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,418
Because no one knows they exist.

221
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:15,543
Oh.

222
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,496
- The so-called mystery eggs?
- Mm-hm.

223
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:22,457
Yeah, I've heard rumours,
but I thought it was just a myth.

224
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:26,975
Last year, they turned up.
At Romanov's.

225
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,776
So how do you know this?

226
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:33,420
I was partners with a man named
Victor Korolenko. Alex's father.

227
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,216
He was in tight with the Russians.

228
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,937
What they knew, he knew.

229
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,623
So why aren 't you
pulling this job with him?

230
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:43,337
Let's just say he's no longer around.

231
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,534
Leave it at that.

232
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,057
He's gone.

233
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,583
You're here.

234
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,776
Now we just have to deliver.

235
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:00,779
- Ripley...
- Hmm?

236
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:01,813
Why?

237
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:04,783
Why risk your freedom at all?

238
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:07,855
This will not be
anything close to easy.

239
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,815
You are not in jail in the present.

240
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:13,174
- Are you not comfortable?
- I'm never comfortable.

241
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:16,977
Some people
were born to compose music.

242
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,056
Others to split the atom.

243
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:25,094
I was born to steal shit.

244
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,022
Hold out your hand.

245
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,573
Hand?

246
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:40,293
That coin was given to me by Victor
when we became partners.

247
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,778
The coin represents
a Russian phrase.

248
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:47,944
<i>Vorovoslky mlr</i>
Loosely translated, thieves' world.

249
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,337
Victor belonged to it.

250
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:51,612
Y owww

251
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,501
you belong to it.

252
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,819
Psst. Hey:

253
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:37,459
You misunderstand.
Ripley's just business.

254
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,301
This is...

255
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,743
Stalking?

256
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:45,494
Well, if you had given me your number,
I would have called first.

257
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:49,702
Those are two very flawed assumptions.

258
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,302
Do you have a vase?

259
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:53,221
I just took these
from a roadside shrine

260
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,983
and I think they need some water.

261
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:01,778
May I use that... thing over there?
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:08,336
I've noticed this Russian nightclub
down the block.

263
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:10,261
Riga Rose or something like that.

264
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,340
Why don 't we meet there after work?

265
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,092
I'm busy.

266
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:23,261
- I'll wait.
- I won 't show.

267
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,101
I'll take my chances.

268
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:31,376
<i>Do svldanja,</i> Alexandra.

269
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:36,336
Research. Keith Ripley.
'93, the Brooklyn Museum.

270
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,182
'94, the Diamond District Warehouse
and then in '95...

271
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

272
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:45,775
In fact, I busted him twice.

273
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:48,258
Both times he walked
because of good lawyering.

274
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:51,137
Exactly, so I thought
why not swing for the fences?

275
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,015
Murder one, Victor Korolenko.

276
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:55,862
Thinkin ' of the Brighton Beach steam bath?
Forget it. There was no...

277
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:58,737
- No body. But we've got a ton of forensics.
- And no witnesses.

278
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,696
Nobody there admitted
to seeing a thing.

279
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:05,100
I was this close to convincing
Korolenko to take witness protection,

280
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:07,339
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

281
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,852
But Ripley got to him first.

282
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:11,462
I can 't prove it.

283
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,654
Right, OK. I see, I see. OK.

284
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:16,582
No, what you don 't see, Michaels,

285
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,457
is why Ripley got involved
in a small-time caper,

286
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,621
like grabbin ' a few diamonds
off of some couriers on a subway.

287
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:23,699
And neither did I.

288
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,019
Until I read
the Dutch guy's statement.

289
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:29,935
Those diamonds came from Romanov's.

290
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:34,859
You mean Ripley and his new partner
are planning to take down Romanov's?

291
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,584
Ah, come on:
Like that could ever happen:

292
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,422
Not even Ripley
could take down a place like that.

293
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,613
Wanna bet?

294
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,656
(¶ Dance music)

295
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:15,700
- You know this place very well.
- I never said I didn 't.

297
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:17,894
Let's face it,
you didn 't see the nightclub.

298
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:21,539
You saw the flyer in the fax
and then you made an assumption.

299
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:24,656
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

300
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,583
Never assume anything,
especially down here.

301
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,092
- How mysterious.
- What?

302
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,738
(Shouts) How mysterious:

303
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:35,979
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I don 't drink.

304
00:23:36,024 --> 00:23:38,140
Another assumption.

305
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,862
You wanna dance?

306
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,059
Yeah.

307
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:50,094
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.
Why not?

308
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,421
(Alex speaks Russian) Here.

309
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:49,776
- And for him.
- Thank you.

310
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,018
Thanks.

311
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:52,702
I thought all Russians drank.

312
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:55,895
(Laughs) Translation,
we're a race of suicidal alcoholics.

313
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,253
No: I didn 't mean that: No.

314
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:00,659
Actually, we are. Cheers.

(Laughter)

318
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:10,543
So... how is it...
working for the lawyer?

319
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,422
- Huh, I'm a lawyer, too, you know.
- Oh.

- Well, you don 't know until you try.
- True.

322
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,782
Besides, my father warned me
about being a lawyer.

323
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:27,896
He told me I should try and do
something honest with my life.

324
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,219
As if he would know.

325
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:34,177
Your father and Ripley,
they were close, right?

326
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,742
Once upon a time.

327
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:44,133
I'm sure Ripley told you.
My father's dead.

328
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,059
Now Ripley likes
to try to take care of me.

329
00:25:49,104 --> 00:25:51,299
Pay for stuff. That kind of thing.

330
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:54,943
Of course, it's the least he can do.

331
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:58,622
Sorry. I don 't mean to pry.

332
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,176
(Laughs)

333
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,782
Yes, you do.

00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:07,576
(Laughs)

335
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:10,700
Now who is making assumptions?

336
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:15,699
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

337
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:33,102
You wanna know about Ripley?

338
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:37,057
Stay away.

339
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:08,979
(Knocking)

340
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,902
You son of a bitch:

341
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,095
Well... you dropped these

342
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:25,137
and I am a gentleman
bringing them back to you.

343
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,015
Uh-huh.

344
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:32,896
No, no, no, no, no:

345
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:36,498
No:

00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:27,339
Shit, man: What do you want?

348
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,581
I told you to leave her alone.

349
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:34,344
I'm not gonna tell you again.

350
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:37,376
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

351
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:46,377
Son of a bitch.

352
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:52,212
Fascinating.

353
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,897
You could start a whole new trend
in interior design.

354
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,572
- What are these?
- What do they look like?

355
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:03,977
Police IDs?

356
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:08,134
There's a reception at Romanov's
tonight, honouring the NYPD.

357
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,183
And our invitation 's just arrived.

358
00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:13,498
A cop for the night.

359
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,104
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

360
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:19,022
Meanwhile, however,
Ineed you to go to the dry-cleaners.

361
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:22,500
Why don 't you go and pick up
your dry-cleaning yourself, sir?

362
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,421
Who said anything about picking up?

363
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,418
You're dropping off.

364
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,939
(Speaks Vietnamese)

365
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:44,052
(Speaks Vietnamese)

366
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,022
Cellphone, please.

367
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,375
- Commissioner Rawls.
- Gentlemen.

368
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:40,335
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

369
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,215
Such a pleasure having you here.

370
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,732
May we give you gentlemen
the grand tour?

371
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:46,934
- The secrets of Romanov?
- You might say so.

372
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:48,815
- Thank you. We're honoured.
- Please.

373
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:56,938
(Ripley) The guards, all FSB secret police.

374
00:30:56,984 --> 00:31:00,215
Every door, every inch of glass
wired and alarmed.

375
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:04,052
So even if a bird flies in here,
you know about it.

376
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:06,502
Topkapi.

377
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:07,943
Rififi.

378
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:11,772
No, the bird flew into the museum,
landed on the wire

379
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:14,179
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

380
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,657
You're a cineaste.

381
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:18,172
Actually, I only see heist movies.

382
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:23,135
Well, the lesson to take away
from the bird flying into the museum

383
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:27,700
is no matter how well you planned,
always be ready to improvise

384
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,702
because, I guarantee you,
something's gonna go wrong.

385
00:31:30,744 --> 00:31:33,383
- I'd prefer to avoid that.
- Uh-huh.

386
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,860
How comprehensive
is the surveillance system?

387
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,223
Let's take a look.

388
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,702
(Speaks Russian)

389
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:01,178
- Smart card for the elevator.
- And all the doors.

390
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:02,896
This way. After you.

391
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:04,333
We're on.

392
00:32:07,264 --> 00:32:09,698
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

393
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:14,255
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

394
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:18,659
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is a serious crime.

395
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,502
- And quite an embarrassing one in this case.
- Really?

396
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,262
Do you realise how ashamed I felt

397
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:26,740
telling that nice lady at the door
that I was still a lieutenant?

398
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:28,695
I mean at my age?

399
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:30,382
Or should I say at your age?

400
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:33,541
I'm not amused.
What are you doing here?

401
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,894
And why did you appropriate my invitation?
As if I didn 't know.

402
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:39,014
I apologise for the subterfuge.

403
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:42,773
I just wanted to show my friend here
some of the finer things in life.

404
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:46,737
If you want to arrest us for impersonating
police officers, go right ahead.

405
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:49,093
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out in two hours.

406
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:52,295
It'd be a delightful two hours.
Get your hands down:

407
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:55,780
Then there's all that explaining
you'd have to do to your superiors.

408
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:57,735
Now that would be an embarrassment.

409
00:32:57,784 --> 00:33:02,494
Notorious thief gaining admittance
pretending to be you.

410
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,863
Great police work, Weber.

411
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:06,577
We should discuss my police work
when this is all over.

412
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:07,977
Hmm.

413
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:11,460
- Who's your sidekick?
- Jules Dassin.

414
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:15,861
Good to meet you, Jules.
I love your movies.

415
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,815
Enjoy the party, gents.

416
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:19,855
While it lasts.

417
00:33:22,024 --> 00:33:26,336
Now... do you mind telling me
what that was all about?

418
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:29,740
- Just a cop.
- Really? No kidding.

419
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:34,899
We have been made in the very place
we are supposed to take down.

420
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:37,299
Exactly how do you stay out of jail?

421
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:42,338
Unless, of course, you and this Weber
are partners trying to set me up.

422
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:45,336
Are you, Ripley?

423
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,338
Here we go.

424
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:51,022
Come on: Move your damn ass:

425
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:57,613
Weber has no idea
what we're here for.

426
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,097
Of course he does.

427
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:01,214
He doesn 't know when
and he doesn 't know how.

428
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,061
And, no, he doesn 't know
about the eggs.

429
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:04,696
No one does. Here.

430
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,257
The best way to neutralise Weber

431
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,738
is to fuel his obsession
with busting me.

432
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,173
He's so blinded by it, he no longer
thinks like a cop. Trust me.

433
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:15,454
Give me a good reason to, huh?

434
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,382
I already gave you
40 million good reasons. Here.

435
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:22,941
Now you've seen what the public sees,
it's time for the real treat.

436
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:26,693
That is, of course, as long as you
promise not to come back and rob us.

437
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,655
I guess I won 't take any notes, then.

438
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:29,932

441
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,453
Even with the knowledge
of all protocols,

442
00:34:38,504 --> 00:34:40,893
it is absolutely impregnable.

443
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:43,936
The voice sensors ask
our head of security, Boris Sergeev,

444
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:46,020
a random set of pre-recorded words.

445
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,976
But this is only half the process.

446
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:53,097
We also have
a biometric handprint sensor.

447
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:56,454
Since Mr Sergeev and I
are the only ones who have clearance,

448
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:58,734
we must both be present
to open the vaults.

449
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:01,776
Once I activate
the biometric handprint sensor,

450
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:04,099
he must activate the voice sensor.

451
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,942
This way neither of us
can steal from the other.

452
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:09,498
Well, you better hope Mr Sergeev
stays healthy.

But, I'm afraid, whoever tried
wouldn 't even have half a second

467
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:07,054
because an ultrasonic motion detector
would automatically lock him in

468

to the reception.

476

What the fuck?

495
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:08,734
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley,
special agent in charge of this op.

496
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:11,582
You're conducting
an investigation of a potential theft

497
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,058
that you assume is going down
at Romanov Jewellers.

498
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,015
Assume, my ass.

499
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,976
I know it's going down
and I know who's pulling it off.

500
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,618
Except we're asking you
to call off your dogs.

501
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:23,700
There are other matters
that take precedence.

502
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,462
What could possibly take precedence

503
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,098
over the potential theft
of millions of dollars in diamonds

504
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:32,137
from a company that donates tons of money
and equipment to the NYPD?

505
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,656
Valentin?

506
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:37,422
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

507
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:41,093
was the right-hand man
to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

508
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:46,263
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent
Russian diamond centre in America.

509
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:48,653
Roommmaanoovv'sss

510
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:53,863
But diamonds...
they're not all that he's shipping over here.

511
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:55,940
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury.

512
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:58,054
Gold, gems, artworks.

513
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:00,941
Where do you think
Romanov's got the money

514
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:04,533
to buy your department a helicopter
and now police cars?

515
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:06,302
From retail diamond sales?

516
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,381
- So why are they doing this?
- Is that a serious question?

517
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:13,419
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

518
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,773
That's their mindset.

519
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,859
We need more time
to build our mutual cases.

520
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:23,338
That's why we can 't have
any other investigations

521
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:25,454
potentially alerting Zykov.

522
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:31,622
Lieutenant...

523
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:33,893
shut it down.

524
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:38,858
- Gentlemen.
- Commissioner...

525
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:43,896
(Clears throat) Just in case
you think you're smarter than us,

526
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:46,981
decide to continue this investigation
on a down and low,

527
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,173
forget it.

528
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,933
This is bigger than you and your ego.
Do you get it?

529
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,663
I get it.

530
00:39:57,904 --> 00:40:01,658
- What did the feds have to say?
- Nothing. Everything's still a go.

531
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:07,139
(Ripley) The first order of business
is to bypass the security cameras.

532
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:09,937
(Martin) If we can gain access
into the surveillance system,

533
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,216
we can replace the light feed
with a continuous loop of study shots

534
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:16,255
with no face inside.

535
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,215
That still leaves the voice sensors,

536
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:21,142
the fingerprints,
the motion detectors,

537
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,301
the meanest-looking vault door
I have ever seen in my life.

538
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:48,657
(Ripley) The inner vault door,
Swiss-made, 3 feet thick,

539
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:50,899
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

540
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:53,419
If you punch out the lock,
they block retraction

541
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:56,137
so that you couldn 't open it
even if you knew the combination.

542

544
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:04,661
30 pre-recorded words.
One week, we've got them all.

00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:05,898
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

546
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:08,538
Yes, we're going to be doing
some maintenance work

547
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:11,144
in the subway adjacent
to your basement next week.

548
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:14,972
We'll be working nights
and didn 't want the drilling to alarm you.

549
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,300
(Squeaking)

550
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:37,657
You place
an ultrasonic transducer here,

551
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,253
broadcasting at the exact operating
frequency of the transmitter

552
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:44,137
and it bounces back
the frequency to the unit.

553
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,902
At least in theory.

554
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:48,617
Have you ever used
an ultrasonic transducer?

555
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:49,892
Nope.

556
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:52,378
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

557
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:53,982
I can get anything, my friend.

558
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:58,176
- Can you get past a keypad?
- It is, as always, a question of time.

559
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,976
One tumbler at a time.

560
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:03,937
It is tight but possible.

561
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,375
(Speaking Russian)

562
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:21,459
You.

563
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:24,376
Yeah.

564
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:25,652
Me.

565
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:31,493
(Laughs)

566
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:35,696
What's so funny?

567
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:39,093
I hate Chinese food.

568
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:42,614
I absolutely, unequivocally,

569
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:44,655

570
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:47,423
loathe Chinese food.

571
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:49,213
Oh:

572
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:53,177
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to Chinese food.

573
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:54,737
(Laughs)

574
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:56,422
I can 't even stand the smell.

575
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:59,501
Another completely wrong assumption.

576
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,897
No.

577
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:04,060
It's not completely...

578
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:05,139
wrong.

579
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:11,653
What?

580
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:20,493
Wow:

581
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,016
- You stole this.
- Yes, I did.

582
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,101
- Didn 't you?
- Yes. That's what I do.

583
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:16,577
Wait.

584
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,255
(Hums)

585
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:49,975
We have a problem.

586
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:52,936
The bracelet?

587
00:44:54,264 --> 00:44:55,492
I cannot return it.

588
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:57,614
(Laughs)

589
00:44:57,664 --> 00:45:00,053
No, I like it.

590
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,858
So what could possibly be a problem?

591
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,338
(Sighs) You.

592
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:08,816
- What?
- Me.

593
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:11,458
I thought that part
was not a problem.

594
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:14,337
(Laughs) And Ripley.

595
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:15,817
That part is a problem.

596
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:20,174
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just can 't trust.

597
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,742
How did your father die?

598
00:45:27,664 --> 00:45:29,780
By gunshot.

599
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:31,860
Who did it?

600
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:36,182
He had gambling debts to a Russian gangster
named Nicky Petrovich.

601
00:45:38,064 --> 00:45:39,975
- Nicky wants his money.
- Ask him.

605
00:45:50,024 --> 00:45:53,380
Why would they kill your father
and let Ripley live?

606
00:45:54,624 --> 00:45:58,333
Because Ripley has... I don 't know.
How do you want me to put this?

607
00:45:58,384 --> 00:45:59,419

I wanna be with you

and you can 't promise me a thing so...

612
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:23,695
maybe we shouldn 't even try.

613
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:34,062
Oh, you, you, you, you.

614
00:46:37,624 --> 00:46:38,898
Get in.

615
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:52,099
I know you don 't want to,
I know you don 't mean to, but you will hurt her.

616
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:53,941
She doesn 't need any more of that.

617
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:59,377
None of which you had
anything to do with. Am I right?

618
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:02,659
Is there something
you want to ask me?

619
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:05,857
Yes.

620
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:10,139
Why is Victor dead
and you're still walking round?

621
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:16,737
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was in deep
to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

624
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,659
- Victor backed out?
- He was trying to protect Alex.

625
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:28,697
Made a deal with Weber.
He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

626
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,939
- And you.
- And me.

627
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,418
Weber offered Victor witness protection.

628
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:35,500
He and Alex,
but Alex didn 't want to go.

629
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:38,661
Victor didn 't want to go without her so...

630
00:47:38,704 --> 00:47:40,535
he bought a bullet instead.

631
00:47:40,584 --> 00:47:44,543
So why is this still your problem?
Why don 't you just leave?

632
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:48,896
You don 't make a deal with Nicky
for the throw of it and then walk away.

633
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:52,778
There's no statute of limitations.
Nicky wants those eggs.

634
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:54,701
Victor's share would have paid off his debt.

635
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:59,736
Victor and I were partners.
He was responsible for me.

636
00:47:59,784 --> 00:48:03,254
So now I'm responsible for him
and his debt.

637
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,373
Bullshit.

638
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,461
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

639
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:11,302
- That's not an option.
- Oh, wow: This is just...

640
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:14,183
Look...

641
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,299
We do the job.

642
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:19,982
Nicky gets his cut,
I take a small chunk,

643
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:23,061
nowhere near commensurate
with my risk,

644
00:48:23,104 --> 00:48:24,776
and you clear a cool 20 million.

645
00:48:24,824 --> 00:48:27,577
I don 't know. This is just...

646
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:30,855
Look, either we pull
this job off flawlessly

647
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:33,896
or you call Weber
and you ask for witness protection,

648
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,457
which isn 't a choice at all

649
00:48:35,504 --> 00:48:37,779
because Nicky will find you
and he will kill you.

650
00:48:37,824 --> 00:48:40,657
It doesn 't matter where you go
or how long it takes.

651
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,097
That's an unalterable fact.

652
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:50,937
(Laughs)

653
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:53,417
Well...

654
00:48:58,024 --> 00:49:01,141
Then we steal the fucking eggs, no?

655
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:03,419
Yes.

656
00:49:06,984 --> 00:49:08,497
Oh, shit:

657
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:14,612
All right, we are working on it.
So back off, please. Thank you.

658
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:16,859
I think he called us a name.

659
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:21,060
We do not like to be insulted.

660
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:24,378
All right:

661
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:17,063
(Whispers)

662
00:50:40,544 --> 00:50:42,580
Do you know
the significance of this coin?

663
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:45,939
Yeah.

664
00:50:48,104 --> 00:50:52,177
Then you must know by the mere fact
that you have it in your possession,

665
00:50:52,224 --> 00:50:56,854
I cannot assume the two of you
will not attempt to double-cross me.

666
00:50:56,904 --> 00:51:00,817
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you, Nicky.
We've been trying to...

667
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:05,415
(Ripley) Nicky...

668
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:10,220
- Alex... l'm so sorry.
- Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren 't we?

669
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,973
There's no reason
for you to bring her here.

670
00:51:14,024 --> 00:51:17,334
The fact that you gave
that coin to him

671
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:19,978
tells me there are many reasons,

672
00:51:20,024 --> 00:51:22,379
but only one I care about.

673
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:24,221
Why would we try to betray you?

674
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:28,143
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps,

675
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:29,856
a misguided sense of revenge.

676
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:32,941
His, perhaps, simply greed.

677
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:35,498
It doesn 't matter.

678
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:37,933
I will not take the chance
of the two of you

679
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:42,136
taking what is rightfully mine
and selling it to the highest bidder.

680
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:47,494
Please, excuse me, Mr Petrovich...

681
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,660
Will you please? Thank you.

682
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:54,095
Where is it written
that these eggs are yours?

683
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:59,141
Because they belong to my family.

684
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:05,214
Because my great-grandfather
made them.

685
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:08,982
Yes, Ripley.
Evgenly Petrovich made them.

686
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:10,696
(Mutters in Russian)

687
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:17,812
He made the 1917 mystery eggs.

688
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:20,739
I will have those eggs.

689
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:24,060
And you will get them for me.

690
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:28,938
That's why I bring Alexandra here.

691
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:32,181
To keep me company while you do
what you need to do.

692
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:35,499
Go.

693
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:44,300
Anyone tries to follow us, she dies.

694
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:47,376
You'd better believe she dies.

695
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:51,539
If I don 't get what I want...

696
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,533
she dies.

697
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:57,172
Go.

698
00:52:57,224 --> 00:52:59,294
There is a subway not far.

699
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:05,016
Damn you, Gabriel:

700
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:07,774
I told you not to get her involved:

701
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,815
You told me? You told me?

702
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:13,015
You and her father got her involved
even before she was born:

703
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,578
Goddamn it: We go tomorrow.

704
00:55:24,224 --> 00:55:25,213
How much time?

705
00:55:26,304 --> 00:55:28,534

Hell, look around you. Take what you want.

01:10:03,641 --> 01:10:06,075
Oh, shut up and give me the box.

814
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:10,041
What about Alex?
Nicky will kill her. You know that.

815
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,719
I will ask you one more time.

816
01:10:13,801 --> 01:10:16,793
- Why are you doing this?
- (Sighs)

817
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:17,910
I'm a cop.

In Miami for the last ten years.

819
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:24,600
Weber requested me. Just for you.

821
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:31,557
So you're a cop.
You wanna arrest me? Go ahead.

822
01:10:31,601 --> 01:10:33,353
Where am I gonna go?

823
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:37,155
But in one minute that vault door's gonna lock
and we'll be stuck in here

824
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:39,112
and Alex is gonna be dead.

825
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:41,800
I can 't believe you're such
a contemptible human being

826
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:44,435
that you would use her like that
and then just kill her

827
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:46,870
cos you might as well
be pulling the trigger yourself.

828
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:49,560
Simply to bag the great Keith Ripley.

829
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:53,395
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

How do I find Nicky?

832

Phone number in my pocket.

833
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:04,832
Give it to me and the eggs.

834
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:09,035
- Do you want her alive or not?
- Do you?

835
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:22,234
(Sighs)

836
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:23,270
Ten seconds.

837
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:26,510

842
01:12:44,321 --> 01:12:47,199
I'm a police officer: Listen to me:

843
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:49,152
There is a thief
locked in your inner vault:

844
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:51,431
The guard is in the basement closet:

Y owww!

849
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:05,678
OK. Fine.

850
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:09,875
Put them down:

853
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:18,078
Kick them. Now:

854
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:23,032
What do you want?

855
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:26,198
You let me out the front door
so I can rejoin my unit.

856
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:28,197
They have the building surrounded.

857
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:31,711
Meantime, you go downstairs,
you find your thief and your comrade.

858
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:34,321
- You understand?
- That door is alarmed.

859
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:35,874
You have a problem, solve it:

860
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:38,196
Do not make me
shoot this man, please:

861
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,992
(Alarm rings)

862
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:18,076
- Put down your weapons.
- We are police:

863
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:21,352
Yeah? Everybody's police tonight.

864

865
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:28,870

01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:56,596
Can we talk?
I have a proposition for you.

868
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:08,390

01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:17,478
Do not move.
He has a gun behind the box.

870
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:18,590
Bad boy.

871
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,713
Give me the box
and give Andrei your weapon, please.

872
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:23,194
We don 't wish trouble here.

873
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:24,993
No, no, no. You don 't understand.

874
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:27,509
You let her go,
then I'll give you the box.

875
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:31,315
You see, if I fire through this box,

876
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:33,750
which I have no problem
doing whatsoever,

877
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:35,439
N cckyy'sss noot ggoonnaa booe vvoerryy maapopoyy

878
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:37,119
Then we are all expendable.

879
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:40,432
If you understand
the meaning of the word.

880
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:41,800
Open the box.

881
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,517
Lower the gun. Lower the gun.

882
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,472
Lower it.

883
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,316
OK.

884
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:04,311
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm just lovely. Thanks.

885
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:06,591
You go.

886
01:16:14,401 --> 01:16:15,436
Give me the box.

887
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:20,792
- Get in.
- Why?

888
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:22,354
N cckyy wwwaantsss too sssoeoe yyoouu

889
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:25,875
Give me your weapon.

890
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:28,840
We're fine, right?

891
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:40,520
Where do you get off detaining us?

892
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:42,279
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

893
01:16:42,321 --> 01:16:44,994
My security were,
understandably, confused.

894
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:47,680
Please go with Mr Sergeev
down to the vault.

895
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:49,791
We have what you want. Please.

896
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:03,280
- Where's the other one?
- Nobody else. Just him.

897
01:17:03,321 --> 01:17:04,993
Where the hell's my man?

898
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:11,196
Lieutenant, your personal life,
none of my business.

899
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:15,354
I apologise for bringing you here...

900
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:20,799
but I had to be sure the eggs
were genuine before I let you go.

901
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:25,073
Your lack of trust
is really depressing, Mr Petrovich.

902
01:17:26,921 --> 01:17:28,798
I'm a man of my word.

903
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:32,876
She should be with her godfather now.

904
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,035
Let's see.

905
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,118
- Do you mind?
- Sure. Go.

906
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:47,909
(Mobile rings)

907
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:48,950
Yeah.

908
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:56,481
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Where are you?

909
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:00,361
I'm at the jail. I had to see him.

910
01:18:00,401 --> 01:18:01,675
<i>How Is hhe?</i>

911
01:18:01,721 --> 01:18:03,279
(Sighs) Well, how do you think he is?

912
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:05,915
I had no choice, Alex.

913
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,189
<i>No one hhad a chholce</i>

914
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:12,269
Remember? I told you.
Neither one of us could promise a thing.

915
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:15,711
Listen, promises blow away in the wind.

916
01:18:15,761 --> 01:18:17,592
But feelings are real.

917
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:21,156
And I need to know
were the feelings lies, too?

918
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:23,954
<i>Llsten llsten Whhat I mean Is</i>

919
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,435
are we real?

920
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:36,797
- I've gotta go, Gabriel. Good night.
<i>- Walt Don 't go</i>

921
01:18:36,841 --> 01:18:38,320
Hold...

922
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:48,153
Are you satisfied?

923
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,189
Did you see them?

924
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:02,278
- Actually, we were in a hurry.
- Look.

925
01:19:12,401 --> 01:19:14,551
They are simply...

926
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:15,716
wood?

927
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,832
(Laughs)

928
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:36,630
- Oh, my God:
- Simply wood?

929
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:43,116
It was 1917, Gabriel.

930
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:45,755
Russia. People were starving.

931
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:49,510
There were no jewels,
no diamonds left.

932
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:50,994
No hope.

933
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:55,477
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

934
01:19:57,521 --> 01:20:00,194
Perhaps you understand
why we had a revolution.

935
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:04,276
People needed
to believe in something.

936
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:09,159
Take him home.

937
01:20:14,921 --> 01:20:16,036
Gabriel.

938
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:23,350
I know what they say about me
but I'm not a killer.

939
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:27,837
Merely a humble immigrant.

940
01:20:27,881 --> 01:20:29,519
Probably much like you.

941
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,032
I don 't think so, Mr Petrovich.

942
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:37,031
You're not like me at all.

943
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:51,472
Excellent. Thanks. We've got Petrovich.

944
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:55,150
Snitch called it in. After all this time
looking for him, you know where he was?

945
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:57,396
I'm sure you'll tell us.

946
01:20:57,441 --> 01:20:59,318
On the boardwalk, watchin ' the sun come up.

947
01:20:59,361 --> 01:21:02,671
He's coming in now.
I'll be right back.

948
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:09,393
Yeah, what I didn 't count on
was that a so-called professional

949
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:11,397
would be manipulated by a chick.

950
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:13,159
What kind of cops
do they make in Miami?

951
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,351
Good ones, Weber. Good ones.

952
01:21:15,401 --> 01:21:17,232
I don 't get it.

953
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:20,557
All these years in that world.
How do you let an asset use you?

954
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:24,555
Sometimes things... change.

955
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:28,674
Things change?
Like, "which side am I on" change?

956
01:21:28,721 --> 01:21:31,155
Ripley, what is he,
your best friend now?

957
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:33,112
Actually, a better friend than you.

958
01:21:33,161 --> 01:21:35,994
Ah, I get it. I'm the asshole.

959
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:38,032
You're gonna tell me
what a good guy he is

960
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:40,834
or how he got caught up
in a situation he couldn 't control,

961
01:21:40,881 --> 01:21:43,441
or how the sins of the father
shouldn 't rest on the daughter?

962
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,439
Give me something better
than, "things change":

963
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:49,632
All I can give you is the truth.

964
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:54,871
Oh, fuck it:
Go back to Miami, Martin.

965
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:01,280
When your superiors get my report,
you'll be lucky if you have a job.

966
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:03,152
We'll see.

967
01:22:03,201 --> 01:22:05,032
Hey, say anything
you want about Ripley

968
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:07,470
but nothing changes
the fact that I finally got him.

969
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:11,355
Now when he leaves prison,
he'll be leaving in a pine box.

970
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,160
Let's go see Mr Petrovich.

971
01:22:27,801 --> 01:22:28,836
No.

972
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:38,000
- That's not Nicky Petrovich.
- What?

973
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,310
Not him.

974
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:46,917
Look, man, Organised Crime
confirmed it. That's Nicky Petrovich.

975
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:49,634
Well, I don 't care. That's not him:

976
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:51,876
I was there, remember?

977
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,671
There's no case here.

978
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:58,350
- What? Of course there's a case.
- Do you really think I'll put him on the stand?

979
01:22:58,401 --> 01:23:01,677
An undercover Miami cop
who may or may not be legit?

980
01:23:01,721 --> 01:23:02,790
- No offence.
- None taken.

981
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:05,833
A cop who's the centrepiece
of a botched undercover operation

982
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,951
that was officially ordered stopped?

983
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:10,640
I won 't embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department,

984
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:13,878
which accepted tons of money
and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

985
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:17,596
What about Romanov's? What about
the goddamn stolen treasures of Russia?

986
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:18,710
What about it, Weber?

987
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,353
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

988
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:22,710
he had everything cleared out
before you could get in.

989
01:23:22,761 --> 01:23:25,275
<i>(Rlpley) I hhave a proposltlon for youu</i>

990
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:28,552
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges against Ripley.

991
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:32,992
Cos they can never admit that the eggs
or anything else ever existed.

992
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,839
So we can 't even prove
that Detective Martin and Ripley

993
01:23:35,881 --> 01:23:37,155
stole even a goddamn dime:

994
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:38,714
But you must have mug shots.

995
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,791
Russian Mafia,
known associates, something:

996
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:06,354
That's him.

997
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:09,439
That's Nicky Petrovich.

998
01:24:09,481 --> 01:24:11,790
- Detective Martin...
- Yeah?

999
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:14,753
That's Victor Korolenko.

1000
01:24:25,441 --> 01:24:26,590
Presumed dead.

1001
01:24:27,681 --> 01:24:29,797
We just never found the body.

1002
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:35,759
You never will...

1003
01:24:36,961 --> 01:24:38,076
lieutenant.

1004
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:23,719
Weber.

1005
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:24,750
What?

1006
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:28,111
His lawyer got him in front of a judge
on an expedited bail hearing.

1007
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:29,640
Then he just walked.

1008
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:32,036
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

1009
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:35,630
- The lawyer.
- Who the fuck do you think?

1010
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:38,149
Alex. Korolenko.

1011
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:03,477
You can 't promise me anything so...

1012
01:26:03,521 --> 01:26:05,796
maybe we shouldn 't even try.

1013
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:17,396
(Sighs)

1014
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:28,710
(Laughs)

1015
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:47,116
- Papa.

1016
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:50,432

1017
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:52,517

1018
01:26:57,481 --> 01:26:59,039
(Mobile rings)

1019
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:02,390
Yeah?

1020
01:27:02,441 --> 01:27:05,319
<i>(Rlpley) Dldn 't wanna leave</i>

1022
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:09,200
The real Nicky Petrovich

1023
01:27:09,241 --> 01:27:12,119
is the one Zykov is funnelling
the contraband through.

1024
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:17,400
Thank you but Zykov and Petrovich
have gone to ground.

1025
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:20,001
- Check out a disco called...
- Riga Rose?

I never forgot it for a second.

1029
01:27:27,601 --> 01:27:29,432

<i>So whhy thhe hhelp Rlpley?</i>

1036
01:27:42,481 --> 01:27:44,392
Maybe feeling guilty?

1037

(Laughs)

1038
01:27:46,001 --> 01:27:48,356
Guilt's not even in my vocabulary.

1039
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:50,676
I was just hoping
you'd see things differently.

1040
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:55,070
Together you and I could do anything.

1041
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,558
Yeah. I believe we did.

1042
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:02,718
I'll get in touch later on,
if you're interested.

1043
01:28:02,761 --> 01:28:06,800
Meanwhile, I've got to keep an appointment with
a man who's going to pay dearly for something

1044
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:09,992
he's got to keep locked
in his basement just to say it's his.

1045
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,078
- Good hunting, Gaby.
<i>- Walt walt walt</i>

1046
01:28:15,241 --> 01:28:17,072
Let me talk to her.
Just for a second.

1047
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:19,840
- That's him?
- What makes you think she's going anywhere?

1048
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:21,280
She didn 't commit any crime.

1049
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:24,552
She just lied to someone
who was lying to her.

1050
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:31,870
(Laughs)

1051
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:37,437
You be good.

1052
01:28:37,481 --> 01:28:39,437
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

1053
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:44,599
Although I suspect
my legal career just ended.

1054
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:46,836
Thank God.

1055
01:29:15,801 --> 01:29:19,476
You come in here every night
and every night I tell you

1056
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,831
I don 't know shit
from this Petrovich.

1058
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:26,556
This is a nightclub, my friend.

1059
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:27,920
You know what I think?

1060
01:29:29,121 --> 01:29:33,239
I think you need to check out the action
and get your ass laid.

1061
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:36,193
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm sayin ', dude?

1062
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:38,311
Find yourself a chick:

1063
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:52,119

1067
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:02,716
- Will my stomach need coating?
- I hope so.

1068
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:05,070
I thought you didn 't drink.

1069
01:30:05,121 --> 01:30:06,474
You thought a lot of things,

1070
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:09,957
but I believe I mentioned
something about making assumptions.

1071
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:13,835
Maybe that's a concept
we should get rid of. Immediately.

1072

but the office was closed.

So...

1076
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,359
I came here.

01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:33,152

My name is Alexandra Korolenko

1079
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:40,597
and I come from St Petersburg.

1080
01:30:40,641 --> 01:30:42,597

Do you wanna dance with me?

1085
01:31:02,201 --> 01:31:03,190
Yeah.

1086
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:08,116
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

- Yeah?

1089
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:20,270
That night when I called you
from Coney Island,

1090
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:22,710
you never answered my question.

1091
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:24,160
Which one?

1092
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:27,716
I wanted... I want to know...

1093
01:31:31,521 --> 01:31:32,874
Was it all lies?

1094
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,357
