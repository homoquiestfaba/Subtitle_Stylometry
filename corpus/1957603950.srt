00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,785
gotten into ghost videos lately.

545

Seriously, that's what
you're into now?

546
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,573
- Yeah.
- Ghost videos are thebest.

547
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,097
We watch this
ghost-video compilation thing.

548
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,143
We're especially into
that guy Dark Corners.

549
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,796

are the fucking creepiest.

"And now for something
truly terrifying."

552
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,543
Last night, we binge-watched
like 30 of his posts.

553
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:18,720
It made me have the most
horrifying nightmares.

554
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,200
It was great.

555
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,768
You have to send a link
to Dark Corners.

556
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,553
Yeah, not really
anything to send, so...

557
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,729
Oh, so all the more reason
to keep making videos.

558
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,079
Yeah, I...

go watch TV.

the continued job hunt.

have this, too.

are hard.

It's time for the
"Dark Corners" clip of the week.

606
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,955
Ghost blogger Catherine Ohau

607
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,654
sent us this clip from her
channel, "Haunted Ohau,"

608
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:53,223
where she investigates haunted
and abandoned buildings.

609
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,268
In this
particular investigation,

610
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,706
Catherine was searching the
long-empty St. Ambrose School

611
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:00,186
in Winston, New York,

612
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,754
and as she moved down
the first-floor hallway,

613
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,800
she noticed a few bits of
discarded clothes on the floor

614
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:08,542
and a number of
overturned desks.

615
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,240
With her camera, though,

616
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,807
she caught something
truly terrifying.

617
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,640
Did you catch it?

618
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:29,389
Uh, I have your book,
"Ghost and Their Personas."

619
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,782
Wonderful.

620
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,219
So, do you have
your spirit jar handy?

621
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,786
Uh, yeah, it's right here.

622
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:37,267
Can you hold it up
so that I can see it?

623
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,616
Mm-hmm.

624
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,923

Thank you.

628
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,629
Can you tell me what offerings
you've included

629
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:53,283
with your spirit jar?

630
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,024
Any coins or herbs?

631
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,201
Maybe some hair?

632
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,028

put hair in I?

634
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,685
No, I didn't put
anything in it.

635
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,949
Oh, I see. All right.

636
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:11,431
Uh, and then the symbols that
are written on the spirit jar...

637
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,129
where did they come from?

638
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,609
Uh, from a list
that a viewer sent me.

639
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,655
And then the rest
of the symbols...

640
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,222
those are from my book?

641
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,614
Yeah. From your book, yeah.

642
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,877
Well, based on examining
your spirit jar

643
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:26,142
and now hearing that you hadn't
included any offerings,

644
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,013
along with a mish-mash
of symbols,

645
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:32,670
I'm inclined to believe
that your jar is empty.

646
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,976
And since it's empty,
you may now open the jar.

647
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:41,461
Are you frightened
to open the jar?

648
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:44,290
Yeah, if... if I'm
being honest, I am.

649
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,945
Well, if it helps,
I'll say once more,

650
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,555
there is currently nothing

651
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:51,948
trapped inside
your homemade spirit jar.

00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,129

what should I be prepared for?

653

Nothing, Ken.

654

655
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,135
They can't do anything to you.

656

They have no true physical form,
no real power.

drawn across our reality.

in your jar, which there isn't,

00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:29,521
- Are you bleeding?
- Something happened.

729
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:31,044
Like, ghost-wise?

730
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:33,569
I don't think that
it's just Roberta here.

731
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,440
I think there's something else.

732
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:38,486
- Something... Something worse.
- Worse how?

733
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:41,011
Like, dangerous?

734
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,142
Can we just talk in private?

735
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,885
Well, be careful, Ken.

736
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:53,806
Okay, what exactly
happened to you?

737
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,286
Something tried
to fucking kill me!

738
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,593
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

739
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,420
Honey, you need
to go to the hospital.

740
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:01,727
No, it's fine, it's fine.
I'll be fine. It's fine.

741
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:05,296
It's fine? What, are you
drunk or something?

742
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:07,820
Oh, my God. You are.

743
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,735
You're drunk.

744
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:11,519
It's okay, Kelsey. It's fine.

745
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:15,436
Well, [Sighs] when did you
start drinking again?

746
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:18,962
I had a beer with Terry
like a couple weeks ago.

747
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,485
So with Terry.

748
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,400
That's not the point.
It's fine.

749
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,969
Okay, okay.
But it doesn't help you.

750
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:27,971
And tonight,
you were drinking alone.

751
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:29,363
People do that, Kelsey.

752
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,757
To the point that
they need stitches?

753
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,324
I didn't do this to myself.

754
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:36,109
Is it possible that
whatever happened tonight,

755
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,068
that you imagined it?

756
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,375
I didn't hallucinate,
and I'm not fucking drunk.

757
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,289
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have called.

758
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,992
God damn it.

759
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,908
Damn it.

760
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,431
Terry. Wake up, Terry.

761
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,433
- Terry, wake up.
- What?

762
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:57,435
We... We shouldn't have
did what we did.

763
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:59,002
Mm-hmm. What's that?

764
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:01,134
We shouldn't have messed
with the spirit jar.

765
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,701
Okay.

766
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,747
I-I was in my room.

767
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:07,488
- Terry, wake up.
- Hmm?

768
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,491
There was, um...

769
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:13,930
- Terry.
- It's great talking to you.

770
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:15,627
Bye.

771
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:17,542
Terry, wake up.

772
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:18,891

when we did the spirit jar.

I didn't really seeanything.

785
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:32,138
I mostly just... I heard stuff,

786
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,140
and then there was the light
and the door

787
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:36,839
and then you fell off
your chair, but...

788

No, I totally agree.

789
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,581
What's going on isbullshit.

790
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:43,454
People are leaving comments
saying it's all just a big hoax,

791
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,021
that I made it all up.

792
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:48,546
I don't know. Maybe just
shut down the comments?

793
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:51,462
Yeah, but then it looks like
I'm hiding something, right?

794
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:53,159
And also, why would
anybody do this?

795
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:56,597
Why would I put myself
through all of this?

796
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,295
Some people would.

797
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,427
What people?

798
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:02,952
People who like attention.

799
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:05,215
You think I want
this type of attention?

800
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:06,869
[Sighs] I don't mean you.

801
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,654
I mean, that's why
other people would do it.

802
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:13,353
- My videos aren't fake.
- I didn't say they were fake.

803
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:15,486
This is really happening.

804
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:17,705
Look, I know it is.

805
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:19,185
What did Kelsey say?

806
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:21,144
I haven't talked to her
in a couple of days.

807
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:23,624
Maybe give her a shout.

808
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,410
- She told me you e-mailed her.
- She told you that?

809
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:28,064
[Chuckles] Yeah.

810
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,413
Oh, right.

811
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:31,502
Yeah, I think
I was just telling her

812
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:33,678
about what happened
with the spirit jar.

813
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,550
Why'd you think she needed
to know I fell out of my chair?

814
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:39,423
'Cause she was the one who
told you to do some research.

815
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:43,514
Who told you she was the one
to tell me to do research?

816
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:45,690
You did.

817
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:47,518
No, I didn't.

818
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,214
I think you did.

819
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,479
I would really appreciate it

820
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:54,742
if the two of you
did not conspire against me.

821
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:57,876
We're not.

822
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,660
Did you tell her
I was drinking?

823
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:01,706
Hell no.

824
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:04,359
Do you have a problem
with me drinking, Terry?

825
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,280
I guess I'm just worried
about your state of mind, man.

826
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:12,195
I'm not a drunk!

827
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:15,198
But nearly two years ago,
you didhave a nervous breakdown

828
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,896
which led to you
drinking way too much,

829
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:22,640
which led to you losing both
your job and your family, right?

830
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:26,818
What's happening right now
with me in this apartment

831
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,168
has nothing to do with that.

832
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,475
Okay, and why did you have to
move so far away from your kids

833
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:33,738
anyhow... and from me,
for that matter?

834
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,696
What are you trying
to escape... reality?

835
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:38,003
I needed a fresh start.

836
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:41,702
This shit is your fresh start.

837
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:45,054
You know what, if you think
I'm such a fuck-up, just say so.

838
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:47,708
I don't think you're a fuck-up.

839
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,929
You're bad friend, Terry.
You're a fucking enabler.

840
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:54,106
If I'm an enabler,
then you're fucking indulger.

841
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:55,455
If I'm an indulger,

842
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,675
why would I make up
a fake haunting

843
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,895
just to ruin a life
that I don't want?

844
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,374
You know what?

845
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,072
You wanted to do
this ghost-video stuff

846
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:04,812
so you could make money
so you wouldn't have to go

847
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:07,293
get a real job
out in the real world.

848
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:09,469
Terry...

849
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,905
you've known me
since grade school.

850
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,478
Everything that is going on
with me is not like before.

851
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,613
It's really happening.
None of it is fake.

852
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:25,007
Fine.

853
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:28,227
- You believe me?
- Never said I didn't.

854
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,448
And hey, I didn't tell Kelsey
about us having a few beers,

855
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,103
and I don't care if you want
to hide from the world.

856
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,842
Maybe we should all be hiding.

857
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,152
You good?

858
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:41,849
Yeah. Maybe.

I suppose what I'm saying is,
the last time we spoke,

863
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:18,625
when I examined your spirit jar
and said that it was empty?

864
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,149
Wait, it's not?

865
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:23,761
No, the jar was empty,

866
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:27,678
but I took the liberty
of doing some research

867
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,462
on your Roberta Wellwood,

868
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:32,465
which in turn led me
to some medical reports

869
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:34,337
that date back
to about five years

870
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:37,035
after the young woman's
tragic fall.

871
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:41,126
These reports that I found
involve Roberta's mother,

872
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:42,649
Yvonne Wellwood,

873
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:45,652
whereas she confessed that,
in a fit of rage,

874
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:47,915
she pushed Roberta
out the window

875
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:51,397
after the failed axe attack
on the father.

876
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,312
Holy shit.

877
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:55,967
Holy shit, indeed.

878
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:59,144
These reports go on
to reveal that,

879
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:02,365
not soon after Yvonne's
confession of murder,

880
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:05,585
she committed suicide.

881
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:08,371
She committed suicide
in this apartment?

882
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:10,634
No, not there,

883
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:14,333
but in a psychiatric facility
where she was being kept.

884
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,074
Now, my theory is that

885
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:19,773
when you attempted to use
your homemade spirit jar,

886
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:23,603
you inadvertently harvested
her deranged soul.

887
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,171
Whoa, whoa.
I harvested her soul?

888
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,607
Yes.

889
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,479
And it took a while
for Yvonne Wellwood

890
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:31,872
to reincorporate
from the astral plane

891
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:33,613
back into your apartment.

892
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:37,182
So that's why she didn't
immediately present herself.

893
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:40,838
But once she did,
Yvonne began to wreak havoc

894
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,015
in the hopes of capturing
Roberta's spirit

895
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:47,410
so that she could replay
her daughter's murder

896
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:50,021
again and again.

897
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:51,892
Why would...
Why would she do that?

898
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:53,285
It's called a ghost loop.

899
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:55,679
It happens when restless spirits

900
00:51:55,721 --> 00:52:00,031
are fated to repeat
their tragic circumstances.

901
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,467
Okay. Okay.

902
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,556
Um, you said you had good news?

903

I may have a way I can help you.

my very own personal spirit jar,

complete with
the correct markings,

906
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:16,613
which should, A, capture

and hold the demented spirit
of Yvonne Wellwood

908
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,187
and, B, release the confined
spirit of poor Roberta Wellwood

enter the light.

could do all of that?

01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,962
with the spirit
that he refers to as Roberta,

1077
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,529
she appears to be wearing
a white dress.

1078
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,662
I've heard some people say
they also think

1079
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,576
she appears to be screaming.

1080
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:52,231
The reason Roberta most likely
is screaming is...

1081
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:53,972
Right, Colin,
you said you've done

1082
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,713
some additional research
on the building.

1083
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:58,934
I discovered that Roberta's
mother, Yvonne Wellwood...

1084
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:00,631
The second Wellwood ghost,

1085
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,720
whom we are hoping
we encounter tonight.

1086
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:06,593
Yes. That Yvonne had actually
confessed to murdering Roberta.

1087
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,073
Yes.

1088
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:10,032
Additionally,
there is reason to believe

1089
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:12,077
that that haunting
will continue.

1090
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,341
Colin's theory is... and
correct me, Colin, if I'm wrong.

1091
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:19,519
Colin's theory is
that Ken's homemade spirit jar

1092
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,261
might have somehow pulled
the spirit of Roberta's mother

1093
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,611
from the astral plane
to our earthly plane

1094
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:28,180
to torment her daughter
again and again.

1095
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:31,183
Let me remind everyone
what we're referring to.

1096
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:36,143

this video is truly terrifying.

But what is it?

1104
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:01,953
I have to say, that thing

1105
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:04,477
doesn't look like it could be
the ghost of Yvonne Wellwood.

1106
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,392
When the spirit
of Yvonne Wellwood

1107
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:08,394
entered our earthly plane,

1108
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:11,963
she underwent a radical
ectoplasmic transformation.

1109
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:15,053
Whatever it is,
it looks dangerous.

1110
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,273
Well, Yvonne was
a psychotic murderer.

1111
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:19,231
According to whatever
medical files you found?

1112
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:21,059
Exactly.

1113
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:23,409
Well, I did a little research
into Yvonne Wellwood myself,

1114
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:25,323
and I found no record
of her at all.

1115
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,763
That's strange.

1116
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,765
Either way, it seems
there's no denying

1117
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,464
there are likely two paranormal
entities haunting this location,

1118
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:38,033
which should make for
an intriguing investigation.

1119
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:41,210
And so, with that,
how about we head on over

1120
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:46,215
to Ken Barber, currently at
the Wellwood investigation site?

to elaborate?

1132
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,243
Uh, sure. Colin sent me this.

1165
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:37,152

are the symbols derived from?

and I apologize,
