2
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,734
Andy, are you ready?

3
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,069
Get up here.

4
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:48,205
I'm done with my boat, mom.

5
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:50,841
We're gonna
be late to the airport.

6
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,376
Please bring your bag down.

7
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,079
I can't find it.

8
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:58,415
Did you look under your bed?

9
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:02,319
What are you doing up there?

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,724
Babe you got the passports?

11
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,094
Yeah, I got them.

12
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,398
Daddy, daddy look.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,168
Oh, yeah it looks good,
the sail looks great.

14
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,606
- You almost got it.
That's good.

15
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:26,510
I checked the weather,
not a drop of rain all week.

16
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:28,812
I know, that's great.

17
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:29,847
Hello.

18
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:29,847
Can you take the luggage out?

19
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:29,847
Honey, can you guys take
the luggage outside, please?

20
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:35,319
- Andy where's your bag?
- I was saying, he has to...

21
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:38,622
Andy. Where's your bag, sweetie?

22
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,891
Yeah, I saw the X-ray.

23
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,527
Well, schedule an mri
and let's just wait

24
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:45,162
to see what the results
of the blood test are

25
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:48,265
and we'll talk next week, okay?
Email me his results.

26
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,367
Yeah, thank you. All right.

27
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,668
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,203
Are we gonna go on jet skis?

29
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:54,771
Because Colin said
he went on a lake

30
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:56,673
and his dad let him
drive a jet ski.

31
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:59,710
Six year old Colin rode
a jet ski by himself?

32
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,612
He went 100 miles per hour.

33
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,280
And he also said
that his dad can

34
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,282
kick your ass because
you're a doctor.

35
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:09,753
First of all do not repeat
bad words after Colin.

36
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:14,158
Secondly, doctors are pretty
tough, you'd be surprised.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,628
And I highly doubt Colin
rode a jet ski by himself.

38
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,164
Then promise me we
will go together then.

39
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,465
I promise.

40
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,202
Kevin, Andy,
so you're finally leaving.

41
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:25,202
Lucas, yeah.

42
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:29,873
Uh, Jules found a really
good deal in the Caribbean.

43
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,176
We're gonna spend some
quality time with the family.

44
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:33,944
Oh, that's what
vacations are for.

45
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:33,944
And only because of you,

46
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:38,415
Margie and I were able to spend
our last vacation together.

47
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:43,220
I know, I know, it's okay,
you don't have to thank me.

48
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,421
By the way Julie mentioned

49
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:46,690
you can't start
the lawnmower again.

50
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,625
I'll tell you what,
I could show you how to fix it.

51
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,427
It's simple,
it'll only take a second.

52
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:52,629
It's a small engine,
and they're all the same.

53
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,898
I'm... I'm on vacation.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,934
I'm not fixing
anything right now.

55
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,937
Andy your father
can fix a human heart

56
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,673
but he can't fix the lawnmower.

57
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,912
Be careful, some areas are
not very safe out there.

58
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,981
Thanks, Lucas,
I'll keep that in mind.

59
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,317
- Toodle-loo.
- Have a nice week.

60
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,520
Kevin, slip the
concierge a little

61
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:19,289
something extra
he'll upgrade your room.

62
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,860
Money... that's how
everything works down there.

63
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,697
Okay.

64
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,664
Thanks.

65
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,899
Au revoir.

66
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,469
- Daddy, what's a concierge?
- Uh...

67
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,583
Daddy, is treasure island real?

68
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:53,924
Yeah, for sure,
hundreds of years ago

69
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:58,495
pirates used to hide
treasure on deserted islands.

70
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:00,864
Why?

71
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,301
Mm... so no one else could
figure out where they hid it.

72
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:07,404
Why didn't they keep their treasure
at home with their families?

73
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:11,441
Pirates don't have,
homes, you know, or families.

74
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,645
If they didn't
have homes or family

75
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,281
why did they need treasure?

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,853
That's a good question.

77
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,009
Hey, come here.

78
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,479
What do you think?

79
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,781
It's pretty amazing.

80
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:54,651
It is pretty good. Yeah.

81
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:54,651
- Welcome.
- Hi.

82
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,421
May I have your name and
reservation number please?

83
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,855
Kevin Riley.

84
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,527
Uh, I don't think I'm really
particularly good at this

85
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,697
but if you were willing
to upgrade our room,

86
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,936
I would be willing to compensate
you, personally, financially.

87
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,472
Certainly, let's see
what we have available.

88
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,807
Thanks, man.

89
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:22,012
So what do you think
of the honeymoon suite?

90
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,514
It's pretty great,
nice to finally see one.

91
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:28,385
Oh, come on.
Our honeymoon suite was nice.

92
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,487
I'm sorry our honeymoon suite
did you just say?

93
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:31,688
Our honeymoon suite
was a tiny bed

94
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,924
in the back of an rv
on the way to Mexico.

95
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,059
So? That sounds like fun,
it was great.

96
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:39,396
- It was the worst trip ever, that's what that is.
- I thought it was fun.

97
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:48,105
I know you did.
Love you.

98
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,396
- Hi, there.
- Good morning, how are you doing?

99
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,897
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

100
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,998
How can I help you today?

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:14,998
I want to get a jet ski, please.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,072
Oh... man, uh, yep, I'm sorry
but we're all out for today.

103
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:25,008
You know the list is full,
so sorry.

104
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,109
Actually, if you can
give me your name

105
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,477
I can book you for tomorrow.

106
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,180
No I get it,
I get it, that's cool.

107
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,150
Sir, sir we don't...
Sir, we don't have any jet skis.

108
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,919
Okay, my son,
he's never been on one before

109
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,888
and I swear to you
it's all he talks about.

110
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,723
So if there's anything that
you could do it would be great.

111
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:40,957
It would mean a lot to me.

112
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,493
I'm not... you know what,

113
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:43,493
I'm not even supposed to
tell you this

114
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:48,131
but... but you can rent a
motorboat from one of the locals.

115
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,600
A couple of kilometers down
you'll see a bunch of guys

116
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:53,470
and they have all kinds
of boats, all right?

117
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:58,442
Hey, mister.

118
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,444
What you got there?

119
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:04,748
- Five dollar fish.
- No, thanks, nice fish though.

120
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,516
Yo, my friend, you need a boat?

121
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,051
- Yeah.
- Only 300, bro.

122
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,920
- Which one?
- Right there the white one.

123
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,621
Right here, my man.
The fastest boat is right here.

124
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:13,457
Yeah, right, give me 250.

125
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:13,457
- Three hours for $200.
- Give me 250.

126
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,659
Come here, you gonna like it.

127
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:16,726
Right here, right here come on.

128
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:16,726
Just give me 250.

129
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:16,726
- Come on, come right here.
- He says 200.

130
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,497
Fun boat, you're gonna love it.

131
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,732
- Go ahead.
- Thanks, man.

132
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,901
- I like this one.
- How you doing, sir?

133
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,572
- I'm good, how are you?
- Fine, this is a good boat,
man.

134
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,240
- This is the fastest
boat ever, okay?
- Okay.

135
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,709
That engine right
there 60 horsepower.

136
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,244
- Okay.
- It came from a old sport boat.

137
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:38,682
- All right.
- Just $200 for three hours,
cash please.

138
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:38,682
- Thank you very much.
- You need my license?

139
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:44,020
Get in, come on, no man, I don't
need your license, come on.

140
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:46,089
- Okay. - What you gonna do,
you gonna steal my boat?

141
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,725
- Maybe. - You can take it,
I'll get insurance money.

142
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,231
Don't worry, man,
just bring it clean

143
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:54,231
and I'm not gonna charge
you a cleaning fee, okay?

144
00:07:54,233 --> 00:08:00,003
So sit down, I'm gonna
show you how it works, okay?

145
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,573
Okay, very simple okay,
put the gear in drive.

146
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,542
And you're gonna put the
throttle control lever up

147
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:05,542
and that's it
you're ready to go.

148
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:08,879
- Okay.
- You got the life vests
right there, okay.

149
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:10,547
- And make sure if you got
kids put them on them.
- Okay.

150
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:14,184
And you got a full
tank of gas, be safe.

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,821
Now remember if you go swimming,

152
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:19,923
remember to drop
the anchor, okay?

153
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:23,260
'Cause when you come back you're
not gonna see
the boat again, okay.

154
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,794
Have a good trip.

155
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,626
You can steer it, here we go.

156
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:59,029
- Babe.
- Yeah?

157
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:00,597
Where did you find this thing?

158
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:00,597
Well they
didn't have any jet skis

159
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,967
but the good thing
is this is safer

160
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:07,904
and we're all together, right?

161
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,209
Wow.

162
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:13,209
Oh, I see how it is.

163
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:17,614
These guys think
they can take us huh?

164
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:20,083
What do you say we show
them what we can do?

165
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:21,718
- Buckle up.
- Do it.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,820
Yeah, faster, daddy, faster.

167
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:29,659
Bet you Colin
never went this fast.

168
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,790
Kevin. Kevin!

169
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:03,259
- Yeah?
- Slow down.

170
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,995
Okay.

171
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:06,997
Babe, listen, I think
we should go back.

172
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,832
We can't even see
the land anymore.

173
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:13,403
- No.
- Yeah, we got two hours left,
come on.

174
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,873
I think it's gonna take
us a while to get back.
We should turn around.

175
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,708
All right, you know
what your mom is right.

176
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,144
- Let's turn this baby
around and we'll...
- Sorry.

177
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,713
Cruise around closer
to shore, okay?

178
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,749
- No.
- I know, buddy, I'm sorry.

179
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,685
I don't mean to
be a party pooper.

180
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,253
It's safer.

181
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,990
Island, island,
I wanna see the island.

182
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:36,726
Daddy, treasure island.

183
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,028
I don't think it's a good idea.

184
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,165
Mom, just for a minute,
can we see the island?

185
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,733
What do you say, mom?

186
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,302
It's not every day you get
to see a deserted island.

187
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:46,302
Why don't we just check it out?

188
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:49,072
And we'll go home
and have lunch after.

189
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah!

190
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,411
Mom, please, please, please?

191
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,680
Okay.

192
00:10:56,682 --> 00:11:02,052
Yeah, full speed ahead!
Next stop treasure island!

193
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,405
Daddy, look, palm trees.

194
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,773
They're everywhere.

195
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,275
Awesome.

196
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:26,443
Come here your ears are red.

197
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:28,311
Dad you think
there's treasure here?

198
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,447
You never know.

199
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,716
You guys wanna take a
walk around the island?

200
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:32,716
I think I'm gonna sit down

201
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:36,720
and read for a little bit,
you guys go ahead.

202
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:37,854
All right.

203
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,823
Let's look
for a buried treasure.

204
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,757
All right, well, let's do it.

205
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,358
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

206
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,761
You boys have fun.

207
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,464
Let's do it,
come on,
let's find some treasure.

208
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,734
What do you think, huh?

209
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:50,734
Awesome.

210
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:50,734
Let's go see this thing.

211
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:54,037
Let's see if we can make
it all the way around.

212
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,271
Cool.

213
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,780
Whoa, a seashell.

214
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:08,218
Dad, look.

215
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,121
Wow, that's pretty cool.

216
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:15,158
Take a look inside,
see if anybody's home.

217
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,512
Hello, darlings.

218
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,882
Look, mom, we found
a cool seashell.

219
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,117
Ooh a conk shell,
it's good luck you know.

220
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:44,387
- Conk, can you say conk?
- Conk.

221
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,791
Conk shell,
it's good luck, you ready?

222
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:51,528
- I'm hungry.
- Hungry, too.

223
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,296
Let me help you up.

224
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:57,534
- Who wants Sushi?
- I want Sushi.

225
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,938
Okay, how about, uh,

226
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,975
what do you say we get
mom a caterpillar roll?

227
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,077
- Eww.
- Eww.

228
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,346
Or a spider roll?

229
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:11,815
What about a tarantula roll?

230
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:15,285
What, no those are too hairy,
I don't like those.

231
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:19,455
How about some,
start with some miso chorizo?

232
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,457
Miso chorizo?

233
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,593
Or some edamame salami?

234
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,867
I don't think
there's a crab there.

235
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,036
Yeah, probably not.
What's going on over there, hon?

236
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,913
We run out of gas?

237
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,587
- No, it's full.
- Okay.

238
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,226
I think that's
supposed to be down.

239
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,530
All right, come on.

240
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,539
Come on, come on.

241
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:19,916
I mean, anyways
if anything there's...

242
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,585
There's got to be a bunch
of boats around.

243
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,201
Oh, there we go.

244
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:44,941
It's basically a
lawnmower engine.

245
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,485
Fuck, come on, come on.

246
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:18,341
It won't be much longer, honey.

247
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,152
All right,
so how long do you think

248
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:30,653
before they notice
the boat is missing

249
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:32,221
and they come looking for us?

250
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:36,259
I don't know if they care
if the boat is missing.

251
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:40,029
I rented it from a
local and paid in cash.

252
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,001
He doesn't know my name
or where we're staying.

253
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:50,373
And he wouldn't want to report
his missing boat to the police?

254
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,008
I hope he does.

255
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,717
Look, if it comes down to it,

256
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,052
I'll put on a life vest
and I'll swim back.

257
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,721
You can't swim back,
it took us an hour going

258
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:06,990
whatever miles per hour we
were doing to get out here.

259
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:10,493
Can you even imagine
how far out we are?

260
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:20,403
I'm gonna keep looking for
boats on the other side.

261
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,150
Hey.

262
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,087
You okay?

263
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,456
Only battery's dead.

264
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,158
I've been messing with
the engine all morning
and it seems fine.

265
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,560
The fuel line's good,
we got fuel.

266
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,261
The engine's just... i
don't know.

267
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:53,796
I think it's the
battery that's dead.

268
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,835
I went around
the island, uh,
I didn't see any water.

269
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,241
I did see a boat
a little while ago.

270
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:09,112
Mommy, my head hurts
and I'm thirsty.

271
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:12,348
I know, sweetheart,
but you have
to stay out of the sun.

272
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,717
Your father's asked you twice
to stay out of the sun.

273
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,352
It's okay. It's okay.

274
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:18,888
Hey, chief.

275
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:25,361
Everything's gonna be fine.

276
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:28,698
Just like in the pirate stories.

277
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,234
Did you know that when they
used to sail these seas

278
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,470
they would go for weeks
at a time without food?

279
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:38,508
And they didn't mind because
it was... it was an adventure.

280
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,876
Just like it is for us.

281
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:41,677
So I want you to do
what your mom says

282
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:41,677
and I want you to
stay under that tree

283
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,914
and stay out of the sun
and I want you to think about

284
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,650
what you're gonna
tell Colin about

285
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:52,255
your big adventure
on treasure island, okay?

286
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,824
Okay?

287
00:18:57,327 --> 00:19:03,166
Look, boat, boat.
Come on, boat. Hey!

288
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:06,435
- Babe, boat, yo.
- Hey!

289
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,871
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

290
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,908
- Stop.
- Whoo, help!

291
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,710
- Stop!
- Stop, help.

292
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:16,212
- Help us.
- Hey!

293
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:19,315
- We need help.
- Whoo, help!

294
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:22,685
- See us!
- Help, hey!

295
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,954
Look over here!

296
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,391
Hey, whoo!

297
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,630
Hey, come here, it's okay.

298
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,200
There's gonna be plenty more.

299
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:38,935
That's just one.

300
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:41,571
A boat is gonna come along
and they're gonna get us okay?

301
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,739
Now in the meantime,
you get under that palm tree.

302
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:44,974
Stay out of the sun.

303
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,250
What are we gonna do?

304
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:58,854
Well, we can last a couple
of days without food.

305
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,224
Someone's guaranteed
to come by then.

306
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:04,460
How long can we
last without water?

307
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,734
I can't believe,
this is actually happening.

308
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:49,305
Hey.

309
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:58,481
I know I've been
too hard on you.

310
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,585
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:07,757
Do you really think
we're gonna be okay?

312
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,660
Of course we're gonna be okay.

313
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,999
I will not let us die out here.

314
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,934
That's a promise.

315
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,394
Jules...

316
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:22,765
Jules, Jules.

317
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,800
Jules, you got to wake up.

318
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,437
His heart is racing,
he's overcompensating

319
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,039
'cause he can't pump
the blood properly.

320
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,908
Andy, Andy!

321
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:38,581
Damn it, goddamn it.

322
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:49,558
Please don't let him die,
we have to do something.

323
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,162
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

324
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,766
Hey, we have to
get off the island.

325
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,869
We have to get out on the water.

326
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,604
<i>There are boats out there.</i>

327
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:04,140
<i>Someone is gonna spot us.</i>

328
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:07,576
<i>If we don't he's not
gonna wake up tomorrow.</i>

329
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:09,445
<i>None of us will.</i>

330
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,754
Baby, I'm sorry.

331
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,691
I love you.

332
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,794
I love you.

333
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,050
Hello! Help!

334
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,319
Help, help!

335
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:43,325
Help, help, help!

336
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:47,930
Help, help, help!

337
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,334
My son and my wife
they need water.

338
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:30,172
Here, here, wet their lips.

339
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:31,707
With what?

340
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,275
It's fresh water.

341
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,677
Oh...

342
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,181
Jules.

343
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:43,452
Come here.

344
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,054
Come here.

345
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,390
I got water there.

346
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:53,696
No, no, put it on her neck,
put it on her neck.

347
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:56,965
The skin is thin there,
it'll suck in the moisture.

348
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,734
I'm a doctor.

349
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:04,740
Exactly. Okay.

350
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:07,743
Now get her wrist,
get her wrist.

351
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,417
Come on, water.

352
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:26,161
We have water, we've got water.

353
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:33,302
How long you been out here?

354
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:34,369
A few days.

355
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,071
- Days?
- Days.

356
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:36,071
What happened?

357
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:40,509
We're staying at a resort
and I rented this boat

358
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:44,413
and then the engine
just wouldn't start.

359
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,448
Drifted out to sea and...

360
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,417
But my son I need to
get him to the hospital.

361
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,920
He won't last much longer,
please.

362
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:54,523
Let me take the kid.

363
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:11,774
Come on, babe, we're going home.

364
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm... I'm Kevin,
this is my wife, Julie.

365
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:13,235
And I just want to say
we're gonna be forever

366
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:16,905
grateful for what
you've done for us.

367
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:21,610
What is your name?

368
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:25,547
Listen, man, I want to help you.

369
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,883
I want to save you
and your family, okay?

370
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:29,051
Okay.

371
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,485
But I would like
a reward, you know,

372
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:33,088
a compensation for
saving your lives.

373
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,558
Yes, of course, definitely.

374
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,394
I swear to you
you'll be very happy.

375
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:43,932
Yeah, but I would like to
agree on the price right now.

376
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:51,440
Of... of course,
anything you want.

377
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:54,576
Uh...

378
00:30:54,578 --> 00:31:02,217
Ten... thousand.
$10,000, $10,000.

379
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:09,524
Forty, forty, that's everything
that we have in our savings.

380
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,593
I'll give you $40,000.

381
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:16,565
How much is your
family's life worth?

382
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:20,969
I want one million dollars.

383
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,941
I don't... I don't have
a million dollars.

384
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:25,941
But you're a doctor right?

385
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:29,645
Yes, I'm a doctor but I
work at a county hospital.

386
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:33,115
We don't even make
anything like that.

387
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:39,488
Listen, man,
I have a family, too.

388
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,359
Y'all come down here and
spend $10,000 on one vacation.

389
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:49,598
That's more than I made this
whole year, for four people.

390
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,300
I need a million
dollars or I'm leaving.

391
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,636
- Make up your mind.
- No, no, you can't leave us.

392
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,139
You can't leave us,
you can't be serious.

393
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:57,139
We'll die out here.

394
00:31:57,141 --> 00:32:02,077
You said you have a family,
and I've offered you $40,000.

395
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,446
$40,000, isn't that enough?

396
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:06,982
- Not for me.
- Wait, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

397
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:09,284
- Please don't go.
- One million
dollars or no deal.

398
00:32:09,286 --> 00:32:11,653
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
you can't leave my family here.

399
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,056
One million dollars or no deal.

400
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:17,092
I don't have a million dollars.

401
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:21,029
My son is six years
old you motherfucker.

402
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,577
You can die here.

403
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,612
Or we can go to town.

404
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:42,150
Call one of your rich
friends get my money

405
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:43,986
and your family lives.

406
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:46,621
I'll get money,
just get us off the island

407
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:47,990
and I'll get you
a million dollars.

408
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,524
- You sure?
- Yeah.

409
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,026
Good.

410
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:57,159
Wake up.

411
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:17,412
Where's my... where's my wife,
and my... and my son?

412
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:20,582
My son?

413
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,120
Back on the island.

414
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,824
Why? We agreed.

415
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:34,162
Listen to me.
We have to go to the bank
and transfer the money.

416
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,631
And then we go back
to the island with

417
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:41,103
the second boat so you
can get your family.

418
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:41,103
But they don't have any water.

419
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:45,540
They had enough water,
listen carefully.

420
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,177
Think about your family,
your family is on the line.

421
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,247
You do anything stupid your
family's gonna die okay?

422
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:54,382
- Why are you doing this?
- By the morning
they're gonna die.

423
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,152
- Shut the fuck up.
- Don't do anything stupid.

424
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:59,187
Don't tell the police
or anyone else,

425
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:01,756
because if you do
I won't tell anyone anything.

426
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:05,127
I will say this guy is a liar.

427
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:07,395
Turn around go back, please.

428
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,164
Turn around and go back, please.

429
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,700
I swear to god,
I'll still pay you the money.

430
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:11,700
Just take me back, please.

431
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:15,203
I swear to god I'll
still give you the money.

432
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,172
I'll give you the money!

433
00:35:17,174 --> 00:35:19,875
Let's make sure you do that.

434
00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:54,242
So I'm in town
and I'm coming right now.

435
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,945
Okay, alright.

436
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:01,183
Just make sure you text me
the account number right away.

437
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,517
Yeah.

438
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,187
Okay, good.

439
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,966
All right, don't mess with me,
man, I'm on the way right now.

440
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:20,402
Jorge!

441
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:24,472
Bye.

442
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:38,587
There are thousands
of islands back there.

443
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:42,691
I am the only one
who knows where your family is.

444
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:45,227
So don't do anything stupid.

445
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,267
Here, clean up.

446
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:00,008
Jimmy, it's Kevin.

447
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,544
I'm in a lot of trouble,
I need money today.

448
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:03,945
I don't even have time to
talk about this right now

449
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:07,315
but you have to do something
for me immediately.

450
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:09,918
I can't tell you right now.
It's about Andy and Julie.

451
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,753
Just wire it.

452
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,690
You have my bank information,
just get it to me.

453
00:37:19,462 --> 00:37:22,330
Put me in with
Dr. zett's office, please.

454
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:25,267
Can't talk about it right now,
I'm in a bad situation.

455
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:25,267
What do you mean?

456
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:30,038
Nine zero five six
four nine eight three.

457
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,742
Hello, can you hear me?
I need money.

458
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:38,046
No, no, no, no, not next week,
it has to be now.

459
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,015
Richard, Richard, Richard,
I've been waiting

460
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:42,450
on the phone for
you for ten minutes.

461
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,386
Ten minutes I've been
sitting here waiting for you.

462
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:48,056
No, no, no, no, no,
I cannot wait.

463
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,357
I cannot wait!

464
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,625
Yes!

465
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:54,829
Get him on the phone,
get him on the phone!

466
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:57,766
Fuck!

467
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:07,008
Lucas, Lucas, it's... it's
Kevin, can you hear me?

468
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,044
Listen, I know that
you always said that

469
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:12,981
you wanted to repay me
for what I did for Margie.

470
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:14,849
Well, now's the day.

471
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,687
Take me to the bank.

472
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,803
How can I help you?

473
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:37,405
I need to check my account.

474
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,974
Can I have your card?

475
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:41,810
Thank you, Mr. Riley.

476
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:08,770
Anything else I can
do for you today?

477
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:15,477
Have a good day.

478
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:21,149
This wasn't the deal.

479
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,417
You can either
take that money now

480
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:24,419
or you can take nothing!

481
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,454
If you don't take my money,

482
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:30,959
if you don't tell me where
my wife and my child are,

483
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:30,959
you're gonna be looking
over your shoulder

484
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:36,064
for the rest of your short,
agonizing, miserable life,

485
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,132
because I'm gonna take your face

486
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,767
and break it in half with my

487
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:41,636
fucking hands you understand me?

488
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:53,748
I need to know that
we have a deal.

489
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,483
Transfer it.

490
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:57,018
Anything else?

491
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,487
Thank you.

492
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,425
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

493
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,927
I want to transfer to
that account number please.

494
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:08,196
- The whole amount?
- The entire balance.

495
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,564
Sure thing.

496
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:18,940
Yeah. Wired two minutes ago,
you got it?

497
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:22,710
Okay, okay, we're good.

498
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:24,813
Okay, it's good.

499
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:33,688
Okay, come.

500
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,824
You can follow us in this one.

501
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,099
Hey, why are you locking me in?

502
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,134
Okay, for your own
safety and everyone's.

503
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,669
Don't communicate with anyone.

504
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:23,271
- Open... open the door!
- Listen, listen.

505
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,507
When we get to the
island I will let you out

506
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,208
but first you have
to wait one hour

507
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,576
after we leave, then you leave.

508
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:30,712
- No, open it up!
- Don't worry.

509
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:34,649
Hey, hey, I don't know how to
get back, it's gonna be dark!

510
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:37,051
Okay, Jorge, let's go.

511
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,199
Hey!

512
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:08,069
Hey, what are you doing?

513
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:13,975
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

514
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,279
I gave you all that money.

515
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:22,750
I swear on my son's life I will
never tell anyone about this.

516
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:24,419
You got the money.

517
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,724
What are you doing?

518
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,928
Jorge, back, back, go back!

519
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,730
Back, back.

520
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:38,433
I will tell you, stay back.

521
00:44:38,435 --> 00:44:39,467
Please!

522
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,739
I paid you the money!
I gave you everything I have.

523
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:47,241
Why are you doing this?

524
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:48,976
Please just take me
back to my family.

525
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,079
I swear to god
I'll never tell anybody.

526
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:52,780
How do I know you won't
tell your government?

527
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:55,049
I won't tell anybody, I swear.

528
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:56,718
You'll tell your government
and they can

529
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,853
look for me and arrest me,
you think I'm stupid?

530
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:00,154
No.

531
00:45:01,257 --> 00:45:04,792
I'll never tell anybody, please!

532
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:06,728
Don't let them die!

533
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,864
Don't you let them die!

534
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:11,265
Please!

535
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,036
You've got the money!

536
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:18,239
Do not leave my
family on that island!

537
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,774
Please!

538
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:24,445
Don't you let them die!

539
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:34,061
Hey, grab
the lifesaver, grab it.

540
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:35,262
Pull him in, pull him in now.

541
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:08,162
Mr. Riley,
detective constable haagen.

542
00:50:08,164 --> 00:50:09,764
We spoke on the phone.

543
00:50:09,766 --> 00:50:12,400
The us embassy
has been notified,

544
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:13,801
and the us coast guard captain

545
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:18,639
will guide you through
the rescue plan.

546
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,775
- How's your leg?
- I'll live.

547
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:23,310
Now we're right here,
and these are the islands

548
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,514
where you most likely made
your initial landfall,

549
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:28,182
and then you drifted
at sea for at least

550
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:31,118
one full day and night
more likely going

551
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,355
north northeast following
the prevailing currents.

552
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:37,258
They move at about four,
four and a half knots.

553
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,093
That potentially
takes us out another

554
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:42,163
150 nautical miles
from these islands.

555
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:42,163
We have an initial search area.

556
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:49,370
It's about 2,000 square miles,
roughly the same size as
the state of Delaware.

557
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:51,238
And inside that
search area there are

558
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,474
hundreds of islands and keys.

559
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:55,810
We can do this, it's just
gonna take some time.

560
00:50:55,812 --> 00:50:59,113
Okay, realistically how long
to search the entire area?

561
00:50:59,115 --> 00:51:03,684
A major search and rescue operation
like this can take weeks.

562
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:07,588
Weeks? They're gonna be dead
before the sun rises, weeks?

563
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,356
Mr. Riley,
the ships are in preparation

564
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,459
to deploy in about three hours.

565
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:13,127
And that's gonna
put us at this first

566
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:14,862
chain of islands
just before dawn.

567
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,298
Don't helicopters have lights?

568
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,600
Yeah, but it's virtually
impossible to spot

569
00:51:19,602 --> 00:51:22,503
two unconscious people
on an unknown island

570
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:24,738
in the dark,
even with night vision.

571
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,109
There's nothing
we can do right now.

572
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:31,378
What about the fisherman?

573
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,180
We have to focus on your family

574
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:34,482
and then we'll
find the fisherman.

575
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:36,584
Why don't we go for
the fisherman right now?

576
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:38,853
Let's talk alone, please.

577
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:46,193
How do you suppose
we get this guy?

578
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:47,294
You don't know his name,

579
00:51:47,296 --> 00:51:49,630
you don't know the
vessel hull number.

580
00:51:49,632 --> 00:51:52,299
I told you on the
phone his name is Jorge.

581
00:51:52,301 --> 00:51:53,301
Jorge.

582
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:58,839
Mr. Riley, be realistic.

583
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:04,912
Most likely, Jorge,
is a Cuban migrant.

584
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:09,150
Most deckhands are immigrant
workers with no records at all.

585
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:14,155
I bet the fisherman is a migrant
himself, probably Haitian.

586
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:16,857
- What about the bank?
- We have the video.

587
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,193
We're looking into
the wire transaction

588
00:52:19,195 --> 00:52:22,163
and the receiving account
as we speak.

589
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:24,231
But this is the Caribbean.

590
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:26,367
I'm sure you know
that there's a lot

591
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:29,837
of shady stuff
going on in these banks.

592
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:36,510
Have you had any arguments
with your wife lately?

593
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,912
Why do you ask?

594
00:52:37,914 --> 00:52:43,384
Does your wife or your son
have life insurance?

595
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:50,791
No...
Yes, with our credit union.

596
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:56,897
Where did all the money
from your account come from?

597
00:52:56,899 --> 00:53:00,234
- What difference does it make?
- A big difference.

598
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:04,638
You rented a boat from a
local man away from the resort.

599
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,974
You don't have a
witness that saw

600
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,311
your wife or your son
get onto that boat.

601
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,814
Days later you show up at a bank

602
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:19,320
to complete a wire transfer
to an offshore account

603
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:25,326
accompanied by a
mysterious fisherman.

604
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:30,764
Mr. Riley,
is there actually a fisherman?

605
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:36,003
Is it possible that your family
was not on the boat as you said?

606
00:53:38,873 --> 00:53:40,507
Are you serious?

607
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:43,944
You're wondering if I'm lying?

608
00:53:43,946 --> 00:53:45,646
You're wondering
if I would do something

609
00:53:45,648 --> 00:53:48,849
to harm my six year old son
and my wife?

610
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:52,519
I don't know who
the fisherman is,

611
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:57,725
but I know he left my wife
and my son on an island to die.

612
00:53:57,727 --> 00:54:01,262
Right now they are dying
of severe dehydration

613
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:05,899
and thirst,
unless we go out and save them.

614
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:10,271
You look exhausted.

615
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:13,407
You need to get some rest before
the search starts tomorrow.

616
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:16,777
I'll take you back to the hotel.

617
00:54:16,779 --> 00:54:19,713
We're going to find
your family, Mr. Riley.

618
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,683
We're going to find them.

619
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:21,408
I have a family, too.

620
00:55:24,546 --> 00:55:26,914
Text me the account number.

621
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:32,052
There are dozens
of islands back there.

622
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:36,690
I am the only one who
knows where your family is.

623
00:56:06,955 --> 00:56:10,090
- Damn it.
- Checking out the scores?

624
00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:14,428
Yeah me, too. I tell you,
it's the only thing
that keeps me sane.

625
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:18,632
Family has fun and whatnot
and we go to the beach, and...

626
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:22,136
But I've been stuck, you know,
with my wife and the kids

627
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:26,173
in the same hotel room for a
week now, you know what I mean?

628
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:28,575
Don't get me wrong,
you know, it's a nice place.

629
00:56:28,577 --> 00:56:30,477
I like it here, the family does.

630
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:31,745
You fish?

631
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:35,149
Big game fishing,
one of my favorite sports.

632
00:56:35,151 --> 00:56:39,119
I placed third in this one.
You know, I also fish marlin...

633
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:42,156
What do you do with the
fish after you catch them?

634
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:45,459
Throw it back in, or sell it.

635
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:46,927
Who do you sell it to?

636
00:56:46,929 --> 00:56:48,128
Fish suppliers.

637
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,797
Thank you.

638
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:51,799
Hey, anytime.

639
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:57,204
Detective,
if this guy's a fisherman
then he has to have a buyer.

640
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,740
He's got to have somebody
that he sells his fish
to regularly

641
00:56:59,742 --> 00:57:01,108
and I think we can
track him that way.

642
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:05,112
Do you know how much resources
it would take to do that?

643
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:09,616
And if by some miracle we do track
him down through the buyer,

644
00:57:09,618 --> 00:57:13,454
there's no guarantee that the fisherman
will talk in time to save your family.

645
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:16,623
- I'll make him talk.
- The plan is to search and rescue.

646
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,960
We do not have all
the resources possible

647
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:19,960
so you have to bear with us.

648
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:23,664
Let me jump in here. Mr. Riley,
let me introduce myself.

649
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,233
I'm Brian sweeney,
I'm deputy chief of
mission United States embassy.

650
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:29,102
- Can I have a word with you?
- We're on the case, okay?

651
00:57:29,104 --> 00:57:31,071
Look, I know the
detective personally.

652
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,573
He's a good man,
he's been around the block.

653
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:34,908
Let's let him find
the fisherman, all right?

654
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,211
But in the meantime I need
every available resource

655
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:40,214
out there searching for your
family and that includes you.

656
00:57:40,216 --> 00:57:43,150
You have the 100%
cooperation and backing

657
00:57:43,152 --> 00:57:45,219
of the United States embassy.

658
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:46,487
- Let them do their job.
- Thank you.

659
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:47,754
- Okay?
- Thank you.

660
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,190
Hey, Mr. Riley.

661
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,793
- Yeah.
- Don't go too far.

662
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:55,496
They're expecting you
at the base in an hour.

663
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,264
I'm just gonna go up to my room,
I'll be back in a minute.

664
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,533
In an hour, Mr. Riley.

665
00:58:03,738 --> 00:58:05,205
Hey, can I get a taxi?

666
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:06,273
Right away.

667
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,008
Taxi.

668
00:58:09,677 --> 00:58:11,245
Thank you.

669
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:14,748
Where to, boss?

670
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,050
Where do fishermen
sell their fish around here?

671
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:18,685
We can go to the market
if it's still open.

672
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:20,621
- Let's go.
- All right.

673
00:59:08,303 --> 00:59:11,204
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a couple of fishermen

674
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:14,608
that may be doing business here,
one is, uh... Haitian.

675
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,710
He's really thin,
he's probably 40 years old,

676
00:59:16,712 --> 00:59:18,278
average height,
do you know somebody like that?

677
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,747
I don't know anybody,
there's this guy named Roger.

678
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:20,747
He knows all of them.

679
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:23,317
Maybe you can catch him
at the loading dock.

680
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:26,820
- He drives a brown Van.
- Thank you. Thanks.

681
00:59:45,006 --> 00:59:47,874
Hey, stop the Van!

682
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:50,077
Hey, stop!

683
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:53,046
I'm sorry, man.

684
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,148
I was told that you might be
able to help me with something.

685
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,950
I'm looking for a
couple of fisherman

686
00:59:56,952 --> 00:59:58,352
who probably do business here.

687
00:59:58,354 --> 01:00:00,754
One is Haitian and he's
got a guy he works with.

688
01:00:00,756 --> 01:00:02,856
His name is Jorge, he's latino.

689
01:00:02,858 --> 01:00:04,024
Does the name ring a bell or...?

690
01:00:04,026 --> 01:00:06,193
- No, man.
- What about the boat?

691
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:07,828
Pretty rusty antennas going...

692
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,230
I been doing this for
30 years, I would know.

693
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,633
No one we deal
with comes to mind.

694
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:14,701
How do you know those guys
are here at the market?

695
01:00:14,703 --> 01:00:17,704
There are hundreds of boats
and owners all over the islands.

696
01:00:17,706 --> 01:00:19,373
What if I were to hire
somebody like a deckhand,

697
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,875
you know, somebody to work
on my boat for me with me?

698
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:24,745
You can try the...
The harbor in the morning.

699
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,947
Okay, night fishing. What if I
wanted to hire someone tonight?

700
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:28,882
How would I do that?

701
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,954
If you are desperate
there's a bar by the harbor.

702
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:36,823
They all hang out there, easy.

703
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:53,974
Hey, man.

704
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,456
Uh, guys, excuse me.

705
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,826
Hey, um, I'm looking for a guy
by the name of Jorge.

706
01:01:12,828 --> 01:01:14,995
- Do you by any chance know...
- What do you need?

707
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:16,396
- Huh?
- What do you need?

708
01:01:16,398 --> 01:01:17,798
Deck hand for my boat.

709
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,433
Oh, got a couple of
guys here you know?

710
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,702
No, no, it's okay, I just
want to hire the guy Jorge.

711
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:25,305
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, that guy, blue shirt.

712
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:33,747
Jorge.

713
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:35,182
Yes?

714
01:01:37,852 --> 01:01:39,086
Sorry.

715
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:40,021
Haagen.

716
01:01:40,022 --> 01:01:42,889
Detective are there any
leads on the fisherman?

717
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:43,990
<i>Where are you?</i>

718
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,426
This is starting
to look very suspicious.

719
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:46,426
What are you not telling me?

720
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:50,030
I cannot just sit on my ass
and wait for the sun to come up.

721
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:53,366
I need you to tell me
where you are, immediately.

722
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:53,366
Okay, you know what, you call me

723
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:57,738
if there's any
further developments.

724
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:00,907
I'm telling you, my friend,
something's going on.

725
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:04,111
From the first time I saw him
I know something was wrong.

726
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:05,879
Yeah.

727
01:02:14,422 --> 01:02:17,791
What's up, boss, where to now?

728
01:02:19,495 --> 01:02:21,294
I don't know.

729
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,233
What you looking for, man?

730
01:02:27,468 --> 01:02:28,835
Do you want some girls?

731
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:32,906
- No, no, girls.
- Okay.

732
01:02:32,908 --> 01:02:38,011
Here, you know what, I'm gonna
give you 100 bucks just to wait.

733
01:02:38,013 --> 01:02:40,781
- No problem, man.
- Where'd you get that scar?

734
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:43,850
Oh, man, I was cooking some
swordfish and a bone sliced it,

735
01:02:43,852 --> 01:02:46,019
almost cut my finger off.

736
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:48,955
Where did you get the sutures?

737
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:52,092
- What?
- Stitches, who fixed you up?

738
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,860
Oh, they did it
at the hospital, man.

739
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:54,961
Which one, how many
are there around here?

740
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:56,463
There's only one.

741
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:08,809
Excuse me, I have a leg wound

742
01:03:08,811 --> 01:03:10,544
that is showing
signs of infection.

743
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:12,813
- Please, first door.
- Thank you.

744
01:03:12,815 --> 01:03:14,214
Okay.

745
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:19,486
Please, listen to me.

746
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:21,922
A few days ago, I took a
boat ride with my family.

747
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:25,826
We got stranded on an
island and a fisherman

748
01:03:25,828 --> 01:03:27,594
asked us for a lot
of money to save us.

749
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:30,430
He took me back to
the shore and he left

750
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,566
my wife and my child
on the island.

751
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:34,568
After he received the money
he tried to drown me

752
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,870
and then he just disappeared.

753
01:03:36,872 --> 01:03:39,606
My wife and my son
are still out on that island,

754
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:43,143
and they have severe
dehydration right now.

755
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:46,847
The fisherman is Haitian
about 40 years old.

756
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:49,382
- He's very thin really, really thin.
- Sir, please.

757
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:52,853
He's average height,
but he's got a deep laceration

758
01:03:52,855 --> 01:03:55,989
on his inner tricep
and the sutures are fresh.

759
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:57,390
They can't be more
than a week old

760
01:03:57,392 --> 01:04:00,861
and I think that
he got them here.

761
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,998
I need, I need his information.

762
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,871
Look, look, I'm a doctor, too.

763
01:04:10,873 --> 01:04:15,008
Good, then you should know
I can't do that.

764
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,910
I didn't come
here for treatment.

765
01:04:16,912 --> 01:04:18,879
That man is the only person

766
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:18,879
who knows where my
wife and my son are.

767
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:21,948
- Sorry, sir we can't...
- Listen to me, the only person...

768
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,885
Sir, we can't give out
any patient's information

769
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,419
unless you're a police.

770
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:28,288
You should know that,
you're a doctor, right?

771
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,556
He'll never talk to the police.

772
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:32,592
The only person
he's gonna talk to is me.

773
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:37,264
Look, that's my wife,
that's my wife.

774
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:40,934
That's us,
that's my wife and my son.

775
01:04:40,936 --> 01:04:42,502
That's my wife and my son.

776
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:46,006
That man is the only
person who knows

777
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,041
where my wife and my son are.

778
01:04:48,043 --> 01:04:50,510
He's not gonna tell
the police anything.

779
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,480
I need his
information for myself.

780
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:55,248
- Sorry, sir.
- Please.

781
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,617
I can't do that.

782
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:00,654
Yes, you can.

783
01:05:00,656 --> 01:05:04,658
I can't do that but I'm going
to step out for a minute, okay?

784
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:12,666
<i>Dr. clergen,
we need your assistance.</i>

785
01:05:12,668 --> 01:05:14,935
<i>Dr. clergen,
we need your assistance.</i>

786
01:05:14,937 --> 01:05:16,670
<i>Please dial in at once.</i>

787
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,739
"Miguel kaba."

788
01:05:56,043 --> 01:05:58,578
I got you, you son of a bitch.

789
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:56,770
I want you to wait here.

790
01:06:56,772 --> 01:06:58,772
A man is going to come with me.

791
01:06:58,774 --> 01:07:02,609
If you don't ask any questions
I'm gonna give you another $100.

792
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:47,413
Who's this?

793
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:50,483
I'm looking for Miguel.

794
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:55,388
Who's this?

795
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:01,461
I need a man with a boat.

796
01:09:01,463 --> 01:09:03,663
I was told down in the
Marina by some guys

797
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:07,200
that he's good,
so I want to hire him.

798
01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:19,779
Go away, go away now.

799
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,181
I'm not gonna hurt you.

800
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:22,315
Do not touch my daughter!

801
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:22,315
I just need to
know where Miguel is.

802
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:26,352
- I don't know! - I swear to you, I'm
not gonna hurt your child or you.

803
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,887
I just need to know,
where is Miguel?

804
01:09:27,889 --> 01:09:29,656
I don't know,
I say I don't know!

805
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:30,790
I know he lives here!

806
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,293
- Get back!
- What about Jorge?

807
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:34,961
- I don't know.
- Where is Jorge?

808
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:34,961
I know you know Jorge,
where is he?

809
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:39,933
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know!

810
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:54,280
Where is he? Where is he?

811
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,292
Gpc 9243.

812
01:10:31,285 --> 01:10:32,919
Take me back there.

813
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:34,320
I don't know what
you're talking about.

814
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:36,923
Take me back there
right this fucking second.

815
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:38,858
You kidnapped my
wife and my son!

816
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,860
Fuck you.

817
01:10:48,269 --> 01:10:50,303
- Take me back there!
- Fuck you!

818
01:10:50,305 --> 01:10:54,574
You're fucking taking me back.
You have to take me back there.

819
01:10:54,576 --> 01:10:56,342
Take me back to my family!

820
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,345
Take me back.

821
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:07,053
Let him go, now, now!

822
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,394
Papa.

823
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:15,495
Go back, go back!

824
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:18,865
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

825
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:22,035
- Let her go!
- Put that thing down!

826
01:11:22,037 --> 01:11:23,369
How does it feel?

827
01:11:23,371 --> 01:11:25,405
Swear to god somebody's
gonna get hurt!

828
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,572
Put it down!

829
01:11:29,477 --> 01:11:31,044
You put it down!

830
01:11:32,647 --> 01:11:35,448
No, no!

831
01:11:47,394 --> 01:11:48,695
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

832
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:54,067
I'm gonna kill you.

833
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:27,527
It's a gruesome
scene at that house.

834
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,128
That was self-defense.

835
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:32,665
Listen to me,
I have the hull number.

836
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,467
That means we can locate Jorge.

837
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:38,070
Mr. Riley, you're responsible
for the murder of two people,

838
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,472
including a little girl.

839
01:13:39,474 --> 01:13:40,973
- That was an accident.
- You're hereby

840
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:42,842
held into custody,
you held her at knife point

841
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:45,211
before slitting her
father's throat.

842
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:50,016
No, I... I didn't kill her,
I did not, I'm innocent.

843
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:52,018
You transferred a
large amount of money

844
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,121
and were implicated in a
double homicide after that.

845
01:13:55,123 --> 01:13:57,557
The fisherman made
me transfer the money.

846
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,225
There's a boat sunk in the sea.

847
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,893
What do you...
What do you think I did?

848
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,830
You think I tried to fake
drown myself in a boat?

849
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:06,065
Well, it looks like
you were either involved

850
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,600
in a money laundering scheme,

851
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:10,203
or you paid the fisherman
to get rid of your family

852
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:11,671
and then you got rid of him.

853
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:13,539
I'm not talking to you anymore.
I'm not talking...

854
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,541
- I'm talking to him.
- Be my guest.

855
01:14:15,543 --> 01:14:17,910
Listen, I got
the number for the boat.

856
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:17,910
You need to stop
talking right now.

857
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,081
All right, this no longer a
missing persons investigation.

858
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,617
This is now a homicide,
you need to get a lawyer.

859
01:14:24,619 --> 01:14:26,185
- Gpc 9243.
- Are you listening to me?

860
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:27,787
That means we can get to Jorge,

861
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:27,787
- we can make him lead...
- Our office can prevent...

862
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:33,092
Forget Jorge, Mr. Riley,
the search has been called off.

863
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,228
- Okay, the search is over.
- What, why?

864
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,730
Why? Because you're
an American citizen

865
01:14:37,732 --> 01:14:39,632
who is in custody and they
just think you murdered

866
01:14:39,634 --> 01:14:41,234
two of their nationals,
that's why.

867
01:14:41,236 --> 01:14:43,569
What are you gonna do, you gonna
leave them out there to die?!

868
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:44,637
It's not what I'm gonna do.

869
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:46,205
Mr. Riley,
there's nothing I can do.

870
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:48,674
They no longer believe
that your story is credible

871
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:50,576
so they are calling
off the search.

872
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:53,279
Okay, you got to understand that
this is a tourist nation, all right?

873
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,014
They rely heavily on tourists.

874
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:55,014
I don't give a fuck!

875
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:57,817
Okay, listen the
last thing they want is

876
01:14:57,819 --> 01:15:00,219
a media shit storm
that they think is started

877
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:01,888
by someone who they
consider a murderer.

878
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:04,290
All right, so just take my
advice...

879
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,025
What do you think I'm doing?
Why do you think I'm lying?

880
01:15:06,027 --> 01:15:07,293
You have got to
keep your mouth shut!

881
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,561
What makes you think I'm lying?

882
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:10,530
No we went to a hotel,
we checked in,

883
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:10,530
my wife and son,
then we went on a ride...

884
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:10,530
- Mr. Riley, I'm trying to help you.
- And then the fisherman...

885
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:10,530
- I'm trying to help you.
- Left my wife and my son...

886
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:15,801
- There's nothing else that I can do
for you, listen. - To die, to die!

887
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:19,939
My hands are tied.
I'm trying to help and I am going to do...

888
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:21,874
- what if you're wrong? What if
you're wrong? - It doesn't matter.

889
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:21,874
- Mr. Riley listen to me. - You're
gonna have blood on your hands, man!

890
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:21,874
- Listen to me, you are under
investigation. - You're gonna have two

891
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:21,874
- innocent people.
- You're about to get

892
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:27,146
transferred, you are
gonna get transferred to a

893
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:30,182
secure facility where you will
receive medical treatment.

894
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:31,851
Just take him away, please.

895
01:15:31,853 --> 01:15:35,321
Mr. Riley, Mr. Riley calm down.

896
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,990
Jesus Christ!

897
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:42,028
- Get back, get back.
- I got back.

898
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:45,565
Get back, uncuff me.

899
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:46,933
- Uncuff him.
- Get back!

900
01:15:46,935 --> 01:15:48,067
Okay.

901
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:50,836
I did not kill that girl!

902
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,638
It was an accident!

903
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
And my wife and my son
are out there!

904
01:15:54,642 --> 01:15:58,644
- I... Kevin, I believe you.
- No, you don't.

905
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:05,017
You follow me...

906
01:16:06,987 --> 01:16:08,621
I'll shoot.

907
01:16:08,623 --> 01:16:10,323
I'll shoot.

908
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:21,133
He's armed and dangerous.

909
01:17:43,183 --> 01:17:44,917
Kevin!

910
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,782
<i>All units on a high alert.</i>

911
01:20:00,287 --> 01:20:02,555
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning.

912
01:20:02,557 --> 01:20:04,523
I don't mean to be rude,
I'm just in a real hurry.

913
01:20:04,525 --> 01:20:07,092
- Yes?
- Last night, I was out with a couple guys

914
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,561
and they told me they're
going shark fishing

915
01:20:08,563 --> 01:20:10,429
and I've actually
never been before

916
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:12,031
and I kind of missed
them this morning

917
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:13,833
and I don't know
where their boat is.

918
01:20:13,835 --> 01:20:16,202
So I kind of need to
know where it's docked.

919
01:20:16,204 --> 01:20:19,305
I can't help you without a
last name and a hull number.

920
01:20:19,307 --> 01:20:23,142
Miguel kaba is his name,
and he mentioned

921
01:20:23,144 --> 01:20:28,247
that the hull number
was gpc 9243.

922
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,292
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

923
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:46,031
Miguel kaba,
number c-four-four-zero-zero.

924
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:48,567
- Slip 37, compass king.
- How do I get there?

925
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:50,569
Oh, you have to
take the north ferry,

926
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:53,005
- it's about an hour from here.
- Thank you.

927
01:20:53,874 --> 01:20:53,873
Wait.

928
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:58,510
Actually, the lease was
terminated on the slip yesterday.

929
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:00,479
Are you saying that
the boat isn't there?

930
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:00,479
That's right, man.

931
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:04,183
Sorry, but your fishing trip
might not happen after all.

932
01:21:04,185 --> 01:21:06,085
You know you can rent a boat

933
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:08,554
from one of the locals
if you want.

934
01:21:38,386 --> 01:21:40,686
Everything
is coming, I promise you.

935
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,655
We'll go over everything...

936
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,593
I'll be back in the
office in a couple hours.

937
01:22:00,507 --> 01:22:01,674
United States embassy.

938
01:22:02,642 --> 01:22:05,644
Yes, sir, yes, please hold.

939
01:22:05,646 --> 01:22:08,981
- Sir, sir.  - This guy is on an
island with limited recourse.

940
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,050
- Sir!
- Get his wife's credit card... what?

941
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,484
It's him, line two.

942
01:22:12,486 --> 01:22:13,585
<i>Mr. Riley.</i>

943
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:15,654
Jorge has a cell phone.

944
01:22:15,656 --> 01:22:17,589
Mr. Riley you have
got to understand...

945
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:20,059
The fisherman called Jorge
on his phone

946
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:20,059
when we left the bank.

947
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:24,396
Being on the run, you are making
your case infinitely harder.

948
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,432
Jorge definitely
has a cell phone,

949
01:22:26,434 --> 01:22:28,033
so the only way
I'm gonna give myself up

950
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:31,403
is if you... you trace
his calls, you get him,

951
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:34,239
you bring him to
main square at noon,

952
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,976
and you have yourself,
the police, and a translator.

953
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:36,976
That's the only way I'm gonna
give myself up, do you hear me?

954
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:42,715
Mr. Riley, I promise you, I am gonna do
everything in my power to help you out

955
01:22:42,717 --> 01:22:45,117
<i>but I want you to
do me one favor.</i>

956
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:47,753
Don't do anything rash, okay?

957
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,088
<i>Mr. Riley?</i>

958
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,757
Mr. ri...

959
01:22:52,726 --> 01:22:54,026
Amber.

960
01:24:09,069 --> 01:24:10,769
- <i>Haagen.</i>
- You think you can outsmart me?

961
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:12,404
I told you
I would give myself up

962
01:24:12,406 --> 01:24:14,106
but only if you
let me see Jorge.

963
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:17,142
If you don't,
you're never gonna catch me.

964
01:24:17,144 --> 01:24:20,813
We called Jorge's number,
whoever picked up got spooked.

965
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:22,414
<i>The signal disappeared.</i>

966
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,450
If it was Jorge
then he's probably

967
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:28,120
on his way
off the island for good.

968
01:24:28,122 --> 01:24:33,258
Kevin, I believe you,
but you're wanted for murder.

969
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:37,563
In order to help you,
I need you to turn yourself in.

970
01:24:37,565 --> 01:24:42,167
Otherwise you're gonna spend
the rest of your life running.

971
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,771
<i>Kevin.</i>

972
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,707
Kevin.

973
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,840
Jorge?

974
01:26:32,745 --> 01:26:34,246
- Jorge!
- What's going on?

975
01:26:34,248 --> 01:26:37,649
Stop the bus, stop,
stop the bus.

976
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,318
Jorge, stop!

977
01:26:43,523 --> 01:26:46,558
Jorge, stop! Jorge!

978
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,727
Stop!

979
01:26:49,797 --> 01:26:51,330
Stop!

980
01:26:52,298 --> 01:26:53,532
Stop!

981
01:26:56,236 --> 01:26:59,671
Jorge, Jorge, stop.

982
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:02,307
My family, please.

983
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,982
My family!

984
01:27:09,984 --> 01:27:16,355
<i>Familia, familia. Familia!</i>

985
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:24,396
Please, no...
No<i> policia,</i> no<i> policia.</i>

986
01:27:24,398 --> 01:27:27,599
My family, where is my family?

987
01:27:28,268 --> 01:27:29,601
Please.

988
01:28:01,301 --> 01:28:03,402
Get back in your truck.

989
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:07,039
Move it a few feet forward.

990
01:28:11,644 --> 01:28:13,779
Couple feet,
that's it, that's it.

991
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:37,035
- Call for help.
- I don't have a phone.

992
01:28:56,356 --> 01:28:58,056
Jorge, Jorge.

993
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,525
Jorge.

994
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:05,397
Where is my family?

995
01:29:06,599 --> 01:29:10,535
Look, where is my family,
are they here?

996
01:29:11,104 --> 01:29:12,704
Are they here?

997
01:29:12,706 --> 01:29:14,406
Look on this map.

998
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:18,143
Where is my family?

999
01:29:19,379 --> 01:29:21,980
Which island, which island?

1000
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,149
Jorge. Jorge.

1001
01:29:24,684 --> 01:29:26,051
Jorge!

1002
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,154
You have to look!

1003
01:29:30,089 --> 01:29:31,790
You have to look!

1004
01:29:37,498 --> 01:29:39,097
Which one?

1005
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:47,572
Is it that one? Or is it
this one, which one is it?

1006
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:58,450
Where's the closest Marina?

1007
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:01,887
I'm taking your truck.

1008
01:30:10,163 --> 01:30:12,130
Where's the hospital?

1009
01:30:21,841 --> 01:30:25,877
Help me get him in the truck.
Take down the gate.

1010
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:35,654
Hey, hey, you take him
to the hospital.

1011
01:30:35,656 --> 01:30:37,622
Drive fast or he's gonna die.

1012
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,207
Sir.

1013
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:33,979
Can you take me to this island?

1014
01:31:34,514 --> 01:31:36,281
I'll pay you.

1015
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:37,616
How long will it take us?

1016
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:40,218
I have to take her
to fill up first.

1017
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,754
By nightfall, if we're lucky.

1018
01:31:45,558 --> 01:31:46,925
All right?

1019
01:31:59,673 --> 01:32:01,606
- Guys?
- - What's up, man, how can I help you?

1020
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:01,606
I'll pay you a lot of money

1021
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:01,606
if you take me
out to the island.

1022
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:04,976
Nah, man, we're all right,
we're good.

1023
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,546
Shit for five grand
I'll take you anywhere, bro.

1024
01:32:07,548 --> 01:32:09,180
- Fine.
- You got cash on you right now?

1025
01:32:09,182 --> 01:32:10,715
I'll pay you in full tomorrow.

1026
01:32:10,717 --> 01:32:10,715
I don't know you like that, man.

1027
01:32:10,717 --> 01:32:13,785
Get the fuck out of here,
man, with that bullshit.

1028
01:32:13,787 --> 01:32:15,620
You hear this dude?
Get in the back, babe.

1029
01:32:15,622 --> 01:32:17,622
No, man...

1030
01:32:17,624 --> 01:32:17,622
you get the fuck out of here.

1031
01:32:17,624 --> 01:32:17,622
Yo, calm down, brother.
This is my dad's boat,

1032
01:32:17,624 --> 01:32:21,092
all right.
Calm down, he's gonna kill me.

1033
01:32:23,196 --> 01:32:25,830
Get out! Untie it untie it.

1034
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:38,276
Yeah, he just took my boat.

1035
01:32:38,278 --> 01:32:40,245
Nah, some guy
just got on with a gun

1036
01:32:40,247 --> 01:32:41,646
and took my dad's boat,
you don't get it.

1037
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:43,348
He just ran off with it,
he pulled a gun on us.

1038
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,817
It's a yellow speedboat.

1039
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,062
<i>Stolen vessel description.</i>

1040
01:34:04,064 --> 01:34:05,797
<i>I repeat, stolen.</i>

1041
01:34:09,835 --> 01:34:11,903
<i>Yellow twin engine powerboat.</i>

1042
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:15,373
<i>Suspect is white male, late 30s.</i>

1043
01:34:41,934 --> 01:34:45,870
This is harbor patrol.
Shut off the engine.

1044
01:34:46,906 --> 01:34:49,908
Shut off your
engine, immediately.

1045
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:06,458
This is harbor patrol.

1046
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,893
Shut off your engine,
immediately.

1047
01:35:08,895 --> 01:35:10,495
We will open fire.

1048
01:35:11,731 --> 01:35:14,299
This is your last warning.

1049
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:40,759
Engage, engage, engage.

1050
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,117
Julie!

1051
01:38:21,587 --> 01:38:23,054
Jules!

1052
01:38:26,492 --> 01:38:28,092
Jules!

1053
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,327
Baby, I'm here.

1054
01:39:05,264 --> 01:39:08,032
Okay, let's get you some water.

1055
01:39:08,034 --> 01:39:10,401
Just a little. Just a little.

1056
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:14,973
Just take it off my finger,
that's it that's it.

1057
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:24,983
Daddy's here, I'm here.

1058
01:39:37,329 --> 01:39:40,264
Come on to daddy,
come on, come on, come on.

1059
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:43,234
Come on. Come on.

1060
01:39:43,236 --> 01:39:46,004
Come on, Andy, come on, come on.

1061
01:39:55,047 --> 01:39:58,383
Come on, boy, come on,
come on, come on.

1062
01:39:58,385 --> 01:40:00,518
Come on, boy, come on, come on.

1063
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,520
Come to me, boy, come.

1064
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,361
Come to me, come to me.

1065
01:40:10,363 --> 01:40:13,498
Come on.
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1066
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,769
I'm right here, boy.
Good, okay.

1067
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:35,420
That's it my boy
that's it, that-a-boy.

1068
01:40:56,075 --> 01:40:59,310
I told you everything
was gonna be okay, chief.

1069
01:40:59,312 --> 01:41:01,712
We're going home.

1070
01:41:27,573 --> 01:41:31,843
Baby, baby, let's go home.
