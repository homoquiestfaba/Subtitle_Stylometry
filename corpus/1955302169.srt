1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>We can now confirm the mysterious freezing
conditions falling over Gotham City</i>

2
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,353
<i>are a result of an attack by supervillains</i>

3
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:24,738
<i>believed to be connected to the sightings
of a giant monster roaming the streets.</i>

4
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,217
Scanning for target.

5
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,920
Target acquired.

6
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,563
Grandfather! No! What?

7
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,623
Oh, Pennyworth. I was pulling
an all-nighter but I guess I fell asleep.

8
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,060
Master Damian, as we've discussed
on previous occasions,

9
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,629
a young man must have adequate rest.

10
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,631
Those who wore the Robin mask
before you all...

11
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,468
Save the lectures, please. Like you didn't
hear about what happened last night.

12
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,237
Last night?

13
00:03:56,337 --> 00:04:00,307
You really didn't hear? Well, don't worry.
The rest of the world has.

14
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,710
A guy on the street
caught it on his handheld.

15
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,158
<i>I've got him, Batman.</i>

16
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,083
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

17
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,486
Let's just say it's a pretty
popular clip online.

18
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,668
<i>Hey, stop filming.</i>

19
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,161
I do see why this has caused you
a measure of distress, Master Damian.

20
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,665
But the clown prince of crime has
long been Batman's greatest enemy.

21
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,485
It is not surprising that you
found yourself at a disadvantage

22
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,087
in your first encounter with him.

23
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:34,925
Disadvantage!
I accidentally leapt off a building.

24
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:39,196
If Batman hadn't been there...
I don't think he's happy with me.

25
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:40,832
I wish Red Robin was here.

26
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:44,018
It would be good to talk to someone who's
been through the Robin training before.

27
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:48,139
It is unfortunate that Master Tim's work
with his team keeps him away so much.

28
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:51,609
- But you could speak with Master Dick.
- Nightwing?

29
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,625
He's not really giving off
come-talk-to-me vibes right now.

30
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:04,134
Master Bruce. I have prepared tea.

31
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,272
Thank you, Alfred.

32
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,762
Studying. Good.

33
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,831
That's what I was trying
to tell Pennyworth.

34
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,133
I'm familiarizing myself
with your biggest villains.

35
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,570
Not good if it keeps him up all night,
if I may say.

36
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,039
And where have you been, sir?

37
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,726
On patrol. Some trouble
in the Bowery. Handled.

38
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,279
Hey, who is this little guy?

39
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,132
Oswald Cobblepot. The Penguin.

40
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:34,969
- Criminal kingpin.
- How come I haven't seen him around yet?

41
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,884
I sent him away for a while.

42
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,093
That cursed Batman.

43
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,519
It's all his fault. Did I deserve this?

44
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:55,401
Being stranded up here for over a year?

45
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:02,445
I just tried to make Gotham City
a more livable place for criminal...

46
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,498
people like me.

47
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,994
And the Batman always ruins everything.

48
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,371
I should be ruling Gotham City,

49
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:16,089
not stuck in Mr. Freeze's lab
of half-working machines.

50
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,560
What? I actually caught something.

51
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,066
Bah! Barely a minnow.

52
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,797
You take it, buzz.

53
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,234
You know, you're the only one
here I can talk to.

54
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,651
You understand me.

55
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,213
Oh, is it here?
Where did I put those things?

56
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:55,761
Oh, great. Mr. Fun is back.

57
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,955
What's got your thermals
in a bunch, Freeze?

58
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,592
Solitude. That's all that I ask for.

59
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:09,042
And yet wretched humanity
keeps intruding upon me.

60
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,867
Wretched humanity?

61
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,905
If this is your way of saying you
don't want me as a roommate anymore,

62
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,673
the feeling's mutual.

63
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,445
Just drop me off in Gotham City.
I won't take it personally.

64
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,781
No, not you, Penguin.

65
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,230
My territory has been invaded.

66
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:36,623
A new oil drilling platform
here on the ice pack?

67
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,944
Maybe they can get me
back to civilization.

68
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,379
For the 1,000th time,

69
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,633
you'll be much happier once
you've turned your back on humanity.

70
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,682
Living among them brings nothing but...

71
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,652
misery.

72
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,822
Here we go.

73
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,193
- What's that?
- One of my inventions.

74
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,285
The key to our solitude.

75
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:08,072
Our solitude? Great.

76
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:12,826
My device can transform a simple
animal like this tiny isopod,

77
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,241
into a monster.

78
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,138
Yes. We shall defend what is ours.

79
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,392
Come, beast!

80
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,084
Come on, Buzz.
We might as well see the show.

81
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,471
Drill coming in. Get ready for setup.

82
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,219
Your occupation of my land
must come to an end.

83
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,567
You shall return from whence you came.

84
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,509
Don't feign ignorance, you gadflies.

85
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,623
My monster.

86
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,861
Attack!

87
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:09,143
Now, fools, you know the consequences
of crossing Dr. Victor Fries.

88
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:14,198
Well, Mr. Freeze is crazy.
But he's always entertaining.

89
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:17,618
How could you even hope
to defend yourselves?

90
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,987
You are powerless.

91
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,923
Victor, they are roughnecks.

92
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,473
Obviously here to drill.
They might have...

93
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,177
Yeah, one of those.

94
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,974
Darn! How dare you defy me.

95
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,434
- In your face!
- Laugh while you can.

96
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:11,050
My next monster will eradicate you!

97
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,722
Next monster?

98
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,698
Victor, wait!

99
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:24,868
Leave me alone. I need to plan.

100
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:29,218
You want better monsters.
I think I can help.

101
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,194
How? You had better be serious, Oswald.

102
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,864
I have never been more serious.

103
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:40,701
However, to pull it off,
we have to return...

104
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,603
to Gotham City.

105
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,322
Is this one of your tricks?

106
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,488
I assure you, far from it.

107
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,160
What are you waiting for? To Gotham.

108
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,142
Yes. To Gotham.

109
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:18,605
Why so sad, Buzz? You don't think
I'd leave you behind, do you?

110
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:23,189
I need you to keep an eye
on this madman for me.

111
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,565
I am confident, sir, that today's
obligation to Wayne Enterprises

112
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,233
is present in your thoughts.

113
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,469
I haven't forgotten, Alfred.

114
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:52,389
The new technology showcase
at Wayne tower? That's today?

115
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,293
In less than 10 minutes.

116
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,012
Isn't that super important?
We'll never make it in time.

117
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,662
Yes, we will. Get in.

118
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:08,301
- Alfred, you're on logistical support.
- Of course, sir.

119
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,051
- When do I get to drive?
- We'll see.

120
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,020
- Soon?
- We'll see.

121
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,705
- I hope it's soon.
- Remember,

122
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:29,176
this is going to be a Wayne Enterprises
function. So, we have to wear our costumes.

123
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:33,793
- We're already wearing our costumes.
- These are our work uniforms.

124
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,932
Stupid costume.

125
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,274
Gross! Who would eat this?

126
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,650
That couldn't be what it sounds like.

127
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,280
Hilarious, Madam Senator.
I'll definitely have to avoid that vintage.

128
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,316
Wow. He's so friendly.

129
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,852
Yeah, it freaked me out
the first time I saw it, too.

130
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,389
- Oh. Hi, Mr. Green Arrow.
- Watch it, Damian.

131
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,971
Here, it's Mr. Queen. Call me Ollie.

132
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:23,430
Sorry, Ollie. Add that to the pile
of rookie mistakes I've been making.

133
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,366
Yeah, go easy on yourself, kiddo.
We were all new once.

134
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,687
And you're training under him. That's like
jumping into the deep end of the ocean.

135
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,958
Bat... the boss doesn't seem
very happy with me.

136
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,111
Not talking much. Acting grumpy.

137
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,547
- Yeah.
- That's just the way he is.

138
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,716
Green Lantern took him
to a theme planet once.

139
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,218
The whole planet, one big amusement park.

140
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,755
I asked him how it was,
you know what he said? Enjoyable.

141
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,291
- That's it.
- Because he doesn't care.

142
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,730
Wrong. It's the opposite.
Underneath, he cares more than any of us.

143
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,335
He has the biggest heart of all.
That's why he has to hide it so well.

144
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:06,540
- Mr. Wayne, I presume.
- Yes. And you must be general Sam Lane.

145
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,144
You've done your research. I'm responsible
for the military's technology budget.

146
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,648
And if today's demonstration
goes as well as it's supposed to,

147
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,638
I'm going to make you an even richer man.

148
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:21,054
In that case,
I'm very pleased you're here, general.

149
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,924
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
If I could have your attention.</i>

150
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,960
<i>I am Dr. Kurt Langstrom,</i>

151
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,130
<i>the head of Wayne Enterprises research
and development department.</i>

152
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,779
<i>Wayne Enterprises has long produced
high tech drilling sledges</i>

153
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,903
<i>for mining in extreme conditions.</i>

154
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:39,852
<i>Now, welcome to the next level.</i>

155
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,243
<i>This single operator
drilling mech's plasma pincers</i>

156
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:54,166
<i>actually turn solid rock into lava
to safely pass through.</i>

157
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,829
<i>We designed the mech
for mining exploration and extraction.</i>

158
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,315
- Alfred.
- <i>Emergency, sir.</i>

159
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:08,130
<i>A break-in at Arkham Asylum.</i>

160
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,739
- You mean a breakout.
- <i>No, sir. In.</i>

161
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,483
<i>This technology could one day be used
to explore the core of the Earth,</i>

162
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,563
<i>or even other planets.
The potential is nearly endless.</i>

163
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:22,047
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

164
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:26,586
Well, Mr. Wayne.
I have to say I'm very impressed.

165
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,288
You could...

166
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,602
Mr. Wayne?

167
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,590
Seal off the perimeter.
Full lockdown protocols.

168
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,731
Get to your stations, people.

169
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,563
That's coming from...

170
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:08,995
Something tells me you don't have
a license to drive this thing.

171
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,464
No one can issue me a license,

172
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:17,283
for there is no government that holds
authority over Dr. Victor Fries.

173
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:20,706
Freeze!

174
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,833
Exactly.

175
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,823
In the name of the Gotham
Police Arkham division,

176
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,725
I demand you give yourselves up.

177
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,236
You're the best Arkham has to offer?

178
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,099
It's embarrassing
I've ever been kept in here.

179
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,301
Stay focused, Cobblepot.

180
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,505
You promised me what we need
is somewhere in here.

181
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,409
I've already spent more time among
other humans than I am comfortable with.

182
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:59,796
You won't be disappointed.

183
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,916
Release me. I shouldn't be in here.

184
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,685
That's what they all say.

185
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,054
What are you guys doing
trapped in that hallway?

186
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,137
Don't you want to be free in here like me?

187
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,340
Okay, freak show.

188
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,223
I don't deserve to be free of here.

189
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,809
I was going to say the same thing.

190
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,444
Where are the items we need?

191
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:36,283
Patience. I waited for months
in your mad scientist igloo.

192
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:39,865
You can wait a few moments more.

193
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,603
First on the list.

194
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,969
What do you two want?

195
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,884
Time to come with us, Bane.

196
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,263
Why do you want me out?

197
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,765
Explanations in good time.

198
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:12,848
Or we can always close you back in.

199
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,172
Good decision.

200
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:30,616
Chemo! We have a deal
you might be interested in.

201
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,028
Always impressive, Killer Croc.

202
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,430
This cell is vacant, you fool.

203
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,701
<i>Au contraire.</i>

204
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:09,188
Clayface, meet your new boss, Mr. Freeze.

205
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:26,259
No, you wouldn't forget little old me
in your escape plans, would you?

206
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,098
Because that wouldn't be funny,
if I do say so myself.

207
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,767
Sorry, Clown.

208
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:37,187
I already have to deal
with one lunatic on this job.

209
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:42,742
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.
You need me. I am the style.

210
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,546
I will put the life in your team's party.

211
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,533
I'd get used to your new
accommodations if I were you.

212
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,937
I have an absolutely awful memory, Oswald.

213
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,971
But this I won't forget, do you hear me?

214
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:09,414
- Why are we waiting?
- I'm scanning.

215
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,456
Always use caution, Robin.

216
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:17,611
Leaping into Arkham unprepared
is like going into a lion's den.

217
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:22,094
I've always loved the lion's den.
It's my favorite part of the zoo.

218
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,666
I'm thinking he's not great at caution.

219
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:39,249
What did I say? Checking off everything
on our shopping list was easy.

220
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,069
Wait. You don't expect me
to work with this snake, do you?

221
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,939
He sold me out to the Gotham police.

222
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,276
You got a score to settle?
Then let's settle it.

223
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,212
Gentlemen, now is not the time.

224
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,161
We should be on our way before Batman...

225
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,855
This game ends now.

226
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:06,093
Game? Trust me, we are not playing.

227
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:09,696
Really? Because I could go for a round
of pin-the-arrow-on-the-bad-guy.

228
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,886
Who wants to go first?

229
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:18,071
- Good work, Robin. We'll take it from here.
- Gordon? You made it to Arkham quickly.

230
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,490
- Kid, duck.
- You crazy?

231
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,704
Do it now.

232
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,615
- Yeah.
- This guy wasn't in my holobook.

233
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:31,096
You're learning how to be
a superhero from a book?

234
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,911
We're wasting time.

235
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,345
Great, you've trapped us in here.

236
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,194
You are a shortsighted little man.

237
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,799
Bane.

238
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,007
They escaped.
There are sewer tunnels underneath here.

239
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,111
They had a vehicle waiting. They're gone.

240
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,078
This wouldn't have happened if I could tell
the difference between the real Gordon

241
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:37,262
- and Clayface.
- You're still learning, kid.

242
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,131
I guess.

243
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,795
What's the big mystery?
Penguin and Freeze needed some muscle,

244
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,464
freed some inmates, simple as that.

245
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,250
On the surface it looks simple.

246
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,904
- You think there's a pattern here?
- The breakout wasn't random.

247
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,641
They skipped others to select Bane,
Chemo, Croc and Clayface.

248
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,410
Why them? It's not a solid team.

249
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,446
Bane and Croc have a known rivalry.

250
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,582
We don't need to know what they want.
We just need to stop them.

251
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:13,353
The key to stopping them
is outsmarting them.

252
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,203
Unless you have explosive arrows,
then that's the key to stopping them.

253
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:19,838
Oh, and look what I've got.

254
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,579
A pattern.

255
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,002
If this is a trick...

256
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:08,441
You will no doubt inflict
bodily injury upon me. Yes. Yes.

257
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:12,078
Your threats are <i>de rigueur.</i> Do not worry.

258
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,660
My science is no hoax.

259
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,197
What's that little guy's name? Appetizer?

260
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:34,117
Buzz here is my hench-bird.

261
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:38,351
Don't mind him, Buzz.
He's a mere sewer-born cretin.

262
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,576
Level with me, Penguin.
What are the odds this is going to work?

263
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,380
Victor Fries is a loony
with a monster size ego.

264
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,416
He's practically a hermit
and on top of it all,

265
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,585
he's a terrible roommate.

266
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,655
But he's also one other thing.

267
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:59,638
- What's that?
- A genius.

268
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:03,225
Time for the moment of truth.

269
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,031
Criminal history. No connection.

270
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,901
Known MOs. No connection.

271
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:46,138
Personality profile. No connection.

272
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:50,092
Maybe they're just recruiting
for an all-villain flag football league.

273
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,746
What if Penguin and Freeze didn't
pick these guys for who they are,

274
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,082
but instead, for what they're made of?

275
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:59,902
- Made of? What does it matter?
- Never mind. Probably nothing.

276
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:02,072
Tell me.

277
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:05,691
Well, three of them have
unusual chemical components.

278
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,594
Bane's venom,
the stuff that makes him strong,

279
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,831
Clayface's mud,
which can expand into anything,

280
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:16,336
and Chemo, well, he's basically
made of super toxic sludge.

281
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:19,038
What about Croc? He's not like the others.

282
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,109
No, but the strength of his constitution
would make him an ideal test subject.

283
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,779
Mr. Freeze is a scientist, right?
What if he's experimenting?

284
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,515
No offense, kid, but don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch.

285
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,987
- No.
- Okay. Dumb idea.

286
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,456
I mean, no, it's not a stretch.

287
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,892
- It's not?
- I was focusing on the villains' skills.

288
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,879
It never occurred to me to analyze
their physical composition.

289
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:44,340
Good work, Robin.

290
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,968
To force those kind of chemicals
to interact with one another,

291
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:53,051
there'll be tell-tale signs
in chroma-spectral scans of the area.

292
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,442
Got a hit. Robin, with me.

293
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,444
- Where to?
- Gotham Harbor.

294
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,982
I'll follow in a second.
In the meantime, this cup is getting low.

295
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:05,563
Indeed, sir.

296
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,723
It is done.

297
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,618
How will you know if it worked?

298
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,211
There's only one way to find out.

299
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,593
Lay it on me.

300
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:41,793
Yes. I feel it. The power.

301
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:50,728
It's time to have a little fun.

302
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:18,539
- Hey.
- It's amazing.

303
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,195
Hey, do superheroes get snow days?

304
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,162
That's a no, I guess.
Sudden weather shifts. Icy conditions.

305
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:04,273
Part of Mr. Freeze's plans, I assume.

306
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:07,493
- No doubt.
- You know, if you let me drive,

307
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,530
you could focus on developing
the perfect plan for fighting Freeze.

308
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,211
Not the time, Robin.

309
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,643
- You're seeing this, right?
- Like you said, Chemo's asset mutates.

310
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:26,729
Clayface's mud stretches.
Bane's venom enlarges.

311
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:31,451
But I didn't know that meant giant,
crazy monster. What do we do?

312
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,352
Here it comes.

313
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:42,274
Now, let's cause some chaos.

314
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,862
What's this? An old friend.

315
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:04,663
I should spend some time with him,
now that I've come up in the world.

316
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,988
- You wearing your seat belt?
- Always.

317
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,445
Good.

318
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,658
Oh, yeah? Bring it.

319
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,534
Hey, guys, a minute ago I was having
coffee in Paris when I saw the news.

320
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:24,215
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

321
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,221
What the...

322
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,698
There goes the Flash.

323
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,693
What?

324
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,612
Hi, Mr. Croc. Good to see you?

325
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,995
Goodbye for good, Batman.

326
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,582
It turns into a plane?
This is the coolest thing ever.

327
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,611
Any chance this thing also transforms
into an enormous heat lamp?

328
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:41,617
We stop the monsters,
the climate will go back to normal.

329
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:46,051
Right. Wait, monsters?
As in more than one?

330
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,933
Look down.

331
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,043
Freeze is turning
Gotham City into the arctic.

332
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,069
It's better than I could have ever hoped.

333
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:08,657
Soon I won't need this blasted suit
to cool me down anymore.

334
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:11,343
What did I tell you, Victor?

335
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:15,414
You were so focused on defending
your little ice cave,

336
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,982
you weren't thinking big.

337
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,186
Yes, you're right.

338
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:24,569
I have been underestimating
myself, haven't I?

339
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,697
Oh, yes, Victor. Look at that screen.

340
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,980
See all that you can accomplish.

341
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,502
No! Oh, my goodness.

342
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,501
Nightwing. Thank you.

343
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,671
- Oh, such a good boy.
- No problem, ma'am.

344
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,324
You all need to find safety indoors.

345
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,409
An avalanche in downtown Gotham?

346
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:54,179
Give you one guess who's behind this
and it rhymes with "sister please."

347
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,849
How did Mr. Freeze
get power on this scale?

348
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,751
Ask Batman or the new Robin
for the details.

349
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:01,766
But I, for one, never wanted
to live in a snow globe.

350
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,672
Oh, yeah, and then there's that.

351
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:21,206
Thanks to you, I realize
I don't have to hide from civilization.

352
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:26,045
I can turn civilization into what I want,
an ice world.

353
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:29,782
Ice world? Not everywhere, I hope.

354
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:33,502
I didn't pay for a private island
so it could freeze over.

355
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:35,938
Of course everywhere!

356
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:39,508
Now, because of you, I think big!

357
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:43,225
A new global ice age!

358
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:08,037
- He doesn't even seem to know we're here.
- Then it's time to drop the subtlety.

359
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:10,785
A barrage of missiles is subtle?

360
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:23,865
What are you doing? Isn't that
the button that turns off the jets?

361
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,746
- There, he noticed us.
- I think you made him mad.

362
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,538
You know what? Maybe I don't
want to drive this thing anymore.

363
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,160
Open fire!

364
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,236
It's not affecting him.

365
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:37,572
Smashing up the GCPD.

366
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:43,578
I knew this day would come.

367
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,527
Need a lift?

368
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,266
At least they're safe.

369
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,739
We would never forget you, Commissioner.

370
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:25,140
Frozen. Shining. Perfect.

371
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,609
A wasteland paradise.

372
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:30,045
Everything I've ever dreamed.

373
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:33,194
Cold enough to ditch the suit yet?

374
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,850
Yes, I think it is.

375
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:49,898
Finally free.

376
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:53,635
I am glad you are here to see
the beginning of all this, Oswald.

377
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:57,706
- You were instrumental.
- Sure. Happy to help.

378
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:01,744
But your usefulness has come to an end.

379
00:41:02,144 --> 00:41:05,030
But... but we're partners.

380
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,999
I'm no fool, Penguin.

381
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:11,220
You wanted to return to Gotham
for one reason, to rule it.

382
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,324
Now that I do rule it, this makes me
your number one enemy.

383
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:17,826
Nonsense!

384
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:21,563
Perhaps, but that's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

385
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:24,733
You'll never get
the upper hand on me, Penguin.

386
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:29,884
Sorry, Victor, but I already have.

387
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:37,229
- No! No, you couldn't have.
- But I did.

388
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,582
The power is great.

389
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:44,199
This was worth the wait!

390
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,004
Nothing can stop me now!

391
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,431
Croc was a durable test subject.
But the others?

392
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,768
Do you have any idea
how unstable they are?

393
00:41:59,868 --> 00:42:03,538
Do you have any idea how little I care?

394
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:06,074
And without the defenses
in your freeze suit,

395
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:09,378
there's nothing you can do to stop me.

396
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,726
You'll never get away with this.

397
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:15,930
Looks like he will.

398
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:19,121
Bring me the Batman.

399
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:21,890
He'll pay for putting me in exile.

400
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,262
And then Gotham will finally,
rightfully, belong to me.

401
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:31,812
- You bet.
- Got a score to settle first.

402
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,365
Hey, Nightwing.

403
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,246
Good to see you.
You must not be getting my texts.

404
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:46,445
- I got them.
- Oh, but...

405
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:49,563
More urgent stuff
to deal with right now, Flash.

406
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:05,133
- Can't say I expected to see that today.
- Can't say I expected to any of this today.

407
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,502
Come on, guys, this is Gotham.

408
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:10,272
Time to settle up, Croc.

409
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:12,520
Happy to.

410
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:26,055
Batman, it's Nightwing. It looks like
our big problem just got even bigger.

411
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:28,357
I have eyes on it, too.

412
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:31,739
We have to shut them down
before Gotham is destroyed.

413
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,652
- Good work, Robin.
- There you are.

414
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:52,694
What's happening to me?
Freeze's formula, it's...

415
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,725
He's unstable. Whatever freeze did,
Clayface can't handle it.

416
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:06,140
Here, it's the key.

417
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:10,666
- You said you wanted to drive the Batmobile.
- I kinda took that back.

418
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:12,968
I've got a plan,
but I need you to buy me time,

419
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:16,071
try to keep Clayface from destroying
the city until I get back.

420
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:19,508
- That's a pretty tall order.
- I know you can do it.

421
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:21,889
You need a ride?

422
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:25,247
- I've got one.
- Is your ride invisible?

423
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:27,428
Wait for it.

424
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:32,854
A new batcycle! Nice!

425
00:44:32,954 --> 00:44:35,770
You'll have to show me
how to get the spikes to work...

426
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:39,217
He does that to everyone, doesn't he?

427
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:44,978
Even... even better!

428
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:51,056
Instead of crushing you,
now I'll burn you!

429
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:54,578
Okay, what does he usually do?
This is the ignition, right?

430
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:01,162
Can't run from me.

431
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,181
I don't know what I was worried about.
This is awesome!

432
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:24,152
How do you do plane mode? Plane mode now!

433
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:30,426
Oh, yeah!

434
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,335
Eat missiles, lava breath!

435
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,398
Where is he?

436
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,126
- Time to go to the workshop.
- Batman, it... it's not ready.

437
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:05,046
Giant monsters are loose in Gotham.
Consider this a field test.

438
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:07,524
Don't start without me.

439
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:12,087
There you are!

440
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,690
- What are you doing here?
- You'll see.

441
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,728
- The magnetometer might me miscalibrated.
- That won't be a problem.

442
00:46:19,828 --> 00:46:22,497
But Batman, you don't understand.

443
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:26,101
Some of the servos are registering
at sub-optimal PSI readings.

444
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,050
Doctor, I've seen the specs.
I can handle it.

445
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:47,935
- Nice.
- Boot it up.

446
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:57,011
- Forget something?
- Oh, of course.

447
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:07,409
- I think that'll do.
- You ordered your own mech?

448
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:09,678
You think you're the only
billionaire in the world?

449
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:11,813
I convinced Langstrom
you might need some backup.

450
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:15,544
The Queen Industries contract helps
support research and development.

451
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:18,031
We filed a report.

452
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,329
Let's go.

453
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,995
- <i>Welcome, Batman.</i>
- Prepare to deploy.

454
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:30,632
Copy that. Actuator systems, nominal.

455
00:47:30,732 --> 00:47:34,935
E systems, 100%. Weapon systems, online.

456
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:42,423
Wait for me.

457
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,318
<i>Launch in 10, nine, eight,</i>

458
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:55,123
<i>seven, six, five, four,</i>

459
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:58,827
<i>three, two, one.</i>

460
00:47:58,927 --> 00:48:00,741
Launch!

461
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,143
This is one sweet ride.

462
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:18,513
Green Arrow, you're on Chemo.
Stop the freezing process.

463
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:22,534
- My pleasure.
- Langstrom, I need something else from you.

464
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:24,081
You do?

465
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:46,408
Masked freak, zero. Croc, everything.

466
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:50,795
<i>We can now confirm the mysterious freezing
conditions falling over Gotham City</i>

467
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,111
<i>are a result of an attack
by supervillains.</i>

468
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,702
Come on. That was my favorite TV!

469
00:48:58,357 --> 00:48:59,621
Is that Batman?

470
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:02,090
You know, your mouth runs faster
than your brain, speedster.

471
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,071
Who else would that be?

472
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:16,133
What's this button do?

473
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:27,084
Oh, yeah!

474
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:37,942
- Nothing's stopping this guy.
- I've got you, boy wonder.

475
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,979
It's impossible to stop me in this thing.

476
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:44,199
And by impossible, obviously,
I meant totally possible.

477
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:46,846
Which one was it again?

478
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:56,757
Had it under control the whole time.

479
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,674
Keep Clayface from destroying the city,
Batman says. Sure, no problem.

480
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:06,254
- <i>Robin, come in.</i>
- Dr. Langstrom, is that you?

481
00:50:06,354 --> 00:50:11,138
<i>Yes, Batman sent me.
I'm headed your way, fast... too fast.</i>

482
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:24,005
This vehicle travels far too fast.

483
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,725
Yeah, it's awesome. What have you got?

484
00:50:26,825 --> 00:50:29,327
Batman has a plan for dealing
with the lava creature,

485
00:50:29,477 --> 00:50:32,559
but it's only at the design stage.

486
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,656
Hey, Chemo.

487
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:46,411
The kids of Gotham are happy to build
snow-forts and have snowball fights in summer.

488
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,292
But enough is enough.

489
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,254
Hello, I'm talking to you.

490
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:18,038
Okay, now you're just hurting my feelings.

491
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,870
Let's try that again.

492
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:18,119
Which building you want, Buzz?
You can have your pick.

493
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,988
Who's there?

494
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:25,266
Mr. Cobblepot, you're back.
We haven't seen you for some time.

495
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:29,214
You're going to be seeing a lot
of me now. Care to know why?

496
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:32,964
Because Gotham belongs to me now.

497
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:38,452
And not even Batman
can do anything about it.

498
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:44,612
Oh, yes, meet my right-hand penguin, Buzz.

499
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:46,968
I'm naming him head of security.

500
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,365
Nice to meet you, boss.

501
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,227
Yeah, I think it's time to retire.

502
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:08,766
It will be the most powerful laser
cannon ever constructed. In theory.

503
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:11,852
Don't worry, I'm sure
we can get this thing going.

504
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,627
This should pull in enough amps.

505
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:24,452
Okay, that's most of the stuff.

506
00:53:24,552 --> 00:53:26,988
What took so long? You've been gone
for, like, two full minutes.

507
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,824
Some of the things on the list
were only available in Central City.

508
00:53:29,924 --> 00:53:33,662
- Excuses. Excuses.
- Here, I'll go get the rest of it.

509
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:37,999
So, Dr. Langstrom, this Cannon will be
powerful enough to cut Clayface down to size?

510
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,721
- Batman hopes so.
- Great! Wait, "hopes"? He doesn't know?

511
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:46,507
Well, the last time a giant lava monster
attacked Gotham was, never.

512
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:50,457
So, no, we haven't had a lot
of chances to test it out.

513
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:56,618
You think some robot's going to stop me?
Just one of your toys.

514
00:53:57,118 --> 00:53:59,532
Here's another one.

515
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,412
I'll break your machine, Batman.

516
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:50,138
I'm going to pry open
that shell of yours, Batman,

517
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:54,221
so I can get to the soft center.

518
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:45,793
Thank you for doing
my dirty work, detective.

519
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:48,496
With Killer Croc out of the way,

520
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:53,013
I'll be able to enjoy
my dominion over Gotham.

521
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:00,441
You plan to dominate Gotham
as the Penguin's flunky?

522
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:03,694
The Penguin is a means to an end.

523
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:07,044
Looks to me like he's sitting back
and watching you do all the work.

524
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:15,957
Tell me, Batman, between Penguin and me,

525
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:19,440
who is the bigger man?

526
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:24,875
Don't forget what they say.
The bigger they are...

527
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:45,099
This day at the beach is turning out
to be no day at the beach.

528
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,415
Computer, are all
of these buildings evacuated?

529
00:56:57,565 --> 00:57:00,435
<i>Affirmative. No life signs detected.</i>

530
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:04,188
- Show me which ones I own.
- <i>Displaying now.</i>

531
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:07,170
Good, 'cause I have great insurance.

532
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:16,597
That one needed a renovation anyway. Yeah.

533
00:57:18,718 --> 00:57:20,071
You're sure it's ready to be tested?

534
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,220
We don't have time
to work up a better prototype.

535
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,576
That's a good sign.

536
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:37,772
- And that's a bad sign.
- Batman's not going to be happy.

537
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:41,821
The contrivance
wouldn't have worked anyway.

538
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:50,384
- What did you do to it?
- Nothing. The design was flawed.

539
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:54,639
It couldn't support valence co-sharing
between the bonded particles.

540
00:57:55,189 --> 00:58:00,061
He's right. Should have thought of that.
No one tell Batman, okay?

541
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:03,564
Why are you here? We know it was you
who put Gotham in a deep freeze.

542
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:06,350
It was, but I was foolish.

543
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,188
- You're here to turn yourself in?
- No, I'm here to help.

544
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:13,991
As if. We're not getting fooled
by that old trick. Are we?

545
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,160
Why would you want to help us
clean up your mess?

546
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,863
Because it is my mess.

547
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:22,366
All I wanted was to be left alone
in my desolate land

548
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:25,436
but Penguin convinced me
to assault Gotham.

549
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:29,457
I was manipulated and then betrayed.

550
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:31,717
- I'll admit, that makes sense.
- Really?

551
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:34,812
'Cause all I'm hearing is, "I'm a bad guy.
I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy."

552
00:58:34,912 --> 00:58:36,894
You said something about helping.

553
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,586
- Nice and slow.
- This is one of my arctic devices.

554
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:46,257
Coupled with your Cannon, it could be
an effective weapon against Clayface.

555
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:49,360
But what is... Oh, I see. Brilliant.

556
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,613
He's right, it could work.
But he'd have to help us set it up.

557
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:56,324
- Then the question is, can we trust him?
- No.

558
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,372
Maybe.

559
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,094
I better call the boss on this one.

560
00:59:06,444 --> 00:59:08,979
Your mech has a back.

561
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,628
I bet I can break it.

562
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,658
<i>Langstrom's laser's a bust, but Mr. Freeze
is here and says he can get it to work.</i>

563
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,573
- Do it.
- <i>You think you can trust him?</i>

564
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:32,654
- Imagine being partners with the Penguin.
- <i>I'd rather not.</i>

565
00:59:32,754 --> 00:59:35,273
Working with the Penguin
is an easy thing to regret.

566
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:37,775
Victor's whole personality
is built on guilt.

567
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,444
He's got enough of a conscience
to want to make amends.

568
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:43,005
<i>Got it. Robin out.</i>

569
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:55,165
Well, well, well.

570
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,340
Who knew that's all it would take?

571
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,123
Oh, no.

572
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,709
Me and my big external speaker.

573
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:52,138
Anyone ever tell you
your power is kind of gross?

574
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,876
Fine. How about call it a draw?

575
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,080
Done yet? How about now? Now?

576
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,535
The Flash pestering me does not
encourage my success.

577
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:36,320
So we do have something in common.

578
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,789
Yeah, but Flash is right.
You need to be done.

579
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:42,635
- Done in one more minute.
- Not sure you've got it.

580
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,691
Or we can be done now. Now's fine.

581
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,353
Fire!

582
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:14,304
It worked briefly,
but we need a sustained blast.

583
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:32,989
Without his freeze suit,
these temperatures could kill him.

584
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,681
Dr. Freeze, let me operate the cannon.
Get away from the lava.

585
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,864
Only I can manage the arctic device.

586
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,711
How much more can he take?

587
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,484
Your freeze suit, where is it?

588
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:17,267
I just wanted solitude.

589
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:26,742
<i>Watch out for the acid thing!
He loves to do the acid thing.</i>

590
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,259
<i>What's happening? Hey!</i>

591
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,212
Hey! I think I need that.

592
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,642
You cracked him?
No one's ever cracked him.

593
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:46,756
- <i>I like what I'm hearing.</i>
- Green Arrow, I'm trying to concentrate.

594
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:51,160
Oh, sorry. Let's see if I can help.

595
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,254
I think we got him.

596
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,098
<i>Can I talk now? Did we win?</i>

597
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:13,063
Mayor Cobblepot. No, Governor Cobblepot.

598
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:15,666
No, no, President Cobblepot.

599
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:18,368
No, no, Lord Cobblepot!

600
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:21,014
That has a nice ring to it.

601
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,290
What?

602
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:37,621
Melting?
This isn't supposed to be melting.

603
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:41,704
Where are my monsters?
What are they doing?

604
01:07:42,815 --> 01:07:45,174
Here comes one now.

605
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,613
What?

606
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:02,395
We've stopped them all, Penguin.
It's over.

607
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,782
No. No. No!

608
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:07,400
Curse you, Batman. No.

609
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,302
Hey! You should've seen the look on you face
when we came around the corner. Priceless.

610
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:31,887
They'll be fine, once they wake up
back inside a cell in Arkham Asylum.

611
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,212
Almost there.

612
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,728
So very hot.

613
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,203
I found it.

614
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,975
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

615
01:08:48,075 --> 01:08:49,409
What's gonna happen to him?

616
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:52,996
He'll get a trial, and I imagine
he'll be back at Arkham with the others.

617
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:57,484
- He saved us.
- Yes, but I caused all this as well.

618
01:08:57,584 --> 01:09:01,789
It's all right. Perhaps I can request
solitary confinement.

619
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:05,091
I might find the peace
I've been looking for.

620
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:06,894
One more.

621
01:09:06,994 --> 01:09:10,214
You may have beaten me this time,
but once I'm free...

622
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:12,045
Enough!

623
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:15,069
I'll have the last laugh over all of you.

624
01:09:15,169 --> 01:09:17,504
Don't forget his pet.

625
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:21,237
All right, calm down now.
What's gotten into this thing?

626
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:31,485
Remember that hole you guy's
blew out on our floor? Good news.

627
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:35,122
During labor detail,
you can help with the reconstruction.

628
01:09:35,222 --> 01:09:37,270
Fantastic!

629
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,545
Well, well, well.

630
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:46,500
When I vowed to get even,
I had no idea it would be this soon.

631
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,702
What are you going to do to me, clown?

632
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:52,435
You're in that cell, and I'm in this one.

633
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:59,085
You were saying?

634
01:10:04,775 --> 01:10:07,116
Not the beak!

635
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,398
Look, Daddy!

636
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,431
I'll have to replace
the forward actuators.

637
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:37,425
Clearly, new struts along the port side.

638
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,185
I can fix this.

639
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,662
Oh, no! What did he do to you?

640
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,987
I heard you let the new kid
drive the Batmobile.

641
01:10:57,087 --> 01:11:00,958
- Yes.
- I didn't get to do that for years.

642
01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:03,775
The northern lights are supposed to be great
in Finland, but they start in 20 seconds,

643
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:07,731
so, I have to leave soon.
Great working with you again, buddy.

644
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,962
I'm not your buddy.

645
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,317
What a kidder!

646
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:24,064
There's a Queen Industries building down by
the harbor that needs some reconstruction.

647
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:26,745
See you when I see you, Bats.

648
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:33,090
Batman, I know I haven't been
the new Robin for very long,

649
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:37,273
but thank you for taking me out
on this mission. I learned a lot.

650
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:45,203
Robin, I owe you. The whole city owes you.

651
01:11:46,003 --> 01:11:48,939
We couldn't have done it
without your help today.

652
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:52,042
Thanks. That means a lot.

653
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:55,112
Hey, I was going to go train.
Want to come?

654
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:58,608
You can help me learn how to do those
quick getaways you're always pulling.

655
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:04,654
Okay, let's go.
Alfred, you're on watch duty.

656
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:06,969
Of course, sir.

657
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,329
Have you really been to a whole
planetwide amusement park?

658
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,210
- Yes.
- How was it?

659
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,378
Enjoyable.
