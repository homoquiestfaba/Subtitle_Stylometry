1
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,089
I'm going to be a grandmother?

2
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:22,434
you are a grandmother and a great-grandmother also.

3
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:24,855
Did you like it?

4
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:31,539
Mom, I'm going to Paris tonight for a conference.

5
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,059
Will only be a few days.

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,559
Well, I need to go.

7
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,759
See you tomorrow?

8
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,759
Yes mom. See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,802
Let's welcome our distinguished speaker,

10
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:16,141
a pioneer in the research of Alzheimer's disease.

11
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,310
Dr. Alvaro Cruz.

12
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,880
Thank you for loving presentation.

13
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,059
Good evening.

14
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,123
The subject of my presentation today

15
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,450
is a disease that most of our community

16
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:33,993
considers an epidemic.

17
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:39,231
Disease for which there is no proper diagnosis,

18
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,567
has no preventive treatment and has no cure.

19
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:48,039
It affects many people worldwide.

20
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,113
And as some of you, I felt it in the skin

21
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,614
with my own mother.

22
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,353
As we know, it was in 1901 that Alois Alzheimer

23
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,856
He noted Mr. Deter Asylum in Frankfurt in Germany.

24
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:09,361
He was 51 years old and showed, among other things,

25
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,431
short-term memory loss.

26
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:19,906
Legend - rMonta -

27
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,804
- US connection.
- Yes thanks.

28
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,588
- Alvaro? - Angela.

29
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,460
Angela, how is she?

30
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,596
Alvaro, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
Zoom in here.

32
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,219
This is interesting.

33
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,970
Zevvy, I'm me.

34
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,608
I will not.

35
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,444
I will turn away an institute of the time.

36
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,562
Herbsaint.

37
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,239
Thank you.

38
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,039
Have you decided what to do?

39
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,923
About what, Mom.

40
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:29,137
You will marry the American?

41
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,137
With the blonde?

42
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,137
Angela?

43
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,637
We are already married, Mom.

44
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,137
Well, you like it?

45
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,037
Mom.

46
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,837
Tonight I go to Paris for a conference.

47
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,637
It will only be for a few days.

48
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,407
Can you see me another?

49
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:35,520
# Why should I feel discouraged

50
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:44,996
# Why should the shadows come

51
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,952
# When Jesus is part of me

52
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:55,039
# When Jesus is part of me

53
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,126
# My constant friend is here

54
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:03,214
# My constant friend is here

55
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:07,101
# His eye is on the sparrow

56
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:10,988
# His eye is on the sparrow

57
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,357
# And I know He watches me

58
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,727
# And I know He watches me

59
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,412
Place the music for me, dear.

60
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:39,230
You know place?

61
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,370
Look, a storm is coming.

62
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,171
Keep trying.

63
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,833
Do not go too far, darling.

64
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,389
Do not go too far.

65
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,243
Dear?

66
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,145
I am fine. It was just a dream.

67
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,651
Just a dream.

68
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,927
# Every morning the memories will

69
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:17,081
# Every morning the memories will

70
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:23,053
# Through the sea where the flying toy fish

71
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,958
# And when night falls

72
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,654
# I find myself remembering

73
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:40,351
# The happy and exciting day

74
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:47,904
# I found my love in Avalon

75
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:52,650
# When the bay side

76
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:57,605
# I left my love in Avalon

77
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:02,560
# And I left

78
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:07,481
# I dream of him in Avalon

79
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:12,403
# From dusk till dawn

80
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:16,507
# And then I think I went to Avalon

81
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:20,611
# And then I think I went to Avalon

82
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,588
I think enough for today, dear.

83
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,094
How are you?

84
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,929
Good and you?

85
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,877
Do not go too far, darling.

86
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,583
Not far.

87
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,609
Ah, it seems comfortable.

88
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,383
What have you been doing?

89
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,554
I grabbed a sandwich at the grocery store,

90
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:14,692
I went to the Frenchman Street, I heard a good song.

91
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,329
And then I took a "siesta".

92
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,967
"Siesta"?

93
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:29,574
It's all right. I'll change and make dinner.

94
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,941
"Siesta".

95
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,093
Hi, Queeny.

96
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,428
Hi dear.

97
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,434
My manager needs some strings.

98
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,403
- Hi, Kenny. - Mr. Stomp.

99
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,139
- Yes sir. - How are we doing?

100
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,775
Well, Kenny.

101
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,278
I'm doing fine.

102
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,679
What do you look?

103
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,013
I need four strings.

104
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,883
No problem. I have a return that can not sell.

105
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,218
I'll handle it. Just a second.

106
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,426
Big Butter and Egg Man.

107
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,797
I got it the other day.

108
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,566
The family sold me the entire collection.

109
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,237
Queeny. Lets go Girl.

110
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,605
Here, Stomp.

111
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,674
- Thanks son. - Everything is alright.

112
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,044
You know it.

113
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,947
- He took the strings? - Yes.

114
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,315
Thanks to Kenny.

115
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,652
- Bye, dear. - MS. Queeny.

116
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,921
- Be careful out there. - We're just going to the restaurant.

117
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,230
I can show you some others are interested.

118
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,998
- Just this one. - Good choice.

119
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,638
Here it is. $ 16.95.

120
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,141
Thank you.

121
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,576

Thank you.

137

When you started

138
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,248
It was like hearing himself Sam Houser.

139
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,751
I have had many influences along the way, I suppose.

140
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:03,421
You are very good.

141
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,493
She will give it to the first person that comes along.

142
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,328
She does not know what money is.

143
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,165
She barely knows who sang the songs.

144
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,970
I care so she would not starve without realizing it.

145
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,671
Cruz.

146
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,441
Stomp.

147
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,876
She's One Life.

148
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,744
"Uma vida".

149
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,516
I saw a very interesting presentation today.

150
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,420
Somewhere on Frenchman?

151
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,624
No. In the old restaurant where I used to go with Mom.

152
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,026
An old man and a woman.

153
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,863
And the woman ... that wonderful voice.

154
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,665
But something was strange.

155
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:52,536
She lost in the music and then found again.

156
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,607
I've never seen anything like it.

157
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:28,873
Jessie, I'm going to the Gator.

158
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,174
Want something?

159
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,943
No. I'm fine, Stomp.

160
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,212
Queeny, I will get a rank.

161
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,615
Back in a minute. Want something?

162
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,922
If you need anything, Jessie's right there.

163
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,423
Are 25.

164
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,163
5. Have a good day.

165
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,307
I have to give a way out, Queeny.

166
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,641
Queeny?

167
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,544
- You'll be fine? - Yes darling.

168
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,412
Are you sure?

169
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,467
Dear Jessie.

170
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,068
Queeny!

171
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,804
Wait, girl.

172
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,072
Queeny, pare!

173
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:43,674
Queeny!

174
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,876
Stop! I'm coming.

175
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,311
Queeny, wait, wait!

176
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,049
Queeny!

177
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,951
Stop the car!

178
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,956
Sorry lady.

179
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,115
- Are you alright? - Woman!

180
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:13,337
Oh, she's ... a wandering idiot.

181
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,573
Always in movement.

182
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,109
Queeny, you need to sit still.

183
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,878
I just wanted some coffee.

184
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,848
Girl, never takes enough coffee?

185
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,716
Always in need of coffee.

186
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,454
If you need me, call me.

187
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,989
If you need anything, okay?

188
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,593
Good to see you.

189
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:45,996
Let's have a coffee. Come.

190
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,963
I can enter?

191
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,975
She is resting, Jessica.

192
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,102
Look, I'm sorry.

193
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,408
I know.

194
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,945
I know.

195
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:39,390
Tell her that I did.

196
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,461
Thank you.

197
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,247
I know her radio broke,

198
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,933
then recorded favorite songs it.

199
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,334
Thank you.

200
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,904
She will like it, Jessica.

201
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,995
That man,

202
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,238
what he wants to Una Vida?

203
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,717
I do not know.

204
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,086
A fan, I think.

205
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,992
It seems he's a doctor.

206
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,293
Maybe he ...

207
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,795
Maybe he what?

208
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,985
Another day with his musicians?

209
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,862
The woman...

210
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:55,580
almost hurt.

211
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,674
She looked confused.

212
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,443
Lost. I do not know.

213
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,183
And you will help her?

214
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,125
Sim.

215
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,298
- I called my office? - Whatever with One Life?

216
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,967
- As? - It's a simple question.

217
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,407
I'm fascinated by it.

218
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,342
For her music.

219
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:13,745
Are you a doctor?

220
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,981
How did you get my number?

221
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,282
Stomp.

222
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,687
Neuroscientist.

223
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,723
I am a scientist, doing research.

224
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,293
So you want to study it.

225
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,498
Yesterday she was confused.

226
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,467
He entered in traffic.

227
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,969
It could have been hurt.

228
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,237
I would like to help.

229
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,943
Stay away from her.

230
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,512
To stay away? It was you who called me.

231
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:01,479
# Sometimes I feel

232
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,496
# Like a motherless child

233
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,183
# Far away from home

234
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,870
# Far away from home

235
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,574
# Far, far away from home

236
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,944
# Far, far away from home

237
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:24,314
# Far, far away from home

238
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,684
# Far, far away from home

239
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,800
It's okay, Queeny. Go inside.

240
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,904
I'll be right in.

241
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,511
- Hey, Doc. - Stompleg, how is she?

242
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,879
She is fine.

243
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,214
We are fine.

244
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,015
How nice.

245
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,288
Jessie tried to you, is not it?

246
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,508
- Jessie? - Jessica.

247
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,927
She took her card to me.

248
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,529
I should not have shown her.

249
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,899
Who is she? What was that?

250
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,871
She is the closest thing to a family that has one life.

251
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,876
She has problems, but do not want to see anyone

252
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,878
interfere as a Life.

253
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,035
Do you mind if I talk to her?

254
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,717
Oh no. It's all right.

255
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,119
It's time the break even.

256
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,923
It is not Cuban.

257
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,625
Try it, you might like.

258
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,760
It's a good cigar.

259
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:45,096
Thank you.

260
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,211
What are you singing?

261
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,216
Singing?

262
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,122
You heard the wind, sir.

263
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,491
It has no wind.

264
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,992
Always venta.

265
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,432
It was the wind that took my butterfly away.

266
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:23,933
His butterfly.

267
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,128
Hi, Queeny.

268
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,915
I would like a coffee.

269
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,914
Thank you.

270
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,623
Do you like coffee?

271
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,157
Clear.

272
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,162
With sugar?

273
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,530
Definitely.

274
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,367
You like it here?

275
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,340
I used to come here with my mother.

276
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:07,296
Mom, this is pepper.

277
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:11,321
What you want is sugar.

278
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,392
I bet you were good to your mother.

279
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,334
Thank you sir.

280
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:59,743
Take a good breakfast, son.

281
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:07,743
Someone's having a birthday today?

282
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:12,643
I'll make your favorite sweet.

283
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,443
Sweet milk, the way I do ...

284
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:19,543
and that you like a lot.

285
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:27,343
Someone will anniversary these days?

286
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,380
Do you know why Satchmo had that name?

287
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,747
Do not.

288
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,553
When he was a child, I used

289
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:34,157
dancing in the streets for money.

290
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,027
There Storyville.

291
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:42,188
He picked up the coins and put in the mouth

292
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,868
to prevent the largest caught.

293
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:50,173
So they called him "Satchel Mouth".

294
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,008
How do you know this story?

295
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,982
What story are you talking about?

296
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,899
Queeny, time to go.

297
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,856
Stomp.

298
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,891
I can stay here with her a bit.

299
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:12,229
And you can take a break.

300
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,832
It sounds like a good idea.

301
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,269
I have some things to make it.

302
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,673
She probably like a walk if you are in order.

303
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,041
Sim.

304
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,743
Hey, Miss Queeny?

305
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,745
Why do not you join us?

306
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,750
I had some classes at Tulane.

307
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,887
If you want to know anything about the albums, I'm the guy.

308
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,888
Because this song is playing.

309
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,058
99% of people who come here will tell

310
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,760
which is Benny Goodman at the beginning.

311
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,095
Simple things.

312
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,997
Acknowledge this arrangement by far, but actually ...

313
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:49,298
It was Fletcher.

314
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,269
She is right.

315
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,238
I also went to school.

316
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,647
This is beautiful.

317
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,048
Do you like?

318
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,718
It reminds me of my house.

319
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,220
Where is your home?

320
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,125
Royal Street, 915.

321
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,694
Better get back to my manager.

322
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,561
Clear.

323
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,174
You were talking about your father.

324
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,357
He was a blues musician.

325
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:15,051
But because of the war and everything

326
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,254
he kept it suppressed.

327
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,160
He was a blues musician.

328
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,878
One Morning

329
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,900
I saw Dad

330
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,902
playing on the front porch.

331
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,942
You see that sheriff?

332
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:41,610
Excuse me?

333
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:42,912
That car.

334
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,852
The woman, the singer.

335
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,230
I believe she has dementia.

336
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,593
Or the beginning of Alzheimer's.

337
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,345
But she seems to be holding through music,

338
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:01,097
unlike Mom.

339
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:05,201
As if she ... I do not know.

340
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,169
Is different.

341
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,882
Hi, Pierluigi, is Álvaro.

342
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:15,081
I found a woman, is a singer,

343
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:19,791
and I spent time with her watching.

344
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:21,209
She has Alzheimer's.

345
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,598
But when she sings,

346
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,188
or have some music around it,

347
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,100
she is freed.

348
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,608
The fog is gone.

349
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,058
I remember that his team studied the influence of music

350
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,346
as memory stimulus.

351
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:36,513
You can send me what you found?

352
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,913
Thank you my friend.

353
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,413
Thank you, Pierluigi, bye.

354
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,708
What's it?

355
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,744
I have two tickets to a benefit concert tomorrow night.

356
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:53,083
If so, will be at The Little Gem Saloon.

357
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,718
Certainly.

358
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,119
Great.

359
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,221
I have a conference at the Monteleone.

360
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,724
But you can pick me up at 6:30.

361
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,058
I will be there.

362
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:06,429
Welcome to Little Gem Saloon with me, John Cleary.

363
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,898
Applause for my friend Kermit Ruffins.

364
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,969
Look at this.

365
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,503
I loved it.

366
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,208
You are very pretty.

367
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,611
... marks the address of the famous residence

368
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,979
Royal Street, 915.

369
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:00,283
Royal, 915.

370
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,512
What do you think of...

371
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,905
- Dear? - Unbelievable.

372
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,675
I thought we'd have a moment for us.

373
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:30,200
- Yes. Let's spend the night. - What?

374
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:33,016
Let's see if they have a room available.

375
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,251
... We can not just have the car and ...

376
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,653
we have to work.

377
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,989
You can get someone to replace you.

378
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:45,528
And what is life if you do not do something crazy once in a while?

379
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,931
I do not even have a toothbrush.

380
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,106
It's beautiful.

381
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,499
Alvaro.

382
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,899
My love.

383
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:12,174
Alvaro.

384
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,375
Come my love.

385
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,027
Mom!

386
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,361
Mom!

387
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,698
- Alvaro. - Mom!

388
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,532
Mom!

389
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,539
Alvaro?

390
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,908
Excuse me.

391
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,643
Just another dream.

392
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,478
WC

393
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,611
- Good Morning. - Good Morning.

394
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,927
You want to tell me about these dreams?

395
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,883
Since Mom ...

396
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:32,102
Every night, or when I close my eyes I dream.

397
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:40,590
And every time I see me with 6 or 7 years old

398
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:45,122
in the field behind the house of my mother.

399
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,501
In every dream, there is a butterfly.

400
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,971
And I chase but never caught.

401
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:01,377
It's all connected somehow.

402
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:04,792
Look what I brought you.

403
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:07,383
What do you mean with on?

404
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,324
With my mother.

405
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,231
Do you like this book?

406
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,613
"Sam e o vaga-lume".

407
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,825
"The moon was high and Sam came out."

408
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,330
"Now it's time to have fun, he said."

409
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,869
"Quem, disse Sam."

410
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,204
"Quem?"

411
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,039
"Who wants to play?"

412
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,042
"But no one said anything."

413
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:11,380
"So Sam went to see why, and the fox was asleep."

414
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:12,715
"And Jay was sleeping."

415
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,250
"The dog was sleeping."

416
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,452
"And the pig was sleeping."

417
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,387
"The sheep were sleeping."

418
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:21,023
"And the cow as well."

419
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,474
We met?

420
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:35,104
Sim, Queeny.

421
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,438
We are friends.

422
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,390
Queeny, I will get the mail.

423
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:00,696
Whether your headphones?

424
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,817
I'll turn on the TV.

425
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,805
# Oh, it's only a paper moon

426
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:40,803
# Sailing on a sea card

427
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,752
# But it would not be make-believe

428
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:47,944
# If you believe me

429
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,814
# Yes, it's just a sky canvas

430
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:55,484
# Hanging on a tree muslin

431
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:58,538
# But it would not be make-believe

432
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:02,044
# If you believe me

433
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,391
# Without your love

434
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:09,031
# It's a party without grace

435
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,266
# Without your love

436
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:15,321
# It's a melody played

437
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:19,170
# With a coin in a video arcade

438
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,429
# It's a Barnum and Bailey world

439
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,016
# Phoney as possible

440
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,746
# But it would not be make-believe

441
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:34,614
# If you believe me

442
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:42,762
# The light paper moon

443
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:48,571
# Shines over a sea card

444
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:53,918
# It will always be real, my love,

445
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:58,434
# Since you mind me

446
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,233
No, Queeny.

447
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,568
It's okay, girl.

448
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:21,771
It's all right.

449
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,407
It's all right.

450
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,412
It's all right.

451
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,648
Oh, it's okay.

452
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,584
The old harmonica is only tune.

453
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:40,189
We'll go to Kenny. He'll tune it.

454
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,959
It's all right.

455
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,441
Louisiana Music Factory.

456
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,775
Here is Kenny.

457
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,411
Hi, Kenny. This is Dr. Cruz.

458
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,813
I found you with One Life.

459
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,614
Yes I recall.

460
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,717
Doctor, is it? What sends, Doctor?

461
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,353
Listen, have you seen Una Vida or Stompleg?

462
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:12,721
Do not.

463
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,824
Dude, do not see them some time.

464
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,325
What is going on?

465
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,261
Well, I do not see the

466
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,562
It has been a few days.

467
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,063
I am sure you are well.

468
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,633
What do you know of the One Life?

469
00:48:24,634 --> 00:48:26,769
What's her story? Who is she?

470
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,104
I asked.

471
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,006
She does not like talking about it, so I left to ask.

472
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:32,575
Her memory and everything.

473
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,311
I do not think she could tell me, if I would.

474
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,812
Thanks, Kenny.

475
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,381
If you want to,

476
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:41,650
her name is Maisie. I know it.

477
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:43,152
Maisie.

478
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:47,756
One Life said she lived in Royal Block 900, if I remember.

479
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:50,593
Royal? No, she lives with Stomp On You call.

480
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,163
Do you have the address by chance?

481
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,933
Yes I have. Hang on.

482
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,970
They live in Dufranc, 2315.

483
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,839
Thanks, Kenny. Thank you very much.

484
00:49:11,144 --> 00:49:12,644
Oi, Pierluigi.

485
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,145
Anything for me?

486
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:16,644
We know very little about the effects of music.

487
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:20,297
But we made some very interesting tests.

488
00:49:20,698 --> 00:49:22,044
In one case,

489
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,779
catatonic two subjects,

490
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,779
a little less than 80 years old,

491
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,279
They emerged from the darkness

492
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,279
when we played an Elvis song.

493
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:33,279
They started talking to them

494
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:36,779
not about the music, but like old friends.

495
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:39,279
But when the song ended,

496
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,779
back to before state.

497
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,279
I understand.

498
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,779
Thank you my friend.

499
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,080
Goodbye.

500
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:11,394
It's that doctor.

501
00:50:11,395 --> 00:50:14,410
Maybe there's something he can do, Jessie.

502
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,755
Stomp.

503
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:30,626
- Hi, Doc. - How are you?

504
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:31,960
More or less.

505
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,064
Lets sit.

506
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:50,746
So how will one life?

507
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,805
Not very well.

508
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,138
She's in there with Jessie.

509
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,327
There's something I want to tell you, doctor.

510
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,009
I was accepted.

511
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,710
Accepted for what?

512
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,747
The Music Maker Foundation
em Durham, Carolina do Norte.

513
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:32,649
They have family homes for street musicians like me.

514
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,961
And I passed.

515
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,329
I passed.

516
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,464
The best thing I did in 10 years.

517
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:50,172
And still I have a family there.

518
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,208
At my age, doctor!

519
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,044
I talked to them about the One Life,

520
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,945
but they can not accept it,

521
00:51:56,946 --> 00:52:01,250
you know, being as it is and everything.

522
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,753
And she's not very well, doctor.

523
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:08,057
She just sits there staring.

524
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,531
It does not give a whisper or anything.

525
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,864
Do you think Jessie would take care of it?

526
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,399
Jessie is an addict.

527
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,219
One Life knows you're going?

528
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,541
Do not.

529
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,249
I did not tell her or Jessica.

530
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,455
It's a shame a woman like Queeny

531
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:43,225
have their choices reduced to someone like me.

532
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,561
What have you done for it has been great.

533
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,566
She did more for me than I do for her.

534
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,707
Can help you, Doctor?

535
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,715
I will see what I can do.

536
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:13,088
See you.

537
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,625
God bless you, doctor.

538
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:20,596
To you too.

539
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,779
Saint Annes?

540
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,214
Hi, Jane. Is Alvaro Cruz.

541
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:42,485
Would you have any available bed by chance?

542
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:43,852
No, we're sold out.

543
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:46,188
I get it.

544
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,458
Once you open a place I'll call you.

545
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,764
I've been with the musicians.

546
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:59,435
And Stompleg, man, is leaving.

547
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,837
And the only person who can take care of One Life

548
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,396
It is Jessica, and she is addicted.

549
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,304
Therefore, One Life has no one.

550
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,903
Herbsaint.

551
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,839
Herb o quê?

552
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,341
I see a dark rum.

553
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:45,080
Jessica is working tonight?

554
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,815
Yes, it is.

555
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,592
Thank you.

556
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,433
Why are you here?

557
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,135
Because I want to talk.

558
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:09,805
This has cost.

559
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,139
It's all right.

560
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,075
$ 100.

561
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,676
You can pay for it.

562
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,218
Come on.

563
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,686
We can talk here.

564
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,324
It's all right.

565
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:33,896
What do you intend to do with the One Life?

566
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,398
And why would I tell you?

567
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,635
Because I want to help her and because I paid you.

568
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,706
She needs someone to look after her.

569
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:49,441
Stomp.

570
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:51,980
Stompleg're leaving and she has no one.

571
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,626
- Hi, Doc. - Stompleg.

572
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,802
Queeny, you remember the doctor?

573
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,142
Are your?

574
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:55,477
Sim.

575
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,647
In Angola you have to find something

576
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:01,249
to fill the time while serving his sentence.

577
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,589
The hardest thing is the monotony.

578
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,593
I can still remember what I had for breakfast, lunch,

579
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,496
and dinner every day.

580
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,302
Doctor, I did some things

581
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,839
of which I'm not proud.

582
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,509
But I learned good things there.

583
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,711
I learned my music.

584
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,847
Because of that, I met her.

585
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:39,688
Mind if Una Vida and I were walking?

586
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,024
Do not.

587
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,691
I think she likes it.

588
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:53,435
# There is a place

589
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:57,539
# Called Lonesome Valley

590
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,459
# You have to go there

591
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,380
# Alone

592
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:09,517
# No one else can

593
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:13,655
# Go there for you

594
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:18,794
# You have to go there alone

595
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:24,772
# My mother walked

596
00:58:26,078 --> 00:58:28,988
# At Lonesome Valley

597
00:58:30,973 --> 00:58:35,026
# She had to walk through this lonely valley alone

598
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:39,081
# She had to walk through this lonely valley alone

599
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,878
# No one else will

600
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:47,923
# Walk through it

601
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:54,062
# She walked by this lonely valley alone

602
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:05,541
# We all have to walk this lonesome valley

603
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:14,169
# We must walk this lonesome valley alone

604
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:21,791
# No one will walk for us

605
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,998
# We must walk this lonesome valley alone

606
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:50,986
Honey, it's temporary. It is only a few days.

607
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,588
Why you brought without talking to me first?

608
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:55,157
I know. I'm sorry.

609
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,694
I know. You are right. Excuse me.

610
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,595
Alvaro, this is a big problem.

611
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,997
You can not just ...

612
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,015
Angela, when my mother needed me,

613
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:06,034
I was not there.

614
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,171
I ... it ... please.

615
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,906
It's the right thing.

616
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,207
I know that.

617
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,142
Please.

618
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,510
I know that.

619
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,975
How did you find me?

620
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,629
They found my card with you.

621
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,881
What happened?

622
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,250
I did something stupid, that's all.

623
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,891
Where is she?

624
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,961
It's in my house for now.

625
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:14,981
But...

626
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:19,801
I'll take you home and then we will see it.

627
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,436
We need to talk.

628
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,519
I'll change.

629
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,855
- Want a water? - Yes.

630
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,433
- Thank you. - I have to smoke a cigarette.

631
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:06,374
- Want to talk outside? - Of course.

632
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:35,937
My mother died when I was born.

633
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,243
Queeny was my mother until I was 12 years old.

634
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,865
And then she walked away again.

635
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:51,537
For the music.

636
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,525
I think she thinks she gave me all he could.

637
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:06,301
And then she came back?

638
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,587
I was 18 years old.

639
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:11,645
I walked around the house one night

640
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:15,125
and I heard her voice.

641
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,678
That voice.

642
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,051
We talked for hours.

643
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:27,055
All anger I had just passed.

644
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:34,162
She moved in with me and things were good.

645
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:37,549
My art was selling and ...

646
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,984
We were happy.

647
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,340
Then she began to forget things.

648
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,776
Little things at first.

649
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:52,710
We would meet somewhere and she did not appear.

650
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,476
Forgot the way home

651
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:57,442
and I had to search for it.

652
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,356
And when was that?

653
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,860
When it started?

654
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,328
About 10 years ago.

655
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:15,136
Then one day she got mad.

656
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,717
Broke all my parts.

657
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,624
I tried to stop her, but she dropped me.

658
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,930
Broke everything except the butterflies.

659
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,654
Why butterflies?

660
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,156
It's just what she speaks.

661
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,560
His music, his bow, his Firefly,

662
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,395
she loves that damn book.

663
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:47,769
Can I show you something?

664
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,136
Clear.

665
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:04,552
This is one of Queeny drawings.

666
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:12,427
It's a club in New York called Village Gate.

667
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,179
She talks about it all the time.

668
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,034
She sang there.

669
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,770
It opened in 1958.

670
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:29,343
As she remembers a club that opened in 1958,

671
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,218
but do not remember me?

672
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,020
My mother had Alzheimer's.

673
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:41,822
And that is what One Life has.

674
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:49,998
My mother was not aggressive. With nobody.

675
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:55,136
But sometimes she forgot who I was.

676
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,771
That broke my heart.

677
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:04,785
This is very good.

678
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:07,350
Sim.

679
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,084
She drew a lot.

680
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,524
She always put the drawings.

681
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:21,496
When he started to forget things, the designs have changed.

682
01:08:21,884 --> 01:08:26,567
Things just changed her mind.

683
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,742
Oh yeah.

684
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,448
And wherever she went, always I wrote to my grandmother.

685
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,353
Paris.

686
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,573
I think it's time to go see One Life

687
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:08,943
and maybe you can stay with us for a while.

688
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,546
I think she would.

689
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,389
Why are you doing this?

690
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,965
Because I can.

691
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:39,840
Honey.

692
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:43,010
I thought maybe we could dine here.

693
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:44,846
Angela, this Jessica.

694
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,252
Where is she?

695
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,255
She's taking a nap.

696
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:57,091
But it will come down to dinner.

697
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,927
I'm Angela.

698
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:01,597
Jessica.

699
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:06,100
I will finish setting the table.

700
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,537
Give me a minute.

701
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,773
Honey, we can ...?

702
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,107
Clear.

703
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,533
You came.

704
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,834
You came.

705
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,275
Excuse me.

706
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,045
Excuse me.

707
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:02,058
My dear.

708
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,194
My baby.

709
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,495
My baby.

710
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:14,859
Queeny?

711
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,148
You are my sister?

712
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,087
Sim.

713
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,024
My sister?

714
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,065
You want me to read some of your book?

715
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,216
I call Stompleg to read the book?

716
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:47,593
You want me to read?

717
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,570
I do not want to be a burden to anyone.

718
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,614
Hello, Dr. Cross.

719
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,921
This is wonderful.

720
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,959
Thank you, Jane.

721
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,729
Thank you very much.

722
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,233
He was my friend in Saint Anne, the hospital assistant.

723
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,770
There is a room available.

724
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,472
No, no.

725
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,342
You have nothing to do with it.

726
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,811
She's my responsibility.

727
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:34,021
I know I'm not ...

728
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:35,316
But if you do,

729
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,685
never let me take her home.

730
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,088
She has Alzheimer's, Jessica. will not improve.

731
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:44,325
It needs professional care all the time.

732
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:48,029
She can not stay in a place like this.

733
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,597
Will stop singing.

734
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,121
Why you say that?

735
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,002
You do not understand, do you?

736
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,370
I dont understand?

737
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:59,540
Listen, missy. Do not tell me...

738
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:03,110
Must let me help.

739
01:13:03,111 --> 01:13:05,324
She does not go to any asylum.

740
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,936
I appreciate everything you're doing.

741
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,988
But she goes home with me tomorrow.

742
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,748
Come here, honey. Mom has something to tell you.

743
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:28,349
- Who is my butterfly? - I.

744
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,070
Let me see how you're playing.

745
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,371
Take it.

746
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,087
Look at Mommy.

747
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,189
- What is it? - The moon.

748
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,824
The moon. Who is this?

749
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,191
You, Mom.

750
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:53,394
- Who is this? - You, Mom.

751
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,629
You see what I'm doing?

752
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,164
I'm right beside you.

753
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,068
Look at Mommy.

754
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,004
I want you to go with these people today.

755
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,372
I do not want to go!

756
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:08,175
They will take care of you better than I can now. Take this.

757
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:10,378
- What will you do with it? - Touch.

758
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:14,081
You will play and will be fine.

759
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:19,086
Mommy loves you very much, do not forget that.

760
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,088
Did you hear me? Never forget.

761
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:22,923
Say, I'll be big and strong, Mom.

762
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,392
I'll be big and strong.

763
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,427
I'll be big and strong, Mom.

764
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,062
Can go.

765
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,033
Make them go away!

766
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,102
Make them go away!

767
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:36,904
Please do not let them take it.

768
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:40,574
- Do not let them take my baby. - Take some water.

769
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,616
Queeny? Tome.

770
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:49,484
Do not let them take my son.

771
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,386
It's all right.

772
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,942
It's all right?

773
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,549
I want to help.

774
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,324
Great.

775
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,796
What do you know about One Life to have a child?

776
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:45,940
We can get out of here? I will tell all I know.

777
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,341
Clear.

778
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:50,177
Let's have a coffee in the restaurant

779
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:51,812
and then I'll take you home.

780
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,545
Thank you, Shake.

781
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:36,323
"They're coming to get my son today."

782
01:16:36,324 --> 01:16:38,192
His name is Sam.

783
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:40,995
He used to work at Tulane.

784
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,652
music teacher or something.

785
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,400
It has to do, no?

786
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,906
She used to talk a lot when he was a child.

787
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,059
He said he was a good boy.

788
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:58,012
I would like to play with him.

789
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:02,049
But I was kind of glad he's not around.

790
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,417
I was jealous.

791
01:17:05,353 --> 01:17:07,521
Where is him now?

792
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,691
I do not know.

793
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,226
I looked for a few years

794
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,534
when things started to get weird.

795
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,664
I called the school, but he hung up.

796
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,354
Jessie, we have to find it.

797
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,543
Look, he wants nothing to do with it.

798
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,779
Sure?

799
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:36,817
He has to know that the mother still thinks of him.

800
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:42,623
The last memories she retains are the oldest.

801
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:45,826
I just said.

802
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,729
He did not want to be found.

803
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,230
What's his last name?

804
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,268
Waters.

805
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,508
Oh really? PM Dawn?

806
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:03,444
Oh really? You know where you are, is not it?

807
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,778
Let's go. Get out of here.

808
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:06,413
I'll take care of you in a minute.

809
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:08,582
Louisiana Music Factory. Here is Kenny.

810
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,618
Hi, Kenny. It is Dr. Cruz.

811
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:11,952
What sends, Doctor?

812
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:15,422
Listen, I need to find a faculty member at Tulane.

813
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:17,358
It's all right. What is the name?

814
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,659
Sam Waters.

815
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,994
He taught in the music department.

816
01:18:21,495 --> 01:18:23,564
See if you can find an address.

817
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,766
I will try, doctor. We'll talk later?

818
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,134
Thanks, Kenny.

819
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:39,246
Kenny got the address with man

820
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,548
who directed the school to where Sam was sent.

821
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:45,052
I do not know if it is still valid, but it is across the river.

822
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,787
Come on?

823
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,864
You will not call him first?

824
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,359
As you do this by phone?

825
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,710
- Hello Love.
- Hi How is she.?

826
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,505
- She is fine.
- Great.

827
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:13,914
Listen, I'm leaving the restaurant with Jessica.

828
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:16,517
She told me about the boy of One Life.

829
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:18,119
She has a son.

830
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,454
Really?

831
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:20,755
Sim.

832
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,890
I'll call you later.

833
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,651
Sr. Waters?

834
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,286
We would like to talk.

835
01:21:05,192 --> 01:21:06,873
What it is?

836
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,798
Sr. Waters?

837
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:14,802
My grandmother knew your mother before you were born.

838
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,703
I'm Jessica.

839
01:21:16,704 --> 01:21:18,772
I'm the girl that you do not answer.

840
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:24,778
- Your mom ... - My mother?

841
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,364
My mother, whoever she was,

842
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:29,950
He gave me when I was 5 years old.

843
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:34,955
She did not give you.

844
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,463
His mother was forced by the court

845
01:21:43,464 --> 01:21:45,799
to deliver it to the state.

846
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,968
She had no choice.

847
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,708
Where is she?

848
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,811
She's in my house for now.

849
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,980
I'm Dr. Cruz.

850
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:03,886
Sir, your mother has Alzheimer's.

851
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,516
That's why you're here?

852
01:22:10,991 --> 01:22:12,291
Sr. Waters?

853
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,532
His mother does not remember me.

854
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,372
But she still dreams with you.

855
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,816
It's too late.

856
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:43,257
If you change your mind, you have my card.

857
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,660
Come on.

858
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,003
She still remembers the music?

859
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,876
It is the most amazing, she recalls.

860
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,245
The brings back.

861
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:08,682
And when that happens, it is something worth seeing.

862
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,778
She's upstairs in the bedroom.

863
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,649
She had a very hard day.

864
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:49,089
That place.

865
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,959
I visit her at any time, is not it?

866
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,127
Clear.

867
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,631
I'll get my stuff.

868
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,053
And then?

869
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,161
It's done.

870
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,665
She is hospitalized.

871
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,435
- And how is she? - Good.

872
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,370
I'm going back tomorrow, okay?

873
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,203
Are you coming tomorrow?

874
01:24:57,825 --> 01:25:00,827
Today, more than 5 million people

875
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:04,564
They are living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States.

876
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:08,569
Currently, Alzheimer's costing this nation

877
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,672
203 billion dollars a year.

878
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:15,442
And this number will rise to 1.2 trillion

879
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:20,747
by 2050, unless we find a cure.

880
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,753
While we do not have all the answers,

881
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:31,191
can be proud of and trust in the progress we have made.

882
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:34,027
And we will not stop until we find a cure

883
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,229
for this devastating disease.

884
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:43,003
Thank you. See you next Tuesday.

885
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,026
I'm ready to see my mother.

886
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:06,395
Claro, Sam.

887
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:12,065
"Sam saw Gus do something cute."

888
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:15,235
"Did the Firefly die laughing."

889
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:18,171
"It was funny to see them go for free to the movies."

890
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,241
"Stop for free, said Sam."

891
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:23,078
"Not another word."

892
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,613
I like cinema.

893
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:31,418
Do you think they also let us in for free?

894
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:32,719
Sim.

895
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:48,535
Queeny?

896
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,772
You have someone here to see you.

897
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,684
Can you play?

898
01:29:35,631 --> 01:29:37,631
- Alvaro. - Mom?

899
01:29:39,485 --> 01:29:41,682
Follow my voice, darling. Come.

900
01:29:43,943 --> 01:29:45,278
Mom!

901
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,280
Mom!

902
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,816
Mom!

903
01:29:58,459 --> 01:29:59,825
Mom!

904
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:10,042
Do not be afraid.

905
01:31:35,589 --> 01:31:37,891
Institute of Neuroscience. This is Jane.

906
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:39,225
Hi, Dr. Cross.
