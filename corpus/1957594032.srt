00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,367
so you could be around broads.

189
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,680
- Yeah except in the business

190
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,998
we call them models not broads.

191
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,205
- You making some money.

192
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,038
- Yeah.

193
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,700
- They're gonna be beautiful
girls running all around here?

194
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,506
- I hope so.

195
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:22,639
- You paying me some rent.

196
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,614
- Wait a minute you're gonna
charge your own son rent?

197
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,781
- You know ...

198
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,772
(ice clinking)

199
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,659
Yeah, I think I could live with that.

200
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,616
- That's good.

201
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,663
Hey, I gotta go Dad, I'll see you later.

202
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,597
(jazz music)

203
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:37,286
- Look, do me a favor Junior.

204
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,680
Why don't you bring me back
some of those fancy magazines.

205
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,223
You know, Cosmo, Vogue.

206
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,525
- Oh, and the swimsuit issue
of Monster Truck Magazine?

207
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,339
- Yeah, that one too so I can't let

208
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,176
my fingers do the walking
if you know what I mean.

209
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:50,343
- [Junior] You got it Dad.

210
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,791
- My JR in howdy couture.

211
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,523
Man, whoever would've thunk it.

212
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,700
(Barry exhaling)

213
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,283
(upbeat music)

214
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:07,725
- [Helmut] Want to check
this because I think

215
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,416
I saw a dimple somewhere.

216
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,413
Yeah, and there's a dimple.
- Here's my schedule

217
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,246
for next week.

218
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:13,079
- [Helmut] Turn for me please.

219
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,036
Good, good.

220
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:15,044
Very nice.

221
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,805
- Try not to call me back to St. Tropez.

222
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:18,889
Now!

223
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,706
You too cabin boy.

224
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,539
- [Helmut] Yeah, good.

225
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,227
They go here, you know they really are.

226
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,060
- Junior.

227
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,420
- Yeah boss.

228
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
- Do you see what I see?

229
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:35,793
- [Junior] Yeah, some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.

230
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,123
- No, Arizona Iced Tea.

231
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,361
Do you see this?

232
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,032
So, take her back to the camper.

233
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:41,865
- Now?

234
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:42,953
- No, tomorrow, now!

235
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,983
Out, out!
- Okay, okay!

236
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:44,816
- Loopi.

237
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,015
Loopi, Loopi.

238
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:53,704
Loppi I am your boss, but
you never listen to me.

239
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:57,064
Now please, bring to me
the 200 millimeter lens

240
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,816
you are holding, smearing
the glass with your fingers,

241
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,905
you Mediterranean cabin boy.

242
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,740
- Me llamo Loopi Ansopaz.

243
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,619
Always with the Mediterranean cabin boy.

244
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,364
Does this look like a boy to you?

245
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:08,197
- [Boss] Helmut.

246
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,030
- [Helmut] Yeah?

247
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,924
- We have 89 more setups to do today.

248
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,098
- Yeah, 89 is good.

249
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:12,931
Yeah, a number I like.

250
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,882
- Yeah, so move it babe, now!

251
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:15,715
- We're moving now.

252
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,211
- I'm gonna be an Oscar
winning film director some day.

253
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:20,047
- An Oscar winning
- Yeah.

254
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,797
- film director, wow.

255
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,595
Have you written your
acceptance speech yet?

256
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:25,428
- Well--

257
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,439
- I've taken acting lessons
and the first thing we

258
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,043
did was write our acceptance
speeches for best actress

259
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:34,293
and best supporting actress
depending on our areas.

260
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,403
- You know it's funny you should say that

261
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,398
'cause I'm casting for a film right now.

262
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,231
- [Model] Really?

263
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,112
- You would be perfect for.

264
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:43,128
I mean, you were born to play this part.

265
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,010
You look good.

266
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,948
I mean it has some full frontal nudity

267
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,412
and purely gratuitous sex

268
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:49,332
but you're a professional so I'm sure

269
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:50,508
you're cool with that, right?

270
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,591
- No problem.

271
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,301
- Okay.

272
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:58,435
- Junior, get your ass over
here with some coffee, now!

273
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,084
- She thinks I'm some kind
of gopher or something.

274
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,667
(upbeat music)

275
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:12,788
(chair thudding)

276
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:16,014
(man arguing in Spanish)

277
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:16,847
(horn honking)

278
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:17,680
- [Man] What's up man?

279
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,513
- Hey, look at that.

280
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:19,490
What do we got?

281
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,021
A quarter, catch it.

282
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,006
Good, you want a tip?

283
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,486
Start your college fund with that.

284
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:26,319
- You.

285
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,819
- Ladies, bonjour.

286
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,062
What are we doing?

287
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:32,109
Little drinks here out on South Beach?

288
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,924
Very, very nice.

289
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:35,279
Need someone to pay your bills?

290
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,917
What about buy you expensive jewelry?

291
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,417
You like that, don't you, hmm?

292
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,410
What about licking between your toes?

293
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,716
Hmm, you would like
that, I know you would.

294
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,733
You're all so beautiful.

295
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:51,272
And that over there, that's
my late model black Rolls.

296
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:52,952
I know you saw me drive up in

297
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,568
'cause I saw you checking me out.

298
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,144
- It's very late.

299
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,580
- Witty, very witty.

300
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,666
Hey, look I got frequent
flyer miles on my Sears card.

301
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,914
Why don't we go use that and
make a little oochie coochie.

302
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:04,994
Come on girls where you--

303
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:05,827
- [Woman] Come on.

304
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,410
(upbeat music)

305
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,874
- Yeah, hello.

306
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,322
Wife swapper?

307
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,624
I wanna talk to you about renting a broad.

308
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:25,457
So, how much for one in their 20s?

309
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,190
I want one with big silicone lips

310
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,523
and big silicone nips, yeah.

311
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:38,550
A tight ass for sure, perfect.

312
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,387
Ten thousand?

313
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,076
Are you nuts?

314
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,829
No broads worth ten grand.

315
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,579
Gimme a break, forget
it, you guys are crazy.

316
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,112
(everyone laughing)

317
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,227
- [Boss] Junior!

318
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,526
Get your ass over here
with some coffee, now!

319
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,827
- Oh!

320
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:57,583
(girls screaming)

321
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,500
(everyone yelling)

322
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:03,262
- You insect.

323
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:04,815
I will kill you.

324
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,713
I will disengorge your
organs, crush your vertebrae,

325
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,632
and slice you like a pizza.

326
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,171
And do you know why?

327
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,191
- It's because you're fired!

328
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,092
- No, you can't fire me because I quit!

329
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:16,925
- No, you're fired.

330
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:17,758
- No, I quit.

331
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:18,591
- Fired.

332
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:19,424
- Quit.

333
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:20,257
- Fired.

334
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,090
- Quit.

335
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,923
- Fired.

336
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:22,756
- Quit.

337
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,589
- Fired.

338
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,422
- I'm fired.

339
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,566
- Yeah, you quit, I mean
you, you're double fired!

340
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:28,149
(upbeat music)

341
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:37,039
(everyone yelling)

342
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,905
(jazz music)

343
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,039
- Hey Dad.

344
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,579
- Junior, what are you doing?

345
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,667
I thought you were working,
where are the babes?

346
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,000
- Yeah, well they sent me out
to scout new talent, you know.

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,520
- [Barry] You got fired didn't you.

348
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,956
- Yeah, but it wasn't my fault.

349
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,028
- Never is.

350
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,278
Look, sit down.

351
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,871
- Man, you should've seen
me with all those models.

352
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,044
In a week I could've been
a fashion photographer

353
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,385
and in a month I could've
been a film director.

354
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,672
- Yeah, and next year
President of the United States.

355
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:19,256
What would happen if you
were teamed up with somebody

356
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,483
who knew something about business?

357
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:21,345
- Like Donald Trump.

358
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:23,697
- Yeah, or Ivan Boesky.

359
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:26,288
- Wait a minute, are you
trying to say that you and me.

360
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,002
- Could get together in business

361
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:31,252
and maybe open our own modeling agency.

362
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,880
- That's the worst idea I've ever heard.

363
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,840
- Exactly, it's so bad it just might work.

364
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,118
- You're right.

365
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:40,379
- Yes.

366
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,756
- Darling, you're gonna love them.

367
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:43,698
They're all fresh faces just from Europe.

368
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:44,979
We're gonna go pick them up today.

369
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,065
Yes, we have Brit from England,
we have Babs from Texas.

370
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,520
Germany is, of course it's from Germany.

371
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,467
(horn honking)

372
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,300
I've to be honest,

373
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,262
yes, she just came off
the covers of Vogue.

374
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,004
Great, I want a car to
take me to the airport

375
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:56,691
at six to pick up the new girls.

376
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,765
- You like my pouf pouf?

377
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,598
I do a pouf pouf.

378
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,002
- Oh God I don't care
about your pouf pouf,

379
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,438
just go get me a car to pick up the girls.

380
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,439
Come on, shoo shoo shoo.

381
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,469
- [Man] But what about my pouf pouf?

382
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,302
(whimsical music)

383
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,716
(airplane screeching)

384
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,844
- [Junior] Hey, Dad,
there's a Swedish one they

385
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,414
were talking about let's get her first.

386
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,908
Oh there she is, that has to be her.

387
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,849
She's hotter than they said she was.

388
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,318
- [Barry] What is she
a ref, black and white.

389
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,651
Good, very nice.

390
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:30,486
- [Junior] Wow.

391
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:33,146
- [Barry] Blonde, uh huh, she's the one.

392
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:36,751
- Hi, we're here from the
agency to pick you up.

393
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,728
- This is nice.

394
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:40,595
- Here, let me get your bag.

395
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,428
- Wow.

396
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,261
- Hey, what's you're name sugar lips?

397
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,094
- My name?

398
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,685
Oh, my name.

399
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,102
My name is Inga.

400
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:47,935
- Inga?

401
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:49,626
- I am from Sweden.

402
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:52,699
- Nah, that will never work if
you wanna work in this town.

403
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,861
From now on your name is Zinga.

404
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:55,694
- Zinga?

405
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,423
- Zinga, now that's a classy name.

406
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,256
- [Barry] Yeah.

407
00:17:58,256 --> 00:17:59,089
- Oh.

408
00:17:59,089 --> 00:17:59,922
- Come on, get in.

409
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:00,755
- [Zinga] Okay.

410
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,998
- [Barry] Zinga, Zing
yourself in this car dear.

411
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,952
You're, beautiful.
- Wow, this is nice.

412
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,324
- [Barry] Yes it is,
almost as nice as you.

413
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,340
So I bet you like Aquavit huh?

414
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,062
- [Junior] Dad wait,
real models don't drink.

415
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:14,625
- Oh yeah, I drink all the time in Sweden.

416
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,850
- [Junior] Okay Dad, the
next one we have to get is,

417
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,350
oh the German one.

418
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,792
That's one of those airlines.

419
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,330
- [Junior] Gosh, she is there.

420
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:29,916
- You're late.

421
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,432
- [Barry] Hold on cutie.

422
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:33,893
- This one's a looker.

423
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,601
(speaking foreign language)

424
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,835
- Hey maybe you and I can
have some bratwurst sometime.

425
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,379
- Who is this schwank?

426
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:43,658
I'm going to report him to the agency.

427
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:46,357
- Really, I am the agency.

428
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:49,857
(airplane engine roaring)

429
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,428
(whistling loudly)

430
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,867
- [Barry] Man, she's got legs that go

431
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,867
all the way to the alps.

432
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,453
- I don't care what your name is Fraulein.

433
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:09,703
From now on your name is Legs, come on.

434
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,570
- [Barry] Welcome.

435
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,773
- [Michael] He he, he he.

436
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,721
- [Barry] Virgin Atlantic, let's go there.

437
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,023
- Hi, we're from the agency.

438
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,207
Let me see if your name is on the list.

439
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,154
- Of course it's on the list.

440
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:39,934
It's Brit, I'm on the list.
- Brit.

441
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:40,797
Okay, here you are.

442
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:41,797
- Thank you.

443
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:43,696
- [Barry] Hop on in.

444
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:44,529
Oh there's no room.

445
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:45,698
- I got it.

446
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:46,642
- [Barry] It's a little tight there.

447
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:48,100
- Sorry.

448
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,930
- [Barry] Slide on in here Brit.

449
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,809
- [Junior] Slide right on in.

450
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,099
- Why do I feel like I'm in
between a rock and a hard place?

451
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,050
- Well, I don't know about the rock

452
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,883
but I can definitely tell you about the--

453
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,299
- Dad, haven't you ever heard about

454
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,136
sexual harassment in the workplace?

455
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,553
- Heard about it?

456
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,381
I invented it.

457
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,785
- [Brit] Oh God.

458
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:08,368
(Brit gagging)

459
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,889
- Can you tell me where we are?

460
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,511
- No I'm sorry, no Ingles.
- Hey, here she is.

461
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:22,691
- Hi, excuse me, can y'all tell
me is this Miami or Chicago?

462
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:23,741
- [Junior] This is Miami.

463
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:24,864
We're from the agency.

464
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:25,697
- Hi.

465
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:26,754
- Hi, how you doing?

466
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:27,645
Do you have a name?

467
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:28,478
- Babs.

468
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,893
- [Barry] Babs?

469
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,805
Why don't we make that Boobs?

470
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,253
- Cool it Dad.

471
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,135
- No, Babs.
- Lemme get that for you.

472
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:35,952
- Babs is fine, Babs will do.

473
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,022
- Why don't you and
your friends hop on in.

474
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:37,855
- Hi, y'all.

475
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:38,688
- [Girls] Hi.

476
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:39,521
- [Junior] Give it a rest.

477
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,354
- [Girl] Hi.

478
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:41,854
- Okay, settle in.

479
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:46,587
We're off to see the wizard.

480
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:52,764
(birds chirping)

481
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,871
- Well here we are, at the mansion.

482
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:00,912
- Home sweet home.

483
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:03,079
- [Barry] Home sweet home.

484
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,250
(upbeat rock music)

485
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,933
- Juan.

486
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,211
- Hey, senor Barry.

487
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:16,766
You going to take care of me, eh?

488
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:20,000
If not, I'm going to tell the big one.

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,780
- Girls this is the B And
B Models corporate yacht.

490
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,697
Pretty hot.

491
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,186
This is the pool heated in the winter

492
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:40,269
and cooled in the summer.

493
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,527
Girls these are the tennis courts.

494
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:46,239
Feel free to use them anytime.

495
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,489
Nice shot, Dad.

496
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,757
Girls this is the hot tub.

497
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:56,960
Try to avoid going in
there during feeding time.

498
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,262
Trust me on that.

499
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:00,429
Hey, Dad living large huh?

500
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:02,439
Girls, this is it.

501
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,272
- Wow.

502
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:04,105
- [Barry] This is your new home.

503
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,105
- I love it.

504
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:08,291
- [Barry] It's huge isn't it.

505
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,208
(girls chattering)

506
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:17,363
(luggage falling)

507
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,990
(models laughing)

508
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,407
Get up you idiot.

509
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,630
Girls this is my living room

510
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,866
and it's your bedroom.

511
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,318
- So where do we sleep?

512
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,151
- Pick a couch, any couch will do.

513
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:39,569
I want you to consider
me your long lost uncle.

514
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,688
I want you all to know
that you can count on me,

515
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,688
that there will always be an
open bedroom door to my room.

516
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:50,836
- And now the house rules
are really basically simple.

517
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,281
First, try to respect each
others food, makeup, clothes,

518
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:58,123
and privacy but secondly,
and most importantly of all,

519
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:02,502
no guys ever, never, ever,
ever under any circumstances

520
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,431
without exception, instant
firing will follow.

521
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,920
Don't even think about it.

522
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,306
- What about bedroom checks?

523
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,837
I think we should have bedroom checks.

524
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:13,537
Absolutely, don't you think
bedroom checks would be good?

525
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:14,476
Yeah, we need that.

526
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,883
- Dad, I know the girls are sexy

527
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,689
but this is supposed to be a business.

528
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,110
- Fine look, I'm the
businessman here right?

529
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,129
In this business we have an expression.

530
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,791
It's called mixing business with pleasure.

531
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,041
(intense upbeat music)

532
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:37,407
(models chattering)
(models laughing)

533
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:02,826
- Hey, that's my bed.

534
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:06,553
- Honey, I deserve the
biggest and the best

535
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:11,053
and the biggest is always
the best in men and in beds.

536
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,189
Get your stuff.

537
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,100
(loud hammering)

538
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:23,532
All right, you watch out
bitch because I am going to

539
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:25,532
be more famous than you.

540
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:29,706
- And how are you gonna do that?

541
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:31,781
- By sleeping with the
right man of course.

542
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:36,781
- (gasps) Sleeping with
the right ... (scoffs)

543
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,643
I'm gonna reach the top of the world

544
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:42,643
by sleeping only with the
man I intend to marry.

545
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,513
(kissing loudly)

546
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,094
- Intend to marry?

547
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:48,731
Girl are you crazy?

548
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,045
What if he has other plans?

549
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:53,878
You know like loving you
and then leaving you?

550
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,235
- No, not my man.

551
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,024
Believe me I can spot them.

552
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:03,524
- Do you love him?

553
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,930
I love him very, very much.

554
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,698
- Then I think you ought to marry him

555
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,289
and have babies right away.

556
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,362
- [Model] What?

557
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:16,695
- Did I say something wrong?

558
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,375
- What do you do with all of this?

559
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,858
- I use them.

560
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:24,862
You see I'm going to be an actress.

561
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:27,719
Modeling is only a step
towards a silver screen for me.

562
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,185
- What does modeling
have to do with acting?

563
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:33,209
- Directors sleep with models

564
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,649
and until you go out with a director

565
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,048
and sleep with him you'll
never be an actress.

566
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,529
So what are you doing here?

567
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,346
- Some guy stopped me
on the street in Surigao

568
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:43,805
and offered me a ticket here.

569
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:45,729
He never asked if I'd modeled before.

570
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,260
- Oh, so have you?

571
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,761
- No.

572
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:50,326
- No?

573
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:51,159
- No.

574
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,991
- So, you've never modeled before?

575
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:54,824
- No.

576
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,371
- That's all right, we'll teach you.

577
00:26:57,371 --> 00:27:00,123
(models laughing)

578
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:01,131
- Girls.

579
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:02,517
Zinga bring the shaving cream.

580
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:05,498
Babs bring your brassieres
and bring stuffing,

581
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,713
lots and lots of stiffing.

582
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:10,089
It's all right we'll teach you.

583
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:14,942
- Well first when go get a job
it's called see go, go-see,

584
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:17,314
and you have to dress up like a model.

585
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:19,310
- You mean in high heels
and a tight dress right?

586
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,200
- No, no, no, no, no, forget that stuff.

587
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,891
Trendy, funky clothes.

588
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,526
Hop hip, hop rap, these clothes.

589
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,436
- Yeah, yeah, and when
you see someone you know,

590
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,558
like a makeup artist or
photographer, even if you

591
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:31,466
don't remember their names
they breathe all over you

592
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,971
and they got really stinky
breath you've got to go

593
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:34,029
up to them you go,

594
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,844
"Oh, it's so good to see you, oh!"

595
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,431
(kissing loudly)

596
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:39,691
Wow.

597
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,640
- Oh God, and don't forget to
tell them they look fabulous.

598
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,850
- Oh yeah, you look great.

599
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,570
- Even if you don't remember their names.

600
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,881
- But what do I do if I get a job.

601
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,449
- Ah, that's the easy part.

602
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,103
Just act like a model.

603
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:54,369
- And when you get a fashion
show, it's called runway, okay.

604
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,606
Now line up, line up.

605
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:57,572
And this is what you do.

606
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,733
Ready, boobs out, butt
in, put your head up

607
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,979

Okay, now you try go ahead.

00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:26,399

616
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,855
- [Model] Oh it was great,
beautiful, beautiful.

617
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:30,688
(models clapping)

618
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,116
(cat call whistling)

619
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:47,616
- Hey, hey, now how's that for new talent?

620
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:50,637
Check it out.

621
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:55,265
- Whoo wee baby I feel
a love thing coming on.

622
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:56,231
- They're walking right past us

623
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,982
and didn't even say hello, huh.

624
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:01,232
- Hey, hey, I love you and you and you.

625
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:05,309
Oh my God I think I'm gonna faint.

626
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:10,122
- [Model] Miami Beach
looks so small on here.

627
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:12,012
- Oh, but that's because it's a map.

628
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:14,512
It's much bigger in real life.

629
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,131
- Hey, guys look there's Barry, come on.

630
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,760

631
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,173

00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:24,839

(Barry exhaling)

640
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,385
Buns and boobs.

641
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:37,328
Whoo, I love this business.

642
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:39,995
(upbeat music)

643
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:48,171
(models chattering)

644
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:51,265
- [Junior] Oh hey girls.

645
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:52,098
- [Models] Hi.

646
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:54,181
- Okay everybody line up.

647
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,580
Zinga, eyebrows.

648
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,192
I want those eyebrows
plucked into a thin line.

649
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:04,040
Otherwise, you're looking really good.

650
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,290
And you, Brit, you have great skin tone

651
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,423
but don't hide it under all that blush,

652
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,733
you know just a little bet.

653
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:18,984
Legs, Legs, don't show
so much leg on go-sees.

654
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,421
Make them ask to see those.

655
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:23,668
No, make them beg to see those.

656
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,401
Whoa, is that real?

657
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:27,311
- But of course it is.

658
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:29,937
- That watch is worth at least $5,000.

659
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:30,770
- [Fab] So?

660
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,011
- You know, if they think
you're rich you won't work.

661
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,187
- [Barry] Yeah, I'll take that.

662
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:35,858
- Dad, Dad, I got it.

663
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:38,168
Just take it off later.

664
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:39,364
- Yeah, later.

665
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:40,864
- Good, very good.

666
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:42,719
No, sorry.

667
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:46,466
(spitting)

668
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,987
Ladies, you are on the hottest
fashion scene on the planet.

669
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,173
Right in the epicenter.

670
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:55,787
I mean Claudia, Paulina,
Naomi, they're all here.

671
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,866
- So, how much money do we get?

672
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:59,705
- Yeah, okay, let's talk about that.

673
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:01,067
See this is how it works.

674
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,737
First, we query up by the day.

675
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:06,811
Unlimited mileage and
unlimited cleavage, mm-hmm.

676
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,396
Now, there is 20% that we
take out for deductible.

677
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,504
There's 18% for wear and tear,

678
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,016
then of course, there's 45%

679
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:15,738
to maintain this lavish
palace, then of course,

680
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:17,124
there's state and local taxes,

681
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,762
there is tax, tag and title.

682
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,282
Price is subject to change.

683
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:21,878
Void where prohibited by law.

684
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:24,392
Excuse me, any questions?

685
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:25,462
Good, I didn't think so.

686
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:26,295
Barry Junior.

687
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:27,543
- Thank you Barry Senior.

688
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,990
The bad news is girls,

689
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,399
you're all gonna need new portfolios

690
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,182
if you wanna work in this time.

691
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,873
The good news is, I'm gonna
show all your new pictures.

692
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:37,539
- Yes but, there will be a small charge.

693
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,157
- How small?

694
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,490
- $500 per girl.

695
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:43,567
- You've got to be shitting me.

696
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:48,567
- Babs, high fashion models do
not use the term shitting me.

697
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:50,696
- I don't even have
(speaking foreign language).

698
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:51,662
- Don't worry girls, don't worry,

699
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:52,838
we'll work with you, okay?

700
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:54,918
Listen, you just pay us
what you can for now,

701
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,828
and we'll take the rest
out of your residuals.

702
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:58,255
- Along with the rent for the mansion.

703
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,401
- [Models] Rent?

704
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,227
- But don't worry, $500 an hour,

705
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:02,635
you girls will be making that much money

706
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,355
in no time at all.

707
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,478
- [Model] All right.

708
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:07,969
- Okay now everybody, let's

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Okay get it off the shoulder a little bit.

00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:16,568
There you go, oh this is good.

714
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,068
(camera shutter clicking)

715
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,495
Oh this is great, you can't screw this up.

716
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:27,057
Give me the Twin Towers, come

717
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:29,420
Don't worry, this will
strengthen your thing.

Oh yeah, oh yeah, come

722
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:04,055
(upbeat music)

723
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,629
- Oh looking fabulous and lovely,

724
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,359
stand up the hair, I like it like that.

725
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,501
Come up on the hair.
- Ultimately

726
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:09,334
you have to handle this.

727
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,167
- [Loopi] Come up with the hair,

728
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,735
I like it like this, pouf, pouf.

729
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:15,064
- It looks like electric shock therapy.

730
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,342
- [Loopi] We'll try dreadlocks later.

731
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,175
- Go on.

732
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:19,569
- I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

733
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,303
No, it's big hair, that's what it is.

734
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:22,455
Lackluster really.

735
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,369
Knock that off.

736
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,209
- Loopi.

737
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:25,763
- You look like funny name man,

738
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:28,527
the bald headed TV, Luke Perry.

739
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:31,761
You know I think maybe perhaps,
maybe we do the tuck, tuck.

740
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:36,137
- Loopi, you are the one
who said no tuck, tuck.

741
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,564
- [Loopi] Okey-dokey, no tuck tuck.

742
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:38,836
- Get in here, what--

743
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:40,239
- I got it, I got it.

744
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,072
- Let me see that.

745
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,216
- I can't believe it.

746
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,049
- Hmm.

747
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,271
- This is good.

748
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,378
- We're in business.

749
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:51,068
- [Junior] Here are your
new go-see lists girls.

750
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:53,901
I made copies for each one of you.

751
00:33:57,074 --> 00:34:00,151
- And here are your new portfolios.

752
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,072
- [Junior] And you'll notice
that I'm using an avant garde,

753
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,438
nuevo art deco style,
which Helmut Newton and I

754
00:34:03,438 --> 00:34:06,535
are at the cutting edge of this new look.

755
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,775
I think you'll really like 'em.

756
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:10,797
- Yes, and as the cop
on the TV says girls,

757
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:14,630
go out there and get
'em, before they get you.

758
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,797
- [Model] Helmut, don't you
think this is a little too much?

759
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:20,277
- [Helmut] No, no, no
touch, no touchy here.

760
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:22,400
(workers chattering)

761
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,828
I'm shooting from the ground up

762
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,199
and the sunlight is coming
into the shadow, hello.

763
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,340
- [Loopi] Who is this person?

764
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,643
- Yeah, I'm wondering about this myself.

765
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,189
- Is this for models, ya.

766
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,961
- No, it's a dog show stupid.

767
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:35,893
(everyone laughing)

768
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,066
- [Helmut] And she has a sense
of humor on top of it all.

769
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:39,463
The sunlight is ...

770
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:40,296
(girl screaming)

771
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:41,796
Oh, oh my god, oh.

772
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:46,256
- I hope your dogs can swim then.

773
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:48,756
Now, where's the Queen Mother?

774
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:54,159
- Hey boss, how you like my new look?

775
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:56,998
I think we might be
able to work with this,

776
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,091
the wet look.

777
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,450
- Good yeah, no out, no in, no out.

778
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,125
Yeah good, no, no, yeah good, good, hmm.

779
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,708
(upbeat music)

780
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,504
(man groaning)

781
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:13,587
- Legs, what?

782
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:17,481
(girl groaning)

783
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,853
- [Legs] Oh I'm sorry boss.

784
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:21,686
- It's okay.

785
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,519
- [Legs] Sorry.

786
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,519
- It's okay.

787
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:27,343
- I'm about to go to the casting
for a skating commercial.

788
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:29,430
- Don't worry, I'll teach
you a couple of things

789
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,689
about roller blading.

790
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,423
Okay, like this.

791
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,447
It's all in the waist, all in the waist.

792
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,096
Okay push out, okay go ahead.

793
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:39,711
You're doing great, you're doing good.

794
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,253
Wait Legs, watch out!

795
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,411
(Legs screaming)

796
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:43,994
Legs, are you okay?

797
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,260
(groaning) Whoa.

798
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,161
- See that was great.

799
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:51,123
- [Junior] Yeah you are great.

800
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,289
You know the problem is that your pair

801
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:53,927
doesn't have any bounce.

802
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,767
- What do you mean, I bounce.

803
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,579
- Yeah, but not like the new ones do.

804
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:59,565
You know, we gotta get you a new pair.

805
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,622
- You Americans always

806
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:03,219
want to replace everything, even breasts.

807
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:06,443
- Hey, I wasn't talking about your tits.

808
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:07,786
- Tits?

809
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,100
- You know hooters.

810
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,265
- Hooters?

811
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:13,426
- Melons, gazongas, jugs, no cones, knobs,

812
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:15,526
your breast, how 'bout breasts?

813
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:18,130
I wasn't talking about your breast.

814
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,797
- Would you like to?

815
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:23,703
- Well, you know I gotta go to work.

816
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:26,572
I'll see you later though.

817
00:36:26,572 --> 00:36:29,228
- Okay, later we'll talk about my breast.

818
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,287
- [Man] You'll see, dogs
really love that food.

819
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:32,661
(dog growling)

820
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,760
- Onie, be a good
doggie, eat the dog food.

821
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,285
Be a good dog. (screams)

822
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,118
Bad doggie.

823
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:39,141
- [Bass] Hey, you can't do that.

824
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:40,014
- Ugh.

825
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:42,944
(engine revving)

826
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:45,243
- Is this a fisheye lens?

827
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:48,393
It looks to me like a fisheye lens, Loopi.

828
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:51,560
(upbeat cheery music)

829
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:57,613
If I wanted a fisheye lens,
I would ask for one, no?

830
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:58,446
- No.

831
00:36:58,446 --> 00:36:59,279
- Yeah.

832
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,112
- Si.

833
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:01,477
- No, yeah.

834
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:03,560
- I think a fisheye lens.

835
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,972
- Now, where is the talent?

836
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,403
Where is the talent?

837
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,236
- Helmut.

838
00:37:12,427 --> 00:37:13,760
- Oh, wonderful.

839
00:37:14,937 --> 00:37:17,564
Take this trash off
please, show us your bosom.

840
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,213
Beautiful, yeah.

841
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:20,296
- I know you.

842
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:22,871
- [Brit] No you don't.

843
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:25,422
You probably wish you did.

844
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:27,407
- [Man] I'd remember that body anywhere.

845
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,622
You and your friends just
started working today.

846
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,622
- That's right, how'd you know that?

847
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:37,518
- It says so in the script.

848
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:38,351
- Oh.

849
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:41,180
- [Helmut] Yeah, I can see it,
yeah good, yeah this is it.

850
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,112
Yeah, oh yeah that's it.

851
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:46,801
Ooh, ooh, I really do look good today.

852
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,051
Ah, okay, yeah.

853
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:53,036
Just one more, next girl,
next girl please, yeah.

854
00:37:54,654 --> 00:37:57,487
- Don't worry, I'll see you again.

855
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:00,733
- [Helmut] Yeah, beautiful.

856
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:04,787
Loopi, out, like old Helmut do his art.

857
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:08,063
Yeah good, beautiful,
look beautiful, yeah.

858
00:38:08,063 --> 00:38:10,230
Oh sexy, good, yeah, good.

859
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:13,668
Work it, oh yeah.

860
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,418
(dramatic music)

861
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:19,407
- Si.

862
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:24,742
(glasses clanking)

863
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:27,628
Ooh.

864
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:32,003
- I can't believe it.

865
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:34,585
That stupid little dog tried to bite me.

866
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,508
It wasn't my fault.

867
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,029
- [Model] Hey.

868
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:38,891
- Hi.

869
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,590
- I found this wonderful new shop.

870
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,850
Want to see what I bought?

871
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,683
- [Model] Sure.

872
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:45,209
- You know I couldn't
find any of the places.

873
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:49,491
- Hi everybody, I just signed
for one of the commercials.

874
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,246
Junior taught me how to be good.

875
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,922
- [Model] I guess that means
you didn't get the job.

876
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:55,755
- [Man] Hey there.

877
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:56,588
- What, hi.

878
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:58,355
- [Man] I told you I'd see you again.

879
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:00,696
- Are you following me?

880
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:03,029
- [Man] Can I see your book?

881
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,472
Who shot these things, Ray Charles?

882
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:08,824
- Yeah, they're good, no.

883
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:11,213
- Junior says they look
like Helmut Newton.

884
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:14,637
- Helmut Newton, no, no, fig newton, yes.

885
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:16,695
(everyone laughing)

886
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,778
- Don't laugh at my book.

887
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:30,385
I have never been so
incredibly insulted, so rude.

888
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:33,503
- [Man] Hey, wait, just wait.

889
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:36,538
- No, don't make fun of our books.

890
00:39:36,538 --> 00:39:37,810
- We can make it up to you okay.

891
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,406
I live with these three other guys,

892
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:41,075
and they were wondering if you girls

893
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,099
would have us over for dinner tonight?

894
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,107
- Yeah, you girls can cook the food,

895
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,283
serve it to us, and clean up,

896
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,570
while we drink beer and play
volleyball, how about it.

897
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,038
- What about the other two guys.

898
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,899
- Are they good lucking too?

899
00:39:52,899 --> 00:39:55,019
- Shoot, I'd say we're good looking.

900
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,453
- Okay, what do y'all want to eat?

901
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:00,826
- Maybe a little sushi and some sashimi.

902
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:03,155
And maybe a little Dom
Perignon to wash it down.

903
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:06,443
- Yeah, and then we can have
some oysters on the half shell,

904
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,428
maybe a little bottle of Chardonnay,

905
00:40:08,428 --> 00:40:10,485
some smoked salmon in there,

906
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:12,365
and then we get up to main course.

907
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:13,198
- Yeah.

908
00:40:13,198 --> 00:40:14,031
- Filet mignon's great this time of year

909
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,190
with some artichokes, asparagus,

910
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,161
you know we can have a couple of

911
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,681
chocolate souffles and creme brulees,

912
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:23,105
before we go on to the vintage
ports and cognacs of course.

913
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:25,026
- Ooh all right.

914
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,549
- Okay, all right.

915
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,733
- Great, well we'll see
you girls tonight then.

916
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:29,566
- [Model] All right.

917
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:31,618
- All right, bye.

918
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:33,992
- Forget about it, we give
them beer and hotdogs.

919
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:35,839
In the meantime, we've got
some important business

920
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,089
to discuss with our agency.

921
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:40,512
- We can't get work with these pictures.

922
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:42,244
Mine makes me look like a dumb blonde.

923
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:43,077
- Me too.

924
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:43,910
- Me too.

925
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,587
- Me too, I want my old pictures back.

926
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:48,124
- [Model] And I want my money back.

927
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:51,412
- I like mine, I think
Junior makes me chic,

928
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:53,883
like Hollywood movie, and I like that.

929
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:55,829
- Look, let me call you back.

930
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,730
Girls listen, JR, he's like that one eared

931
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,655
groomba guy, Van Gogh, do
you remember his painting?

932
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:08,202
The Scream, oh the power of
that image, unbelievable.

933
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,431
He is an artist.

934
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:11,363
Now, don't question me or him,

935
00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:13,608
go, out of here, please.

936
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:15,457
- I think you're right.

937
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:18,374
- I know I'm right, thank you Legs.

938
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:23,849
- Dad, I just passed
the girls in the hall,

939
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,126
they really looked pissed.

940
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:26,315
What did you do to them now?

941
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,701
- Look, they hate their books

942
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,790
and you didn't get them any work today JR.

943
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,173
- 'Cause nobody has any vision, any taste,

944
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:34,105
any appreciation of art.

945
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,639
- Art, like what?

946
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,705
- Like this bike, this bike
is made of Russian titanium,

947
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,497
pla-ta-nium, uranium,
the best money can buy.

948
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:42,348
- Yeah, you mean the best bike

949
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:44,721
the girl's money can buy JR.

950
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,359
- Corporate travel, it's a
legitimate business expense.

951
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:47,496
- [Barry] Is that right?

952
00:41:47,496 --> 00:41:48,329
- Yes.

953
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:49,439
- Well speaking of expenses,

954
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,517
I'm doing some traveling myself kid.

955
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:52,350
- [JR] Where you going?

956
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,033
- Look, I'm outta here,
I can't bone these girls,

957
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,473
I ain't making any money,

958
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:57,817
what the hell am I doing here, huh?

959
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:00,264
- Wait, wait, wait, I
mean where are you going?

960
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:01,837
You haven't even heard
the master plan yet.

961
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,685
- The master plan, I'll
give you the master plan.

962
00:42:03,685 --> 00:42:05,080
I'm gonna rent some dirty movies

963
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,037
and then I'm going home
to hook up my blowup doll

964
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:09,902
to the vacuum, that's the master plan.

965
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,593
- Okay, so I guess you don't want to make

966
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:14,414
some major buckanagas with me.

967
00:42:14,414 --> 00:42:16,347
- Major buckanagas, what do you mean?

968
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:17,577
- Come here.

969
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,833
(Junior whispering)

970
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,303
Send their girls out.

971
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,136
- You can do that?

972
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,033
- Hey, am I Barry Junior or what?

973
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:25,747
- I don't know, but if you pull that off,

974
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:27,079
that'll be unbelievable.

975
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,415
I'll issue you some major stock warrants,

976
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:31,448
some convertible dentures,
and until we go public,

977
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,951
you'll remain the schmuck, okay.

978
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,463
- Sure Dad.

979
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,296
- Perfect.

980
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:43,325
♪ Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah ♪

981
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:48,325
♪ Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah ♪

982
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:52,879

983
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,215
- Swedish right?

984
00:42:57,215 --> 00:42:58,620
- How did you know?

985
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,120
- Psychic I guess.

986
00:43:01,193 --> 00:43:03,935
- It's better if you play with two.

987
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:06,012
- Wow, where did you learn
how to play like that?

988
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:07,031
- UK.

989
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:07,864
- What?

990
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:08,697
- United Kingdom.

991
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:09,530
- Is that in Ohio?

992
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,414
- England.

993
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:11,475
- Oh England.

994
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:12,308
- Right.

995
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:13,141
- Okay.

996
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,087
- Where'd you learn how to play?

997
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:17,754
- UVA, you know it's
University of Virginia.

998
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:23,163
That's the UV, I don't
know what the A's for.

999
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,634
- So you do a lot of
sporting commercials, right?

1000
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:30,005
- Obviously you didn't notice my ass.

1001
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:31,730
- [Both] Jean commercials.

1002
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,468
- So why do you preppies wear
those wide rim glasses anyway?

1003
00:43:35,468 --> 00:43:36,801
- Are you talking to me?

1004
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:38,176
- Yes I am preppy.

1005
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:39,009
- Catch.

1006
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,311
Hey, just because I'm
a preppy from Boston,

1007
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:45,252
doesn't make me a bad guy.

1008
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:48,949
- Really, well I bet you
wear those preppy underwear,

1009
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:52,394
you know, the kind that
gets all bunched up

1010
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:54,063
between the cheeks when you stand up.

1011
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:56,960
(man groaning)

1012
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,043
- Wanna see my role book?

1013
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,879
- Wow, this is some great shots.

1014
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:08,817
Can I tell you something?

1015
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:11,665
You look a lot better in person.

1016
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:12,547
- You're not just telling me that

1017
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:15,117
'cause you want to get me in bed are you?

1018
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:16,587
- Actually yes I am.

1019
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,805
Did I tell you I was studying
to be a veterinarian?

1020
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:20,001
- [Girl] Really?

1021
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:20,834
- Yeah.

1022
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:23,487
- I love animals, I almost
married one last year.

1023
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:25,576
- Really, me too.

1024
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,968
(everyone laughing)

1025
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,477
(men yelling)

1026
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:33,133
- [Man] Whoo, here we go.

1027
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:36,387
(everyone cheering)

1028
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:39,220
(water splashing)

1029
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:43,571
(man yelling)

1030
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:47,353
(jazz music)

1031
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:04,507
- Obviously you can get it in
huh, let's play strip poker.

1032
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:05,340
- [Man] Here we go.

1033
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,183
- Wait, wait, wait, I
think I hear Junior's call.

1034
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:09,779
We better get inside.

1035
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:11,363
- What, you girls turn into vampires

1036
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:13,409
at sunset or something?

1037
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:15,762
- Junior says that if we
show up late for casting,

1038
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:18,060
they call us ragged.

1039
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,057
- Buy hey come on, we don't have

1040
00:45:20,057 --> 00:45:23,039
to even work tomorrow, so let's party.

1041
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:24,479
- [Man] Hey Junior, come on, let's party.

1042
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:25,590
Come on Junior, come on.

1043
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,015
- I'd like to, but sorry
guys, I'm management now

1044
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,157
and these girls have got
to get their beauty sleep.

1045
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,889
They have a lot of work tomorrow.

1046
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:33,454
- How'd we get a lot of work?

1047
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:34,631
- Well just trust me okay.

1048
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,311
I'll give your girls your
go-sees in the morning,

1049
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:38,537
but you gotta go to bed.

1050
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,058
- [Model] I feel like
we live in a monastery.

1051
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:42,058
- [Model] Come on girls.

1052
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:54,806
- You gonna play?

1053
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:56,490
- How many cards in strip poker?

1054
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,720
- I don't know.

1055
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
- Just deal.

1056
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:01,489
- I told you Chantal is booked to do

1057
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:03,032
the Eu de monde perfume commercial

1058
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:04,857
at the Majestic at 10, right.

1059
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:06,327
Yes Christy is also booked at 10.

1060
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,510
Yes, she is doing the Lamborghini shoot,

1061

12 Street Beach, yes, 12 Street Beach.

1062
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:11,611

- Paulina's booked to do the
Harley Davidson commercial.

1064
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,273
Yes, it's a national, I
told you that yesterday.

1065
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,614
She's wearing some sort of thong.

1066
00:46:18,614 --> 00:46:19,694
I don't know that they change it.

1067
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,329
(upbeat music)

1068
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:23,791
- All right Fab, here it is.

1069
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:24,624
- [Junior] Okay, you go in here

1070
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:26,311
for the Eu de monde perfume commercial.

1071
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:27,144
- [Fab] All right.

1072
00:46:27,144 --> 00:46:29,175
(everyone cheering)

1073
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:34,175
- [Junior] Oh Fab, you're booked

00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,073
- Yes, excuse me.

1244
00:55:48,073 --> 00:55:51,472
That's a violation of
statute 12345 and six,

1245
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:54,473
not to mention 69.9 of the penal code.

1246
00:55:54,473 --> 00:55:56,729
- Nobody ever called me indecent before.

1247
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:57,664
- I'm not saying you're indecent,

1248
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,862
I'm not even saying what
you're exposing is indecent.

1249
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:01,734
As a matter of fact, it's kind of decent.

1250
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:02,567
I'm just doing my job.

1251
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,768
My job obviously is to give out tickets.

1252
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:05,767
Now let me see your IUD.

1253
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:08,733
- [Man] Officer, I'd like to
report a crime in progress.

1254
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:11,150
- What are you talking about?

1255
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:20,495
That is a crime in progress.

1256
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:22,662
41-16, we have a 36-24-36,

1257
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,401
with a size four top in progress.

1258
00:56:26,401 --> 00:56:28,249
Can you give me some back up units please?

1259
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:29,882
- How about dinner?

1260
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:31,418
- Okay.

1261
00:56:31,418 --> 00:56:36,418
(camera shutter clicking)
(upbeat music)

1262
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,400
(silly dramatic music)

1263
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,229
- This is my talent?

1264
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:58,561
Loopi, this is my talent?

1265
00:56:58,561 --> 00:57:02,244
Makeup please, and the
dermatologist too maybe, huh?

1266
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:04,053
Yeah, yeah I think so, Loopi.

1267
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:04,886
- What?

1268
00:57:04,886 --> 00:57:08,337
- This is the talent you bring for me?

1269
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,861
I can't work, I can't, no, I can't.

1270
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,234
- Boss, boss man.

1271
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:13,067
- Ya.

1272
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,484
- This way, boss.

1273
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:17,796
- Oh yes, this is beautiful.

1274
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:20,445
Best boys please, turn the camera around.

1275
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:21,528
Around we go.

1276
00:57:22,836 --> 00:57:23,927
Oh this is crazy.

1277
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,427
Not that far, this way please.

1278
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:29,399
Oh okay, here we go now.

1279
00:57:29,399 --> 00:57:31,965
Settle down, settle down.

1280
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:33,965
On my cue, action, good.

1281
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,551
(birds chirping)

1282
00:57:44,109 --> 00:57:46,109
Oh yeah, very good, cut!

1283
00:57:48,379 --> 00:57:51,693
Front line, you have
something better to do?

1284
00:57:51,693 --> 00:57:53,169
Would you like to join us?

1285
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,878
You're looking here, you're looking there?

1286
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:56,250
What, you don't want to work with

1287
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,750
the great Helmut on movie, no.

1288
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,671
You're looking here I see.

1289
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:03,076
There's another commercial

1290
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:05,933
you would like to be
in perhaps, over there?

1291
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:08,740
Hmm, well what are you doing?

1292
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,140
Sit back down and you are grabbing balls.

1293
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,140
Will you hit anything, ooh incoming.

1294
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:17,880
Ooh, mm.

1295
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:22,430
- Yeah.

1296
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,104
- Hey balls, hey boss I meant.

1297
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:27,937
- Yeah.

1298
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,033
- I think I have a hot flash.

1299
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:34,317
- Of course you have a hot
flash, the sun is shining.

1300
00:58:34,317 --> 00:58:36,452
- No, no, no, a hot flash, a poof.

1301
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:38,561
- Oh, the hot flash.

1302
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:39,394
- Si, si.

1303
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:41,661
- And yeah, do you know
why you have the hot flash?

1304
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:44,253
- I don't know why, but I
think you're gonna tell me.

1305
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:46,420
- Because you are Italian.

1306
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,500
- Which one of you hags took my mousse?

1307
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,581
- Shut up.

1308
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:54,468
- [Girl] Those are mine!

1309
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:55,301
- [Model] No it's not.

1310
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:56,134
- You ate my cheese again.

1311
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:56,977
- It's mine, all mine.

1312
00:58:56,977 --> 00:58:59,644
(girls arguing)

1313
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:01,589
- Stop.

1314
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,533
- All right, all right, that is enough.

1315
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:06,890
That's enough!

1316
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,307
Hold it, stop it.

1317
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:12,781
Now come here, come here you guys.

1318
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:15,626
Listen to me, now let's
pretend we're adults

1319
00:59:15,626 --> 00:59:18,372
and talk about this, okay.

1320
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:20,653
You see we're all fighting
over nothing at all.

1321
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:22,547
What's really the problem?

1322
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,609
- The problem is, I haven't gotten paid

1323
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:26,190
for any of the work I did.

1324
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,458
- Me neither, and I have no money.

1325
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,338
- Yeah, well I just got a
bill for rent from Barry,

1326
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:33,223
can you believe that guy?

1327
00:59:33,223 --> 00:59:35,871
- Okay, then we all
agree, enough is enough.

1328
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:36,704
- Yeah.

1329
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:37,537
- Yeah.

1330
00:59:37,537 --> 00:59:38,465
- Yeah.

1331
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:41,729
- I think we should just quit
the agency until they pay us.

1332
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:42,919
- Yeah, and pay us now.

1333
00:59:42,919 --> 00:59:43,752
- Yeah.

1334
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:44,909
- [All] Yeah!

1335
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:46,183
(girls cheering)

1336
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:49,482
- Yeah, we will wrap up
yoga commercial on Friday.

1337
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:52,135
We can't return that
equipment until Monday.

1338
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,831
Ultimately, you're gonna
have to have security.

1339
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:55,998
- Oh yes, yes.

1340
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,172
- And if you can get equipment,
it will be Fuji stocks,

1341
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:03,672
or design bags for the models.

1342
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:06,849
(speaking foreign language)

1343
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:08,599
- Oh, where's my pen.

1344
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:11,756
- The set of TV, the rest
of these things, yeah.

1345
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:14,924
Go to sleep, yeah,
(speaking foreign language).

1346
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:16,341
That's good yeah.

1347
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:26,613
- Junior, what the hells
all the commotion here?

1348
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:28,905
- Huh, we're making a movie.

1349
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:31,461
- Who's we, I see me and you knot head.

1350
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,909
What are you French now, oui, oui,

1351
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:33,957
you got a mouse in your pocket?

1352
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:35,167
- Oh Dad, Dad, you and me.

1353
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,809
I'm directing and you're producing

1354
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,692
from an original script by yours truly.

1355
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:42,425
If I could just find one
we could shoot in two days.

1356
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:43,999
- So do you have one?

1357
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:45,332
- Oh here's one.

1358
01:00:46,197 --> 01:00:49,196
A British Werewolf From
Miami, what do you think?

1359
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:50,483
- A werewolf from Miami.

1360
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:51,316
- [Junior] Yeah.

1361
01:00:51,316 --> 01:00:52,879
- Sounds like a story about Madonna.

1362
01:00:52,879 --> 01:00:56,217
- Nah, she's totally for the part.

1363
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:59,288
But you know she does have
hair in all the right places.

1364
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,522
- So what else you got there?

1365
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:01,413
- This is a good one.

1366
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:03,116
This one we can shoot in a weekend.

1367
01:01:03,116 --> 01:01:05,311
It's about your life Dad,
it's called Mr. Miami.

1368
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:07,038
- Uh-huh, I like the way that sounds.

1369
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,649
Let me take a look at that.

1370
01:01:08,649 --> 01:01:10,053
- Nah, it's garbage.

1371
01:01:10,053 --> 01:01:10,965
- What do mean it's garbage.

1372
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:12,201
- It's garbage, it's just garbage.

1373
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,868
Anyways, here it is,

1374
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,956
this is perfection.

1375
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:19,832
That is good.

1376
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:20,858
- Perfection huh?

1377
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:24,642
Ah, from Miami to Eternity,
sounds like a classic.

1378
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:26,148
- Also known as Oscar's List.

1379
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:27,226
- [Barry] Hmm.

1380
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:30,551
- This is a film within
a film, within a film.

1381
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:32,557
You see what I did was I
ripped off the climax scenes

1382
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:34,967
of 40 Academy Award winning films

1383
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:36,512
and I wove them into this top script,

1384
01:01:36,512 --> 01:01:38,394
spectacular cinematic images.

1385
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,650
- Hmm, climax scenes huh?

1386
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,610
Now that sounds interesting.

1387
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,773
(girls chattering)

1388
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:43,606
- We quit.

1389
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:44,900
- I hate you.

1390
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,663
- [Model] Swine.

1391
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:48,548
- Junior, how could you do this to me?

1392
01:01:48,548 --> 01:01:50,720
- I'm tried of this rubbish, up your bum.

1393
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,280
- And we're gonna sue
you for all you're worth.

1394
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,634
- Fine, see you in small
claims court. (laughs)

1395
01:01:56,634 --> 01:01:57,965
- Wait, wait, you girls haven't even heard

1396
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,920
about the feature film
I've been asked to direct.

1397
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,805
- Yeah, the kid's got his big break.

1398
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,301
And he wants to make you girls stars.

1399
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:05,261
- Did you say stars?

1400
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:06,094
- I did.

1401
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:06,927
- You're lying.

1402
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:07,760
- Uh-huh.

1403
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,319
- Junior I'm so happy for you.

1404
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:10,348
- I'll tell you what, you girls show up

1405
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:11,706
at 8:00 a.m. Saturday morning

1406
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:13,338
and you'll see if we're lying to you.

1407
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:15,149
In the meantime I have
a copy of the script

1408
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,541
for each one of you.

1409
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:17,968
- Yeah, so why don't you
girls just take a script,

1410
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,896
any script, and memorize a part, any part.

1411
01:02:20,896 --> 01:02:22,336
- And where's the money for this?

1412
01:02:22,336 --> 01:02:24,090
- Oh is that what this
is about, cash girls?

1413
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,090
- Well here you go, see.

1414
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:28,723
Hey, not so fast.

1415
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:34,576
You girls are what we
moguls call, pay or play.

1416
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,962
That's right, you pay, we play.

1417
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,940
- Fab, here you go.

1418
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,448
You get to play that
memorable role from Octagon,

1419
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,490
I mean Octopussy.

1420
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,637
And you, Cleopatra.

1421
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,037
- But I thought Cleopatra was Egyptian.

1422
01:02:49,037 --> 01:02:51,363
- Well Cleopatra was Egyptian,

1423
01:02:51,363 --> 01:02:54,113
but Elizabeth Taylor was British.

1424
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:58,794
And Zinga, you get to roll on
the beach, sex on the beach.

1425
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:02,275
I hope it takes you from here to eternity.

1426
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:04,714
And Babs, you've used a gun before right?

1427
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,547
- Yeah.

1428
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,428
- Good, 'cause you're
gonna get Bonnie and Clyde.

1429
01:03:07,428 --> 01:03:08,711
- All right.

1430
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:10,555
- And Legs, fabulous Legs,

1431
01:03:10,555 --> 01:03:14,554
only you could play that
long-legged French Lieutenant,

1432
01:03:14,554 --> 01:03:15,971
I mean his woman.

1433
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:21,444
(men sighing)

1434
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:23,014
That was really a close call.

1435
01:03:23,014 --> 01:03:25,127
You know we really do have
to pay them this time.

1436
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:27,453
- Oh yeah, well how do
you expect us to pay them.

1437
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:28,909
You know we have to pay a film crew.

1438
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:30,982
You know what I'm talking about,
those big guys with tattoos

1439
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:32,532
who set things up, break things down,

1440
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:34,752
snap people's necks,
and breaks their knees.

1441
01:03:34,752 --> 01:03:36,420
- I know, I know, I know.

1442
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,544
Screw the writers, screw
the director, and--

1443
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:41,505
- Yeah, but most importantly,
screw the talent.

1444
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:46,505
(upbeat music)
(man snoring)

1445
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,832
- You boys the weekend shift?

1446
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:56,384
- That's right, 10-4,
over and out good buddy.

1447
01:03:56,384 --> 01:03:59,081
- They say this stuff's
worth over a million bucks.

1448
01:03:59,081 --> 01:03:59,914
Stay away!

1449
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:04,122
- I think you had a little
too much coffee there Bill!

1450
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:06,320
Hit the road, we got this baby covered.

1451
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,140
- Go home and feed the dogs
Bill, we got it all, yee-haw.

1452
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,636
(both yelling)

1453
01:04:11,636 --> 01:04:14,826
- Man, them trailer
parks, and a broken phone,

1454
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:16,288
get us fired.

1455
01:04:16,288 --> 01:04:17,668
- Well the inbred thing.

1456
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:20,346
- [Barry] I'm telling you what
we got here, here, Junior.

1457
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:21,179
All right.

1458
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,154
- [Junior] Well I'll be darn.

1459
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:29,834
- Whoo hoo, we hit the
mother load Barry Junior.

1460
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:31,287
- If this stuff is worth a million bucks,

1461
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:33,220
you know we can get into some deep shit.

1462
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,637
- Big shit, trouble, heaps, mounds of it.

1463
01:04:37,475 --> 01:04:38,558
- And action!

1464
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:42,343
Okay Legs, you're awfully
close to the rocks.

1465
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:44,394
You're looking for your lover.

1466
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:46,855
You climb over these rocks, sand, grass,

1467
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:48,340
anything looking for him.

1468
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,515
The French Lieutenant
is never coming back.

1469
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,771
You've got to make him wanna come back.

1470
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,354
Show him your tits.

1471
01:04:55,472 --> 01:04:57,805
Okay let me see those tears.

1472
01:04:58,723 --> 01:05:00,288
He didn't break daybreak.

1473
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:03,360
- Yeah, and he ate all
your croissants too.

1474
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,363
- Dad, I am the director,

1475
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:08,218
nobody talks to the
talent but the director.

1476
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:09,347
- You're right you are the director.

1477
01:05:09,347 --> 01:05:10,391
- Thank you.

1478
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:12,810
- But nobody talks to the
talent but the director

1479
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,120
and the director's dad.

1480
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,703
Now, act you bitch!

1481
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,802
- Oh this is great, this is
great, keep rolling the film,

1482
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:23,363
she's committing suicide.

1483
01:05:23,363 --> 01:05:24,583
(girls screaming)

1484
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:27,767
- Oh my God, oh my God, she's
drowning, she's drowning!

1485
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:32,205
- Perfect, we won't have
to pay her residuals.

1486
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:34,788
(upbeat music)

1487
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:42,866
(music drowning out speakers)

1488
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,462
- And action.

1489
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:53,121
Okay.

1490
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:01,341
- [Barry] Show us more tits.

1491
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:04,138
- [Junior] Okay, keep
rolling, keep rolling.

1492
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:07,616
- I would not be able to do
this in the state of Denmark.

1493
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:10,391
- Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

1494
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:13,031
- And cut, I love it, I love it.

1495
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:16,736
Classical dialogue, amazingly
main stream visuals.

1496
01:06:16,736 --> 01:06:19,591
And yet, and yet it's so Joe Eszterhas.

1497
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:22,697
- Yeah, you're a regular Sneilberg.

1498
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:24,513
(upbeat music)

1499
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,263
(birds chirping)

1500
01:06:38,743 --> 01:06:39,753
- [Junior] Okay, and ninjas attack.

1501
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:40,864
(people groaning)

1502
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,449
Okay, good flip 'em.

1503
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:43,703
And swing 'em, kick.

1504
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:44,823
Yes, kick someone else.

1505
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:46,452
Kick him, kick him in the sides, yes.

1506
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:48,867
Yes, keep going and kick 'em, punch.

1507
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:49,700
Kick him.

1508
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,229
(people groaning)

1509
01:06:52,229 --> 01:06:54,229
Kick anyone, kick, kick.

1510
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:56,290
And cut!

1511
01:06:58,505 --> 01:06:59,338
- Oops.

1512
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:04,924
- Perfect, take two.

1513
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:09,686
Also, show us more tits.

1514
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:11,992
- And action.

1515
01:07:11,992 --> 01:07:13,650
Okay Clyde gets Bonnie out of the car.

1516
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:15,305
You're scared, you're
nervous, the law is coming.

1517
01:07:15,305 --> 01:07:17,196
It's the final showdown.

1518
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:18,388
And guns out, fire.

1519
01:07:18,388 --> 01:07:20,805
(gun firing)

1520
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:23,225
(girl screaming)

1521
01:07:23,225 --> 01:07:24,604
And you're dying, you're dying.

1522
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:26,771
You're dying, you're dead.

1523
01:07:28,722 --> 01:07:31,222
You're dying, and you're dead.

1524
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,426
Dad, Dad, what do you think?

1525
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:34,566
That was great.

1526
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:35,733
That was good.

1527
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:41,241
- It was good, but next
time show us more tits.

1528
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:46,832
(relaxing music)

1529
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,454
- This is fantastic.

1530
01:07:50,454 --> 01:07:54,210
You're in Venice, it's hot, you're dying.

1531
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,746
This is great.

1532
01:07:55,746 --> 01:07:58,079
- Wrong, I'm in Miami Beach,

1533
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:01,856
I'm hot, and you're dying.

1534
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:06,242
Get yourself another actor, schmuck.

1535
01:08:07,468 --> 01:08:09,196
- This is the scene where Richard Burton

1536
01:08:09,196 --> 01:08:11,690
tells Elizabeth Taylor
how much he digs her.

1537
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,753
All right, okay ready and action.

1538
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:16,601
(soft music)

1539
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:19,268
(girl coughing)

1540
01:08:20,898 --> 01:08:22,731
- Et tu, Et tu Burton.

1541
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,958
- [Junior] Cut, cut, cut.

1542
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:28,250
Your husband's name is Richard Burton,

1543
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,654
his name is Brutus.

1544
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:32,977
It's et tu Brutus, Brutus, Brutus okay.

1545
01:08:32,977 --> 01:08:35,436
Et tu Brutus, ready and action.

1546
01:08:35,436 --> 01:08:37,138
- That's him!
- Et tu Brutus.

1547
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:38,207
- Arrest him officer right there.

1548
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:39,624
That's that worm.

1549
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:43,948
- Art, where are your papers?

1550
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,398
- You little heterosexual smaller person,

1551
01:08:47,398 --> 01:08:49,222
nobody like you no more.

1552
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:50,076
- Don't worry girls I'll be back,

1553
01:08:50,076 --> 01:08:51,130
this happens to the best of them.

1554
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,738
Don Sells, the Brothers Cohen, Spike Lee,

1555
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,788
you'll see, I'll be back.

1556
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:56,098
- Well folks, I guess that's what

1557
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:59,483
they call in this business a wrap.

1558
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:00,483
Yeah, hello.

1559
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:06,562
Wife Swapper, boy, have
I got some girls for you.

1560
01:09:06,562 --> 01:09:07,395
- No work.

1561
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:10,414
- At least you have a boyfriend.

1562
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:12,831
Junior won't even look at me.

1563
01:09:14,146 --> 01:09:15,852
- Who would hire us now anyway,

1564
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:18,250
we're practically criminals.

1565
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,188
- Oh come on girls, maybe after this one,

1566
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:23,129
we'll all get work as an actresses.

1567
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:26,441
- Yeah and in the meantime
where are our boyfriends?

1568
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:30,652
- Well the last time I saw
Rod, he was chasing Legs.

1569
01:09:30,652 --> 01:09:31,551
- [All] Yes.

1570
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,801
- He has the hots for Legs.

1571
01:09:35,452 --> 01:09:39,362
- I have an idea where
we can all have some fun

1572
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:42,313
and teach those guys a
lesson they'll never forget.

1573
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:43,238
- What is it?
- What?

1574
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:46,450
- First we get a video camera.

1575
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,711
- [All] Yeah.

1576
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:49,522
- And then ...

1577
01:09:49,522 --> 01:09:50,700
Now you know what to do right?

1578
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,834
- Yeah I know what I'm,
they're all the same.

1579
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:54,251
- Okay, okay, go.

1580
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:58,023
(jazz music)

1581
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:01,354
Oh hi Rod.

1582
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:02,271
- [Rod] Hi.

1583
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:07,378
- Babs is out on a casting
today, so I was wondering,

1584
01:10:07,378 --> 01:10:11,545
would you like to help me
to try on some lingerie?

1585
01:10:12,395 --> 01:10:15,227
- [Rod] Yeah sure,
where's everybody else at?

1586
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:17,615
- Oh they're gone, but you really think

1587
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:19,615
that Babs wouldn't mind.

1588
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,898
- You know actually, I'm sure
she'd want me to help you out.

1589
01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:27,898
I mean, that's what friends are for.

1590
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:34,895
You know this could
definitely use some adjusting.

1591
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:35,820
- [Model] Oh.

1592
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,399
- And this definitely has to come off.

1593
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:39,899
- [Model] Mm-hmm.

1594
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,149
- So does this.

1595
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:47,897
Slow down, your candid camera.

1596
01:10:47,897 --> 01:10:50,945
Hey I was only trying to help her out.

1597
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:53,945
- I'll show you about being helpful.

1598
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:58,918
- Well I just don't know where Fab is,

1599
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:01,098
I mean she said she'll meet us here.

1600
01:11:01,098 --> 01:11:02,060
I haven't see her.

1601
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,893
- Well that's all right,

1602
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:05,743
I'm kind of enjoying being alone with you.

1603
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:09,346
- [Model] Sting, you wouldn't
cheat on Fab, would you?

1604
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:11,468
- Oh no, I'd never do that.

1605
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,050
But I feel like being alone with you.

1606
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,467
- [Model] Oh you naughty boy.

1607
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,294
Keep your hand just like that
so Fab can focus the camera.

1608
01:11:22,294 --> 01:11:26,874
- Ah ha, so that's how much
a true Boston boy does it.

1609
01:11:26,874 --> 01:11:27,707
- Oh shit.

1610
01:11:28,978 --> 01:11:33,080
- Ooh Babs, those moves and my great body,

1611
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,738
we're gonna make one great couple.

1612
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:36,236
- You dance so well.

1613
01:11:36,236 --> 01:11:37,281
- That's not all I can do.

1614
01:11:37,281 --> 01:11:39,531
- Oh yeah, show me big guy.

1615
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:44,313
- Ooh, now feast your eyes on this.

1616
01:11:44,313 --> 01:11:46,480
- Feast your eyes on this.

1617
01:11:47,334 --> 01:11:50,732
- Well at least they're all consistent.

1618
01:11:50,732 --> 01:11:53,396
- Ooh Eddie, it's so hot in here.

1619
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,820
- Here baby, let me cool you off.

1620
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,403
- Ooh, that's cold.

1621
01:11:58,354 --> 01:12:00,911
- [Eddie] Well I can
always lick it off for you.

1622
01:12:00,911 --> 01:12:03,393
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, before
you do that cowboy,

1623
01:12:03,393 --> 01:12:05,855
I think you better smile for the camera.

1624
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,688
(water splashing)

1625
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:13,248
(girls laughing)

1626
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:22,114
(Junior breathing heavily)

1627
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:24,668
- So is that what you
mean by no distractions?

1628
01:12:24,668 --> 01:12:26,918
- Look Legs, Legs, come on.

1629
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:29,686
Now what do I do?

1630
01:12:29,686 --> 01:12:31,603
- [Girl] I'll show you.

1631
01:12:33,426 --> 01:12:34,259
- Jerk.

1632
01:12:35,946 --> 01:12:36,779
- I can't believe them.

1633
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:37,612
- Focus on this.

1634
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:40,383
- What a pig, what a pig.

1635
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:41,317
(phone ringing)

1636
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:43,429
Get that would you, would you get that?

1637
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:44,262
Get that for me.

1638
01:12:44,262 --> 01:12:48,056
- And this definitely has to come off.

1639
01:12:48,056 --> 01:12:48,889
- Hello.

1640
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:50,902
- [Girl] I just don't know where Fab is,

1641
01:12:50,902 --> 01:12:53,535
I mean she said she'll meet us here.

1642
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,738
- No Steve I'm sorry, Babs busy.

1643
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:59,071
Mm-hmm, yeah, bye-bye honey.

1644
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:03,122
- [Girl] Ooh, that's cold.

1645
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:05,068
- [Eddie] Well I can always lick it off.

1646
01:13:05,068 --> 01:13:07,887
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, not so fast cowboy.

1647
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:09,510
I think you better
- Yeah.

1648
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,997
Oh no I'm sorry Rod.
- Smile at the camera.

1649
01:13:10,997 --> 01:13:12,470
Babs out shopping again.

1650
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,915
Oh yeah, I'll tell her you called, bye.

1651
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:19,180
(phone ringing)

1652
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,013
- Yeah.

1653
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,523
Sorry Jeff honey, Brit's out.

1654
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:25,367
- [Man] Now what do I do?

1655
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,659
- [Girl] I'll show you what to do.

1656
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:30,887
(phone ringing)

1657
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:32,385
- Hello.

1658
01:13:32,385 --> 01:13:35,303
Eddie, no sorry, Zinga's
at the hair salon.

1659
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:37,643
- [Girl] You've got to admit,

1660
01:13:37,643 --> 01:13:40,088
Jeff is amazingly good looking.

1661
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:41,470
- [Jeff] That's not all I can do.

1662
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,720
- Oh yeah, but he lacks sophistication.

1663
01:13:45,569 --> 01:13:48,139
- Are you kidding, Rod's the best.

1664
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:50,262
- You're all crazy.

1665
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:53,383
My cowboy is the best and you all know it.

1666
01:13:53,383 --> 01:13:55,207
- Give me that phone, I'm calling Jeff.

1667
01:13:55,207 --> 01:13:57,019
- No, no, no, no, I'm calling Steve.

1668
01:13:57,019 --> 01:13:59,767
(phone ringing)

1669
01:13:59,767 --> 01:14:00,600
- Hello.

1670
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,199
- [Man] Ooh, feast your eyes on this.

1671
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:03,032
- It's for you.

1672
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:04,871
- [Girl] Feast your eyes on this.

1673
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:05,704
- Yeah.

1674
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:09,491
- [Girl] Well at least
they're all consistent.

1675
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:10,574
- Sure, sure.

1676
01:14:14,098 --> 01:14:15,970
Junior wants me to be his date

1677
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,049
for the premiere of the
movie tomorrow night.

1678
01:14:18,049 --> 01:14:19,118
(girls cheering)

1679
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:20,724
- Oh good.

1680
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:24,224
(upbeat triumphant music)

1681
01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:30,372
(lady snoring)

1682
01:14:30,372 --> 01:14:31,959
(people laughing)

1683
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:34,626
(upbeat music)

1684
01:14:35,546 --> 01:14:36,629
- [Lady] Yes!

1685
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,024
- You don't want to see it?

1686
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:43,528
- No, I'm too nervous with
all these people around.

1687
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:45,483
(everyone laughing)

1688
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:47,900
(gun firing)

1689
01:14:49,144 --> 01:14:51,894
(girl screaming)

1690
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:55,255
- Et tu Burton.

1691
01:14:57,295 --> 01:15:00,511
- I could not do this
in the state of Denmark.

1692
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:03,295
- [Man] Frankly my dear,
I don't give a damn.

1693
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,821
(man groaning)

1694
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:08,400
(everyone laughing)

1695
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,233
(audience booing)

1696
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:17,221
- I'd like to thank my mother, my father,

1697
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,354
my cousins, my drama
teachers, and basically--

1698
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:22,094
(Helmut laughing)

1699
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:24,180
- Oh you should submit that

1700
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:27,013
to Germany's funniest home videos.

1701
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:32,053
- I don't know for me, maybe a little bit

1702
01:15:32,053 --> 01:15:33,720
too so-so campy, si.

1703
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:36,459
- No, take a walk.

1704
01:15:36,459 --> 01:15:37,981
- [Man] I'm getting
pooped, one of these days.

1705
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:38,837
- [Junior] One of these days.

1706
01:15:38,837 --> 01:15:39,764
- I think they're tying his ponytail

1707
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:42,232
just a little too tight.

1708
01:15:42,232 --> 01:15:47,232
- That's what happens when
you shoot non-union, worm.

1709
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:48,201
- Bitch.

1710
01:15:49,096 --> 01:15:50,837
- I don't know which
one of you two did that,

1711
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,620
but you might think of changing your name,

1712
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,288
if you ever want to
work in this town again.

1713
01:15:55,288 --> 01:15:58,477
- Yeah well, maybe we'll
change it to your name.

1714
01:15:58,477 --> 01:15:59,896
- I'm sure you don't even know my name.

1715
01:15:59,896 --> 01:16:02,475
- Yeah what is it, shit for brains.

1716
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,901
Hit the streets pencil neck.

1717
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,589
- It's okay, they just
didn't understand it.

1718
01:16:07,589 --> 01:16:10,670
- Oh yeah, they understood
perfectly, it sucked.

1719
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,691
- I'm through.

1720
01:16:11,691 --> 01:16:13,994
- Yes you are, and I'm out of here.

1721
01:16:13,994 --> 01:16:16,670
Oh and by the way Junior,

1722
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,503
I think you should drop

1723
01:16:17,503 --> 01:16:19,092
that Junior thing at the end of your name.

1724
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:23,291
Or you'll be hearing from my lawyer, son.

1725
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,875
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1726
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,731
- But where can we go, Havana?

1727
01:16:26,731 --> 01:16:29,086
- Listen to me, I liked your film.

1728
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:30,036
- You did?

1729
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:32,216
- Yes and I like you.

1730
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:34,966
(romantic music)

1731
01:16:39,096 --> 01:16:42,513
- No kiss ever meant so much to me.

1732
01:16:42,513 --> 01:16:45,065
You know, I think I'm
falling in love with you.

1733
01:16:45,065 --> 01:16:46,568
- That's good, because I loved you

1734
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,985
from the first day I saw you.

1735
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,419
- Okay you lucky swines,

1736
01:16:58,419 --> 01:16:59,825
step on up, let's do some business then.

1737
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:02,081
Let's begin to make your dreams a reality.

1738
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:03,499
Ooh, let me think about this one.

1739
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:05,441
You must be the prince.

1740
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:07,960
- Yes Prince Ali Khan from Shibam.

1741
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,484
- So, which girls for you?

1742
01:17:09,484 --> 01:17:12,353
- The blonde one, I got
20,000 American dollars.

1743
01:17:12,353 --> 01:17:13,686
- Let me see it,

1744
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:18,200
sounds about right.

1745
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,121
You want that girl?

1746
01:17:19,121 --> 01:17:20,368
- [Prince] The sexy blonde.

1747
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:21,966
- Ah, she's white you know.

1748
01:17:21,966 --> 01:17:23,008
- I got jungle fever.

1749
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:24,702
- Yeah, she's the antidote then.

1750
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:27,822
Okay, hit the streets Wesley.

1751
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:29,227
Next, how chic.

1752
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,838
- Sheik Abdul Dadul Fabul, I got 20,000.

1753
01:17:32,838 --> 01:17:33,800
- [Barry] That's no bull.

1754
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,313
- I'll take the blonde one.

1755
01:17:35,313 --> 01:17:37,664
- 20,000, sounds about right.

1756
01:17:37,664 --> 01:17:39,441
The blonde, not a bad choice for a man

1757
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,260
who rides between humps all day.

1758
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,435
Yeah, take a walk sheik

1759
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:45,608
and watch were you stick your sword, next.

1760
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:46,441
- Hi.

1761
01:17:46,441 --> 01:17:47,274
- [Barry] Hi.

1762
01:17:47,274 --> 01:17:48,107
- Hi.

1763
01:17:48,107 --> 01:17:48,940
- [Barry] Hi again.

1764
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:49,773
- I 20,000.

1765
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:50,660
- Uh-huh, sounds good.

1766
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,743
- I take, I take blondie.

1767
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:54,535
- Blondie.

1768
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:55,368
- [Man] Hi.

1769
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:56,201
- Hi again.

1770
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:57,034
You want blondie.

1771
01:17:57,034 --> 01:17:59,131
Well you happen to be
a lucky man my friend,

1772
01:17:59,131 --> 01:18:01,435
Mr. Shaguni Shogun Benihana Tokyo,

1773
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:04,472
'cause I happen to have an
excess of blondes in inventory.

1774
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:07,678
So, by the way also, she
happens to be dumb too.

1775
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:08,863
- Tonto.

1776
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:10,836
- Uh-huh, you lucky man, yeah.

1777
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:12,334
Okay, well nice doing business with you.

1778
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,224
- Arigato.

1779
01:18:13,224 --> 01:18:16,462
- Yeah arigato, and
moriyaki, and who's next.

1780
01:18:16,462 --> 01:18:17,326
- Holy Cow.

1781
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:18,612
- [Barry] Holy Cow is next, yes indeed.

1782
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:23,064
- 'Cause my country has very,
very, very, very few blondes.

1783
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:25,918
- Really, well my country has
many, many, many 7-Elevens.

1784
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:27,502
- I want blonde.

1785
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,195
- Blonde, I should have guessed.

1786
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:30,189
All right take a walk

1787
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:33,035
and watch what you do
with your beef jerky.

1788
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,452
Next.

1789
01:18:34,452 --> 01:18:35,806
- $20,000 man.

1790
01:18:35,806 --> 01:18:37,524
- Well what are you Al Pacino?

1791
01:18:37,524 --> 01:18:39,732
- I want the little blonde
one with the blue eyes.

1792
01:18:39,732 --> 01:18:40,632
- The blonde one?

1793
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,813
- Tell you what, I'll take her.

1794
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:42,696
- You'll take her.

1795
01:18:42,696 --> 01:18:44,760
So, this money clean?

1796
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,555
- It all depends, why you think?

1797
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,430
- Well it's like, it looks
like you been eating doughnuts.

1798
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,284
There's some powder on it.

1799
01:18:49,284 --> 01:18:50,273
- It's hard working money my friend.

1800
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:51,755
- Yes, I'm sure it is hard working money,

1801
01:18:51,755 --> 01:18:53,448
it's gonna work very hard in my pocket.

1802
01:18:53,448 --> 01:18:55,272
- Thank you bandero.

1803
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,896
- [Barry] Yeah and I'm back again.

1804
01:18:57,896 --> 01:19:00,813
- I promise, I would never ever be,

1805
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:06,081
what ever the name in English is again.

1806
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:07,160
- The word is suckered.

1807
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,385
- Oh screwed.

1808
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:10,101
- You know, we really have had

1809
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:12,094
some wild times here, haven't we?

1810
01:19:12,094 --> 01:19:14,594
- Guys, I think I'm gonna cry.

1811
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:17,627
- Come on, let's get on with our lives.

1812
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:20,280
- Yeah, I've got a plane
to London to catch.

1813
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,439
- Maybe Junior needs a roommate.

1814
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:25,176
- Girls, I'm really glad I saw you.

1815
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:27,009
Boy, this is exciting.

1816
01:19:27,873 --> 01:19:29,544
I got a shoot for you girls today.

1817
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:30,533
- Forget it Barry.

1818
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:34,334
- Hey listen, I've got
500 bucks right here,

1819
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:37,587
take a look, cash up front now

1820
01:19:37,587 --> 01:19:42,424
and another 500 when you're
done, at the end of the shoot.

1821
01:19:42,424 --> 01:19:43,507
- What shoot?

1822
01:19:44,453 --> 01:19:45,302
- I can't believe it.

1823
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:47,481
We're shooting a bridal gown catalog,

1824
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:49,916
right here in Barry's mansion.

1825
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:53,790
Now, as a matter of fact, here you go.

1826
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,402
We've got bridal gowns for everybody.

1827
01:19:56,402 --> 01:19:58,001
Here you go Zinga.

1828
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,393
Oh, and there's a bonus.

1829
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:02,382
You girls can keep these
when you're done too.

1830
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:03,926
And this is exciting too,

1831
01:20:03,926 --> 01:20:06,798
they're made out of 100% acrylic.

1832
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:09,550
Which means they'll last
longer than any marriage

1833
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,417
you will ever be in.

1834
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:11,675
- [Model] That's good.

1835
01:20:11,675 --> 01:20:13,952
- Uh-huh, I knew you'd like that.

1836
01:20:13,952 --> 01:20:15,117
So, there you go.

1837
01:20:15,117 --> 01:20:17,200
Oh, and also, by the way,

1838
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,891
I need you to sign these releases.

1839
01:20:20,891 --> 01:20:23,724
Here, pass 'em off, just go ahead.

1840
01:20:26,328 --> 01:20:28,737
We can do this quickly,
Barry has places to go.

1841
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:31,054
- Why does mine say marriage contract?

1842
01:20:31,054 --> 01:20:33,387
And who is Shogun Manifooey?

1843
01:20:34,318 --> 01:20:35,256
- Oh no the marriage contract,

1844
01:20:35,256 --> 01:20:38,123
that's a misprint from another shoot.

1845
01:20:38,123 --> 01:20:41,064
That is the name of the guy
you'll be modeling with.

1846
01:20:41,064 --> 01:20:42,731
Okay, so let's go.

1847
01:20:42,731 --> 01:20:44,673
Come, come, come, down the stairs.

1848
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,112
Come on Zinga.

1849
01:20:46,112 --> 01:20:48,724
Babs, Babs, everyone move along.

1850
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:50,721
(Barry shooing the girls)

1851
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:51,804
Change, good.

1852
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,024
- Have you seen Junior?

1853
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:58,789
- Legs, I've got a little
Uncly Barry advice for you.

1854
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:01,163
I think you should forget about JR.

1855
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:03,697
You should be thinking
about places like Abu Dhabi

1856
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:06,264
and Kuwait, he's a loser.

1857
01:21:06,264 --> 01:21:10,198
You're much too much woman
for him, and too tall.

1858
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,591
So go.
- I'll never forget him.

1859
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:13,758
- Yeah you will, trust me.

1860
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:21,766
Yeah hello, Eurotrash Productions,

1861
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:25,333
I got a big fashion gig for
that crowd photographer there.

1862
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,998
Yeah Helmut.

1863
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:27,831
And make sure they send along

1864
01:21:27,831 --> 01:21:30,597
that cabin boy assistant of his.

1865
01:21:30,597 --> 01:21:32,856
What's his name Snoopy, Droopy?

1866
01:21:32,856 --> 01:21:34,390
No, no, no, Loopi.

1867
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:39,390
Yeah, make sure Loopi's
there, bye. (laughing)

1868
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:46,243
(upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

1869
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:00,971
(horn honking)

1870
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:05,755
(water splashing)

1871
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:12,008
(motor whirring)

1872
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:34,975
- Great, so my dad the rat
is abandoned sinking ship.

1873
01:22:34,975 --> 01:22:36,892
Man, I don't need this.

1874
01:22:39,393 --> 01:22:41,369
You know, you're what's important to me

1875
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:43,289
and I didn't even know it.

1876
01:22:43,289 --> 01:22:45,929
You're the only thing.

1877
01:22:45,929 --> 01:22:49,429
Well at least the girls are working today.

1878
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:56,471
Shoot.

1879
01:22:58,545 --> 01:23:01,128
(upbeat music)

1880
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:05,802
(camera shutter clicking)

1881
01:23:05,802 --> 01:23:09,297
- First of all, let me tell
all the ladies present today,

1882
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:11,547
God loves you, yes he does.

1883
01:23:12,836 --> 01:23:13,761
- Ooh I love the hair.

1884
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,018
It sits right on top of the head

1885
01:23:15,018 --> 01:23:17,851
with the curls coming down.

1886
01:23:17,851 --> 01:23:19,869
- What magazine is this for anyway?

1887
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:22,398
- [Man] For the same magazine.

1888
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,093
- [Man] Deliver his look.

1889
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:25,171
- [Girl] Time.

1890
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:26,004
- If you know what I mean.

1891
01:23:26,004 --> 01:23:28,681
- What do they care about fashion?

1892
01:23:28,681 --> 01:23:29,951
- Enough pictures, enough pictures.

1893
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,919
- Oh enough from you, you Latin worm.

1894
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:33,922
- Dearly beloved, we're
gathered here today

1895
01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:36,255
to bury the dearly deceased.

1896
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,823
Wait a minute, you're
getting married, am I right?

1897
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:47,749
Just a minute, let me find my place here.

1898
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:48,749
No, why, no.

1899
01:23:49,861 --> 01:23:51,528
Oh, oh, there it is.

1900
01:23:56,505 --> 01:23:58,088
Wind and more wind.

1901
01:24:01,558 --> 01:24:03,730
- Hey Legs stop, it's a real wedding.

1902
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:08,063
- [Elvis] Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here today.

1903
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:12,778
Bonsieur John.

1904
01:24:12,778 --> 01:24:14,590
Business class, where is my chauffeur?

1905
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,996
- I swear I had nothing to do with it.

1906
01:24:15,996 --> 01:24:17,622
- You had nothing to do with what?

1907
01:24:17,622 --> 01:24:20,098
- I swear, I swear.
- What do you doing?

1908
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,319
(men yelling)

1909
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:25,020
You know what, your mother was a dud.

1910
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,770
Nothing but a lousy
little poodle, that's it.

1911
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:32,508
- Come on, let's get this over with.

1912
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:35,121
- And unless some son-of-a-bitch

1913
01:24:35,121 --> 01:24:36,453
come forward and tells why.

1914
01:24:36,453 --> 01:24:38,301
(yelling in foreign language)

1915
01:24:38,301 --> 01:24:42,801
They should not be bound and
gagged in holy matrimony.

1916
01:24:43,693 --> 01:24:45,906
(yelling in foreign language)

1917
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:47,519
- Stop, it's a real wedding!

1918
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:50,748
- Then I hereby pronounce
all of you, husband and ...

1919
01:24:50,748 --> 01:24:54,915
(man yelling in foreign language)

1920
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,669
I take it you are the girl's father then?

1921
01:24:57,669 --> 01:24:58,859
- Who are you?

1922
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:00,610
- [Helmut] What is this,
I don't like surprises?

1923
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,813
My picture, it looks good.
- Get away, imbeciles.

1924
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,542
- Barry sold you girls to these men.

1925
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:05,393
- What?, sold us?

1926
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:07,393
- Give me back my stick.

1927
01:25:08,265 --> 01:25:10,050
- I have a contract with this woman man,

1928
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,346
is that a problem with that cockroach?

1929
01:25:11,346 --> 01:25:12,200
- No, wait, wait, wait.

1930
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,963
I can refund all your money.

1931
01:25:13,963 --> 01:25:15,753
- You better, or else.

1932
01:25:15,753 --> 01:25:17,839
- [Helmut] All right,
all right you pushed me.

1933
01:25:17,839 --> 01:25:18,740
- Thank you very much

1934
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,149
- You pushed me too far,
I'm calling my agent.

1935
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,732
- And I'm gonna call my bookie.

1936
01:25:28,975 --> 01:25:31,567
- [Barry] Yes, love this boat.

1937
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:33,594
Love your new life Bar.

1938
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:35,011
You're big, huge.

1939
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:38,313
Bahamas, here we come.

1940
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:40,646
Broads, gambling, champagne.

1941
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:45,993
Man, living the good life, you deserve it.

1942
01:25:45,993 --> 01:25:47,781
You're rich Barry, rich.

1943
01:25:47,781 --> 01:25:50,527
Rich I tell you, it's mine, it's all mine.

1944
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:51,694
Mobs of money.

1945
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:57,477
- [Junior] Wait, let's just
talk about this for a minute.

1946
01:25:57,477 --> 01:26:00,021
- Hey you cockroach,
you owe me $20,000 man.

1947
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,797
- [Junior] I'm sure we
can negotiate something.

1948
01:26:01,797 --> 01:26:05,420
- But what about our
$500, Barry promised it.

1949
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,221
- This is bullshit.

1950
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:08,757
I'm calling the cops this time.

1951
01:26:08,757 --> 01:26:11,589
- Stop being so mean to him, all of you.

1952
01:26:11,589 --> 01:26:13,922
- Thank you, you're amazing.

1953
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:19,810
- [Barry] My money, my
money, all my money.

1954
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,433
Fish are eating it, I'm gonna catch it

1955
01:26:21,433 --> 01:26:22,930
and kill you and then eat you.

1956
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,417
My money, oh it's ...

1957
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:28,084
(phone ringing)

1958
01:26:30,599 --> 01:26:31,516
- Yes, yes.

1959
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:36,817
Really, wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

1960
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,218
You were at Paramount,

1961
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:39,889
but you left Paramount
to go to Warner Brothers,

1962
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:42,706
but Universal's made
you a housekeeping deal?

1963
01:26:42,706 --> 01:26:44,496
Sure babe, we can cut a deal.

1964
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,859
We're making a deal.

1965
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:48,779
You want to deposit the
money into my account?

1966
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:50,686
Oh I love you babe, you're the best.

1967
01:26:50,686 --> 01:26:52,760
(everyone chattering)

1968
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,581
I, Junior, will refund all
of your money gentlemen,

1969
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:57,796
'cause I have just caught a six figure,

1970
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,228
plus royalty output deal.

1971
01:26:59,228 --> 01:27:02,027
With a seven figure advance, yes.

1972
01:27:02,027 --> 01:27:04,798
- The studio screwed Junior
and denied the sequel.

1973
01:27:04,798 --> 01:27:08,548
We all went home, still
broke, but a little wiser.

1974
01:27:08,548 --> 01:27:11,200
I stayed in touch with all
the girls from that season.

1975
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,841
We all send these little
videos to each other

1976
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:14,177
so we can keep up.

1977
01:27:14,177 --> 01:27:15,377
Here's my collection.

1978
01:27:15,377 --> 01:27:17,716
Hi girls, I'm a cowgirl now.

1979
01:27:17,716 --> 01:27:20,162
(upbeat music)

1980
01:27:20,162 --> 01:27:23,495
- [Model] Hey girls, I'm a princess now.

1981
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,744
- Hey everybody.

1982
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:30,580
- Hey everybody, it's me Legs.

1983
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,822
I was just practicing for my next film.

1984
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:35,335
It's sort of mine and Junior's number.

1985
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:36,275
- [Helmut] Do you know why

1986
01:27:36,275 --> 01:27:39,162
you can't keep a generous mustache on?

1987
01:27:39,162 --> 01:27:39,995
- [Loopi] I don't know why boss.

1988
01:27:39,995 --> 01:27:42,423
Is it supposed to be this
way with all this pressure?

1989
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,590
- Because you are Italian.

1990
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:47,079
- Si.

1991
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:49,473
- Rod actually became a veterinarian

1992
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:53,529
and does plastic surgery
on poodles, we're rich.

1993
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:55,571
- Hey, we went to the Bahamas for Easter

1994
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:57,101
and guess who we caught on our video.

1995
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:57,934
(upbeat music)

1996
01:27:57,934 --> 01:27:59,184
Check this out.

1997
01:28:00,303 --> 01:28:02,335
- So you folks must be new
here in town in the Bahamas.

1998
01:28:02,335 --> 01:28:04,263
Yeah, what do want, a gambling jacket?

1999
01:28:04,263 --> 01:28:06,363
Nah, I don't think so, probably honeymoon.

2000
01:28:06,363 --> 01:28:07,807
I think you should get something

2001
01:28:07,807 --> 01:28:09,315
for this little cutie over here.

2002
01:28:09,315 --> 01:28:10,913
How 'bout this, beautiful,

2003
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:12,529
take a look at this preowned coconut.

2004
01:28:12,529 --> 01:28:15,634
Is this a sight to
behold, is this gorgeous?

2005
01:28:15,634 --> 01:28:18,067
This is fabulous, this is for this woman.

2006
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,443
It's big, it's beautiful,
all right a little beat up.

2007
01:28:20,443 --> 01:28:23,064
I let that happen, what
you got five years.

2008
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,273
It's a pretty good looking
piece of coconut for five years.

2009
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:27,401
You, I got something for you beautiful.

2010
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:29,891
You guys are just married,
take a look at this coconut.

2011
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:30,841
Only one year old.

2012
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:32,711
I'll give you something
in a second you leech.

2013
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:34,553
Here you go, beautiful.

2014
01:28:34,553 --> 01:28:35,847
What's your story, is this your friend?

2015
01:28:35,847 --> 01:28:37,557
You couldn't get him a date?

2016
01:28:37,557 --> 01:28:39,039
You should work on a date for him.

2017
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:40,369
Piece of coral for you.

2018
01:28:40,369 --> 01:28:41,588
This is what you got your eye on,

2019
01:28:41,588 --> 01:28:42,783
don't you young man?

2020
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:45,588
Yeah, how do you like that little baby?

2021
01:28:45,588 --> 01:28:47,906
This is the best price
point you'll find anywhere.

2022
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:48,740
Take a loot at that.

2023
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,948
All right you like the
weight on that, don't you?

2024
01:28:49,948 --> 01:28:51,696
Let me see what else you got here.

2025
01:28:51,696 --> 01:28:53,568
You got your eye on anything else special?

2026
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:55,258
It all looks good to you?

2027
01:28:55,258 --> 01:28:57,529
I think you want the big
one, you want this big one.

2028
01:28:57,529 --> 01:28:59,049
That fresh one doesn't look too good.

2029
01:28:59,049 --> 01:29:01,167
You guys want to have
matching coconuts don't you?

2030
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:04,584
Yeah, I think you want matching coconuts.

2031
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:23,516
