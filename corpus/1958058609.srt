Hey, Rico.

00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,769
And I thought you were
leaving town with my credit.

to get in the ring with me.

00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
Where-- what are you doing?

185
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,548
Where are you going?

186
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,598
You got any money on you?

187
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,558
What do you need?

188
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,519
A thousand.

189
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,437
You got it.

190
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,522
Hey, I'll get it back to you.

191
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,773
Don't worry about it.

192
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,899
Crap table?

193
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,109
Here.

194
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,151
Sure thing.

195
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,278
Sure thing.

196
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,988
Dragon Room.

197
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,116
Oh.

198
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:08,616
Ang!

199
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,258
RICO: Mind if I join you?

200
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,343
It's your house.

201
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,636
A gentlemen
gentleman always asks.

202
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,106
Angelo.

203
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,649
What are you doing here?

204
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
I want to talk to Isabella.

205
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,985
She's not here.

206
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,611
Come on, Doris I
know she's in there.

207
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,863
Please, let me speak to her.

208
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,948
Angelo, I'm already
in bed sleeping.

209
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,825
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

210
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,535
You must know, you spend
40 hours a week talking

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,162
on the phone, for Chrissakes.
- All right!

212
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,122
She's at Rico's.

213
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,874
She went on with that asshole?

214
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,250
- You pushed it on her.
- I did, huh?

215
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,042
Yeah, you did.

216
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,259
Who's that?

217
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,385
A friend.

218
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,845
Where Bill?

219
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,724
He went to San Francisco
for a couple of days.

220
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,851
I suppose Bill
drove you into this.

221
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,769
It's not what
you think, Angelo.

222
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,520
What is it then?

223
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,234
Look, it just happened.

224
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,028
Yeah, right.

225
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,156
You're not going to
tell Bill, are you?

226
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,490
Angelo.

227
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,241
Angelo!

228
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,421
I really appreciate you
taking me to pick up my stuff.

229
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,215
You're welcome.

230
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:51,385
You know, you should've left
that degenerate years ago.

231
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,055
I thought if I could just get
him out of this town, you know?

232
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,557
You can't change a
person just by moving

233
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,184
him to a different place.

234
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:58,684
Yeah, I guess.

235
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,879
Isabella.

236
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,589
I've always thought you were
the most beautiful woman

237
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,676
to walk the face of the earth.

238
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,344
You think that's funny?

239
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,638
Well, it's quite a line.

240
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,223
Too much?

241
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,099
Yeah.

242
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,267
A little.

243
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,228
Yeah, well--

244
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,272
I mean it.

245
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,024
Well, thank you.

246
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,859
I should go now.

247
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,194
No, stay.

248
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,154
That's all right, I have
a friend I can stay with.

249
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,072
I have a guest room.

250
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,823
You could stay there.

251
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,577
Really?

252
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,327
Sure.

253
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,542
OK.

254
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,293
OK.

255
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,300
[sad music]

256
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,435
Hey, Angelo.

257
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,312
What happened to you?

258
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,647
Bad day.

259
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,482
[speaking chinese]

260
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,568
You banking?

261
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,319
No credit.

262
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,196
Where did I inherit
this reputation, huh?

263
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,115
Did I say anything about credit?

264
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,492
You have that
look in your eye.

265
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:43,993
I love you too, darling.

266
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,914
So who do you like?

267
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,292
The guy in the red.

268
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,168
Good.

269
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,169
I'll bet on the other one.

270
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,672
That's it, get him.

271
00:21:59,485 --> 00:21:59,985
Yeah!

272
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,267
Yeah!

273
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,142
That's it!

274
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,233
On the money, yeah?

275
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,859
Was I right?

276
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,486
Was I right or was I right?

277
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,079
How about I fight?

278
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,877
None of these fighters
is going to beat you.

279
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,213
I'll fight two guys.

280
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,424
But you gotta give
me three to two.

281
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,969
If I win, I take a total
of five grand home.

282
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,470
What is it about you?

283
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,599
You can never just take
the money and leave?

284
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,058
Come on, two against
one, you'll clean up.

285
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,982
You've got a bet.

286
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,150
I'll go and change.

287
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:27,925
Yeah!

288
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:28,676
Go, go!

289
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,900
[knocking on door]

290
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,949
[knocking on door]

291
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,701
Angelo, it's Charlie.

292
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,452
Open up.

293
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,760
[knocking on door]

294
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,186
Who is it?

295
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,687
Angelo, it's Charlie, open up.

296
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,654
It's 6 o'clock.

297
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,572
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all day,

298
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,406
but the phone's been busy.

299
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,328
Figures.

300
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,335
ANGELO: You got
something for me?

301
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,129
Yeah, I got something for you.

302
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,257
ANGELO: How much you got?

303
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,550
Five grand.

304
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,303
Put it on the Rebels to win.

305
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,223
Come on, you know
what time it is?

306
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,392
Yeah, I know what time it is.

307
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,644
It's 6 o'clock.

308
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,604
Yeah, and the
game starts at 7.

309
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,982
We only have an hour
to place the bet.

310
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,401
No shit.

311
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,610
Listen, why don't you
get the hell out of here?

312
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,990
So I can make some calls.

313
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,996
What happened last night?

314
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,540
Nothing happened.

315
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,708
Why?

316
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,710
I heard Rico beat you
out of a lot of dough

317
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,919
and Isabella took off on you.

318
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,927
What you talking about?

319
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,137
It's what I heard.

320
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,263
Yeah?

321
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,016
Well, you heard wrong.

322
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,267
Did I?

323
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,894
Yeah, you did.

324
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,233
Where is she then?

325
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,110
We got into an argument, she
spent the night with Doris.

326
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:18,739
Did he beat you?

327
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,953
Yeah, he did.

328
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,538
Figures.

329
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,248
What's that supposed to mean?

330
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,458
It means he's
a better fighter.

331
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,208
He's lucky.

332
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,047
How much he beat you for?

333
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,214
15 grand!

334
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,466
Is there anything else
you'd like to know, huh?

335
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,343
Anything else?

336
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,011
Hey, if I knew it upset you
so much, I wouldn't have asked.

337
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:50,062
Angelo, hurry up and
make the call, would you?

338
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:50,562
I'll see you tomorrow.

339
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,568
You know what time it is?

340
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,612
What is this, time
conscious week?

341
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,572
You want my money or
I go someplace else?

342
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,115
Hey, hey, what's with
the sensitivity bit?

343
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:02,991
Sit down, kid.

344
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,201
I'm only messing with you.

345
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:04,701
Count that, Johnny.

346
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,875
Thanks.

347
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,045
Hey.

348
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,005
That's for you.

349
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,216
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me.

350
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,176
Be generous with your
own money, all right?

351
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,386
What's the big deal?

352
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,846
It's a 10 spot.
- It's a big deal.

353
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,557
You can pop any bitch
in this joint for 20.

354
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,642
That's what I like about you.

355
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,393
All class.

356
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,730
He's short five grand.

357
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,191
And you're short five grand.

358
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,902
I'm good for it.

359
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,114
You want 15 dimes
on the rebels minus 7?

360
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,281
That's a sick bet.

361
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,241
Hey, they're going to win.

362
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,493
I can feel it in my bones.

363
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,246
I don't know, Ang.

364
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,915
You got to do
this from me, Greek.

365
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,584
I need it real bad.

366
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,837
You lose, you'll be here
tomorrow with my money.

367
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,506
I'm going to be
here to collect.

368
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,760
Hey, hey, what
happened last night?

369
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,636
I won.

370
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,554
You won?

371
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,430
Yeah.

372
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,973
Yeah, I won.

373
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,350
I heard you went busted.

374
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,101
You heard wrong.

375
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,925
[radio announcer]

376
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,394
Everything OK?

377
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,312
Hm?

378
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,396
Everything OK?

379
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,147
Yeah.

380
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,574
[fight sounds]

381
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,911
THUG: Hey man, you're
breaking my radio.

382
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,955
What?

383
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,958
You know you're
going to give it to us.

384
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,669
Now you're going
to have to pay us.

385
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,587
You want money?

386
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,881
Huh?

387
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,967
I owe one guy $5,000.

388
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,595
I owe my best friend $1,000.

389
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,682
Last night, I lost
$15,000 and my girlfriend.

390
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,975
You want money?

391
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,477
Huh?

392
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,145
Eat this.

393
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,105
Ha ha ha.

394
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,982
[fight sounds]

395
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,908
ISABELLA: Excuse me.

396
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,117
Who the hell do
you think you are?

397
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:48,993
You're not going
to keep me here.

398
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,954
Excuse me.
- Hey.

399
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,665
What's going on here?

400
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,042
You're not going to keep
me here against my will.

401
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,335
Keep you here?

402
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,294
You're not a prisoner.

403
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,171
You're my guest.

404
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,256
Oh, yeah?

405
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,050
Well, your goon here
says I can't leave.

406
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,510
It's not like that.

407
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,386
Look.

408
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,096
I've been here for two days.

409
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,889
And everyone just keeps
staring at me like I'm a piece

410
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,601
of furniture or something.

411
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,814
A fine piece of art is a
more accurate description.

412
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:18,898
Where are you going?

413
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,400
To get my hair done.

414
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,278
What the hell are
you staring at?

415
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,237
Here.

416
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,196
What's that?

417
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,364
A little shopping money.

418
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,532
Enjoy yourself.

419
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,158
No, thanks.

420
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,702
Go ahead.

421
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,828
No.
Really.

422
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,412
Thank you.
- OK.

423
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,623
Be back for dinner?

424
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,590
Take her wherever she
wants to go, Nick.

425
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,179
[phone rings]

426
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,351
Hello?

427
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,187
CARLOS (ON PHONE):
Isabella, please.

428
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,105
She's not here.

429
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,690
CARLOS (ON PHONE):
This is Carlos.

430
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,026
She has an appointment
today at 11:30.

431
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,527
I'm running a little behind.

432
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,613
Ask her if she can
make it at 12:00.

433
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,488
Yeah.

434
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,073
I'll tell her.

435
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,035
[knocking on door]

436
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:12,785
Who is it?

437
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,589
Where's my money, kid?

438
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,470
Something came up.

439
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,013
Need a couple days.

440
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,932
Oh, you need a couple of days.

441
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,685
How come you didn't ask me?

442
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,938
Or do you only come around
when it's time to collect?

443
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm asking now.

444
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,027
You pay the juice.

445
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,696
I told you, I don't have it.

446
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,614
I need a couple days.

447
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,282
That's all.

448
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,700
You know, anybody
else and I have

449
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,827
him put a bullet in their back.

450
00:40:54,827 --> 00:41:01,459
But you, you I like.

451
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,046
I'm going to give you a
chance to work it off, kid.

452
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,216
Johnny here is a
little short of help.

453
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,053
His assistant called in sick.

454
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,889
So you're going to help him out.

455
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,224
Come on, Greek.

456
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,309
I thought we were friends.

457
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
We are.

458
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,395
We are.

459
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,024
This is strictly business.

460
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,362
Don't make me
change my mind, kid.

461
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,615
OK.

462
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,991
I'll give him a hand.

463
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,576
Good.

464
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,162
Lovely watch.

465
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,374
Nice gift from you to me.

466
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,291
Right?

467
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,167
Come on.

468
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,670
Let's go to work.

469
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,587
I need to make a stop.

470
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,714
Fine.

471
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,214
I'll go with you.

472
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,410
I need to talk to you.

473
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,161
Give us a minute?

474
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,664
Fine.

475
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,665
Call me when you're ready.

476
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,541
Listen.

477
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,543
Oh, save it, Angelo.

478
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,170
If I had a nickel for
every time we made up,

479
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,463
I'd be a rich woman by now.

480
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,589
You know what's
wrong with you?

481
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,090
No.

482
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,550
But I'm sure you're going
to tell me, aren't you?

483
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,426
I didn't come here to talk
you into coming back with me.

484
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,218
Good.

485
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,219
Because you know what, Angelo?

486
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:35,970
I'm not going back with you.

487
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,346
What's with the smart answers.

488
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,348
I'm not some asshole that's
trying to pick you up.

489
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,725
What are you here
for, to see Carlos?

490
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,809
Are you two dating
behind my back?

491
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,102
Can you just listen
while I speak here?

492
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,771
No.
I'm not going to--

493
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,563
Can you just close that little
yap of yours for a minute?

494
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,814
I'm not going to
close my little yap.

495
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,899
- Can you shut up?
- No, I'm not going to shut up.

496
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:48,399
Shut up!

497
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,654
Come here.

498
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,238
Come here.

499
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,915
Come here.

500
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,957
I don't care if
you stay with Rico.

501
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,921
No.

502
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,089
I do care.

503
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,216
Get away from him.

504
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,091
That's all I can tell you.

505
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,802
He's bad news.

506
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:16,928
Oh, really?

507
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,138
Look.

508
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,183
I've known you for three years.

509
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:26,062
And yeah, I broke promises.

510
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,314
And I lied to you.

511
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,484
But I'm telling you this
time, you stay with this guy

512
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,403
and you're going to get hurt.

513
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,532
That's not what
I want to hear.

514
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,658
What are you talking about?

515
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:42,912
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

516
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,540
One week.

517
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,961
One week and I am leaving
this stinking town forever.

518
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,128
If I had a nickel for--

519
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,088
For every time I said
I was leaving this town,

520
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:52,964
you'd be a rich woman?

521
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,924
I know.

522
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:55,424
I'm saying it now.

523
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:03,850
We'll get in a car and we'll
drive any place you like,

524
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,228
Seattle, Frisco, Colorado.

525
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,479
You name it, we'll go there.

526
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,859
Wish I could believe you.

527
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:13,359
This time it's for real.

528
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,365
Forget it.

529
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,783
Won't be long before
[inaudible] finds you.

530
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,956
I like Rico.

531
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,917
He's good to me.

532
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,793
So why don't you
just leave me alone?

533
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,175
Have a good life.

534
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,070
So, we got a problem
with the broad?

535
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,989
Nah, it's OK.

536
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,198
So, where we going?
- North.

537
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,408
North.

538
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,452
Can you be a little
more specific?

539
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,037
So, you're a big time gambler.

540
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,622
Yeah, I do OK.

541
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,332
What about you?
You gamble?

542
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,291
Nah.

543
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,167
You don't gamble?

544
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,376
No.

545
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,630
What do you do for kicks?

546
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,089
What are you, writing a book?

547
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,007
Get in the car.

548
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:18,883
I'll show you what
I do for kicks.

549
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,890
[doorbell]

550
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,016
Wow.

551
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,059
You look great.

552
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,644
Well, thanks.

553
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,938
I have a surprise for you.

554
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,397
What is it?

555
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,274
Well, if I told you what it
was, it wouldn't be a surprise,

556
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,025
would it?

557
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,955
What is it?

558
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,705
Open it.

559
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,837
Oh, my god.

560
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,256
It's beautiful.

561
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,049
Let me put it on you.

562
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,059
You go around the back.

563
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,769
Give me about 30 seconds
and then I'll flush him out.

564
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:30,825
Thanks for the help.

565
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:31,742
Well, what the hell
took you so long?

566
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,624
Come on.

567
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,750
Let's get the car
and get out of here.

568
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,622
Thing's still alive.

569
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,818
Can I ask you something?

570
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,569
Hm.

571
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,949
Do you have a wife or kids?

572
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,080
You don't seem like the type
to go to church on Sundays.

573
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,510
I mean, what do you do for fun?

574
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,016
I like to hurt people.

575
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,767
I like to make them suffer.

576
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,324
I dedicate this fight to you.

577
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,875
[crowd noise]

578
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,977
PATRON: Hey Johnny,
how about another beer?

579
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,862
You got my money, asshole?

580
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,531
Here's a chance to
earn your money now.

581
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,908
Let's see what you can do.

582
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,785
Here's your fucking money.

583
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,649
Thanks for the help.

584
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,734
Jesus Christ.

585
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,652
Clean yourself up
before you embarrass me.

586
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,371
I know you don't love me now.

587
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,249
But in time, you will.

588
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,668
I need to go and pick
up some more of my things.

589
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,003
Give Nick a list.

590
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,339
He'll pick up anything you need.

591
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,674
I would like to go out
and pick up my own stuff,

592
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,427
drive a car, go shopping, go
out to a restaurant by myself,

593
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,470
thank you.

594
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,346
All right.

595
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,806
Go.

596
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,975
You're letting me go?

597
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:12,851
Here.

598
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,602
Take my car.

599
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,065
Alone.

600
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,024
No goons or anything?

601
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,359
Alone.

602
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:21,109
Bye.

603
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,492
Where you going?

604
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,826
To take a bath.

605
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,911
You're not going out?

606
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,496
Not right now.

607
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,830
I just wanted to
know that I could.

608
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,581
That's all.

609
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,819
Hey.

610
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,571
You heard from her?

611
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,530
No.

612
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,573
Don't worry about her.

613
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,907
She's just trying
to make you jealous.

614
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,701
She's going to call soon.

615
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,954
You know, she's
doing a damn good job.

616
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,999
Hey, are you OK?

617
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:17,874
No.

618
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,420
I'm not OK.

619
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,838
I owe you.

620
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:23,714
I owe the Greek.

621
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,590
I owe the landlady.

622
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,800
I owe everybody.

623
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,844
Don't worry about me.

624
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,345
I told you, forget about it.

625
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,140
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a dead issue.

626
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,018
You always come
through for me, Frank.

627
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,436
It's an investment.

628
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,771
An investment?

629
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,732
One of these days,
you're going to hit it big.

630
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,774
You know why?

631
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,776
Because you think big.

632
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,362
Like when we first
come to town, right?

633
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,655
We walked into
that hot crap game.

634
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,781
You had $100.

635
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,241
I had $100.

636
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,120
At the end of the night, you
had $30,000 and I had $120.

637
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,996
Yeah.

638
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,873
Three years later, I'm busted.

639
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,625
What does that tell you?

640
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:04,504
That 15 years later, I'm
still singing in the lounge.

641
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,756
Look.

642
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:10,052
I saw you win
$130,000 in one night.

643
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,929
That's more money than any
one of these working stiffs

644
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,307
are going to make in a lifetime.

645
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,516
What's it going to take, Ange?

646
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,607
A million dollars.

647
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,526
Million dollars.

648
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,111
Yeah.

649
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,696
When I drove into this
town with Isabella,

650
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,824
I swore I wouldn't leave
unless I was a millionaire.

651
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,284
You know what?

652
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,994
You're not going
to leave this town.

653
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,829
You're not going to leave
with $1 million, $2 million,

654
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,705
or $10 million.

655
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,706
You know why?

656
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,292
Because you love the action.

657
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,293
I'm leaving.

658
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,836
I'm leaving as soon as--

659
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,089
As soon as what?

660
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,924
Let me tell you something.

661
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,093
You don't wise up, you're
going to lose Isabella, too.

662
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,260
Hey.

663
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,679
A minute ago, you
were on my side.

664
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,806
I'm on your side.

665
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,724
But she loves you.

666
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,892
Don't ruin that.

667
00:57:58,892 --> 00:57:59,893
What are you talking about?

668
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,769
She left me.

669
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,938
So, go after her.

670
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,981
Get her the hell
out of this town.

671
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,149
Build her dream house.

672
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,150
Get her a couple of kids.

673
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,777
Do something.

674
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:13,115
She thinks I'm a degenerate.

675
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:13,865
Maybe you are.

676
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,586
[knocking on door]

677
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,723
What do you want, Angelo?

678
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,433
I'm sorry.

679
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,560
I want to talk to Isabella.
- She's not here.

680
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,148
Come in.

681
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,367
Want some coffee?

682
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,875
Have you heard from her?

683
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:05,625
Yeah.

684
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,671
She still with Rico?

685
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,422
Yeah.

686
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,183
If she calls, will you tell
her I need to talk to her?

687
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:21,933
Sure.

688
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,565
Hey.

689
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,108
Thanks for everything.

690
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,778
You're a good friend.

691
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,029
I'm, I'm sorry.

692
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:43,830
You know I, I like her.

693
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,331
You like her?

694
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,588
I love her.

695
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,380
It's not enough.

696
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,805
I didn't mean to hurt her.

697
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,057
I just want her back.

698
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:06,269
Angelo, why would
she come back to you?

699
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,521
Look at you.

700
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,773
You're worse than
you've ever been.

701
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,316
You're a drunk and a degenerate.

702
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,820
[music playing]

703
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,116
Spring time, sunrise in
a warm desert morning.

704
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,160
I'll be your honey.

705
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,247
You can be my hero.

706
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,668
It's a been a while
since the cards smiled.

707
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:39,255
Now one fine day, I'll
be heading down the road

708
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,677
on the right side of zero.

709
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:50,558
Well, there's a break
even point, I know.

710
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:55,105
And I will find it
before I get old.

711
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:04,990
But if you don't know where
halfway is, well, how can

712
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,409
you know if you're getting old?

713
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:20,005
Spring time, sunrise in
a warm desert morning.

714
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,341
I'll be your honey.

715
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:27,554
You can be my hero.

716
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,890
It's been a while
since the cards smiled.

717
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,852
Now, one fine day, I'll
be heading down the road

718
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:37,022
on the right side of zero.

719
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:45,905
Well, there's a break
even point, I know.

720
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,200
Just where it is,
it's so hard to tell.

721
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:59,627
But if you don't know
where even is, how can

722
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:03,048
you know if you're doing well?

723
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:15,560
Before you disappear
when I count to 10,

724
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,146
I'll be your honey,
you can be my hero.

725
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:28,490
Til then, I'll be counting
on you to tell me when.

726
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,951
I'm heading down the road
on the right side of zero.

727
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:41,294
Well, there's a break
even point, I know.

728
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,963
Just where it is,
so hard to tell.

729
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:55,100
But if you don't know where
even is, well, how can

730
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,936
you know if you're doing well?

731
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,310
Where's the ketchup at?

732
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,646
How'd you get in here?

733
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,940
I knocked on the door.

734
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,110
Nobody answered,
so he jimmied it.

735
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,486
You do that again
and I'll kill you.

736
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:55,660
Look, you put yourself
on the spot here, kid.

737
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,122
And until you pay me the
money you owe me, I own you.

738
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:02,041
I own your freedom,
your privacy, I

739
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,626
even own your old
lady if Rico hasn't

740
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,044
already taken care of that.

741
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,130
You son of a--
[gun cocks]

742
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,840
Come on.

743
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,176
Let me see how brave you are.

744
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,719
One step, kid.

745
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:13,469
You can do it.

746
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,352
Yeah, I thought so.

747
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:25,190
You're all a bunch of
muscle-building fags.

748
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,774
You like to get in a ring
and play with each other,

749
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,525
thinking you're tough.

750
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,113
Well, you ain't
nothing to me, kid.

751
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,650
Yo, Lefty.

752
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,525
Go get him.

753
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,641
I got your money, Johnny.

754
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,268
I just wanted to see you run.

755
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,270
Funny, huh?

756
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,898
[groans]

757
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,744
Go ahead and shoot.

758
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,729
Hey, Frank.
How's it going?

759
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,605
Hey, Ange.
Good.

760
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,481
Good.

761
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,357
How you doing?

762
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,983
All right.

763
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,942
give this envelope
to Isabella for me?

764
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,449
What, are you leavin'?

765
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,910
Yeah.

766
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,412
Where you going?

767
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,997
Atlantic City.

768
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:28,748
Ha ha ha.

769
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,834
Come on.

770
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,086
Let's have a drink.
- No.

771
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:33,961
No.

772
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:34,712
I gotta get going.

773
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,759
Seriously.

774
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,636
Where are you going?

775
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,972
I got that cabin
up in Colorado.

776
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,433
You tell her I'll be waiting?

777
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,893
All right, Ange.

778
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,020
That's good.

779
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,979
Take care of yourself.

780
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:52,855
OK.

781
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,232
I'll see you, Ange.

782
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,773
Ange.

783
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,067
Saved me a trip.

784
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,278
I was just about
to pay you a visit.

785
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,196
You don't have to
come looking for me.

786
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,531
I'm right here.

787
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,867
I owe you $5,000.

788
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,409
You get it when I get it.

789
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,706
I like you, Angie.

790
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,249
You got a lot of balls, kid.

791
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,209
I admire that.

792
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,419
Sit down.

793
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,629
- Can't.
- What's your hurry?

794
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,755
Where you going?

795
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,133
I'm out of here for good.

796
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:04,635
Not until you pay me my money.

797
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:09,390
I told you, you'll
get it when I get it.

798
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,017
Hey.

799
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:15,605
Suppose I found a way for
you to pay off what you owe

800
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:21,611
and make $100,000 on top of it?

801
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,612
Keep talking.

802
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,364
Rico's having a
tournament at his place.

803
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,491
Yeah?

804
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,159
I'm listening.

805
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,785
50 fighters.

806
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,207
$10,000 apiece entry money.

807
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:38,252
The winner walks
with half a million.

808
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,839
Now, I'd put up your
entry money for you.

809
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,217
If you win, you get $100,000.

810
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,051
Simple as that.

811
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,182
What's the catch?

812
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,225
The catch is that
you have to win.

813
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,067
Christine, coffee, black.

814
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,781
Rico thinks he can't lose.

815
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,703
If he wins, he gets the money.

816
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:16,332
If he loses, he plans to
send in three of his goons

817
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,670
with shotguns and rob the joint.

818
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,798
Now, if you can
take care of Rico,

819
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,759
I think I can take care
of his three goons.

820
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,094
Sounds good.

821
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:28,844
Can you beat him?

822
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,769
Think so.

823
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,396
Oh, kid.

824
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,941
You're going to have
to do better than that.

825
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,736
Let me ask you something.

826
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:51,867
If I were you, and some
guy was popping my girl,

827
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:52,785
I'd tear his heart out.

828
01:12:58,791 --> 01:12:59,750
50-50.

829
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,252
50-50?

830
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:04,422
I beat Rico, I get $250,000.

831
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,216
Absolutely not.

832
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,093
Ciao.

833
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:09,844
Angelo?

834
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,682
What about Isabella?

835
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,940
I get $250,000 and I
tear his goddamn heart out.

836
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,486
Now you're talking, kid.

837
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,237
See ya.

838
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,041
MICHAEL HORN: Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen, to the arena.

839
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,503
I'm Michael Horn here live
from KWAB Sports Radio, about

840
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,214
to present to you a
very special event.

841
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:51,218
Now, tonight's total cash prize
is half a million dollars.

842
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,554
Strength, stamina,
speed, and skill

843
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,599
will decide tonight's
victor in a kickboxing

844
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:00,770
extravaganza of one-on-one
direct elimination bouts.

845
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,481
50 hopefuls are out for
blood tonight in a winner

846
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,066
takes all competition.

847
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,777
And make no mistake,
all these fighters

848
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,404
want to win badly,
seeing as each of them

849
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,115
had to put up $10,000
apiece to enter.

850
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,816
Whoa.

851
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,901
What a surprise this is.

852
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,779
Angelo de Grassi blasts his
way through big Hank Louis

853
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:52,905
like he wasn't there.

854
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,657
Absolutely astounding.

855
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,168
Ladies and gentlemen, Killer
Conroy stepping into the ring

856
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,796
now, a fitting name for
this particular fighter

857
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,090
since he usually ends
up mauling his opponents

858
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,134
rather than simply beating them.

859
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,178
During this competition last
year, I believe Conroy actually

860
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:19,306
shattered one opponent's knee.

861
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,267
Needless to say, that
guy no longer fights.

862
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,453
And of course, Rico, our host.

863
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,371
Here's a fighter who
truly enjoys the combat.

864
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,974
Angelo versus Hayes, now.

865
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,019
Angelo steadily cutting his
way through the competition.

866
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:07,688
We'll see if he can sustain
this remarkable performance.

867
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,504
How we doing, Ange?

868
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,339
If I win my next fight,
I gotta fight this guy.

869
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,595
Good luck.

870
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,519
MICHAEL HORN: That's
another one for Conroy.

871
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,145
This native of Hell's
Kitchen is truly

872
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,313
a force to be reckoned with.

873
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,118
MICHAEL HORN: Angelo de
Grassi is fighting like a man

874
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:44,910
with a mission tonight.

875
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,220
And Conroy moves
into the semifinals.

876
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,269
Rack up another one for Rico.

877
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,062
And he moves into
the final round.

878
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,356
Better place your bets
now, ladies and gentlemen.

879
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,900
The action's going
to get hotter.

880
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,777
Because it's Angelo and
Conroy in the semifinal.

881
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,947
The winner of this match
goes on the fight Rico.

882
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,241
And the winner of that fight
gets-- yup, you guessed it--

883
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,326
half a million dollars.

884
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,900
Your worries are over.

885
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,444
I'll take care of Rico's men.

886
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,528
You take care of Rico.

887
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:53,445
What?

888
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,280
You want some more of this, huh?

889
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,031
Come on.

890
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,819
[gunshot]

891
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,546
Shut up.

892
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:58,922
OK, boys and girls.

893
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,799
It's time to pass the hat.

894
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,887
All your money and your jewelry.

895
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:06,888
Move, move.

896
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,140
Pick it up, now.

897
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,035
Don't even think about it.

898
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:39,022
What?

899
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:53,578
Out.

900
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:54,329
Get out.

901
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:11,471
- It was just a friendly game.
- Yeah?

902
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,597
Yeah.

903
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,557
Matchsticks.

904
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,016
We were just playing
for matchsticks.

905
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:15,767
Sure.

906
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,357
Could have waited
one more hand.
