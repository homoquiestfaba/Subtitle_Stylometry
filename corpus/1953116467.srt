1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,386
Wake up.

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,341
Wake up.

3
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,381
Damn.

4
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,266
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT

5
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,870
A kiss for all you clowns
out there.

6
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,909
- That's right.
- For all you clowns.

7
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,142
I'd love to work in a circus.

8
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,101
- That doesn't match.
- What, the tie?

9
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,422
Where's the shirt I bought you?

10
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,344
I wore it to the Red House interview.

11
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,911
I haven't ironed it.

12
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,744
Any calls while I was
in the shower?

13
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,345
- No.
- Good.

14
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,263
Why?

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,662
No reason.
Mckenzie might cancel.

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,231
Nobody's going to cancel.

17
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,462
Or reschedule.
It's happened before.

18
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,465
Sara called last night.
They sold their apartment.

19
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,101
Already? They put it up for sale
last month.

20
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,261
They cut the price in half
to sell faster.

21
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,265
Luisa, our kids were born
in this house.

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,025
Where would we live?

23
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,831
We could live with my parents
in Mexico.

24
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,505
With your parents?

25
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,266
You want me to move to Mexico
and live with your parents?

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,071
You could get a good job
with your resume.

27
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,187
And the kids?

28
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,661
They can go to college there.

29
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,390
College.

30
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,185
That's another thing.

31
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,704
How will we afford it?
Unemployment won't cover it.

32
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,951
I'm a failure

33
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,750
You're not a failure.

34
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,981
Why?

35
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,267
Look how hot your wife is.

36
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,981
Remember the hotel we stayed in
on our honeymoon?

37
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,870
The Hotel Paraiso.

38
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,030
We sure were happy then

39
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,707
We still are.
This is just a bad streak.

40
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,226
I'll tell you what

41
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,261
You're going to put on this shirt
you look so great in,

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,980
which I gave you with all my love,

43
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,790
and you're going to cheer up.

44
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,710
I can't.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,102
Why are you so depressed today?

46
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,785
I'm not depressed.

47
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,666
Yes, you are.

48
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,910
But I love you anyway.

49
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,546
Name one original thing
I've ever done.

50
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,591
"Coca-Cola. Life's little spark."

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,023
That wasn't bad.

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,062
Wasn't bad?

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,462
They still use it on commercials.

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,350
- That was ages ago.
- Look.

55
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,548
I know you're having a hard time,

56
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,067
but plenty of people are worse off

57
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,189
than we are.
You'll get that job

58
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,185
and we'll take a trip
with the money.

59
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,910
Our anniversary is the 14th

60
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,426
That's right.

61
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,141
Our anniversary.

62
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,069
But I still have two weeks.

63
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,268
We can go to that hotel.

64
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,103
We'll stay in the same room.

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,546
What if it's gone?

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,703
We're not that old.
Why would it be gone?

67
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,907
How do I look?

68
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,830
You look

69
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,107
totally handsome.

70
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,830
Tom Cruise is finished.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,950
You'd blow people away in Hollywood.
Come here.

72
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,988
I gotta go, I gotta go...

73
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,063
I don't want to be late.

74
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,064
- I'd like to teach the world to sing...
- Silly.

75
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,221
In perfect harmony...

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,703
Luisa, please, I have to go,

77
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,142
or late is what I'll be...

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,109
Good luck. Got everything?

79
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,149
Wallet, phone, keys?

80
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,827
I think so

81
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,706
Want me to come with you?

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,465
I'm a big boy now.

83
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,428
- Good morning.
- One moment.

84
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,106
Mckenzie Emerson Spain
may I help you?

85
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,262
I'll connect you

86
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,467
Good morning.

87
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm here to see the president,
Javier Gandara.We're friends.

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,266
I think I'm a little early.

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,025
- Name?
- Javier Gandara.

90
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,829
No, yours.

91
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,471
Roberto Gomez.

92
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,667
Roberto Gomez is here.
He says he's early.

93
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,743
What should I do with him?

94
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,461
Teri says Mr. Gandara can't
see you yet.You can wait here.

95
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,383
Sure.

96
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,381
Thanks.

97
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,826
Excuse me, can I get some coffee
somewhere?

98
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,585
Yes, downstairs on the right.

99
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,781
Hey, David.

100
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,021
Where are you going?

101
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,069
I'm a friend of David's.
I was saying hi.

102
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,461
One moment, please.

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,590
I'm here to see the president
and I'm a little early...

104
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,267
Mr. Solar is very busy.
He mustn't be disturbed.

105
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,426
- Wait there.
- Right.

106
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,142
Okay.

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,226
Hey, Sole!

108
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,541
Hi, Martin.

109
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,345
Let's get lunch.
I reserved at a Chinese place.

110
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,143
I'm almost done with this screen!

111
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,791
You've been at it all morning.

112
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,465
That's the easiest level.

113
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,862
I ate the magic mushroom!

114
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,422
Forget the mushroom,
you're on the easy level.

115
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,664
I'll go and get a cup of coffee.
Thank you.

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,503
Shut up!

117
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,102
Hello?

118
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,468
Hey, I missed you on Saturday.

119
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,270
You were right not to go.
We lost, as usual.

120
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,387
Finally.

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,746
Roberto Gomez.

122
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,027
Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,864
Don't worry about it.

124
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,590
The president is waiting.

125
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,144
Okay, see you later.
Bye.

126
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,585
Everybody out.

127
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,025
- How is everything, Roberto?
- Javier.

128
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,347
What happened to you?

129
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,265
In the cafeteria, a disaster.
Never mind.

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,821
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

131
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,262
Hey, nice office, huh?

132
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,389
Yeah.
How are Luisa and the kids?

133
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,429
Great. Luisa's doing great.

134
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,710
Chasing kids around all day...
Anyway, we're fine.

135
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,341
- Is she still teaching?
- Not at the moment.

136
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,628
She substitutes sometimes,
stuff like that.

137
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,386
My daughter's in New York,
at N.Y.U.

138
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,261
50 grand a year and another 50 grand
for the apartment in Tribeca.

139
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,061
- Those are big numbers.
- But you know what?

140
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,506
I don't care.

141
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,628
Your kids' future is worth it,
don't you think?

142
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,181
Nothing better to spend it on.
Of course.

143
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,509
What can I do for you?

144
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,264
Well, Javier, look.

145
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,264
I'll fill you in.
I've been working

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,471
freelance these last few years.
No attachments, rig ht?

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,749
Taking my time,
charging my battery...

148
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,664
And I feel like I'm ready

149
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,221
to settle down.
You came to mind and I thought

150
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,784
I'd be perfect for your new project
So here I am.

151
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,101
Javier, the truth is
I'm having a hard time.

152
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,865
I need a job.

153
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,901
A job, a job, a job

154
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,030
I can't offer you a job, Roberto.

155
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,706
You know things aren't that simple.

156
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,706
Tell me about it. I've been jobless
for two years with a mortgage to pay

157
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,262
and Luisa has no idea
we'll be broke in two months.

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,183
It doesn't have to be full time.

159
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,263
I could come in a couple times a week
How about it?

160
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,865
Impossible.

161
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,511
I could easily swing it

162
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,630
but you know I can't
because you're my friend

163
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,429
But I'm good.

164
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,504
I'm good, Javier.

165
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,982
Okay, maybe not as good as before.

166
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,871
But remember, the Coca-Cola campaign
was my idea.

167
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,625
"Life's little spark."

168
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,464
It made you guys millions.

169
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,701
Hold on a second.

170
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,510
That was a team effort.

171
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,708
A team effort?
You're kidding, right?

172
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,944
We both know that was my slogan.

173
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,581
It was 2 A.M., I was 17 years old

174
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,664
I brought you guys coffee
and you were exhausted.

175
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,871
And I said, "Hey, where's the spark?
Life's little spark."

176
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,670
You loved it, Javier.

177
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,107
You loved it.
Layout don't remember,

178
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,388
please, go and ask David.

179
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,029
I swear on my kids
that was mine.

180
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,861
I swear.

181
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,266
I'm sorry to put you on the spot
like this.

182
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,905
Thanks, Javier.

183
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,822
Roberto.

184
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,431
Maybe we could get your kid
a scholarship.

185
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,941
Sure.

186
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,427
Excuse me, can you spare any change
for a sandwich?

187
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,230
Sorry, I haven't got anything.

188
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,940
What do you mean?
You have a car

189
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,341
and a briefcase and a house.

190
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,265
You guys in ties are all bastards!

191
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,988
You're listening to Migma Radio.

192
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,110
This song is dedicated
to all those assholes out there

193
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,264
who tried to fuck up my day
but failed.

194
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,061
The song is called:
You can all go to hell

195
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,631
What? What?

196
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,908
What are you looking at?
What?

197
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,904
What's your problem, you clown?

198
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,902
What?

199
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,029
Move it or l'll smash you.

200
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,503
You, you and you.All three of you.
Fucking kiss asses!

201
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,187
You want me to say it in English?
I'll say it in English.

202
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,387
Clown.

203
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,347
Can you give me the number
for the Hotel Paraiso in Cartage?

204
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,467
What?

205
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,661
It's not listed?
It has to be.

206
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,063
No, I don't want another hotel.
It has to be that one.

207
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,270
Okay, never mind.

208
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,264
Thanks anyway.

209
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,145
Goodbye.

210
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,981
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

211
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,985
- Where's the hotel that was here?
- It's not here any more.

212
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,460
It’s gone.

213
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,348
These walls are over
two thousand years old.

214
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,504
Emperor Augustus would be proud
of the colossal undertaking

215
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,107
initiated by City Hall

216
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,901
to rescue this jewel of Imperial Rome
from the clutches of obscurity.

217
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,189
Buried for centuries,
it remained hidden

218
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,390
from human sight.
A coincidence, however,

219
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,904
some boys playing with a Roman coin,

220
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,110
caused the history of this city
to take

221
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,229
a 360-degree turn.

222
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,909
180. If you turn 360 degrees,
you end up in the same place.

223
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,587
Okay, then.

224
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,664
But a picture is worth

225
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,346
a thousand words.
Let's begin the guided tour.

226
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,584
Here is our wonderful archeologist,

227
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,271
Mercedes San Roman.

228
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,544
She knows more than I do
about practically everything.

229
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,589
The first discoveries

230
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,471
were made under
the Plaza DE Condesa DE Peralta

231
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,351
when they started building
the Center for Arts and Crafts.

232
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,423
- What about the coin?
- The mayor made that up.

233
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,823
The first digs uncovered
a complex alignment

234
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,269
of structures
and rich architectural elements

235
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,788
which were a prelude
to the amazing archeological find

236
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,261
which took place shortly thereafter.

237
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,585
Please follow me

238
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,341
RESTRICTED ACCESS
WORKERS ONLY

239
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,429
Hey, who's there?

240
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,382
Hey!

241
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,749
Stay there! It's dangerous!

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,751
Don't move! It's dangerous!

243
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,345
Don't move!

244
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,662
- Hold on!
- Help!

245
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,787
Take my hand!

246
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,703
Here! Hey! No!

247
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,749
- I can't!
- God!

248
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,990
Please, help me!

249
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,381
Give me your hand

250
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,667
Help!

251
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,385
We got you!

252
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,463
- Jump!
- Don't let go!

253
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,828
Jump, for God's sake!

254
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,022
I'll get help!
Hold on!

255
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,381
Help!

256
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,505
Help!

257
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,591
Help!

258
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,748
Help me, please!

259
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,705
Help!

260
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,948
I'm slipping, I can't hold on!

261
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,586
Good lord!

262
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,625
- No!
- Where is he?

263
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,221
Get help and call an ambulance.
Quickly!

264
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,950
Enough introductions.

265
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,263
Let us enjoy the efforts
of the last few years.

266
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,185
An archeological discovery
of global importance.

267
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,910
That's impossible.

268
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,345
What's wrong now?

269
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,463
- We can't go out there.
- What?

270
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,702
There's been an accident.
Make something up.

271
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,707
Sir.

272
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,707
Sir.

273
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,745
Are you all right?

274
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,550
- Sir.
- I don't know.

275
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,781
I think so

276
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,785
Can you get UP?

277
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,147
Is it your back?

278
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,348
No, I can't move my head.

279
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,627
I can't.

280
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,826
What's wrong?

281
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,825
Nothing, don't worry.

282
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,943
[- What are you guys doing?
- What's up]

283
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,069
- He needs an ambulance.
- It's on the way.

284
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,142
Now, damn it!

285
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,829
We had a hard time finding it,
because at first we thought

286
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,744
- one of the neighbors...
- Excuse me.

287
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,903
Can we go outside already?

288
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,825
I need to send the article
to the paper before it closes.

289
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,665
Why can't I move my head?

290
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,260
Stay still.

291
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,269
- It's okay.
- What's going on?

292
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,980
You see those rods over there?

293
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,185
You have one stuck in your head.

294
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,467
What?

295
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,028
It's okay, the ambulance
is on the way.

296
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,262
I need to call my wife.

297
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,469
Hey! Where are you going?

298
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,431
- What's going on here?
- Please! Listen for a second.

299
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,665
It took centuries to discover
this ancient marvel.

300
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,385
I want to be the one
who turns on the lights.

301
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,469
Is that too much to ask?

302
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,509
What hospital will they take me to?

303
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,981
Perpetuo Socorro.
It's five minutes away.

304
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,665
Perpetuo Socorro.

305
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,664
Relax.

306
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,701
Hi, honey. Why haven't you called?
How was the meeting?

307
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,943
Fine. Listen...

308
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,468
Something absurd happened,
you'll laugh.

309
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,544
I had a little accident and I have
an iron rod stuck in my head.

310
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,747
You have what?

311
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,505
I had a little accident.

312
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,664
Hello? Roberto?
I can't hear you.

313
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,063
I said I have an iron rod
stuck in my head.

314
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,462
You slipped on an iron bed?

315
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,587
You don't understand!

316
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,424
Hello? Roberto?

317
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,587
Roberto?
Listen, are you okay?

318
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,743
I'm fine.
I'm waiting for the ambulance.

319
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,902
The ambulance?

320
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,303
They're taking me to Perpetuo Socorro.
I'm in Cartage.

321
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,544
Okay.
Socorro, Cartage, ambulance.

322
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,982
I'm leaving right now. Why Carta...?
Never mind, I'm on my way.

323
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,305
Are you calmer now?

324
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,427
Yeah.

325
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,260
I'm better.

326
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,105
Is there a lot of blood?

327
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,223
I don't see any blood.

328
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,743
Careful, damn it!

329
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,823
- Where's the ambulance?
- It's almost here.

330
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,711
Take it easy, okay?

331
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,544
The ambulance is almost here.

332
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,782
What's he doing with his cell phone?

333
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,260
Stop that!

334
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,351
- Better?
- Yeah, better.

335
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,945
Feeling any calmer?

336
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,782
By the way, my name is Roberto.

337
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,262
Claudio.

338
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,907
Sorry.

339
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,668
Sorry we met like this, Roberto.

340
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,107
Damn.

341
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,271
I was only looking
for the Hotel Paraiso.

342
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,271
They closed it a couple years ago
to build the theater museum.

343
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,111
Theater? What theater?

344
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,029
It's grandiose, Merche.

345
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,030
Grandiose.

346
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,744
There's a man down there!

347
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,186
- What?
- You're rig ht.

348
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,626
It looks like an accident.

349
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,062
Jose! Jose, listen to me.

350
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,826
- Don't close, there was an accident.
- No, you're mistaken.

351
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,904
That still hasn't been established.

352
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,030
- We're ruined!
- This is no time to joke,

353
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,705
- Mayor.
- I'm not joking.

354
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,022
This is horrendous.

355
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,509
Everything was so grandiose...

356
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,504
All the photographers...
Everybody out!

357
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,060
Get out of here!

358
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,749
Please, step back!

359
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,783
<i>Please! He fell.</i>

360
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,227
He fell. Please!

361
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,143
Everyone step back!
Coming through!

362
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,869
- Over here.
- Everyone step back.

363
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,901
Hi.

364
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,428
How's it going?
I'm Carlos, Toni and Pace, okay?

365
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,786
Roberto.
Nice to meet you.

366
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,025
Toni's going to check your vitals
and I'll take a look under there.

367
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,546
- Okay.
- Let's see.

368
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,626
Roberto, any trouble breathing?
Any chest pain?

369
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,227
No, not my chest.
But my head hurts.

370
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,628
Well, that's normal.

371
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,591
Don't worry. Can you move your arms
and legs at the same time?

372
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,982
Of course he can He just did.

373
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,541
- Let him say it.
- Yeah, I think so

374
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,111
Blood pressure 130 over 85.

375
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,387
Isn't that high?

376
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,622
- You should see mine.
- Would you be quiet?

377
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,703
Roberto, it's perfect, okay?

378
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,146
What happened to your face?

379
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,590
Nothing, a drunk guy punched me.
Who's in charge here?

380
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,545
I'm the museum director.

381
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,748
Can I have a word with you?
Come with me.

382
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,506
Please, step back.
Step back!

383
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,151
Quit moaning!

384
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,265
I can't move that man.

385
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,741
Take him away in the ambulance
right now.

386
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,470
Will you take responsibility?
I won't.

387
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,747
I didn't say that

388
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,266
He doesn't work here.

389
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,501
I know.

390
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,265
What were you doing, shithead?

391
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,222
Why can't you move him?

392
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,782
That rod in his head
may have reached the brain.

393
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,342
He could bleed to death
before we get to the hospital.

394
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,149
Oh, my God.

395
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,351
Are you a doctor? No, right?
Let the doctors make conclusions.

396
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,584
Take your ambulance
and get him out of here

397
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,584
I'm not touching him.

398
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,902
I told you it was too soon
to open to the public.

399
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,744
I saw something like this once.

400
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,744
A guy with a knife stuck
in his head.

401
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,902
Are you retarded?

402
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,982
And?

403
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,905
He died.

404
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,982
What a schmuck.

405
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,790
How could this happen?

406
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,024
He grabbed the statue
and the crane spun around.

407
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,750
I tried to stop him, but...

408
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,505
What the hell are we paying you for?

409
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,384
It's not his fault.

410
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,341
I shouldn’t be here.

411
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,271
Did the ?oor fall in?

412
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,191
I only wanted to come back
the hotel

413
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,184
where I spent my honeymoon.

414
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,708
Roberto, the fire department
will be here any minute.

415
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,664
Make way, please!

416
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,345
Let'; go, let's go!

417
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,148
Don't step there!

418
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,025
Careful, damn it!

419
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,946
If I cut the bar it'll shake too much
We have to make a hole.

420
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,625
Let's get this straight.

421
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,227
You're standing on national heritage.

422
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,189
You know what that means?

423
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,104
You need an expert to dig here.

424
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,342
Saving that man is the priority.

425
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,708
That's yours, mine is the museum.

426
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,465
Layout don't let me work

427
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,862
Everybody settle down.
Don't be stupid.

428
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,831
Can't we just raise him
a little bit?

429
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,949
I'm afraid to move him.
We need a doctor.

430
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,102
Roberto, right hand.

431
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,260
Left hand.

432
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,102
Roberto, I'm going to insert an IV.
You'll feel a prick.

433
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,181
Don't cry, it doesn't hurt.

434
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,105
You won't believe it,
but that hurt more than this.

435
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,831
Please, let me through.

436
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,031
Roberto, we called a doctor
to examine you.

437
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,467
We don't want to move you
until he's seen the rod.

438
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,341
I feel perfectly fine.
I don't know why we can't leave.

439
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,231
It's not that simple.
We have to wait for the doctor.

440
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,950
I need to call my wife.

441
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,104
I told her you were taking me
to the hospital.

442
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,742
Yes?

443
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,503
Hi, sweetie.

444
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,230
I'm almost there.
What's wrong?

445
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,586
I'm not going to the hospital.

446
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,707
Then where?

447
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,668
Nowhere.

448
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,061
Why? What's going on?

449
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,586
They're waiting for the doctor.

450
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,821
Where are you?

451
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,822
At the hotel.

452
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,505
Our hotel?

453
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,266
Well, it's a museum now.
It's incredible.

454
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,187
They found a Roman theater
underneath it.

455
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,104
What are you doing there?

456
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,786
I was upset.
I wanted to get out of Madrid.

457
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,661
I put the music on full blast
and I wanted to surprise you.

458
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,671
It would have been nice
to spend our anniversary together.

459
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,470
I'm almost there, my love.

460
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,271
Drive slowly, okay?
I don't want you to have an accident.

461
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,628
I'll be there very soon

462
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,223
She's a teacher.

463
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,350
She loves working with kids.
That's why she puts up with me

464
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,743
I had a girlfriend who dumped me
because I snore.

465
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,221
- I never got to sleep with her.
- How did she know you snore?

466
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,427
You're right.

467
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,025
A friend must have told her.

468
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,222
Roberto!

469
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,063
Roberto!

470
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,185
Yeah, I'm okay.

471
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,827
- My God.
- It's on the internet.

472
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,585
They'll destroy the theater.

473
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,983
Years numbering every rock,
wrecked in minutes.

474
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,542
They'll sink my career in politics.
What do we do, Merche?

475
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,464
Don't let them in!

476
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,187
It's complicated.

477
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,825
I'm listening, sorry.

478
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,711
I can't talk right now!

479
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,470
This way, doctor.

480
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,825
Please!

481
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,909
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

482
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,507
- I'm Doctor Andres Velasco.
- Nice to meet you. Roberto.

483
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,107
- Having a rough day, are we?
- Awful.

484
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,865
Has he been conscious
the whole time?

485
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,829
- Yes.
- Blood pressure 130 over 85.

486
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,950
Doctor, tell us what's happening!
What's his name?

487
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,387
Can we put up a screen or something?

488
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,031
It's on the way.

489
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,466
- Thank you, doctor.
- Roberto.

490
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,861
I'm going to perform
a neurological exam.

491
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,910
Okay. Is this covered
by Social Security?

492
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,063
Don't think about that now.
Relax, this won't hurt.

493
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,588
I feel perfectly fine,
except for the rod.

494
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,828
Roberto, can you feel my hand?

495
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,868
Yes.

496
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,784
- Can you squeeze it?
- Sure.

497
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,021
A little more.

498
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,182
Very good.

499
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,945
Stick out your tongue

500
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,430
Very good, Roberto.
Let's see.

501
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,424
Follow the light with your eyes.

502
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,468
A little more.

503
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,267
Very good.

504
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,740
- Everything is fine
- Thank God.

505
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,744
That's a relief.

506
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,869
No questions, please!

507
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,109
The patient is stable,

508
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,820
but he can't be moved
until we see the X-rays.

509
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,870
Would you blame the accident
on the poor conditions

510
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,431
of the facility?

511
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,583
He can't say any more.
He doesn't know.

512
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,707
Thank you.

513
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,783
- Claudio.
- What is it, Roberto?

514
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,591
- You think I'll be okay?
- Of course you will.

515
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,470
I've seen much worse cases.

516
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,782
My grandfather had a bullet
in his head from the war

517
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,943
and he died old and happy.

518
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,110
- I need you to hold your breath
- Sorry.

519
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,466
One moment.

520
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,981
Okay, thanks.

521
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,460
It's funny.

522
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,903
This morning nobody
wanted to talk to me

523
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,950
- and now suddenly...
- It's everywhere on TV.

524
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,780
You're going to be a star.

525
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,221
Hey, where are you going?

526
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,260
I'm Luisa Gomez. I need to see
my husband, he had an accident.

527
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,071
I'm the museum director.
Please, come with me.

528
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,028
What happened?

529
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,951
I'm very sorry.
My heart goes out to you,

530
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,706
but I assure you,
your husband is in very good hands

531
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,782
What happened?

532
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,910
Your husband illegally entered
a restricted area.

533
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,188
We're not responsible
for what happened.

534
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,185
If he tries to sue us,
he hasn't got a chance!

535
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,146
Let us through!
She has to see her husband!

536
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,710
- You can't come through!
- Stay back!

537
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,667
Hi, Luisa.

538
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,264
- Roberto...
- Luisa, my love.

539
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,264
Sweetheart! Oh, my God!

540
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,743
What happened?
What happened, darling?

541
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,671
Why is everyone staring at him?

542
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,823
Why is he lying there?
Pick him up.

543
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,903
Take him to the hospital.
Do something!

544
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,950
- I told you, they can't move me.
- Why not?

545
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,071
Because I have an iron rod
stuck in my head.

546
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,541
It's okay, Luisa.

547
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,828
An iron rod?

548
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,741
Oh, I get it.

549
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,662
Luisa.

550
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,101
Would you stop calling me already?

551
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,069
I can't talk, I'm in a meeting.

552
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,870
- Alfonso.
- Chairman, sir.

553
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,670
You have one minute to explain.

554
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,629
First of all, I want you to know

555
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,830
the man entered the area illegally.

556
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,030
I have to give a press conference
to explain.

557
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,340
The facilities are in strict compliance
with the law. Make sure that's clear.

558
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,070
I'll tell you what's clear.

559
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,624
Get him out of there right now
or don't come to work tomorrow.

560
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,389
Luisa, are you okay?

561
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,743
I'm okay. I'm okay, honey.

562
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,061
You're the one who isn't okay.
Does it hurt?

563
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,906
Not at all.
I don't even feel it.

564
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,630
Thank God

565
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,425
Did they give you any medicine?

566
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,106
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll be fine, okay?

567
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,546
Is that blood?

568
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,907
This?

569
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,187
It's coffee.

570
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,624
Could I please have a moment alone
with my husband?

571
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,624
Of course. You heard the lady.
Let's go.

572
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,624
Come on, everybody out.

573
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,541
Roberto...

574
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,391
Sorry, sorry,

575
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,507
sorry.

576
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,267
Luisa...

577
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,745
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,383
I didn't get the job.

579
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,181
Don't worry about that now.

580
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,549
We'll find something...

581
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,270
I don't know.

582
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,350
Anything...

583
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,748
What matters is getting you
out of here.

584
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,908
Why isn't there a doctor with you?

585
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,984
- You just told him to leave.
- Right.

586
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,990
What did he say?

587
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,824
Listen, honey.

588
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,663
I have an idea.
I'm going to talk to Kiko Segura.

589
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,742
Kiko Segura?

590
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,267
What does he know about this?

591
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,947
No.

592
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,867
No.

593
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,864
- Roberto Gomez on line two
- Have him call back.

594
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,828
It's urgent.

595
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,824
- Roberto.
- Hi, Kiko.

596
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,869
- How's it going?
- Turn on the TV.

597
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,628
- What channel?
- Take your pick.

598
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,629
I see Roman ruins.

599
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,147
- What is this, a concert?
- No.

600
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,270
There's an ambulance.
Was there an accident?

601
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,662
See the guy trapped down there?

602
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,267
Yeah.

603
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,220
That's me.

604
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,782
The rod bisected
the midline of the brain,

605
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,179
so it hasn't damaged
any crucial nerves.

606
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,069
So it hasn't damaged
any crucial nerves.

607
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,865
The problem is it's pressing
against the sagittal sinus.

608
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,830
What's the sagittal sinus?

609
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,667
It's a vein canal situated
in the upper dura mater

610
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,579
which drains blood ?owing
from the brain to the jugular.

611
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,149
Which drains blood ?owing
from the brain to the jugular.

612
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,984
In English, doctor.

613
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,020
If we remove the bar,
we don't know if we'll be able

614
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,262
to stop the bleeding
before we can operate.

615
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,502
Well, then?
What are you going to do?

616
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,584
Just cut the bar and that's that.

617
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:20,979
Wait, it's not that simple.
The vibration could damage his brain.

618
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,621
Wait, it's not that simple.
The vibration could damage his brain.

619
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,351
Damage his brain?

620
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,060
In that case what we have to do

621
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,861
is dig it out. Mercedes was there
when the theater

622
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,899
was rebuilt. She knows every rock.
Isn't that rig ht?

623
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,709
Was rebuilt. She knows every rock.
Isn't that rig ht?

624
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,704
She knows exactly how to handle this

625
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,590
I don't know anything.

626
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,868
Look, this might sound cruel,

627
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,421
but we have to take everything
into account.

628
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,867
We could destroy
the pieces down there.

629
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,267
The rocks?

630
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,381
What's more important here,

631
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,543
some rocks or my husband?

632
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,828
She's absolutely right.

633
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,461
Thinking about rocks
at a time like this?

634
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,699
Merche, for God's sake!

635
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,145
Merche, for God's sake!

636
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,267
A man's life is at stake Hello?

637
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,909
Okay, we can try it.

638
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,065
If it works, we'll take Roberto
to the hospital and remove the bar.

639
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,341
The man's identity remains unknown.

640
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,471
Apparently he doesn't work for
the company restoring the ruins

641
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,943
Sources say he might have been
trying to kill himself

642
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,387
because he lost his job.

643
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,621
How do you know him?

644
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,019
Old friends. Who wants to go?

645
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,260
Old friends. Who wants to go?

646
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,383
- I'll go.
- Easy, Johnny.

647
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,108
First I want to remind everybody

648
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,104
that a man's life is at stake.

649
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,628
He's asked us to represent him
and that's a responsibility.

650
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,225
We could send a ghost writer
for memoirs.

651
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,419
Nobody cares about books any more.
Anything else?

652
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,149
Nobody cares about books any more.
Anything else?

653
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,304
We could send a crew
to make a documentary...

654
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,907
Spare us your stupid ideas,
thank you.

655
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,347
I have some awesome ideas
for product placement.

656
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,107
Typical stuff like Schweppes,
Fanta, Colacao, Actimel...

657
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,819
But I can get other things

658
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,822
But I can get other things

659
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,631
Good lord.

660
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,389
Somebody has to get down there.

661
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,860
Right now.

662
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,269
Luisa, I'll be okay.

663
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,662
Everything will be fine.

664
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,626
Some guy here says he's your agent.

665
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,827
His what?

666
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,391
Yeah, let him through.

667
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,586
How are you, Mr. Gomez?

668
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,906
Don't worry.

669
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,863
I'm all right.

670
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,990
Juan Gutierrez, Celebrities in Action
My friends call me Johnny.

671
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,461
This is a huge opportunity,
Mr. Gomez.

672
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,539
I wish everyone had
a head for business like you.

673
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,223
I wish everyone had
a head for business like you.

674
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,260
Actually, my head has seen
better days.

675
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,707
But I work in advertising,
so I know what I'm talking about.

676
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,023
Yeah? lmanol Salas came in
the other day. Do you represent him?

677
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,387
I wish.

678
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,464
Too bad. He's a sweet guy.
He said he signed for big bucks.

679
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,459
He's buying a house in Ibiza.

680
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,461
He's buying a house in Ibiza.

681
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,304
- How much does he make?
- A million per episode.

682
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,588
Damn! I wish I made that
per operation.

683
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,026
You're not on TV.

684
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,581
No, I save lives.

685
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,227
Nobody should make that much
for being on TV.

686
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:11,859
What you want is a house in Ibiza.

687
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,669
What you want is a house in Ibiza.

688
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,621
Who are you and what
are you talking about?

689
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,942
- Doctor!
- I'll be right back.

690
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,067
All right.

691
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,064
You must be Mrs. Gomez.

692
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,711
Sorry! Sorry, Roberto.

693
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,259
- Are you okay?
- Take this.

694
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,227
- Are you okay?
- Take this.

695
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,906
What is this?

696
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,107
I don't drink.

697
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,342
No, you don't have to

698
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,868
Just hold it up so people can see it.
It's product placement.

699
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,942
Thanks.

700
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,659
Doctor, one moment, please!

701
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,741
Doctor, one moment, please!

702
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,789
Please, step back.

703
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,542
Doctor.

704
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,511
From professional to professional.
How is he? Will he die?

705
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,107
From professional to professional,
I hope not.

706
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,579
How long can he stay like that?

707
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:54,626
How long can he stay like that?

708
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,670
With an open brain wound?
The infection could appear in 24 hours

709
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,380
Then in the worst case scenario,
he has 24 hours?

710
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,625
If his sagittal sinus tears,
he'll die in seconds.

711
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,979
Rig ht. Doing a TV interview
wouldn't hurt him, would it?

712
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,480
Rig ht. Doing a TV interview
wouldn't hurt him, would it?

713
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,222
Doctor!

714
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,185
Just a few questions!

715
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,065
Let me through, damn it!

716
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,379
Get out of the way.

717
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,630
Get out of the way.

718
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,864
Excuse me, who are you?
You were in the restricted area.

719
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,262
I'm the victim's agent.

720
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,271
His agent? Already?
You guys don't waste any time.

721
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,867
I'm sorry but we can't comment
rig ht now.

722
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,501
Sure, I imagine that would cost us.

723
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,751
I'm here to protect him
and his family.

724
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,909
You think I could interview him?

725
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,062
Frankly, no.

726
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,463
- At least tell me why he did it.
- Who knows why?

727
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,270
It's a cold, cruel world.

728
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,699
People will do anything.
That's why he needs me.

729
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,747
People will do anything.
That's why he needs me.

730
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,224
You can't hire an agent
and turn this into a circus!

731
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,906
Luisa, it's a great opportunity!

732
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,347
Listen to me, Roberto.
I'm begging you.

733
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,099
We need to focus,
this is hard enough as it is.

734
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,785
We need to focus,
this is hard enough as it is.

735
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,341
I'll be fine.
Nothing will happen to me

736
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,025
Nothing will happen to you?

737
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,584
I don't want to scare you,
but the doctor mentioned brain damage.

738
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,346
Please, look at all the expectation
I'm creating.

739
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,151
We could make big money
off this accident!

740
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,827
Are you listening to yourself?

741
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,348
How can you think such a thing?

742
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,830
We're talking about your life,
not making money!

743
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,222
Luisa, making money
is what life is all about.

744
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,510
All the time I've wasted
wouldn't even cover our kids' tuition!

745
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,866
What about my time?

746
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,744
What is my time worth
if life is only about making money?

747
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,819
Aren't me and the kids
worth anything to you?

748
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:48,911
Aren't me and the kids
worth anything to you?

749
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,065
This morning I was humiliated like
a schmuck. I practically had to beg.

750
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,506
These are difficult times
for everyone.

751
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,901
Don't you realize?

752
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,462
I'll never find a job, Luisa!
Never!

753
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,219
Even if you never find one,

754
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,789
Even if you never find one,

755
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,270
I won't let them use you
like a dummy.

756
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,228
Who cares?

757
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,110
What about your dignity?

758
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,629
Dignity, Luisa? What dignity?
What are you talking about?

759
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,102
Have I had any these last few years?

760
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:17,619
Running from interview to interview
like a fucking idiot?

761
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,625
Running from interview to interview
like a fucking idiot?

762
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,189
Where's my dignity?

763
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,550
Where can I find it, Luisa?
Tell me.

764
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,502
Luisa...

765
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,741
Where are you going?

766
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,827
Roberto.

767
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,947
Johnny.

768
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,184
I have a contract for you to sign.
To avoid any misunderstandings

769
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,229
You take ten percent?

770
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,749
That's rig ht. Kiko Segura
got you ten grand for the mojitos.

771
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,939
If the bottles appear on TV,
of course.

772
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,827
If the bottles appear on TV,
of course.

773
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,064
Ten grand?
I already made ten grand!

774
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,589
Wait till Luisa hears. I knew it!
I knew Kiko was good at this.

775
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,470
I can't leave until this is over,
damn it!

776
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,190
I'm wasting my time here.

777
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,865
What do you want me to say?

778
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,430
Ma'am...

779
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,268
Can I help you?
You broke that drawer.

780
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,264
Hey! Hey!

781
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,740
That's enough.

782
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,739
Can I help you, ma'am?

783
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,040
Can I help you, ma'am?

784
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,062
A little advice, Roberto.
Free of charge.

785
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,189
You need to sue the museum.

786
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,424
These bastards have no idea
how much trouble they're in.

787
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,659
This was all their fault.

788
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,627
This was all their fault.

789
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,430
It was my fault.

790
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,822
No, no. This isn't over.

791
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,789
The facilities were defective.

792
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,545
There's a lot of cash here.

793
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,704
Imagine what it cost
to expropriate all the homes

794
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,829
and build all this.

795
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,345
I'll tell you one thing

796
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,743
From now on let me handle the media.

797
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,390
It's showtime.

798
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,829
This will be more comfortable.

799
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,947
Okay.

800
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,909
Much better, honey.

801
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,268
Gently, gently...

802
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,547
Gently...

803
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,264
Luisa, who are you calling?

804
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,581
Barbara.

805
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,146
Barbara has exams next week.
She can visit me

806
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,427
at the hospital.

807
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,231
- She needs to be here.
- You'll scare her.

808
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,779
Just let me call her, Roberto.
Relax, honey.

809
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,827
Just let me call her, Roberto.
Relax, honey.

810
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,788
Claudio.

811
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,422
Claudio, can you move that screen?

812
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,389
There are hundreds of photographers
out there.

813
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,942
I know. I'm going to be a TV star.

814
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,179
Roberto, my friend, you picked
a hell of a way to earn a living.

815
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,511
Roberto, my friend, you picked
a hell of a way to earn a living.

816
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,900
How do you feel, Mr. Gomez?

817
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,710
How do you think I feel?

818
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,544
Not too bad,
under the circumstances.

819
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,579
Does it hurt? Can you feel the rod
inside your head?

820
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:54,944
Does it hurt? Can you feel the rod
inside your head?

821
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,750
Actually, not really.

822
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,505
Why did you try to commit suicide?

823
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,788
Wait a second.
I didn't try to commit suicide.

824
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,021
What made you do it?

825
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,910
I wasn't trying to kill myself!

826
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,187
Is that your wife?

827
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,499
Yes, my Luisa.
Come here, my little hot tamale.

828
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:08,864
Yes, my Luisa.
Come here, my little hot tamale.

829
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,828
Shut up.

830
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,427
She's Mexican, I met her in Cancun.

831
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,981
Don't tell them things about us.

832
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,109
You'll get the rest later.

833
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,865
Have you got children?

834
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,267
Claudio.

835
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:22,899
Show's over. Get back

836
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,629
Show's over. Get back

837
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,789
Hey, what is your problem?

838
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,031
Why did you call me
a hot tamale?

839
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,070
You're acting strange.

840
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,621
- That's not how you talk.
- I'm in character.

841
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,271
Look at my hair!

842
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,299
Why didn't you clear up
the suicide rumor?

843
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,904
Why didn't you clear up
the suicide rumor?

844
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,462
Everybody is watching this.
Your parents, mine, the kids...

845
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,940
What will they think?

846
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,262
We're a happy family!

847
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,547
Luisa, please.

848
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,784
Nobody will believe any of it.
Tomorrow

849
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,219
they'll save me and next month
everyone will forget.

850
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,508
They'll save me and next month
everyone will forget.

851
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,028
So just take it easy
and let the story build.

852
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're making a killing.

853
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,781
You have 20 minutes of commercials
per hour,

854
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,619
you're making millions and you want
to pay my client 150 grand.

855
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,191
You're making millions and you want
to pay my client 150 grand.

856
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,264
You woke me up to tell me
how much I'm making?

857
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,791
I didn't wake you up

858
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,864
You're watching TV
and you can't turn it off. Why?

859
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,019
There's a guy dying on live TV
and you wanna see it.

860
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,066
There's a guy dying on live TV
and you wanna see it.

861
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,782
You're a morbid son of a bitch
just like the rest of us.

862
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,749
You know what you're into?

863
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,789
Suffering and death.

864
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,582
But it's expensive, Alvaro.
Very expensive.

865
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,549
Hey, jerk-off.
Who do you think you are?

866
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,419
I can't take anything less than

867
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,511
I can't take anything less than

868
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,866
350 thousand.

869
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,626
Stop being a putz
and put your boss on.

870
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,262
My boss turned off his cell
because his wife had triplets.

871
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,585
I'm representing him,
I'm offering you an exclusive.

872
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,339
I'll go down to 300 thousand.

873
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,511
I'll go down to 300 thousand.

874
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,187
300 thousand? For a guy with a rod
stuck in his head? Are you nuts?

875
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,583
If I didn't have company over,
I swear I'd...

876
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,821
I'll give you 150.

877
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,630
I have to talk to my client.

878
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,581
You'd better hurry up. Some pinhead
might stick a rod up his ass

879
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,265
and beat you to Ru more Rumore

880
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,025
Shit for brains!

881
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,226
- I'm watching the material.
- What's he doing with his cell phone?

882
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,782
It's cell footage.
No, you can see fine.

883
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,139
Nobody has any better close-ups.

884
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,268
Nobody has any better close-ups.

885
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,941
Did you see him fall?

886
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,023
No, he'd already fallen
when we got there.

887
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,147
Okay.

888
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,350
600 euros.

889
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,539
- Video Plus pays a grand.
- Then take it to them.

890
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,905
- Video Plus pays a grand.
- Then take it to them.

891
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,908
If you're interested, I have footage
of a bum getting beat up.

892
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,982
What?

893
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,343
I didn't record it myself.

894
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,424
I walked by and they took off
and dropped their cell phone.

895
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,741
Please.

896
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,951
Thanks a lot.

897
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,263
Listen, honey. Did you see me?
How do I look?

898
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,547
Don't worry,
they'll show it again later.

899
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,465
Of course.
It'll be on the evening news.

900
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,828
- I have to go.
- Let me through

901
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,709
Make way!

902
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,181
How are you feeling?
I'm getting you out of there.

903
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,751
I'm okay.

904
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,787
Merche, darling. What's the plan?

905
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,747
This. We use it to drill through marble.
It has to work.

906
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,665
Isn't it heavy?
Maybe somebody else should...

907
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,823
- Should what?
- Don't mind me.

908
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,471
We might only have one chance.

909
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,226
I've been down there for months.
Nobody knows it better than me.

910
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,950
How long will it take?

911
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,786
If the bit doesn't break,
five minutes.

912
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,784
- Where's my agent?
- What?

913
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,784
Don't mind him, he's delirious.

914
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,069
He called me his little hot tamale.
Let’s just get him out of there.

915
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,825
Please, the sooner the better.

916
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,387
Hello?

917
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,987
Hello?

918
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,187
It's Barbara!

919
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,507
Yes?

920
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,189
I just talked to Antenacinco.

921
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,264
They'll give us 150 thousand
for an interview.

922
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,549
But we can get more.
I wanna put you

923
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,226
- on every channel.
- They're gonna free me.

924
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,586
No! When?

925
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,662
Right now.

926
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,141
They can't do that,
we have a contract.

927
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,461
Honey, it's Barbara.

928
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,862
Wait a second.
We can do the interview

929
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,181
- at the hospital.
- Roberto,

930
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,902
hospitals are full of patients.
Nobody cares.

931
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,710
Talk to your daughter!

932
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,862
Sorry, Johnny.

933
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,471
Hi, sweetheart.

934
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,270
Did you see Dad on TV?

935
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,306
Listen, don't leave the house, okay?
Stay home and study.

936
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,146
- Think about your future.
- Don't hang up.

937
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,748
I know, but you can come
to the hospital after.

938
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,104
Me too, darling.
I love you very much.

939
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,910
How can you tell her that?

940
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,264
If you weren't out of your mind,
I'd be angry.

941
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,907
Make way.

942
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,660
Coming through.

943
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,465
It's Johnny, Juan Gutierrez,

944
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,065
Celebrities in Action.

945
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,501
That's rig ht, the guy
with the rod in his head.

946
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,581
The drill.

947
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,270
Tell him I accept the 150 grand
for the interview with Roberto Gomez.

948
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,264
Have him call me back ASAP.

949
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,423
You hear that, honey?
150 thousand euros

950
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,344
for a 20 minute interview.

951
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,901
It's like making 450 thousand an hour.

952
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,269
It was 150 when you were
trapped there.

953
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,221
This won't work.

954
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,662
Roberto.

955
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,622
Yeah?

956
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,306
The rod won't budge.
We have to cut it.

957
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,541
Cut it?

958
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,029
It's a bad angle, but I'll try.

959
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,750
Come with me, please.

960
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,789
I can't go anywhere.

961
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,862
Luisa.

962
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,747
Just give me a second. That woman
doesn't know what she's doing.

963
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,982
She's crazy.

964
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,871
Roberto, they can't move you yet.

965
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,590
We need time.

966
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,104
Cutting iron with that saw
will heat the rod

967
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,865
until it glows bright red.

968
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,862
What?

969
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,101
Give me the saw.

970
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,464
Imagine a burning hot iron rod
in your brain.

971
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,023
I don't mean to upset you.

972
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,507
I wanted you to know
I think it's a bad idea.

973
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,625
Please, be careful
not to move his head.

974
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,422
Doctor, is there any way
we can postpone this a couple hours?

975
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,264
No, sweetie.They can't.

976
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,027
Whatever they do,
they need to get it over with.

977
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,463
As long as you're sure.

978
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,986
We'll try it.

979
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,870
- There's no danger, right?
- We'll try it.

980
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,704
Okay, let's get this over with.

981
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,420
Roberto, if there's anything wrong,

982
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,187
- let me know rig ht away.
- Okay.

983
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,467
Here we go.

984
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,785
Shit, Roberto.
This is a total disaster.

985
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,581
We can lower the price.
Tell them I'll do it for half.

986
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,459
Okay. Let me make a call.

987
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,950
Okay. Let me make a call.

988
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,741
Merche, darling.

989
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,665
You're doing great.
You're earning your salary.

990
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,629
Leave me alone already.

991
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,591
- And move, you're in my light.
- Please, move.

992
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,907
Here we go.

993
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,587
Stop, stop. stop!

994
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,671
Stop, stop!

995
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,231
It's vibrating too much.

996
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,269
Of course it's vibrating.
It's iron.

997
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,581
Are you okay?

998
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,549
- Keep going.
- The rod will heat up.

999
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,270
Why don't you do something?

1000
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,990
Let's try to pick him up.

1001
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,346
Can we do that?

1002
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,025
Please, be careful.

1003
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,308
Try to lift him slowly.

1004
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,271
So his body doesn't touch
the wire netting.

1005
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,800
Gently, please.

1006
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,263
Stop!

1007
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,147
That's enough.
Stop moving him.

1008
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,270
We could try using a blowtorch.

1009
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,945
No, that's enough!

1010
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,511
Stop touching him!

1011
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,821
You're right, ma'am.

1012
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,983
What did you expect?

1013
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,791
You could try using a handsaw.
We have one in the truck.

1014
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,988
It would take at least an hour.

1015
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,029
No, that's impossible.

1016
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,825
What do we do now, doctor?

1017
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,869
I don't know, ma'am.
I don't know.

1018
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,228
If I had a second
to think about it...

1019
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,711
- Doctor!
- Give me a second, for God's sake!

1020
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,220
I'd like a second opinion.

1021
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,382
You don't trust me?

1022
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,191
Look, Doctor Velazquez,
or whatever your name is

1023
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,583
I don't want my husband to suffer.
The next step we take

1024
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,585
we have to be absolutely sure.

1025
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,106
I'm not stupid!

1026
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,785
- We're running out of time.
- Luisa.

1027
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,862
Luisa.

1028
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,861
Yes, my love?

1029
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,989
Maybe you should call the kids.

1030
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,621
I already did,
they're on their way.

1031
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,067
Good, Roberto. Good.

1032
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,143
We're back in business.

1033
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,227
Okay, recording.

1034
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,271
We're here at the Roman theater
in Cartage,

1035
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,264
where a man trying
to take his own life

1036
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,747
has an iron rod stuck in his head.

1037
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,621
Doctors are working feverishly
to save him.

1038
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,183
We still don't know exactly
what happened,

1039
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,583
but what we do know is
the victim's name is Roberto Gomez

1040
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,107
and that he's an unemployed
advertising executive.

1041
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,270
Tomorrow's headlines
lead with Roberto Gomez,

1042
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,391
who might have tried to kill himself
because he's out of work.

1043
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,941
Yousto Mafeo,
an awful crisis-related story.

1044
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,103
Yes, shock and concern
across the media.

1045
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,547
It's on the cover of every paper.

1046
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,546
El Pais begins with: "Fatal accident
at Roman theater in Cartage"

1047
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,828
and a photo of Roberto Gomez.

1048
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,789
The Vanguardia also has a photo:

1049
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,467
"Roberto Gomez suffers terrible accident
at Roman theater in Cartage."

1050
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,500
A large photo in the ABC:
"Accident or suicide?"

1051
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,582
Also international news...

1052
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,821
We're screwed.

1053
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,187
Wild, isn't it?

1054
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,747
- He was here this morning
- I know.

1055
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,745
He came to my office, but I was busy
with the expense account...

1056
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,505
The bastard tried to kill himself.

1057
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,788
- Fucking hell.
- You can't blame him

1058
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,306
What did he say?

1059
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,225
You know I'm up to my ears
with the Citroen campaign.

1060
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,191
This could cause irreparable damage
The news has gone global.

1061
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,787
If headquarters hears about this

1062
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,862
we're screwed.

1063
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,511
We have nothing to do with it.

1064
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,823
Are you lame or what? What will they say
when they hear his story?

1065
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,224
"I went to see my friends at McKenzie
and decided to kill myself."

1066
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,391
They can't blame us
for him trying to kill himself.

1067
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,908
If we can't control our own media image,
what will our clients think?

1068
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,871
- Hire him right now.
- We have no openings.

1069
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,941
Yes, we do.

1070
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,667
His.

1071
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,263
Okay. I'm on my way.

1072
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,667
Sorry.

1073
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,391
If you wanted the deal,

1074
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,749
you should have taken my call
and talked to me.

1075
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,947
Look, kid.

1076
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,750
You said you accepted our offer.

1077
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,268
Alvaro, I have a moral obligation
to my client.

1078
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,868
Give me 300 thousand
or I'll play the market.

1079
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,625
I told you it's not worth that.

1080
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,782
It isn't?

1081
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,551
What if he dies?

1082
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,060
What do you mean?

1083
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,267
Think about it

1084
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,542
Why doesn't anybody remember
the Chilean miners?

1085
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,423
Because they lived.

1086
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,424
If this guy dies,

1087
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,150
he'll be eternal.

1088
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,504
Like Bruce Lee, or James Dean,

1089
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,185
or like John Lennon

1090
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,342
He'll be a myth.

1091
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,627
A legend.

1092
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,670
His last words will be
the New Testament.

1093
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,947
You thin k so?

1094
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,787
Tomorrow every channel in the world
will kill for that interview.

1095
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,941
All right.

1096
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,908
I'll give you two million
if he dies.

1097
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,981
I'm afraid I can't promise that.

1098
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,790
Then you have nothing, kid.

1099
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,500
You said it yourself.
If he lives, it's worth nothing.

1100
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,821
Consider it an investment.

1101
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,428
An investment?
We're talking business, you bozo!

1102
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,022
Alvaro?

1103
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,943
Alvaro!

1104
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,583
Roberto, sweetie.
Are you okay?

1105
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,220
Yeah, I'm fine.

1106
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,581
Where's Johnny?
When's the TV crew coming?

1107
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,185
Not Johnny again!

1108
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,186
Will you stop thinking about him?
He's all you talk about.

1109
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,501
My boy!

1110
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,625
How was rehearsal?

1111
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,943
You were playing with the group,
rig ht?

1112
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,306
Dad, what happened?

1113
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,427
Nothing.

1114
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,870
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- What were you doing here?

1115
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,990
I wanted your mother to see it.
Isn't it amazing?

1116
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,984
It's so well-conserved.

1117
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,381
I'm on Rumore, Rumore tonight.
How about that!

1118
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,789
What do the doctors say?
Why are you still lying there?

1119
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,024
They say I'll be fine.
You shouldn't have come, son

1120
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,500
He shouldn't have come?

1121
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,421
Lorenzo,

1122
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,503
your father's situation
is serious.

1123
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,868
They haven't moved him
because they don't know how.

1124
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,943
Take your mother for a drink

1125
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,228
- Does Barbara know?
- Yes, she's on her way.

1126
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,622
- How is everything, Roberto?
- I'm okay.

1127
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,145
You must be Doctor Sanz.

1128
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,862
I'm Luisa Gomez, Roberto's wife.

1129
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,341
Mrs. Gomez,
we'll do everything we can

1130
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,184
to free your husband.

1131
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,910
- Your son?
- Yes.

1132
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,023
Andres Velasco, chief surgeon.

1133
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,466
Lorenzo, creepy goth.

1134
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,542
Go get something to drink. If anything
happens, Claudio will come find you.

1135
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,101
There's a cafeteria by the museum.
I have lunch there.

1136
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,189
It took my husband
a year and a half to find a job

1137
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,708
They should ban this stuff on TV.
A man in agony...

1138
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,262
Imagine his family
watching him die on TV.

1139
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,142
You think Dad will be okay?

1140
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,223
Of course he will.

1141
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,702
You know your father.

1142
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,626
He fell off a crane
and didn't break a single bone.

1143
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,988
He's got a rod stuck in his head

1144
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,066
and there he is, wheeling and dealing
like nothing's wrong.

1145
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,828
- Your dad's very strong.
- Yeah.

1146
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,985
Listen to me, Lorenzo.

1147
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,263
Your dad will make it
through this.

1148
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,710
Everything will be fine.

1149
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,026
Excuse me,

1150
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,348
there's no smoking in here.

1151
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,865
Sorry to insist.

1152
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,102
There's no smoking in here.

1153
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,347
Mom...

1154
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,990
Check, please.

1155
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,746
I want your interview
on every channel.

1156
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,347
- What about Rumore Rumore?
- It's screwed.

1157
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,186
You said they offered 150 thousand

1158
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,151
Yeah, but we can't accept
just anything right now.

1159
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,664
The news has gone global.

1160
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,949
Like the Chilean miners.
They lived and they're filthy rich.

1161
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,350
Johnny, I'm only thinking of my family.
Don't lower the price.

1162
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,105
Don't worry, I set a minimum.

1163
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,349
Warner Bros. called
to ask about the movie rights.

1164
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,025
- Yeah?
- And the video game.

1165
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,026
I don't know how they'll make this
into a video game, but they're on it.

1166
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,386
How much will they pay?

1167
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,031
I'll ask them

1168
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,231
Johnny speaking.

1169
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,547
Hi, Kiko.

1170
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,667
Yeah.

1171
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,991
A movie.
Wouldn't that be nice?

1172
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,585
It sure would, Claudio

1173
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,067
I wonder how much they'd pay
for something like that.

1174
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,986
Hey, who could play me?

1175
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,107
Brad Pitt?

1176
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,785
How about George Clooney?

1177
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,351
Isn't he too old?

1178
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,221
Yes, sir. He'll be out within an hour.
I guarantee it.

1179
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,748
You don't get it. We don't want him
to leave now. There's no hurry.

1180
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,186
But earlier you said...

1181
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,546
Forget what I said.

1182
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,830
Our theater is on every
international news channel

1183
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:22,270
Do you realize how much money
that could mean for tourism?

1184
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,070
I can't stop it.

1185
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,064
You're not stupid,
you'll find a way.

1186
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,822
Roberto, how are you?

1187
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,471
Great, David.
What brings you here?

1188
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,385
Hey, sorry I couldn't see you
this morning.

1189
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,749
Gandara has us all on the Citroen
project. You know what that's like

1190
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,551
That's okay, I understand.

1191
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,589
It was my secretary's fault.
I'll fire her if you want.

1192
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,345
No, no, please.

1193
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,462
Listen, we're in a bind.

1194
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,982
Javier was wondering

1195
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,191
if you want to come work for us.
When you get out of here, of course.

1196
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,942
That's funny, this morning
he said just the opposite.

1197
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,987
Right.

1198
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,546
The thing is, this just came up.

1199
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,108
Martin, the kid I had lunch with,
is leaving.

1200
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,705
Yeah? Where to?

1201
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,830
I don't know.
Like I said, it was sudden.

1202
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,624
How would it work? Would I take his spot
or would I work for you?

1203
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,865
No, no, you'd be on your own.

1204
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,023
You created "Life's little spark."

1205
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,103
No, that was a team effort.

1206
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,830
A team effort, but

1207
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:31,987
Roberto...

1208
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,947
Roberto, what's wrong?
Hey! Hey!

1209
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,500
- Hey...
- Doctor!

1210
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,502
Doctor!

1211
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,026
Keep his head steady.

1212
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,108
It's okay, Roberto.

1213
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,501
You'll be fine

1214
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,344
Twenty milligrams of Dilantin.

1215
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,581
Okay, let's go.

1216
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,106
What's wrong?

1217
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,421
Twenty more!

1218
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,582
Coming!

1219
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,231
- Is that better?
- I'm better. I'll be okay.

1220
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,264
I was shaking a little but...

1221
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,907
What happened?

1222
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:05,508
Nothing. He had a small seizure
and lost some spinal ?uid.

1223
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,265
- What?
- Only a little.

1224
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,228
Luisa.

1225
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,581
Luisa.

1226
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,424
David offered me a job.

1227
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,263
Roberto,

1228
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,504
Dr. Sanz and I have talked it over

1229
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,868
and we'd like to bring in
a mobile operating room.

1230
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,467
We've decided we can't risk
cutting the rod without

1231
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,861
damaging your brain

1232
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,989
Like bringing the hospital to him?

1233
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,107
That's right.

1234
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,661
And that works?

1235
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,390
We think it's the best option.

1236
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,102
It certainly is.
You can stay as long as you like.

1237
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,183
We're here at the Roman theater
in Cartage

1238
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,105
where Roberto Gomez,
an unemployed advertising executive,

1239
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,549
got his head stuck on an iron rod
after jumping from a crane.

1240
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,067
Doctors have called in
a mobile operating room

1241
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,871
so they can free Mr. Gomez
from the iron rod

1242
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,185
and move him immediately to the .R.
In hopes of saving him.

1243
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,186
Lorenzo, go find David and tell him

1244
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,706
I want to talk to him.

1245
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,948
I'll make more money today
than in my whole lifetime.

1246
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:06,061
And I'll put it in a college
trust fund for the kids.

1247
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,263
And with what's left over,

1248
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,188
we'll take the trip of our lives.
How about it?

1249
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,382
Paris.

1250
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,263
Paris, that's right.
Wishing we could all our lives

1251
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,185
and we never got to go
But now...

1252
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,071
There!
I'll get revenge on the banks.

1253
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,190
You bounce one check
and those bastards

1254
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,627
look at you like you're a criminal

1255
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,706
I've had my bank account
with the same bank for 18 years

1256
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,261
and when I missed
two mortgage payments

1257
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,946
they treated me
like a fucking thief.

1258
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,104
Bleeding me with commissions,
lying to <i>me...</i>

1259
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,865
Sons of bitches!

1260
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,544
You weren't like this before.

1261
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,589
It's not fair, damn it.

1262
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,991
Dad, David says he'll stick around,
but he doesn't want to disturb you.

1263
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,459
Go tell him we'll sign
when this is over, okay?

1264
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,700
Go tell him we'll sign
when this is over, okay?

1265
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,942
Here.

1266
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,471
Go pick up Barbara,
she should be at the station by now.

1267
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,065
Be careful.

1268
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,469
Honey, those boots...

1269
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,270
How are we doing?

1270
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,990
Johnny.

1271
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,990
Got any news?

1272
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,588
- We're a little stuck with Antena 5.
- What do you mean?

1273
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:24,029
I can't get them on the phone.
They want to talk to my boss.

1274
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,864
Then have your boss talk to them.

1275
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:29,900
This is my deal. If I let them
go above me, I lose authority.

1276
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,471
They'll never take me seriously.

1277
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,907
What about the 150 thousand
minimum?

1278
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,871
I want more.
150 thousand ain't shit.

1279
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,182
Then no more Rumore Rumore?

1280
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,991
No, no. That's a game
they love to play.

1281
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,587
They're trying to scare us.

1282
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,946
You know what Alvaro Aguirre said?

1283
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,990
- Who?
- The head of Antena 5, darling.

1284
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,390
What's going on?

1285
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,982
He said he'd pay two million
if I can guarantee your husband's death.

1286
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,710
How about that!

1287
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,983
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, sweetie.

1288
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,669
Roberto, right now you just need
to get well, okay?

1289
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,061
Okay, anything YOU 55)...

1290
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,031
But Rumore Rumore is about to start
and I don't see any movement.

1291
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,342
Let me handle that, all right?

1292
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,462
Mrs.Gomez, you shouldn't be here.

1293
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,389
How are you, Luisa?

1294
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,505
I'm not well.

1295
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,700
I want you to tell me the truth
about what to expect.

1296
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,907
It's okay.

1297
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,666
Roberto will be fine, really.

1298
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,268
Trust us. We have the city's best
medical team. Everything will be okay.

1299
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,309
Don't tell me
everything will be okay!

1300
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,542
I've been telling my husband that
for years.

1301
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,987
Sometimes things go wrong.

1302
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,462
If I hadn't supported him
the whole time,

1303
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,431
pretending I knew
everything would be all right,

1304
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,866
ironing his shirts

1305
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,226
like nothing was wrong,

1306
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,865
he would have come home.

1307
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,626
But no. He came here.

1308
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,704
Because the only thing more painful
than looking for a job

1309
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,271
is coming home without one

1310
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,828
So tell me the truth, doctor.
Whatever it is.

1311
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,061
The truth?

1312
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,100
We don't know what we'll find
when we pull that rod out of him

1313
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,101
Thank you.

1314
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,544
People have gathered
to show their solidarity.

1315
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,260
We're here with
the Mayor of Cartage

1316
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,390
and the museum's director,
Mercedes San Roman.

1317
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,509
Mayor, what can you tell us?

1318
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,746
First of all, I'd like to clarify
that it wasn't an accident.

1319
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,824
He himself never denied
the suicide theory.

1320
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,262
And the facilities
are in perfect condition...

1321
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,106
The people of Cartage
have rallied behind Roberto.

1322
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,546
They're great people.

1323
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,349
We tried,

1324
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,981
but cutting the rod
was very dangerous and I...

1325
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,870
I did what I could.

1326
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,070
We'd like to invite
our citizens and cameras

1327
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,790
to enter the theater.

1328
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,591
This improvised temple of prayer.

1329
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,787
For the time being,

1330
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,109
all we can do is pray.

1331
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,501
Okay, all set.

1332
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:28,947
Yeah?

1333
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,746
Of course I'm going to.
Of course.

1334
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,744
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1335
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,391
I have to.
Who else will if I don't?

1336
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,622
I'm the Chairman of the Board!

1337
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,262
Make it clear that photo rights
are separate.

1338
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,821
And we still have to talk about
merchandising...

1339
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,785
May I get struck by lightning
if I'm lying.

1340
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,467
I would never make a profit
off your husband's death. Never.

1341
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,266
Then who were you talking to?

1342
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,547
Aguirre.

1343
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,191
I was telling him off.

1344
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,663
He offered two million again,
but I said no way.That's not an option.

1345
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,390
Shut your mouth!

1346
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,022
Okay, but you should know he offered
20 grand if he survives...

1347
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,024
- Give me the phone!
- No!

1348
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,189
- Give me the phone!
- No!

1349
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,264
This is Roberto Gomez' wife.

1350
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,141
Yeah, the guy with the rod
in his head.

1351
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,223
There will be no interview!

1352
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:41,021
Nothing.
My husband's pain isn't for sale.

1353
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,750
Ma'am, I understand your pain.

1354
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,062
But you have to understand,
your husband's misfortune

1355
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,382
has transcended family boundaries.

1356
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,863
And it's our moral obligation
to give people what they want.

1357
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,228
You know what people want,
is that it?

1358
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,747
I'll tell you what I want
Go to hell!

1359
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,145
Not the phone!

1360
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,905
No, don't!

1361
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,744
HEY! stop hitting me.

1362
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,470
You're fired

1363
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,431
layout come within ten yards
of my husband,

1364
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,786
I'll kill you!

1365
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,511
What time is it?

1366
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,420
Eleven.

1367
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,550
Rumore Rumore must be about to start.
Where's Johnny?

1368
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,703
Why are you asking me?

1369
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,022
How should I know?
L haven’t seen him.

1370
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,547
Probably talking on his cell phone
as usual.

1371
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,349
And Lorenzo?

1372
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,505
Lorenzo went to pick up Barbara,

1373
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,265
- remember?
- That's rig ht.

1374
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:35,746
Darling.

1375
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,588
You have to talk to your children
before the operation.

1376
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,107
Rumore Rumore
isn't gonna happen, is it?

1377
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,463
The operating room is ready.

1378
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:49,348
I knew it. Why did they have
to send a rookie?

1379
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,106
That guy is clueless.
We're talking about my life.

1380
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,184
150 grand would solve everything.

1381
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,149
Hey! Have you had dinner?

1382
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,791
Who is that?
I can't turn my head.

1383
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,067
A lady on a balcony.

1384
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,189
Want me to send down a omelet?

1385
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,263
No, thanks!
I'm not hungry!

1386
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,861
You sure? I just made it!

1387
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,625
My son can bring it down!

1388
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,591
Excuse me, has Rumore Rumore
started yet?

1389
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,788
They're showing commercials.

1390
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,027
Damn it, it's too late.
We're out of time.

1391
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,031
Couldn't this at least
have worked out for me?

1392
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,625
Luisa, I'm sorry l let you down.

1393
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,749
You didn't let me down.

1394
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,023
You made me happy.

1395
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,189
You're already successful.

1396
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,226
You've been a wonderful father
and a wonderful husband.

1397
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,066
- The kids adore you.
- Bullshit.

1398
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,028
Roberto!

1399
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,024
My kids are ashamed of me

1400
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,945
because I can't find a job
I'm no good, Luisa.

1401
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,626
I'm a fucking insect
stuck to a needle.

1402
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,100
Stop moving your head.

1403
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,180
How much could I ask Gandara for?
I'm thinking 100 thousand.

1404
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,941
100 thousand is perfect.

1405
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,746
Those bastards
think I was born yesterday.

1406
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:09,187
All they care about
is cleaning their image

1407
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,220
and looking good in front of clients.
They wanna trick me but they won't.

1408
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,700
I know what I'm worth, damn it.

1409
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,385
I know what I'm worth.

1410
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,510
How much do you think I'm worth?

1411
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,383
You're worth everything.

1412
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,185
Will you talk to the kids?

1413
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,866
Sure, honey.
I'll talk to them, okay?

1414
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,340
But I can't take the job.
It's a scam.

1415
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,345
I can see them coming.
They'll fire me one month later.

1416
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,749
Where's Johnny?

1417
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,862
Luisa, please. I'm begging you
I need to be on TV.

1418
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,543
Okay. I'll take care of it.

1419
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,225
Coming through.

1420
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,269
Please, make way.
Step aside.

1421
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,903
You want an exclusive?

1422
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,221
Of course I do.

1423
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,629
Look, I'll let you interview him.

1424
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,384
But you can't put it
on the air.

1425
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,509
I want you to give me the tape.

1426
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,621
Listen, I can't do that.

1427
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,511
I work for a TV station.
Small, but it pays the bills

1428
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,187
What's your name?

1429
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,785
Pilar Alvarez.

1430
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,586
Pilar.

1431
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,942
I'll say this woman to woman

1432
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,910
That tape

1433
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,789
maybe all I have left
of my husband.

1434
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,990
I only want to make him happy.

1435
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,507
I need a camera and a reporter
who will respect him.

1436
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,982
Who'll see him as a human being.

1437
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,587
Who'll bring out the best in him.

1438
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,629
- Good news.
- What?

1439
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,669
- Good news.
- What?

1440
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,345
Johnny made the deal

1441
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,869
Really? With Rumore Rumors?
For how much?

1442
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,229
- 200 thousand.
- 200 thousand? Really?

1443
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,269
Congratulations, my love.

1444
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,707
Wait till the kids hear about it.

1445
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,068
They'll be very proud of you.

1446
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,229
Yes, sir. Good job.

1447
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,064
Johnny did a good job

1448
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:49,146
I was a little worried at first
but I'll end up thanking him

1449
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,828
Did I tell you or didn't I?
It was worth it, wasn't it?

1450
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,949
You were so right.

1451
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,669
I'm the happiest guy in the world

1452
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,266
Lorenzo, where's Barbara?

1453
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,110
She's here, she's coming over.

1454
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,820
How do I look?

1455
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:17,947
Well...

1456
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,786
Have we got any make-up?

1457
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,907
I do. Should I put some on him, Mom?

1458
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,341
Sure.

1459
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,907
Not too much, not too much.

1460
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:34,709
Roberto,

1461
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,264
we'll take you straight to the .R.
If you feel weak or dizzy

1462
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,741
- let me know, okay?
- I feel good. I'm ready.

1463
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,141
We should get started

1464
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,145
Roberto, I'll be asking the questions,
all right?

1465
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,941
Hey, one thing.

1466
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,501
How do we know the other channels
aren't recording this?

1467
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:56,342
It's in the contract.
Only this camera will record.

1468
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,503
Luisa, I'm nervous.

1469
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,462
You're look gorgeous.

1470
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,662
Ready, Roberto?

1471
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,141
I'm ready.

1472
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,867
Are you rolling?

1473
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,381
Rolling.

1474
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,190
Okay, Roberto.

1475
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,027
I suppose the first thing everyone
wants to know is how are you.

1476
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:24,630
Well, now I know what it feels like
to be an olive.

1477
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,667
Actually I have a wonderful team

1478
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,345
of doctors.
They're taking great care of me.

1479
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,101
Roberto, I have to ask you
a question.

1480
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,140
There's a lot of speculation about
whether you came here to kill yourself.

1481
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,263
No, that's completely false
That's not true.

1482
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,266
I came looking for the Hotel Paraiso,
where I spent my honeymoon

1483
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,266
with my wife. And when I got here
it was gone. They'd torn it down

1484
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,865
and I found these ruins,
this theater,

1485
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,582
and I shouldn't have come in, but...

1486
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,389
the guard, Claudio, caught me
playing a childish prank.

1487
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,388
So you actually came here
to remember your honeymoon?

1488
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,747
That's right.

1489
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,109
I had an awful morning.

1490
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,629
I thought it might be nice to spend
another honeymoon here with my wife.

1491
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,783
And this is where you landed?

1492
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,829
Yeah, rig ht here.

1493
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,267
I swung around on the crane

1494
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,265
and fell on this piece
of an iron rod.

1495
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,865
Is it very painful?

1496
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,782
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

1497
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,143
My head and neck, but...

1498
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,186
they're giving me medication
for that.

1499
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,420
You work in advertising,
isn't that right?

1500
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,107
Yeah, it's been twenty years.

1501
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,549
I heard you were the creator of
"Life's little spark."

1502
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,987
- Yeah.
- Ls there a story there?

1503
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,428
Yea h, well, back then

1504
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,664
I was a kid and I hadn't had
children yet.

1505
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,540
Barbara, sweetie.

1506
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,067
That's my daughter.

1507
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,459
It'll be fine.

1508
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,461
It'll be fine.

1509
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,667
Dad...

1510
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,222
It's okay. I'll be fine.

1511
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,186
Come on, sit up
and take off your glasses.

1512
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,189
Isn't she gorgeous?

1513
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,144
Barbara's going to study abroad.

1514
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,748
So she won't struggle with English
like her father.

1515
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:34,149
And my son Lorenzo dresses like
a character from "The Matrix" now.

1516
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:37,702
He'll drown someday
in those rain boots.

1517
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,543
But we all did crazy things
at that age, didn't we?

1518
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,941
I had spiked hair.

1519
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,227
He needs understanding
don't you think?

1520
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,467
Don't, Barbara, sweetie.

1521
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,825
Stop crying

1522
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,943
You're on TV.

1523
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,542
Sorry.

1524
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,741
You love your family very much,
don't you, Roberto?

1525
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,267
I don't know how I'd live
without them.

1526
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,383
I'm sure they feel the same way
about you.

1527
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,426
Why don't you join him?

1528
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,465
You look very pretty.

1529
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:41,942
Well, Roberto, you're a very lucky man
to have such a wonderful family.

1530
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,267
I know.

1531
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,262
I'm very proud of it.

1532
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,022
Thank you for speaking with us,
Roberto.

1533
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,230
Thank you.

1534
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,581
Dummy.

1535
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,263
You're a dummy, Barbara.

1536
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,104
I'll be fine, silly.

1537
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,467
Pilar.

1538
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,665
Pilar, don't do it.

1539
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,388
It's not your problem.
You're just doing your job.

1540
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,861
You'll regret it your whole life.

1541
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,750
I need a phone.

1542
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,861
What are you doing? How dare you!
It's a man in agony.

1543
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,909
- What?
- What did I say?

1544
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,703
How is everything?
Okay, right?

1545
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,470
I think so

1546
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,627
You were right.

1547
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,107
What about?

1548
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:09,071
Bringing Barbara
and all of us being together.

1549
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,382
After they take out this rod

1550
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,702
we're going to Paris,
don't forget.

1551
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,270
I won't.

1552
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,707
It's Johnny. You're gonna ?ip

1553
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,749
They recorded the interview.

1554
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,823
I don't know, a local station.

1555
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:26,030
She's playing with us.
I think she wants to make a deal

1556
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,182
Are you sure?

1557
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,343
Yeah. She has the interview.

1558
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,105
I knew it, damn it.

1559
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,862
I want that tape, you hear me?

1560
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,620
I'm on my way.

1561
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,901
Dad;

1562
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,507
How are you feeling?

1563
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,265
I'm okay, son.

1564
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:46,224
Hey, we have money now.

1565
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,264
You can study anything you want.

1566
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,423
You getting well
is all that matters.

1567
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,708
I'm serious, son.

1568
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,949
Do anything you want, okay?

1569
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,748
What you think is what matters.

1570
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,744
Not what other people think

1571
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,107
Dad, what's wrong?

1572
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:02,909
Dad!

1573
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,585
You're stepping on me!

1574
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,467
Sorry.

1575
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,781
Listen.

1576
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,590
Promise me one thing

1577
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,510
If I don't make it...

1578
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:19,822
- You will.
- Yeah, but...

1579
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:24,265
If I don't make it,
take off those boots, will you?

1580
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,941
I promise.

1581
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,826
That's my boy.

1582
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,829
I love you, sweetie.

1583
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,985
Me too, Dad.

1584
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,628
It's time, Roberto.

1585
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,985
I'm ready.

1586
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,263
We gave you a light sedative,
but you'll be awake until we get you

1587
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,026
in the tent. You'll see everybody
in a couple hours.

1588
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,261
All right.

1589
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,345
On three, all right?

1590
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,668
Roberto.

1591
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,426
Relax and let us do all the work,
okay?

1592
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:25,468
Okay.

1593
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,785
- Shoulders ready?
- Yeah.

1594
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,351
- Hips ready?
- Yeah.

1595
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,911
- Feet ready?
- Yeah.

1596
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,107
- Board ready?
- Yeah.

1597
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,705
On three.

1598
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:34,987
One,

1599
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:36,868
<i>two.</i>

1600
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:37,623
<i>Three!</i>

1601
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,105
Can you smell that?

1602
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,865
It smells like summer.

1603
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,145
Are you with us?

1604
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,230
It smells like peaches.

1605
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,948
I'd like to teach the world to sing

1606
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,708
in perfect harmony...

1607
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,541
Ma'am, stay here with me.

1608
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,261
Ma'am.

1609
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,425
Have you eaten?

1610
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,182
I'm okay, thanks.
Don't worry.

1611
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:37,621
You should eat something.
You've been working all night.

1612
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:42,462
Go and get some water.
Go with your sister.

1613
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,781
Okay, Mom.

1614
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,701
Claudio.

1615
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,988
What if he doesn't make it?

1616
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,260
He will

1617
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,581
He will

1618
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:03,109
Your husband needed hope,
and you gave it to him.

1619
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,987
You think?

1620
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,383
Everybody needs something.
A little spark.

1621
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,831
"Life's little spark."

1622
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,143
I know you have the tape.

1623
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,703
See that man with the scarf?

1624
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,585
That's Aguirre.

1625
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,782
He brought two million euros.

1626
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,545
I'll say no more.

1627
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,101
Thanks.

1628
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,427
Dad!

1629
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,826
Dad!

1630
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,869
Roberto Gomez is dead

1631
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,910
after surgery performed
in the operating tent.

1632
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:05,707
Time and the world
were on his side, but...

1633
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,068
he died in the end.
His family...

1634
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,627
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT
