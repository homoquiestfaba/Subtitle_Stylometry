00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,856
[waves crashing]

00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,035
[birds chirping]

4
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,387
Maleko. [indistinct]

5
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,692
Yeah, Eddie.

6
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:31,693
Get over here.

7
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:38,866
Do you hear something?

8
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,038
It's that woman, Mahina.

9
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,075
She's back.

10
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,543
Mahina?

11
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,389
Alright, you continue
the search.

12
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,559
I'll see you back at the office.

13
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,029
She's back.

14
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,101
[dramatic music playing]

15
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,080
[dramatic music continues]

16
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,107
[Leilani] Now.

17
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,110
That's it, Kainoah. [indistinct]

18
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,780
More to the left. [indistinct]
More to the left.

19
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,982
That's it.

20
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,153
Keep digging.
We are almost there.

21
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,492
Yes.

22
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,830
I hit something, boss.

23
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,138
[groans]

24
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,501
[Charles] What just happened?

25
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,836
I don't know sir.

26
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,336
I think it was
Mahina the <i>Kahuna.</i>

27
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,508
The Royal sorcerer of Hawaii.
[indistinct]

28
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,978
[Charles] I know who she is.

29
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,214
Why don't you run
and get that witch?

30
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,160
John Young's.

31
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,359
Don't let anybody see that.

32
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,197
Wait,
what are you talking about?

33
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,600
We're gonna need to find
a new business.

34
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,572
Eddie, how did it go over there?

35
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,574
Maleko, I need
to show you something.

36
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,777
This book.

37
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,214
That lady Mahina,
she gave me this.

38
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,950
Do you know what this is?

39
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,584
I have a bad feeling about this.

40
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:23,758
<i>The Lost Stories of Hawaii,
And Other Fascinating Tales...</i>

41
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,961
by John Young.

42
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,596
John, John Young.

43
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,098
Eddie, wasn't that
your great granduncle?

44
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,800
You've got to step up your game.

45
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:33,901
You could be related

46
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,571
to an advisor
of King Kamehameha.

47
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,606
You should also look
at this compass.

48
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,975
It's been in the family
for generations

49
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,110
from John Young.

50
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,443
And I've always
kind of looked at it

51
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,748
and thought there's
something more to it

52
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:48,916
than meets the eye.

53
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,453
I've been saving
this letter from...

54
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,623
It was addressed
to my grandmother.

55
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,659
It's from... John Young.

56
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,466
Signatures match.

57
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,972
Yeah, Eddie, nobody can see
this book.

58
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:12,472
What's so secret
about this book?

59
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:15,142
John Young. Eddie, do you
even know who he was?

60
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,178
Yeah. He was
my grandmother's favorite uncle.

61
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,180
Eddie, he was
so much more than that.

62
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,148
He was an adviser
to King Kamehameha,

63
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,117
the unifier
of the Hawaiian Islands.

64
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,152
He was privy to so many secrets.

65
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,787
Secrets like?

66
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,322
Secrets like...

67
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,827
secrets like this.

68
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,028
It's a spear.

69
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,330
It's not just a spear.
It's <i>the</i> spear.

70
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,531
It's the <i>Pololu</i> of Mana.

71
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:40,001
Eddie, this is one
of the most powerful weapons

72
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,333
in Hawaiian history.

73
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,504
Do you know what could be
hidden in here?

74
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,170
The secret to its hiding site.

75
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,341
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.

76
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,509
[knocking on door]

77
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,311
Looks like
it's already starting.

78
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,816
I'm here to talk to Eddie Fox.

79
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,353
Well, well, well.

80
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,522
Nice to meet you, miss...

81
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,824
Granger.

82
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,194
Tanya Granger. [indistinct]

83
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,864
Miss Granger. Please.
Won't you have a seat?

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,735
How can I help you?

85
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,371
I need help... with this?

86
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,374
- It's not yours.
- It's not yours either. Please.

87
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,209
How do you know about this book?

88
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,678
None of your business.

89
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,047
Well then, Maleko,
please, show her the...

90
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,716
Please, you don't understand.
I'm not here to take it.

91
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,718
I'm just here to prevent
something from happening.

92
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,587
He knows about it and he
can't have it. Or your compass.

93
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,023
- And he's looking for it.
- Who's he?

94
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,358
[gasps]

95
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,026
[knocking on door]

96
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,528
I'll get it.

97
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,099
Ah, may I help you sir?

98
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,367
The book.

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,535
Which book?

100
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,902
You know.

101
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,740
No, I'm not sure we've been
properly introduced.

102
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,874
What's your name?

103
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,744
Right.

104
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,279
Right.

105
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,714
Could we discuss this? Listen.

106
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,283
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here,

107
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,416
but I think if you came back
in the morning

108
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,753
when our office
is officially opened

109
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,722
then you might have
better... luck.

110
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,892
Oh, that book?

111
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,295
[grunts]

112
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,004
[waves crashing]

113
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:29,677
The sharks are back
from the sea, Mr. Wellington.

114
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,913
And we have everything in hand.

115
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,516
Finally, that's what I like
to hear.

116
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,521
Yes, very much in hand.

117
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,857
And how's the Miss?

118
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,028
Oh, she's doing fabulous.

119
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,497
She finally spit out
where that compass is.

120
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,431
And?

121
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,100
It belongs
to that treasure hunter,

122
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,869
Eddie Fox.

123
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,670
Eddie Fox.

124
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,273
The name sounds familiar.

125
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,675
Well, let's just be patient.

126
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,311
Mr. Fox will soon be
out of his hole.

127
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,147
[Leilani laughing]

128
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,850
[crickets chirping]

129
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,855
[door opens]

130
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,829
Hey, you.

131
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,506
What do you want
with my compass?

132
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,174
What's this book all about?

133
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:41,682
[speaking Hawaiian]

134
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,936
[ringing]

135
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,241
Eddie, Eddie.

136
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,577
Eddie.

137
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,243
What?

138
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,613
The girl. Where is she?

139
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,416
I've seen that guy before.
It's Kainoah. He took her.

140
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,585
Took her where?

141
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,786
Where he works at. Here.

142
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,589
Mr. Charles Wellington's
Polo Club.

143
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,056
You mean the one to be governor

144
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,058
who acts like he owns
the whole island?

145
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,759
Yeah. I am afraid so?

146
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,129
What these ladies get me into?

147
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,801
[birds chirping]

148
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,776
See anything, Maleko?

149
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,946
It just looks like an off-season
polo clubs to me.

150
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,817
[man] How you doing sir?
What can I get for you?

151
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,452
[Eddie] I'll have
a French gimlet

152
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,254
- with a twist of kalamatas.
- Yes.

153
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,290
Hey, Maleko.

154
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,460
Do you still see him?

155
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,295
<i>I think I lost him.</i>

156
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,330
[beeping] Eddie.

157
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,498
Eddie.

158
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,802
Maleko. [hissing]

159
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,639
Eddie.

160
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,243
Your bill, sir,
whenever you're ready.

161
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:17,244
Thank you.

162
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,346
[clears throat]

163
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,585
Oh, hi. Nice to see you again.

164
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:28,122
I'm not sure we've been
properly introduced.

165
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,258
Allow me
to introduce to you Kainoah,

166
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,593
our most fateful right hand man.

167
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,463
Kainoah, this is Eddie Fox

168
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:39,200
of Eddie Fox
Treasure Hunting Company.

169
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,101
[indistinct]

170
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,103
Eddie Fox and Co.

171
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:46,040
Private Investigation
and Treasure Hunting Services

172
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,942
to be precise.

173
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,811
All right, sir,
presentations are done.

174
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,446
- Let's go.
- [Kainoah] Get up.

175
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:56,116
Yes, let's. I'm assuming
you know the way.

176
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,668
We found him, sir.

177
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,503
Please, have a seat.

178
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,144
Thank you, Leilani.
You can leave us now.

179
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,180
We have business to discuss.

180
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,486
[door closes]

181
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,989
The infamous Eddie Fox.

182
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,358
Well, well, well.

183
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,095
How's your little business
going? Not too fast I hope.

184
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,327
Where's the girl?

185
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,699
Oh, she's safe. Don't worry.

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,165
I was wondering

187
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,167
if you would be brave
and gentlemen enough

188
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,538
to come to her rescue.

189
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:57,344
So... let's talk

190
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,347
since that's why
I invited you here.

191
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,684
You didn't really invite me
here.

192
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,118
I came by myself

193
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,218
and then your henchmen
dragged me over here.

194
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,523
No, let's not quibble
over details, shall we?

195
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,033
I have heard

196
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,870
about your treasure hunting
and deciphering skills.

197
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,741
I also know about your
connection to John Young.

198
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:31,043
The book you so kindly gave me

199
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,379
needs to be decoded
in order to find the spear.

200
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,881
As a member of our team,

201
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:39,084
you'd be entitled
to 50% of the profits.

202
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,421
How does that sound?

203
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:42,557
So I help you
find the secret site,

204
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,325
you give me some money

205
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,594
and you disappear
with the spear?

206
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,264
Well, yes,
but what does that matter?

207
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:58,105
You would be
world famous Eddie Fox,

208
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:03,075
the man who discovered the
long lost <i>Pololu</i> of Mana.

209
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:05,079
[chuckles]

210
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:10,017
It would be fame,
fortune, wealth...

211
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:12,019
Think about it.

212
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,591
The opportunity of a lifetime.

213
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:18,693
You and me.

214
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,097
Edward Fox
and Charles Wellington.

215
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,600
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,636
Yeah.

217
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:31,706
[chuckles] No.

218
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,274
No, that
doesn't sound right at all.

219
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,312
You think that after all
of your treachery

220
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,781
what you've done to try to take
my book away from me,

221
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,117
bringing that girl here,

222
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,353
you think I'm just going
to partner with you now?

223
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,456
Well I think you're the one
that's dreaming.

224
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,393
If you'll excuse me.

225
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:56,564
I thought you might say that,
so I had to plan ahead.

226
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,153
That was easier than I thought.

227
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,423
Thank you Mr. Fox

228
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,925
for the last piece
of the puzzle.

229
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,427
Pleasure working with you.

230
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:30,097
Would you show
this gentleman to his room?

231
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:36,704
You know the spear of mana
is a myth, right?

232
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,174
So why are you so concerned?

233
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,522
Oh, hey look. A butterfly.

234
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,557
Ooh!

235
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,525
[groans]

236
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,705
[Tanya] Help!

237
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,208
Help! Anybody?

238
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,379
[Eddie] I'm coming.

239
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,482
[fastener clicks]

240
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,552
[Tanya] Mr. Fox?

241
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:26,320
Please, call me Eddie.

242
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:48,073
Ah, Mahina. [speaking Hawaiian]

243
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,010
Thank you so much
for accepting my...

244
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,513
Get down, you fool.

245
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,281
You and I know exactly
why I'm here. [indistinct]

246
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,752
Yes, let's discuss this
in my office.

247
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,428
Okay, go.

248
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:22,777
It's exactly where your prophecy
said it would be.

249
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,014
So now...

250
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,382
what's to do?

251
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,984
Nothing.

252
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,117
The prophecy
wasn't for you to hear.

253
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,556
I'm not here
to help you, Charles.

254
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,823
But you know that.

255
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,289
I'm just here to warn you

256
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,727
before all of this
turns against you.

257
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:40,995
And if I may...

258
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:57,077
[chanting in Hawaiian]

259
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,660
You see?

260
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,829
Something powerful is coming.

261
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:19,601
My lover, you don't want to
look for <i>Pololu,</i> Charles.

262
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,335
It'll destroy you.

263
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,604
Refuse it.

264
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,371
It's my final warning.

265
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,174
Oh, come now.

266
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,510
Don't let jealousy get
into your head.

267
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,679
You're a wise woman.

268
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,115
[speaking Hawaiian]

269
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,785
Jealousy is but for the ugly.

270
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,721
Don't you understand, Charles?

271
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,723
You need to stop this.

272
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,695
If was not for Kalanikupule's
defeat against Kamehameha,

273
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:52,533
as heir of the <i>ali'i-'ai-moku,</i>
I would be the one in charge.

274
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,136
Don't you see?

275
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,873
The only person that can
save you and your power

276
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,207
is yourself.

277
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,312
Mana comes from within.
You can't steal mana.

278
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,715
In the meanwhile
I have to take this book.

279
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,216
It is for your protection.

280
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,222
No one tells me what to do.

281
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,424
What should we do?

282
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:52,426
I have an idea.

283
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,429
What's this?

284
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,765
Well, it's a personal
little gadget of mine

285
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,600
I like to call the dis-lock key.

286
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,610
Um, are you sure this dis-lock...

287
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:12,111
Dis-lock key. Yes.

288
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,448
I just got to give it some time.

289
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:19,453
Be gentle with it.
Here... you try.

290
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,125
See what it does,
it senses the mechanism

291
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,795
and once it feels it...
Boom, it opens it up.

292
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,798
Eh...

293
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,633
Okay, let me try something.

294
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,973
- There you are.
- Ah.

295
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,975
- How'd you do that?
- Eh.

296
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,511
- Where's my compass now?
- He's coming back.

297
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:03,598
[dramatic music playing]

298
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,174
Charles Wellington.

299
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,778
Yes, Kainoah.

300
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,680
Ooh, really?

301
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,884
Well why don't you
come over here?

302
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:25,520
There's something
rather interesting happening.

303
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,190
Leilani, you look agitated.

304
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,190
I am so sorry, sir.

305
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,360
I thought that Kainoah
had everything in hand,

306
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,631
but somehow Fox escaped
and took the girl with him.

307
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,866
Do tell.

308
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,699
It really wasn't my fault.

309
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:44,705
- I simply asked Kainoah to...
- Shh. Leilani.

310
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:48,810
Sometimes in life there's
a much easier solution.

311
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,716
Oh, hi. Fancy seeing you here.

312
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,918
Enjoying yourselves?

313
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,219
Well yes,

314
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,719
actually, we're just about
to wrap it up so...

315
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:01,823
[Leilani scoffs]

316
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,725
I really don't think
that is the right direction.

317
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,095
The book.

318
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:10,231
We'll burn its first.

319
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,399
Well, I'd love to see you try.

320
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,401
What are you doing?

321
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,737
Oh, it's a good window.
[knocking]

322
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,242
Solid. Good shape.

323
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,912
Need a hand, Eddie?

324
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,078
Oh, Maleko.

325
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,583
[ominous music playing]

326
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:52,607
What are you two staring
at the window for?

327
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:53,641
Get them!

328
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:54,775
[grunts]

329
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:11,626
[wind howling]

330
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,812
Hey, Tanya, get over here.

331
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,148
Ow, hey, hey.

332
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,652
Sorry.

333
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:39,854
Grab them.

334
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:40,988
Excuse me?

335
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,323
Coconuts. To throw with them.

336
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,592
Oh, that. Yes.

337
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,638
[engine starts]

338
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,390
We still don't have the compass.

339
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:50,558
Ta-daa.

340
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,059
[laughs] You did it again.

341
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:56,496
[indistinct] behind me.

342
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,899
So... can it come and help?

343
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,233
Look, I helped you
find the book.

344
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:03,738
After all, I'm the one who knew
about that mystery first.

345
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,573
I have the right
to be part of it.

346
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:09,076
I'm too excited. It's mysteries,
adventures, lots of secrets.

347
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:12,747
Mr. Fox?

348
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,183
[sighs] I'm done
with the mission.

349
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,416
- W... What?
- What?

350
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,418
I just came here to get
my compass

351
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,422
and my ancestors' book back.

352
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:24,423
Now I've got them. So thank you.

353
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:28,262
And well as they
say, <i>au revoire.</i>

354
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,697
I thought you cared about it

355
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:32,099
and you were going to help
as you promised.

356
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,868
I didn't promise anything.

357
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,870
We need to deal
with this book situation.

358
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,539
There's no way they're going
to let us get away with this.

359
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,608
Why don't you guys
take care of it

360
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:43,878
since you seem to know much more
about it than me. Mm?

361
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,283
You're avoiding the situation.
We need to face this head-on.

362
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,285
Now, can we just talk
about this later?

363
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:54,288
Well, at least try to understand
what you're stepping into.

364
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,790
I thought
you're a treasure hunter.

365
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,123
How about your connection
to the author, John Young?

366
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,128
Should at least have a bit
of interest for your own past.

367
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,961
Lady, you're the one
that brought me here.

368
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,498
I didn't even want to go
on this mission.

369
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,966
We ended up
at some maniac's house.

370
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,736
So thank you for the case,
but no, thank you.

371
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:10,969
I'm sorry I had to put you
through this Mr. Fox.

372
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:11,970
I really am.

373
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,139
But you know
what I'm even more sorry for?

374
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,844
I'm sorry for you. I thought
you were a treasure hunter,

375
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,977
an adventurer
down for something exciting.

376
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,749
So I don't know
if it's because you're scared

377
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:23,984
or whatever reason
you might put into your head,

378
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,755
but right now all I'm seeing
is just a greedy selfish man

379
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,824
who just wants an easy-peasy
scavenger hunt,

380
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:32,827
so he can make enough money
and go with the flow.

381
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,695
That sounds
like a comfortable life to me,

382
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,531
but then don't call yourself
a treasure hunter.

383
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,099
That just makes me sick.

384
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,034
Hey!

385
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:42,870
Forgetting something?

386
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,045
So...

387
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:55,716
it's adventure and mystery
you want, huh?

388
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,185
Well I'll show you
adventure and mystery.

389
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,186
Come on in.

390
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,690
Welcome to the team, Ms. Tanya.

391
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,207
I haven't opened this thing
in a while,

392
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,042
but let's see if it still works.

393
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:26,548
[safe mechanism clicking]

394
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:31,252
[mouthing]

395
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,092
See, I remember it was...

396
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,830
Okay, I got it.

397
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,432
[chuckles]

398
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,001
[doors squeaking]

399
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,507
- Are these all yours?
- Yeah.

400
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:55,242
So, am I still
a fake treasure hunter?

401
00:27:58,513 --> 00:27:59,680
Please, don't.

402
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:02,750
What's this?

403
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,520
Just get over here.

404
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,121
Alright guys.

405
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:11,926
Now let's see what treasures
this book has for us.

406
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,962
[music playing]

407
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,616
"And then,
in the greatest of secrecy,

408
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:40,754
our most trusted [indistinct]
<i>Hebah-hebah</i> Hoapili and mysef

409
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:43,824
took the spear
far out into the jungle

410
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:46,393
to protect its mana.

411
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,962
The <i>Pololu</i> was beautiful

412
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:50,965
and made with the teeth
of a defeated shark

413
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,901
from the wild shores of Oahu.

414
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:57,404
Then we passed
through the bamboo forest

415
00:28:57,471 --> 00:29:00,407
across the river
by the banyan tree

416
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:03,077
on the third night
of the full moon

417
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:08,315
and brought the sacred <i>Pololu</i>
to the cave."

[speaking Hawaiian]

419
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,998
Guys.

420
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,000
Guys. [whistles]

421
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,503
Hey, wake up.
Maleko. Tanya.

422
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,170
I need your help here. Come on.

423
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,672
Wake up, wake up.
What? This is a dormitory?

424
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:34,507
Huh? You think
we're just sleeping?

425
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,876
We're just getting paid
to sleep?

426
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,345
I need help with this.
What does it mean?

427
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:50,355
Uh, it's a <i>Kahuna</i> saying, right?

428
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,026
Yeah, you got it.

429
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,460
So?

430
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,861
Something about the Moon cycle.

431
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:58,799
Hmm, under <i>Mahealani</i> Moon...
[indistinct]

432
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,701
That's, that's
the third full moon

433
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,536
according
to the Hawaii lunar calendar.

434
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,306
Meaning?

435
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,141
...seek and you shall find.

436
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:23,558
Seek, seek, seek...
finding nothing.

437
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,059
Nothing in here. That's it.

438
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,927
Well, what do you mean,
that's it?

439
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:28,929
That's it.
That's all this book is about.

440
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:30,998
It's just a fairy tale, guys.

441
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,767
It's just a fairy tale.
You know?

442
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,234
There's nothing in there.

443
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,839
Hold on, hold on.

444
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,242
Isn't this...
isn't this a <i>Huna</i> symbol?

445
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,346
Yeah, you got it.

446
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:47,682
It's a <i>Huna hemahema.</i>
[indistinct]

447
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:50,417
The symbol to reveal secrets.

448
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,620
Why don't you open it?

449
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,455
You can't open a symbol, silly.

450
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,924
I don't know, you have
some new relics here.

451
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,760
Maybe there's something
that will work.

452
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,445
[ringing]

453
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:21,816
The Waterfall of the Chiefs?

454
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:26,487
That's it.

455
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,288
No, it's hidden.
Just keep digging.

456
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,061
What was that saying again?

457
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,498
Under a night of <i>Mahealani,</i>
seek and you shall find.

458
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:39,834
Seek.

459
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,804
Night seek.

460
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,842
Seek. Night seek.

461
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:52,980
<i>Mahealani,</i> Moon, sky.

462
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,583
Seek the night,
seek the <i>night...</i>

463
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,184
Seek the night!

464
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,823
Boom. It's all right here.
It's all in here.

465
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,323
It's crystal clear. Look.

466
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,326
I recognize that one.

467
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,599
There are drawings.

468
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,333
It's a map made of drawings.

469
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,536
And all clues.

470
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,437
That lead us to a cross.

471
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:19,607
- And you think that cross is...
- Telling us where the spear is.

472
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:21,275
[speaking Hawaiian]

473
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,175
- Waterfall of Chiefs?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:25,845
The one that was thought
to be just a myth?

475
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:28,015
It's not such a myth
as we thought.

476
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:31,553
This is so exciting, Mr. Fox.
You did it. Congratulations.

477
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,351
- [chuckles] Okay.
- Sorry.

478
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,523
I was just saying
congratulations.

479
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:36,524
Right.

480
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:45,399
[applauding]

481
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,367
Isn't this lovely?

482
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,305
Pretty smooth, Edward.
Pretty smooth.

483
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,205
Now I'm not going
to congratulate you

484
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:56,243
in the same way,
but thanks all the same.

485
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:58,245
So I'm assuming

486
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:00,715
you still don't want
to be a part of my team.

487
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,316
Tie them up.

488
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,955
[thumping and grunting]

489
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:26,404
What are you gonna do to us?

490
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:29,076
Well, my dear,
I have a little dilemma.

491
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:30,910
You see,

492
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:33,848
I can't have anyone else
knowing what you know.

493
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:39,453
Loose ends must be trimmed.

494
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,956
You will have to be eliminated.

495
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,990
You know, I don't think
that's a very good way

496
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,426
to start as a future ruler.
Do you?

497
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,796
It's so unfortunate.

498
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,467
See... Eddie Fox was having
a meeting slash date

499
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:56,004
with the lovely Tanya here.

500
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:59,807
He even lit a nice little candle
to set the mood.

501
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:04,812
But then
the jealous assistant burst in.

502
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,514
There was a scuffle.

503
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,115
It all happened so fast

504
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,448
that by the time
the firemen showed up

505
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,786
it was too late.

506
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,390
Okay, fellows, let's go.

507
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,893
Into the jungle.

508
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,967
What are we gonna do?

509
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,970
- What are we gonna do?
- Shh, I'm trying to concentrate?

510
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,575
I need my gadgets?

511
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,308
Well, it's nowhere
near us now, is it?

512
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,813
Nope. But hey, I just got
another idea.

513
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:41,015
Okay, so I'm going to count
to three

514
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,817
and then we're going to get up

515
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,652
by pushing
on each other's backs. Okay?

516
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:46,986
- Okay.
- Ready?

517
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:49,857
One, two...

518
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:53,327
- What are you doing?
- You said get up on three.

519
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,030
No, I said one, two, three

520
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:58,498
and then we're going
to get up. Okay?

521
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,434
Seems better the way
I understood it.

522
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,102
Alright, then. Let's do it.

523
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,840
Which one? You lost me.

524
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,342
Just... let's just do
the way you said it.

525
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,011
You're making this so complex.

526
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,846
You just don't know
how to communicate.

527
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,681
- Do you want to burn?
- No.

528
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,282
Okay, so let's go.

529
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:18,886
- On, on three.
- Yes.

530
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,688
What are you guys doing?

531
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,791
Maleko, I thought you were...

532
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,858
Unconscious. Well, no, but...

533
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,963
Well, yeah, at first and then...
then I was just pretending.

534
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,365
Well, what took you so long
to get up?

535
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,634
You guys are funny.

536
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,736
Okay, well, I'm glad
you had fun.

537
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,739
- Now, could you please?
- Wow.

538
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,745
Oh, yeah, guys,
we got to get going.

539
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:45,046
Eddie, we got to go.

540
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,881
But we don't know where to go.

541
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:50,549
I do. I recognized that symbol,
the wooden flower.

542
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,252
It's right there.

543
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,231
How much further are we?

544
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,068
Way too much further
according to Maleko's map.

545
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:25,873
Yeah, we need to find
a shortcut.

546
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:31,546
I remember when I was a kid

547
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:35,249
and my auntie telling me
about this hidden path

548
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,052
which led to...

549
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,389
a bamboo forest.

550
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:46,928
[relaxing music playing]

551
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:07,748
[yelps] What was that?

552
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,083
[shushing]

553
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,255
I've heard that song before.

554
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,283
[Tanya] <i>Kapuni?</i>

555
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,619
[Eddie] Mahina.

556
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,789
<i>Kapuni</i> means "compass", right?

557
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,224
Yes.

558
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:54,128
So why would Mahina just write
the word "compass"?

559
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,850
Well, well, well.

560
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,519
[laughing]

561
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:54,388
Look.

562
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,625
We need a diversion.

563
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:00,526
[laughing]

564
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,730
[Eddie] I think
I just got an idea.

565
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,701
Why are you looking
at me like that?

566
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,805
- This is ridiculous.
- You look great.

567
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,373
Just go.

568
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,044
[laughing]

569
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,713
Ooh-la-la!

570
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,551
Isn't that weird?

571
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,554
That's just so weird.

572
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:29,090
- [Charlie] You two check it out.
- [Leilani scoffs]

573
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,917
Oh, hi. Care for another drink?

574
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,454
Don't mind if I do.

575
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:08,093
Hold it!

576
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,296
Right there.

577
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:46,535
[laughing]
You two are quite cute.

578
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,803
You call yourselves
the frenetic duo?

579
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,419
[Leilani] Do you need a hand?

580
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,900
Wait... let them go.

581
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:24,105
They'll show us
the way to the spear.

582
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,579
[yelps]

583
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,248
That was easy.

584
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,950
Now, let's look at this book.

585
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:42,089
Little Tiki war guy's next.

586
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,924
Hold on.

587
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:44,925
What?

588
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:47,428
Go back.

589
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:49,730
Now go forward.

590
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,465
What is it?

591
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,402
It's different.

592
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:57,071
- What do you mean?
- Look.

593
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:03,612
Wait a minute.

594
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,451
<i>Mahina.</i>

595
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,785
It's not her name.

596
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,122
It's a meaning.

597
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:18,125
The Moon.

598
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:20,661
It's a lunar compass.

599
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:31,506
This way.

600
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:11,879
The mini warrior.

601
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:14,014
There we go.

602
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:36,897
It's the last clue.

603
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:38,932
It's beautiful.

604
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:51,746
According to this map

605
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,278
it doesn't make much sense
though.

606
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,583
There's no way there's going to
be any waterfall. [indistinct]

607
00:46:55,617 --> 00:46:56,817
We wait and...

608
00:46:57,786 --> 00:46:59,788
[water hissing]

609
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:02,289
Oh my God, we did it.

610
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,793
This is the waterfall.

611
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:39,493
What should we do now, sir?

612
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:41,962
Patience, patience.

613
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:44,666
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

614
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,467
They're showing us the way.

615
00:47:50,672 --> 00:47:51,972
I don't get it.

616
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,207
Maybe there's a trick.
[indistinct]

617
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,174
Like what?

618
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:56,678
I don't know.

619
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,546
Maybe it's something
we should do... [indistinct]

620
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,714
about the Moon.

621
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:19,199
Eddie, where are you?
What happened?

622
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,703
I'm inside the cave.

623
00:48:21,836 --> 00:48:24,037
I just found an opening.
Come on.

624
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:03,210
There it is.

625
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:07,080
The sacred <i>Pololu</i> of Mana.

626
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:22,427
"When someone learns
to be a warrior

627
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:25,232
one must also learn to run."

628
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,940
Patience, my dear.

629
00:49:35,643 --> 00:49:37,612
Run, run...

630
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:39,279
[scoffs] Run!

631
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:53,795
Now.

632
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,967
[gunshot]

633
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,669
[ominous music playing]

634
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:03,170
Thank you so much.

635
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:05,607
You certainly saved us
a lot of time.

636
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,975
You miserable rat.

637
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:11,813
Claiming a spear
you can't even find yourself?

638
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,781
Don't be a spoiled sports.

639
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:15,015
Isn't this much more fun

640
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,148
than sitting
in your shabby little office

641
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,152
pondering on how to pay
your bills?

642
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,455
I gave you a chance
to find the <i>Pololu.</i>

643
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:23,858
- You should thank me?
- [Eddie] Thank you?

644
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:26,993
I would never thank a man
whose whole goal in life

645
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:29,662
is to manipulate everybody
into doing what he wants.

646
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:31,331
Because let's be honest here.

647
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:34,501
What's in it for these guys?
Huh?

648
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:38,138
What? Are you gonna give
them a little bag of gold? Hmm?

649
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:42,010
Or you're just gonna disappear
with the spear and ditch them?

650
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,512
I gave you a chance
to join my team.

651
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,180
I told you already.

652
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:49,517
No one else can know
about this discovery.

653
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:52,386
We're gonna have to trim
those loose ends ourselves.

654
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,737
[yelps] I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

655
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:12,038
Well, you're not me.

656
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,341
No, but really,
I wouldn't do that.

657
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:15,910
And why not?

658
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:18,211
Because that spear's cursed.

659
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,049
Cursed? Really?

660
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:24,050
What? Are some mummies
gonna come and kill me?

661
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:25,887
I think you have
the wrong movie.

662
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,589
Are you done?

663
00:51:27,722 --> 00:51:30,257
No, I just don't want you
to wake any spirits.

664
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,392
Save the pathetic ghost stories.

665
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,267
Are you ready, Mr. Fox?

666
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,604
That's putting it mildly,
[indistinct]

667
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:56,584
[grunts]

668
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:01,089
[groans]

669
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,429
Eddie, behind you.

670
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,970
Whatever you do,
be careful, Charles.

671
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:19,270
Nobody believes in you, Fox.
You're just a joke.

672
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,941
A dusty signboard who takes
money from people

673
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:23,443
to find their pathetic treasure.

674
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,115
Good night, Eddie.

675
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,150
[Tanya] No!

676
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:32,285
Just let me go.

677
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,093
[grunts]

678
00:52:40,662 --> 00:52:41,629
[lamp clacking]

679
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,038
Where's Tanya? Who are you?

680
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,673
[shushing]

681
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:27,508
[speaking Hawaiian]

682
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,343
Wait a minute.

683
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:33,514
Oh, wait. I know who you are.

684
00:53:33,648 --> 00:53:36,551
You're that <i>Kahuna.</i>
You're Mahina.

685
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:39,520
Why me? Why?

686
00:53:39,654 --> 00:53:42,190
Why did you choose
to give the book to me?

687
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:45,193
Your ancestor John Young
was an amazing man.

688
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:47,860
A pioneer and
a very good friend of the king.

689
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:50,198
He was known as the <i>Olohana.</i>

690
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,067
Wait, you knew John Young?

691
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:56,403
<i>Hevah hevah</i> [indistinct] too
was my own ancestor.

692
00:53:56,537 --> 00:53:59,205
He was Kamehameha's <i>Kahuna Nui.</i>

693
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,909
Him and John Young created
a special compass

694
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:04,512
to keep the spirits safe.

695
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:07,546
And when I knew
you were the compass's heir,

696
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:09,884
I knew you would keep
the book safe.

697
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,550
Well, it looks
like you were wrong.

698
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:15,223
I mean, Charles has got
the spear. It's gone.

699
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:19,594
A lost battle doesn't mean
it's a lost cause.

700
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:21,763
Feel the mana.

701
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:25,199
- Charles got the spear.
- It is not about the spear.

702
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,367
What do you mean?

703
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:31,371
A mana is a free spirited source

704
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:34,740
that is elevated
by one's meaningful actions.

705
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:37,111
It becomes from within.

706
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,113
Edward, the mana's in you.

707
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:40,581
I don't know about that.

708
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:43,416
<i>Olohana</i> means
"all hands on deck".

709
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:48,754
Your ancestors would call
upon the spirited words.

710
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:51,924
Sometimes initially
you can't find them

711
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,228
because it wants you to find it.

712
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:56,731
And it'll grow into you
if you let it.

713
00:54:58,232 --> 00:55:00,134
Only you know how to cherish it.

714
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,483
Listen to the universe.

715
00:55:17,952 --> 00:55:19,486
Mana is everywhere.

716
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:23,456
Now open your eyes.

717
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:25,626
See it?

718
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,428
Now watch it.

719
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:35,435
Tanya! Where do they take her?

720
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,175
Makapuu.

721
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:01,829
[waves crashing]

722
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,014
Don't even think about it.

723
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:21,682
Go!

724
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:34,695
And now for the moment
you've all been waiting for.

725
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:37,865
I know we're missing
one audience member,

726
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:40,368
but as they say
in the entertainment business,

727
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:43,037
"show must go on."

728
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,373
Isn't that right, Tanya?

729
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:51,245
[chanting in Hawaiian]

730
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,015
Put that spear down!

731
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,585
Edward... you?

732
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:58,418
How?

733
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:03,722
I command you.
But that spear down!

734
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:05,726
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

735
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:10,430
[swooshing]

736
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:14,068
[dramatic music playing]

737
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,577
Do it.

738
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,947
Strike.

739
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,915
You have no soul. [indistinct]

740
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,421
Leave this island.
Never come back.

741
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,291
That's fair, Fox.

742
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,427
Very fair.

743
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:52,273
[grunts]

744
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:54,942
[screaming]

745
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:02,783
<i>Olohana, olohana, olohana,
olohana, olohana.</i>

746
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,956
You see, Charles,
the spear has destroyed you.

747
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:17,465
[buzzing]

748
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:42,456
Mana is a free spirited energy

749
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,992
floating through the ocean
and the wind.

750
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:47,828
And it finds its home
where good deeds achieve.

751
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:50,698
And it leaves
where bad deeds come along.

752
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:54,335
The spirit chose you.
Take care of it.

753
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:55,503
<i>Aloha.</i>

754
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:00,975
[buzzing]

755
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:16,023
So... what power
does it give you then?

756
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:18,659
I think...

757
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,997
I think
it doesn't give us power.

758
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,868
But it wants us
to find it within.

759
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:34,041
All power comes from within.

760
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,881
The spear is right.

761
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:43,717
It does come from within.

762
