1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,318
<i>You got him! You got him!</i>

2
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,957
<i>Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight.</i>

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,393
I can't stop that.

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,311
Here. Get out of here, you useless tit.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,517
<i>When I met him, he was already
the best cut man in the business.</i>

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,794
Can you stop it?

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,350
<i>Started training and managing in the '60s,
but he never lost his gift.</i>

8
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,475
No.

9
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,231
Let me have a look at him.

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,038
He's fine. He's fine.

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,315
Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,879
I'll give you one more round.

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,478
Seconds out. Let's go.

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,755
What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,876
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,153
<i>Sometimes, there's just nothing you can do.</i>

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,309
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone...</i>

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,232
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,471
<i>or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.</i>

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,511
<i>There are all kinds
of combinations you come up against</i>

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,989
<i>down in the different layers of meat,</i>

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,991
<i>and Frankie knew how to work every one.</i>

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,752
<i>People love violence.</i>

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,874
<i>They slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,195
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,953
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,190
<i>Boxing is about respect-</i>

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,111
<i>getting it for yourself...</i>

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,794
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,592
I'll warm up the car.

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,193
Mr Dunn?

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,271
Hmm. I owe you money?

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,554
No, sir.

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,993
I know your mama?

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,036
Don't rightly know, sir.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,519
Then what is it you want?

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,239
I was on the undercard. I won my fight, to0.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,673
Maggie Fitzgerald.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,228
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,833
Did you happen to see it?

41
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,195
- Nope.
- I did pretty good.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,635
Thought you might
be interested in training me.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,438
I don't train girls.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,229
Maybe you should.
People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,073
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,197
It's a mistake.

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,395
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,914
Just push, will you?

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,991
What did Hogan want?

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,593
Offered us a title shot.

51
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,797
- 'Bout time.
- I turned him down flat.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,668
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,156
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,674
Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,751
You lose it, it may not come around again.

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,833
Now, two or three more fights,
and we'll be ready.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,876
Whatever you say, Frankie.

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,119
<i>Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act,</i>

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,919
<i>that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,036
<i>Sometimes...</i>

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>best way to deliver a punch is step back.</i>

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,359
Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,192
Annie, to0.

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,437
Other than that... you know what I want.

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,159
There's no use me repeating myself.

66
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,836
<i>But step back too far, you ain't fightin' at all.</i>

67
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,396
Thank you for your prayers.

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,436
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

69
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,909
Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,399
Made me weep.

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,152
What's confusing you this week?

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,708
Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,917
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,391
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

75
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,598
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,389
You only come to Mass every day to wind me
up. It's not going to happen this morning.

77
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,549
Well, I'm confused.

78
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,993
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,958
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

80
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,792
Anything else? Cos I'm busy.

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,474
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- An expression of God's love.

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,949
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,759
Well, what is he, then?
Does that make him a demigod?

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,229
<i>There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!</i>

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,031
Did you write to your daughter?

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,155
<i>Absolutely.</i>

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,357
Now you're lying to a priest.
You know what? Take a day off.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,396
Don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,676
<i>Some people'd say the most
important thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,036
<i>Frankie'd say,
"Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart</i>

91
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,953
<i>and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating. "</i>

92
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,229
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,311
My name's Dangerous Dillard

94
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,518
<i>Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch
Out of Broward County, Texas!</i>

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,391
<i>Danger showed up a couple of years back.</i>

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,349
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

97
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,468
<i>Apparently, Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

98
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,634
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
'fore he introduced himself.</i>

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,715
Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,918
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,353
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,591
Lots of people where I comes from does,

103
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,629
but my mama taught me not to cause hurt
to no man, niggers or not.

104
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,678
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,799
<i>Just one of those questions,
but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.</i>

106
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,271
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the Welterweight Champion of the world.

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,033
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

108
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,159
<i>to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!</i>

109
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,834
<i>Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.</i>

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,713
You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.

111
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,711
<i>Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!</i>

112
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,472
<i>Hey, you a bad man, huh?</i>

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,199
Hey, come on, get in the ring.
Go a round with me.

114
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,633
Shawrelle...

115
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,073
I will.

116
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,434
Leave him alone.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,679
Danger, you goon back to training.

118
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,910
Will do, Mr Scrap.

119
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,593
<i>Ow!</i>

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,432
Them some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,875
I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,110
<i>Those pants look real pretty on you, bro.</i>

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,191
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,034
<i>Shawrelle Berry
had a left hook that would move a tank...</i>

125
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,157
<i>but he had a heart the size of a split pea.</i>

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,233
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

127
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,517
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

128
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,319
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

129
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,154
<i>Frankie found out... most gyms lose money.</i>

130
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,312
I thought I told you I didn't want Danger
working out here anymore.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,311
Oh, he ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.

132
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,038
Well, he's hurtin' me.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,671
Breakin' my heart watchin' him
punch the air like it's going to punch back.

134
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,513
And how many times have I got to
tell you that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,318
Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?

136
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,550
You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.

137
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,517
It smells better, Frankie.

138
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,637
Bleach smells like bleach.

139
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,629
Hey, Scrap.

140
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,438
Hey, Mr Willie.

141
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,836
Hey, nice fight last night.

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,354
Big Willie.

143
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,555
Hey, Sally.

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,279
- Nice fight.
- Thanks, man.

145
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,032
People are talkin'.

146
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,031
"Ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat".

147
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,714
What the hell kind of language is that?

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,232
What do you want?

149
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,754
I just thought you might like to know

150
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,798
you got a fighter out there
not talking to another manager.

151
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,634
Not talking to another manager?

152
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,994
Not just any manager.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,594
Mickey Mack.

154
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,509
You came in here to tell me
that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,034
Not a word. Neither one of 'em.

156
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,116
I'm trying to read here.

157
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,475
Well, if you think that's more important...

158
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,115
Who's your new girl?

159
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
What?

160
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,792
Jesus Christ.

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,233
Better hurry up.

162
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,312
If she keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

163
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,552
<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

164
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,757
<i>- I told you I don't train girls.
- Thought you might change your mind.</i>

165
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,149
There's dozens of trainers who train girls.

166
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,071
You won't have any trouble finding one.

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,355
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

168
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,228
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

169
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,039
<i>- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.</i>

170
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,714
If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

171
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,954
No.

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,911
I might as well just keep calling you it.

173
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,918
<i>She came from
southwestern Missouri...</i>

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,152
<i>the hills outside
the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia,</i>

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,030
<i>set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere
between nowhere and good-bye.</i>

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,634
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:</i>

177
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,472
<i>She was trash.</i>

178
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,908
It's for my dog.

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,393
<i>She'd come 1,800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

180
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,392
Workin' the bag, boss.

181
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,119
Not your boss... and that bag's working you.

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,077
Give her her money back.

183
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,310
You sure?

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,231
How much did she pay?

185
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,514
<i>Six months.</i>

186
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,192
Oh, Jesus Christ.

187
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,793
<i>No, I'll just give it back.</i>

188
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,269
No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?

189
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,592
Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues
just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

190
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,956
- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- OK.

191
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,076
And... And what's Danger doing out there?

192
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,230
<i>What's he lookin' at?</i>

193
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,193
Looks like a bottle of water.

194
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,635
He paid his dues?

195
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,517
Dues?

196
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,114
Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,316
Get out of my office.

198
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,599
Fuck me.

199
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,318
Can't think of it as a bag.

200
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,717
I'm not a trainer,

201
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,631
but I can show you this, if you'd like.

202
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,233
Appreciate any help I can get.

203
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,788
OK. Let's see.

204
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,838
What you want to do is
you want to think of it as a man, see?

205
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,273
And he's constantly moving.

206
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,911
He's moving towards you. He's moving around
you. He's moving away from you, all right?

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,389
You don't want to hit him
when he's coming towards you

208
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,391
cos what he's going to do is push you back.

209
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,393
He's going to smother your punches,
take your balance, right?

210
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,631
So watch him carefully.
Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving,

211
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,429
and keep one shoulder back
so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

212
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,873
Right? Go ahead, now.

213
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,632
Good, good. Keep rotating.

214
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,711
Keep moving. That's it.

215
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,758
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

216
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,512
Come on around.

217
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,272
Keep moving, keep moving.

218
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,554
Good, good, good, good.

219
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,791
- Like that?
- Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.

220
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,235
Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

221
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,955
<i>That's good. That's good.</i>

222
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,749
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

223
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,551
You do have a speed bag?

224
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,239
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

225
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,151
All right, you goon home now.

226
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,593
I'll walk out with you?

227
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,148
No, I am home. Want to see?

228
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,639
Yeah.

229
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,352
It's nice.

230
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,155
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

231
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,231
No, just...

232
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,550
pull the door closed when you leave.

233
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,716
Thank you.

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,554
<i>If there's magic in boxing,</i>

235
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,428
<i>it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance,</i>

236
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,435
<i>beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

237
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,670
<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

238
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,635
<i>OK, come on. Watch the footwork.</i>

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,638
Hey, Flip.

240
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,551
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

241
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,915
I think I found somebody you can beat.

242
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,752
I don't fights women.

243
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,434
Why not, bro?
It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?

244
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,556
Cos she - nah, you-you could fight to him

245
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,076
and then you could kiss to him, and then
you could fight to him one more time.

246
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,549
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

247
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,552
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

248
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,039
Thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?

249
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,475
I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.

250
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,393
Look at her little bitty titties.
They're like mosquito bites.

251
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,471
Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.

252
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,551
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

253
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,791
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,836
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

255
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,910
<i>Canvas has titties.</i>

256
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,151
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

257
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,712
<i>Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.</i>

258
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,396
Come on, bro, the floor is having titties?
That's funny, bro.

259
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,993
Shut up, man.

260
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,752
What you laughing at?

261
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,434
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

262
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,675
Yo, when they start making those tights for men,
Flippy?

263
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,512
Punk.

264
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,950
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

265
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,275
- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.

266
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,750
My middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Gracie I'd drive her.

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,671
Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?

268
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,309
She hates that car. Wants the old one back,
but the dealer won't do it.

269
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,312
- Said he's already got a buyer.
- Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

270
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,470
I'd appreciate that.

271
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,913
<i>OK.</i>

272
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,035
Thanks.

273
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,633
See you later.

274
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,231
The man's a rubdown whore.

275
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,038
Today he doesn't want one?

276
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,872
You ever do any work around here?

277
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,191
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

278
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,356
Little girl seems to be coming along.

279
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,589
Yeah.

280
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,353
It's almost like someone's been helping her.

281
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,715
She might just be a natural.

282
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,030
Looks like she's got something.

283
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,634
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

284
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,477
I wonder how the hell she got that.

285
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,437
I wonder.

286
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,436
I'm going to need that speed bag back.

287
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,272
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag.

288
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,989
That's my bag, and if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

289
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,116
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

290
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,599
Yes, yes, it is.

291
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,353
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

292
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,115
I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.

293
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,432
Yeah. Well,
I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

294
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,873
I understand.

295
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,791
Yeah.

296
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,714
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

297
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,672
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

298
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,718
You're going to find a trainer,
either here or somewhere else,

299
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,438
that's going to want to train a girl.

300
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,114
It's the latest freak show out there.

301
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,755
But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting
your time because you're to00ld.

302
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,831
I don't feel that old.

303
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,435
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

304
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,035
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

305
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,111
How old are you?

306
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,954
<i>- 31... until my next birthday.
- Oh, well, there you go.</i>

307
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,359
31.

308
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,750
You wouldn't start training
to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?

309
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,308
Already been working it for three years.

310
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,118
And you can't hit a speed bag?

311
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,031
What kind of training is that?

312
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,031
I've never had any, boss.

313
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,078
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

314
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,435
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

315
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,512
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

316
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,591
Yeah.

317
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,672
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr Dunn.

318
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,556
You're not going to cry now, are you?

319
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,437
No, sir.

320
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,999
Yeah.

321
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,718
Here.

322
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,552
Keep the goddamn thing.

323
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,315
- No, you need it.
- No, take the bag.

324
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,356
I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.

325
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,476
I've had three since then.

326
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,154
Just uh... just enjoy it, will you?

327
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,071
I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.

328
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,115
Yeah.

329
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,872
Just don't lose it.

330
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,751
Yeah, I know, Hogan.

331
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,798
Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.

332
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,393
<i>But if I don't see 40%...</i>

333
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,508
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40,
or don't call me back at all.

334
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,359
Hey, Willie.

335
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,908
- Hey, Frankie.
- Is something wrong?

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,036
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.

337
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,315
I-I know you don't like people dropping in.

338
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,279
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

339
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,510
I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

340
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,477
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

341
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,439
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favour.

342
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,670
Gracie broke out and cried
when she saw it.

343
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,716
Really?

344
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,439
I also needed to talk with you about business.

345
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,479
Oh, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.
We're all set for September.

346
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,391
Everything but the split.

347
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,357
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

348
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,713
What?

349
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,150
Willie, the... the title is just two fights away.

350
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,559
It ain't that. It's...

351
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,359
It's like you said, I got one shot.

352
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,352
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

353
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,274
I need somebody in the action,
who can make things happen.

354
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,475
And I gotta make the change before the fight.

355
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,313
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

356
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,837
So, I get you to the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

357
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,433
Only way he'd do it.

358
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,351
I'm sorry, Frankie.

359
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,874
I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.

360
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,598
I wish it could've been with me.

361
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,870
Mickey Mack's a businessman.

362
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,235
He can't teach you nothing.

363
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,039
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

364
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,429
<i>There's some things
people just don't want to hear.</i>

365
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,394
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

366
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,349
to fight me for the
Welterweight Championship of the whole world.

367
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,113
Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

368
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,158
Just working on my footwork, Mr Scrap.

369
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,670
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

370
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,159
Danger, while you thinking about that punch,
I'll be right back.

371
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,352
I'm... I'm thinking how
I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr Scrap.

372
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,714
<i>No one had the heart
to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

373
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,079
I heard about Willie.

374
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,469
That's cold. That's dead cold.

375
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,473
Course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

376
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,313
Yeah. At least I can see through both eyes.

377
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,868
Yeah, mm-hm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

378
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,793
Well, I've got the gym.

379
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,633
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

380
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,870
Willie tell you why?

381
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,313
It was Mickey.

382
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,913
Mickey's got the connections.

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,276
It ain't about connections, Frank.
It's about you not believing in him.

384
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,999
Well, I found him.
I stuck with him for eight years.

385
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,071
How's that for not believing in him?

386
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,516
You could've got him a title fight two years ago.
Hell, he knew that.

387
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,113
<i>I'm amazed he stayed this long.</i>

388
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,715
Yeah, well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

389
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,351
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head, not protect him?

390
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,829
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship?

391
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,875
Yeah.

392
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,349
Oh, well, now it makes sense.

393
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,273
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

394
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,238
You were a hell of a fighter,
a lot better than Willie.

395
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,073
He get you a title fight
or did he just bust you out,

396
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,039
banging your head against other people's fists
until you lost your eye?

397
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,156
I had my shot.

398
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,913
I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.

399
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,276
Yeah, well, I remember.
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter

400
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,909
spending the second half of his life
cleaning up other people's spit.

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,274
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

402
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,112
Right. You're the smart one.

403
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,350
You're the one learning Greek.

404
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,514
It's Gaelic.

405
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,717
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

406
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,518
How do you say that in Gaelic?

407
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,157
<i>Sorry.</i>

408
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,472
Thanks.

409
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,996
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act...</i>

410
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,231
<i>cos everything in it is backwards.</i>

411
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,593
<i>You want to move to the left,</i>

412
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,514
<i>you don't step left, you push on the right toe.</i>

413
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,995
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

414
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,516
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do,</i>

415
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,511
<i>you step into it.</i>

416
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,470
<i>Oh, my God! He hits the
champ with a right hand and the champ's down!</i>

417
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,073
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the ref has ended the count.</i>

418
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,038
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world!</i>

419
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,078
<i>It's unbelievable how this
has taken place tonight.</i>

420
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,799
<i>But there you have it, folks, a new champion.</i>

421
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,753
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

422
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,078
Want a cheeseburger?

423
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,151
- You bought me a cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

424
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,435
I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

425
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,512
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

426
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,273
Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

427
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,432
You watch the fight?

428
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,670
Yeah, I watched it.

429
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,399
Willie did good.

430
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,471
That's what you've got to say?

431
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,074
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

432
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,797
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up.

433
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,313
That's good work.

434
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,913
You watch it?

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,831
Yeah, I got HBO.

436
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,953
How can you afford HBO?

437
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,350
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

438
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,749
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson

439
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,638
<i>at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.</i>

440
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,551
That true?

441
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,713
Yeah. Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

442
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,313
Don't you remember nothing?

443
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,231
Well, I remember walking halfway,

444
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,992
and thinking I was going to be lynched.

445
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,993
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

446
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,832
Yeah, well, I got a ride.

447
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,595
The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.
I had to walk back two miles.

448
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,433
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

449
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,238
Hmm.

450
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,118
What the hell's that?

451
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,953
It's her birthday.

452
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,154
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

453
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,879
So, it's your birthday, huh?

454
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,791
How old does that make you?

455
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,396
I'm 32, Mr Dunn...
and I'm here celebrating the fact

456
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,758
that I spent another year scraping dishes
and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.

457
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,992
And according to you, I'll be 37
'fore I can even throw a decent punch...

458
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,117
which after working this speed bag for a month
and getting nowhere,

459
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,236
I now realise may be God's simple truth.

460
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,914
Other truth is, my brother's in prison,

461
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,436
my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her babies is still alive,

462
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,239
my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

463
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,551
If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home,

464
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,791
find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

465
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,675
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

466
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,796
If I'm to00ld for this, then I got nothing.

467
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,350
That enough truth to suit you?

468
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,438
This your speed bag?

469
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,592
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

470
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,999
OK.

471
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,911
Just hold it, hold it.

472
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,470
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

473
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,913
No. Sorry.

474
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,434
- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir,

475
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,479
because I know if you train me right,
I'm going to be a champ.

476
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,558
I seen you looking at me.

477
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,153
Yeah, out of pity.

478
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,719
<i>Don't you say that!</i>

479
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,439
<i>Don't you say that if it ain't true!</i>

480
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,238
I want a trainer.

481
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,356
<i>I don't want charity,</i>

482
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,192
and I don't want favours.

483
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,350
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

484
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,310
Stop, stop, stop.

485
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,152
Goddamn it, stop.

486
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,633
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,632
OK.

488
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,029
If I'm going to take you on...

489
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,633
You won't never regret it.

490
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,948
Look, just listen to me.

491
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,838
- If I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.

492
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,309
God, this is a mistake already.

493
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,756
Mm-mm. I'm listening, boss.

494
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,116
If I take you on, you don't say anything.

495
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,952
You don't question me.

496
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,033
You don't ask why, you don't say anything
except maybe, "Yes, Frankie".

497
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,192
<i>And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.</i>

498
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,508
It's all I ask.

499
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,068
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

500
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,754
<i>- All righty.
- We got a deal.</i>

501
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,791
No, not quite.

502
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,030
I'm going to teach you how to fight.

503
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,759
Then, we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

504
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,432
I hate to argue with you, but...

505
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,590
Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.

506
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,150
I teach you all you need to know, and then
you go off and make a million dollars.

507
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,676
<i>I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.</i>

508
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,038
I don't want to hear about it either way,
that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.

509
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,034
All right.

510
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,274
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is, you never move your feet.

511
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,471
You stand there just flatfooted.
You've got to move your feet.

512
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,438
That's one of the best things
I'm going to be able to teach you.

513
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,035
So, here's what you do. You get yourself...

514
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,872
Bend your knees a little bit.

515
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,552
Get in an athletic position.

516
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,790
Look like you're going to hit something.

517
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,793
<i>- Move 'em how, boss?
- Uh, just, you go hit the bag.</i>

518
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,238
<i>- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?</i>

519
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,311
OK, you did two things wrong.

520
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,915
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

521
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,230
Now, what I want you to do...

522
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,072
It's not about hitting it hard.

523
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,718
It's how good you hit it.

524
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,631
So, watch me.

525
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,314
And you can count with me if you want,
just count;

526
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,430
On a one count, I hit right through the bag.

527
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,590
- Can you show me that again?
- You just...

528
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,750
Just say "one", please.

529
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,432
<i>- One.
- OK, one.</i>

530
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,112
- One.
- OK.

531
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,317
Yeah, just say one.
That's good. That's good.

532
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,356
Then I move over to my right foot.

533
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,159
You'll see my weight is
shifting to my right foot.

534
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,836
Then I hit it with the back of my hand,
sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

535
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,319
Then I come over,

536
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,756
and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

537
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,356
And ice pick manoeuvre again, and I come
over on my right foot and hit it right, left.

538
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,749
Don't watch anything but my feet.

539
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,398
One, two, three...

540
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
Just do it like that. Just keep practising.

541
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,036
<i>Need to show 'em how to
stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

542
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,589
<i>To make a fighter,
you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.</i>

543
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,113
Rest when you're dead.

544
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,918
Come here.

545
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,908
<i>You can't just tell 'em
to "forget everything you know".</i>

546
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,355
<i>You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.</i>

547
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,954
Left uppercut, left, left.

548
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,678
<i>Make 'em so tired they only listen to you,</i>

549
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,514
<i>only hear your voice,
only do what you say and nothing else.</i>

550
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,755
Move your feet.

551
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,070
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

552
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,714
<i>Show 'em how to keep their balance</i>

553
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,472
<i>and take it away from the other guy.</i>

554
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,073
Not so low. Look at me.

555
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,037
Right hook and just turn right over...

556
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,196
<i>How to generate
momentum off your right toe...</i>

557
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,557
<i>...and how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

558
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,399
<i>How to fight backing up,</i>

559
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,278
<i>so that the other guy
doesn't want to come after you.</i>

560
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,715
<i>Then you got to show 'em all over again -</i>

561
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,510
<i>over and over and over till they think
they were born that way.</i>

562
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,633
Shift. Shift away. Shift away.

563
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,757
OK, that's enough for today.

564
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,718
Good work. Good girl.

565
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,434
Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

566
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,959
Hey.

567
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,951
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

568
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,272
You're not breathing.

569
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,512
Hate to disagree with you.

570
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,672
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

571
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,113
Now, stop doing that.

572
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,952
OK.

573
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,634
But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

574
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,870
I mean, for a girl.

575
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,518
I don't train girls.

576
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,950
Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

577
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,350
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

578
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,876
I'd like to, but you've
been keeping me to0 busy.

579
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,957
Got any family, boss?

580
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,155
What?

581
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,592
You been spending all this time with me.
I didn't know if you had any.

582
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,993
<i>No.</i>

583
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,958
Well, I've got a daughter - Katy.

584
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,792
That's family.

585
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,599
We're not exactly close.

586
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,398
How much she weigh?

587
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,879
What?

588
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,315
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

589
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,599
Yeah.

590
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,035
Not very big.

591
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,111
Used to be real athletic.

592
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,270
Don't know if she kept it up.

593
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,473
<i>So... what do you think?</i>

594
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,437
Am I ready for a fight?

595
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,673
Hey, Sally.

596
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,712
Come here for a minute, will you?

597
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,233
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, OK?

598
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,673
<i>Can I see you a minute?</i>

599
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,116
Sally here is a real good manager.
Has a couple Golden Glove boys.

600
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,111
Looking for a girl, Sally?

601
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,236
I'm looking for a good one.

602
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,076
Well, see, there you go.

603
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,635
Nice working with you, girlie.

604
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,990
- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

605
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,631
<i>I ain't lying. I been watching you work.
You've got a hell of a left.</i>

606
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,438
Thank you.

607
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,030
So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?

608
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,312
Yeah, sure.

609
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,188
Good... cos I think you're ready for a fight.

610
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,911
All right.

611
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,478
<i>Break!</i>

612
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,030
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

613
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,317
You're doing great. You're wearing her down.
Just keep punching.

614
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,152
I ain't doing great. I'm losing.

615
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,912
You're wearing her down.

616
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,231
Nice night, ain't it?

617
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,595
Jesus Christ.

618
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,114
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

619
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,476
Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0.

620
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,233
Your left. Keep your left up.

621
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,509
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

622
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,036
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ.

623
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,439
Yeah.

624
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,715
<i>Your left, damn it!</i>

625
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,076
Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,

626
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,832
but Sally's a good manager.

627
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,751
He must think she can take her.

628
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,558
<i>Jesus H, your left!</i>

629
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,596
<i>Keep your left up!</i>

630
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,830
You think she can hear you from back here?

631
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,034
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

632
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,951
Might even help him.

633
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,031
Lonnie's girl gets another win,

634
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,830
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

635
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,229
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

636
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,958
Hey, what do I know?

637
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,554
I just come cos I enjoy the fights.

638
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,278
<i>Mother of God!</i>

639
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,197
<i>OK, break!</i>

640
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,316
<i>Hey! Come here, come here.</i>

641
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,913
<i>Hey, get over here!</i>

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,151
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

643
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,118
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

644
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,510
You're doing a hell of a job of it.
Is this how you advise your lightweight?

645
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,592
Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

646
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,035
- I'm talking. What you doing?
- This your fighter?

647
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,076
<i>It's my fighter!</i>

648
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,515
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

649
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,229
Fine. You take her.
She can't fight worth a shit, anyway.

650
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,072
Somebody tell me what's going on.

651
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,071
I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

652
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,549
You're telling me this is your fighter?

653
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,958
Yeah, this is my fighter.

654
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,837
Then you got ten seconds.

655
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,639
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it drops.

656
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,756
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

657
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,478
She thinks she knows you, that's all.

658
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,994
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top,

659
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,911
so you just wait for her, see?

660
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,638
That's all she's thinking about.

661
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,029
And when she cocks
that big right hand, you hear me?

662
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,908
And when she does, you step to the side
and come over with this big "good night" hook.

663
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,353
- Got one?
- Got it right here.

664
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,509
OK.

665
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,068
- Fight, or I'm calling it.
- Go give it to her.

666
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,550
<i>The body knows
what fighters don't - how to protect itself.</i>

667
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,279
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

668
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,079
<i>Twist it just a hair more, and the body says,</i>

669
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,597
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here, cos you obviously
don't know what you're doing".</i>

670
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,238
Neutral corner.

671
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,673
<i>Two, three, four...</i>

672
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,910
- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.

673
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,673
Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

674
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,437
<i>"Lie down, now. Rest, and we'll
talk about this when you regain your senses".</i>

675
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,909
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

676
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,639
Don't get all carried away, now. Good girl.

677
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,517
Thanks, boss.

678
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,068
You, uh... You forgot the rule.

679
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,833
- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?

680
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,639
It's to protect yourself at all times.

681
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,676
Now, what is the rule?

682
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,239
Protect myself at all times.

683
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,878
Good, good.

684
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,349
You gave me away. How's that protecting me?

685
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,078
It wasn't.

686
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,599
It's OK.

687
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,636
I'll work on my left, boss.

688
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,915
Drink your water.

689
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,639
Other than that, how'd I do?

690
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,792
Fine. You did fine.

691
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,189
You gonna leave me again?

692
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,957
Never.

693
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,238
That place you work - do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

694
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,753
Sure.

695
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,876
Not the kind with the canned filling crap?

696
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,997
Oh, big can, yea size.
It says "homemade" on the label.

697
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,272
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

698
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,749
You gonna argue with me?

699
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,956
Know better than to do that, boss.

700
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,915
Good.

701
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,958
<i>All fighters
are pig-headed some way or other.</i>

702
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,476
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

703
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,314
Can you uh... spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

704
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,714
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong,</i>

705
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,872
<i>even if that one thing
is going to be the ruin of them,</i>

706
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,077
<i>if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,</i>

707
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,832
<i>then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

708
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,478
Thought I said I'd see you Monday.

709
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,312
You sure did, boss.

710
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,152
That was last night.

711
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,037
You said not to argue with you.

712
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,269
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

713
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,237
You want my advice?

714
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,514
What?

715
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,470
Where are your shoes?

716
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,710
I'm airing out my feet.

717
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,115
You got big holes in your socks.

718
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,395
Oh, they're not that big.

719
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,950
Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

720
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,156
These are my sleeping socks.

721
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,034
<i>My feet like a little air at night.</i>

722
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,753
How come you're wearing 'em
in the daytime, then?

723
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,798
Cos my daytime socks
got to0 many holes in 'em.

724
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,113
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

725
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,633
Please.

726
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,673
Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

727
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,194
Might find its way to the track.

728
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,237
<i>Oh!</i>

729
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,911
<i>Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.</i>

730
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,199
I got the breathing thing down.

731
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,829
No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking
'em out in the first round.

732
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,194
Thought that was the point.

733
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,396
The point is to get good.

734
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,278
Can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out
in the first round.

735
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,998
How am I going to get you fights?

736
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,709
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.

737
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,394
<i>Why am I still doing four-rounders, boss?</i>

738
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,233
Cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds,
that's why.

739
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,471
I do if I keep knocking 'em
out in the first round.

740
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,917
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

741
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,434
<i>just to let her know who was boss.</i>

742
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,479
Three, four, five,

743
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,630
<i>six, seven...</i>

744
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,756
Sorry, boss.

745
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,229
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

746
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,439
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

747
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,075
<i>Down!</i>

748
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,072
To the corner. Three, four...

749
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,673
<i>five...</i>

750
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,273
<i>six, seven,</i>

751
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,759
<i>eight...</i>

752
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,035
<i>nine, ten! It's over!</i>

753
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,829
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

754
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,471
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

755
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,157
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her
decent fights,</i>

756
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,233
<i>sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

757
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,078
<i>But that only worked for so long.</i>

758
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,470
<i>Then Frankie did something he hated doing.</i>

759
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,471
<i>He took a chance.</i>

760
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,430
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

761
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,511
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

762
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,518
Break. Break. Step back.

763
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,999
<i>Time.</i>

764
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,555
- Dang.
- Dang.

765
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,558
Hey, give us two seconds, will ya?
Just two seconds.

766
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,114
<i>- Your nose is broke.
- Dang!</i>

767
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,599
- Fix it.
- I can't. I can't.

768
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,079
You can fix it.

769
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,550
- I can't. I've gotta call it.
- I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

770
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,473
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

771
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,993
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

772
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,548
Please. If you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

773
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,517
Bite down on this.

774
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,634
OK.

775
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,035
Inhale.

776
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,155
- What?
- Inhale.

777
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,116
What?

778
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,679
Breathe in.

779
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,709
OK, huh?

780
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,835
Yeah, it's OK.

781
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,069
Yeah. All right.

782
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,390
You got 20 seconds before
this turns into a geyser

783
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,436
and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

784
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,795
20 seconds - that's all you've got.

785
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,108
Get goin'.

786
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,314
<i>Go to your corner!</i>

787
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,038
<i>Two,</i>

788
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,918
<i>three, four, five,</i>

789
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,877
six, seven,

790
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,552
<i>eight,</i>

791
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,234
<i>nine, ten!</i>

792
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,112
"Mo cuishle".

793
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,795
Whatcha reading?

794
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,314
What's she saying?

795
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,436
Wants to know what you're reading.

796
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,873
It's Yeats.

797
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,269
Keep your head back.

798
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,351
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?

799
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,396
Show her what a treat that is.

800
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,675
When the hell they gonna get to her?

801
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,035
I'm OK, Frankie.

802
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,792
What'd you learn tonight?

803
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,836
Always protect myself.

804
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,354
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

805
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,954
<i>- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.</i>

806
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,999
I'll be right here.

807
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,598
How you doin'?

808
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,079
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

809
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,037
I'm not the one who's hurt.

810
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,434
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

811
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,590
Why are you telling me that?

812
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,232
No reason.

813
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,916
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

814
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,039
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

815
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,838
Did you write your daughter?

816
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,070
Every week.

817
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,230
I've no idea why you come to church.

818
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,756
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

819
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,518
<i>The first was to fight Billie "The Blue Bear"
Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

820
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,318
<i>Billie the Blue Bear!</i>

821
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,790
<i>Billie was a former
prostitute out of East Berlin.</i>

822
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,838
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

823
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,558
<i>Didn't matter to her
something like that could kill a person.</i>

824
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,919
And the crowds loved her.

825
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,914
<i>He turned it down without even telling her.</i>

826
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,397
<i>The next was to fight the British champ,
a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.</i>

827
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,959
Hello?

828
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,554
Not interested.

829
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,434
<i>He turned that down, too.</i>

830
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,477
That's a lot of money, boss.

831
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,155
Yeah. You're making money.
What're you still working here for?

832
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,071
It's a title match, right?

833
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,391
Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

834
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,313
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

835
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,311
Might still be a good fight.

836
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,188
Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight.

837
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,909
To0 good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

838
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,275
Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

839
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,074
Well, you can get yourself another manager
any time you want.

840
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,914
In fact, if you'd learnt
to protect your face a little better,

841
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,911
I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

842
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,152
My face out there so much,
it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss.
