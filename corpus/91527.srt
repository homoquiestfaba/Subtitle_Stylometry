1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,670
Cecilia was the first to go.

2
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:15,171
What are you doing here, honey?

3
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:18,592
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

4
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:22,470
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

5
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,591
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighbourhood...

6
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,260
..from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

7
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:08,557
People saw their clairvoyance in
the wiped-out elms, the harsh sunlight...

8
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:11,977
..and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

9
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:16,397
Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.

10
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,025
We still can't.

11
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:22,403
Now whenever we run into each other
at lunches or parties...

12
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,740
..we find ourselves going over
the evidence one more time.

13
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,993
All to understand those five girls,...

14
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:32,914
..who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

15
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,627
Cecilia, the youngest, was 13.

16
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,466
And Lux was 14.

17
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,136
Bonnie was 15.

18
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,722
Mary was 16.

19
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,852
And Therese was 17.

20
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,943
No one could understand how Mrs Lisbon
and Mr Lisbon, our math teacher,...

21
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,779
..had produced such beautiful creatures.

22
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:12,327
Paul Baldino claimed to have
found Cecilia on her first attempt.

23
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:14,580
Hey, I was the one who found her.

24
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,083
I was in the storm sewer under my house.
There's all these tunnels.

25
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,252
You could get into anyone's house.

26
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:23,421
When Paul said this, we believed him...

27
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,632
..because he was the son
of Sammy "the Shark" Baldino,...

28
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,093
..and we knew about his escape tunnel.

29
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:33,014
So I went up, thinking I could see
one of those girls taking a shower!

30
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,557
Right!

31
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,434
And I walk in...

32
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,311
..and I see blood everywhere.

33
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,732
So I turned around, went for the stairs
and right back out the tunnel.

34
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:45,443
I had to tell you guys that story.

35
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,195
I'll see you guys later, all right?

36
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:55,076
- (woman) I heard there was an accident.
- (woman #2) It was no accident, Joan.

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,495
Of course the parents are to blame!

38
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,415
I heard they found the razor in the toilet...

39
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:04,211
Everyone had an opinion
as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.

40
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:08,423
That girl didn't want to die.
She just wanted out of that house.

41
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,218
She wanted out
of that decorating scheme.

42
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,808
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

43
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:24,396
Dominic was staying with relatives
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

44
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,733
He was the first in our neighbourhood
to wear sunglasses,...

45
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:30,653
..and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.

46
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,783
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

47
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,581
I love her!

48
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:47,002
When Diana Porter left on vacation
in Switzerland, Dominic denounced God.

49
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,673
To prove the validity of his love...

50
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,300
..he jumped off the roof
of his relatives' house.

51
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,367
Ahem! I'm gonna
show you some images,...

52
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,953
..and, uh... you tell me...

53
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,082
..what they remind you of.

54
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,127
OK?

55
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,937
A banana.

56
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,611
A swamp.

57
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,413
An Afro.

58
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:29,184
I don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

59
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,771
Her act was a cry for help.

60
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,107
I know you're very strict,...

61
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,112
..but I think that Cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet...

62
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:44,074
..outside of the codification of school,...

63
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:49,037
..where she could interact
with males her own age.

64
00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:01,423
Peter Sisten had helped Mr Lisbon install
a model of the solar system in his class.

65
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:04,552
And in return Mr Lisbon
invited him for dinner.

66
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,012
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts,...

67
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:11,141
..which we are about to receive from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

68
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,893
Amen.

69
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,688
Lux, please, put your shirt on this instant.

70
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,856
(whispers) Sorry.

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,363
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

72
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:27,282
- Ham?
- Thank you.

73
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:30,368
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- I hate peas.

74
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,744
Here.

75
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,039
(father) That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

76
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,211
- Well, thank you, honey.
- (girl) Mm, this is good.

77
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:43,423
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

78
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:48,636
Well, I don't know if I'd call myself
an enthusiast, but I like planes.

79
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,390
Ah.

80
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:56,185
Uh, Peter, are you on the football squad?

81
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:59,688
Um, no, I play it,
but I'm not actually on the team.

82
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:02,065
- Oh, I see.
- (father) Ah, not a team player.

83
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,817
Do you like to wrestle?

84
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:08,447
- (girls laugh)
- (father) You OK, Peter?

85
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,327
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to
the endangered species list today.

86
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:16,496
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

87
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,499
The turbot frog?
I don't think I've ever heard of...

88
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,835
Um, excuse me, may I use the rest room?

89
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,088
Oh, of course. The one down here
isn't working very well.

90
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:28,508
- Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.
- OK. Thanks.

91
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,784
- (knocking)
- Hold... Hold on.

92
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,329
(giggles) I thought you'd died in there.

93
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:47,001
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
I need something.

94
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,385
Do you mind?

95
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,764
(giggles)

96
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,937
- Thank you very much.
- You forgetting something?

97
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:14,194
Oh, Peter. Here's a little aerofoil
I thought you might find amusing.

98
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,237
It's a...

99
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,824
..demonstration of
Bernoulli's principle: lift.

100
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:25,997
From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.

101
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,920
Almost every day,...

102
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:35,005
..and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,...

103
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,591
..Lux would suntan wearing a swimsuit...

104
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:43,055
..that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 15-minute demonstration for free.

105
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:50,103
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home...

106
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:55,192
..Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to allow
the girls to throw the first and only party...

107
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:57,194
..of their short lives.

108
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,204
There. Is that OK?

109
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:12,166
I'm gonna get dressed.

110
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,636
- Welcome!
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

111
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,805
Come on in.

112
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,601
The party's in the basement.

113
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:37,440
Just go on round to the left,
and then down the stairs.

114
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,527
(mellow middle-of-the-road music)

115
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,997
Hi, I'm Bonaventure.

116
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,123
Hi.

117
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,250
- Hi. Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

118
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,461
Hi.

119
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,300
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

120
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,594
Thanks.

121
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,761
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,306
Thanks.

123
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:13,100
- Hi.
- Thank you.

124
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,646
- Hey.
- Hi.

125
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,648
Do you wanna sit down?

126
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,026
- Yeah.
- Me too.

127
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,507
(nervous laughter)

128
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,485
Um, how did your SATs go?

129
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,071
OK.

130
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,030
Good.

131
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,158
Do you know where you're applying yet?

132
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:17,246
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale...

133
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,414
..cos that's where my dad went.

134
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,918
That's nice.

135
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,881
You have to imagine
what it'd be like when...

136
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:32,094
..out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

137
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:35,055
And boys, I swear,
two or three years older than you...

138
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:38,976
..would be in this - the P51 B Mustang.
B for what? For bull's-eye, see?

139
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,354
You've heard of Yale?

140
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,523
Oh, yeah.

141
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,526
This punch is fantastic.

142
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,320
- Can I give you more?
- Sure. What's in it?

143
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,533
Juices. Some cherry, pineapple.

144
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,745
You know, I uh... I love pineapple.

145
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,165
Really?

146
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:17,304
This baby would come in, and this won
the war for the United Kingdom. You see?

147
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:20,348
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

148
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:25,645
And it's this kind of, uh...
this kind of equipment that makes, uh...

149
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,981
..a model work.

150
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,693
Here's Joe.

151
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,405
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

152
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:42,411
- Now, if he needs anything just call me.
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

153
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,747
Hi.

154
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,708
Hi.

155
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,212
- Joe! Good to see you. How are ya?
- Hey, Joe.

156
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,131
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

157
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,091
You're just in time.

158
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,093
Good. Hi.

159
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,096
Everyone look! His ears wiggle
if you scratch his chin.

160
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,640
(laughter)

161
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,808
Joe, sing your song.

162
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:08,187
# Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

163
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:13,317
# Oh, the monkeys have no tails
Got bitten off by whales

164
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,695
# Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

165
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,532
- (cheering)
- Good job, Joe!

166
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:23,117
(boy) Good job, Joe.

167
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,495
(# The Hollies. "The Air That I Breathe")

168
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:27,872
Where'd you learn that song?

169
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:31,417
May I be excused?

170
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:35,547
If you want to, dear, but this is your party.

171
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:42,595
Oh, all right, if you want to go upstairs,
go ahead, but we'll just...

172
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,305
We'll just have to have fun without you.

173
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,725
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

174
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,894
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

175
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,355
Joe, will you try tails?

176
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,400
Heads it is!

177
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:58,819
I'll show you again. Let's go.

178
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,529
- Heads.
- Tails.

179
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:01,905
Heads.

180
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,700
- One more time. In the air, Joe.
- Heads.

181
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,789
Heads it is anyway. One more time here.

182
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,208
- OK, call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

183
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,711
Heads. Not bad.

184
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,840
How you doin'?

185
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:22,842
Good.

186
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,888
- You picked it up really well.
- It's my favourite song.

187
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:30,016
You know, you're... very beautiful.

188
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,978
I could paint you sometime.

189
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,315
Thanks.

190
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,322
- So did they sing it to you?
- Yeah.

191
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,449
(voices and laughter)

192
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,285
(Mr Lisbon) Cecilia!

193
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,412
(startled cries)

194
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,332
Cecilia!

195
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,293
(gasps)

196
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,934
Oh, my God...

197
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,145
No! No! No! Don't look. Turn around.

198
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,398
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

199
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:24,401
Don't look. Don't... Don't look at this.

200
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,613
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

201
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:31,700
(Mrs Lisbon wails and sobs)

202
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:51,069
OK.

203
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,458
- What did he say?
- He said she was only 13.

204
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,670
(door bell)

205
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:21,974
Oh, hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

206
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:24,100
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

207
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,818
Oh, hello, Father.

208
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,447
Please, sit down.

209
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,242
Thanks.

210
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,410
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

211
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,456
Ah, no. No, thanks.

212
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,461
(gulps)

213
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,218
How about we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

214
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,428
Afraid she's under the weather.

215
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,348
(clears throat) She's not really...

216
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,892
..seeing anybody.

217
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,146
Well, she'll see her priest.

218
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:15,985
Ah! This kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

219
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,112
Every time.

220
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,823
Excuse me.

221
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,702
Father.

222
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,002
Ah! Double play... Father.

223
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,047
Double play.

224
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,279
Mrs Lisbon?

225
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,705
(knocks)

226
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,249
- May I come in?
- (girl) OK.

227
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
Hello, girls.

228
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,841
I thought we could talk.

229
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,844
Do you feel like talking?

230
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:31,390
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

231
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:43,402
Mrs Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

232
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,828
Mrs Lisbon, hello.

233
00:22:55,581 --> 00:23:01,002
I wanted you to know that
I listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

234
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:19,354
An accident waiting to happen. John said
you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

235
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,690
I know. It's so incredibly dangerous.

236
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,859
Let's give it a try.

237
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,488
Ready?

238
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:30,489
One, two, three.

239
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:37,997
(sighs) Oh, God. It's just so sad.
I can't even believe it.

240
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,166
Footings are too deep.

241
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,668
Got that chain in your truck?

242
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:49,216
(engine starts)

243
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,230
Hit it!

244
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:23,333
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,...

245
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,752
..started with Cecilia's diary.

246
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:29,380
Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant,...

247
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,757
..who had found it next to the toilet.

248
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:34,510
Tim Weiner - "the Brain" - decoded it.

249
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:36,720
Emotional instability.

250
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:40,140
Look at the i's.
The dots on 'em, they're everywhere.

251
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,727
Basically,...

252
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:45,979
..what we have here is a dreamer.

253
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,524
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

254
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:52,027
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

255
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:58,116
"Monday, February 13th.
Today we had frozen pizza."

256
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:06,624
"Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for
dinner. It's the worst. It looks like..."

257
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:12,213
"Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars."

258
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:16,092
"She made a big scene and had to
get it capped. It looks normal, I guess."

259
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:18,261
Here, give me that.

260
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,222
Told you she had a capped tooth.

261
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,273
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

262
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:34,109
Here, something about Dominic.

263
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:39,406
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof
over that rich bitch Porter."

264
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,867
"How stupid can you be?"

265
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,621
"Today we went out on the boat.
It was cold."

266
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:48,832
"We saw a couple of whales."

267
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:52,419
"Lux stroked the whale.
I didn't think they'd stink so much."

268
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:55,213
"It's the kelp in their baleens rotting."

269
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:57,674
"I hope we can go again sometime."

270
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,344
Let's read that. "Lux lost it over Kevin..."

271
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:04,347
- Is it Heines?
- "Heines, the garbage man."

272
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:07,683
(Cecilia) Lux lost it over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

273
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,729
She'd wake up at five in the morning
and hang out on the front steps -

274
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,898
..like it wasn't completely obvious.

275
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:17,026
She wrote his name in marker
on all her underwear.

276
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,570
Mom found them
and bleached out the Kevins.

277
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:21,989
Lux was crying on her bed all day.

278
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,334
The trees like lungs filling with air.

279
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,420
My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.

280
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,638
(narrator) And so we started
to learn about their lives,...

281
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:50,892
..coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

282
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:56,564
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,
the way it made your mind dreamy...

283
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,317
..so you ended up knowing
what colours went together.

284
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,445
We knew the girls
were really women in disguise,...

285
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,490
..that they understood love
and even death,...

286
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:11,370
..and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.

287
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,665
We knew that they knew
everything about us.

288
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:17,334
And that we couldn't fathom them at all.

289
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,725
Hi. Uh, Mrs Lisbon, I'm Lydia Perl.

290
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,103
I'm putting together a... Oh.

291
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,690
- Hi, I'm Bonnie. This is Mary.
- Hello, girls.

292
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:45,987
Um, I'm here to ask you
a couple of questions about Cecilia.

293
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:49,282
Yeah?

294
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:55,454
Great, great. Um, maybe you could start
by telling me a little bit about her.

295
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:00,126
Did she have any
special interests or hobbies?

296
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:04,714
- Um, she liked writing in her journal a lot.
- That is great.

297
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:08,551
Um, OK. Uh, did she...

298
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:11,344
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

299
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,930
What's going on here?

300
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:16,892
Um, you must be Mrs Lisbon.

301
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,394
I'm Lydia Perl. I'm from Channel 2, and...

302
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,563
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

303
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:26,067
The suicide of an East Side teenager
last summer...

304
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,362
..has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.

305
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:32,282
I'm in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon...

306
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:34,493
Why can't they let her rest in peace?

307
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:38,288
..and write poetry,
tragically put an end to her life.

308
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:42,208
Psychologists agree that adolescence
today is much more fraught...

309
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:45,544
..by pressures and complexities
than in years past.

310
00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:49,840
More and more doctors say this
frustration can lead to acts of violence,...

311
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:54,762
..whose reality the adolescent cannot
separate from its intended drama.

312
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:58,849
I baked a pie full of rat poison.

313
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:03,771
I thought I could eat it, you know,
without being suspicious.

314
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:08,526
My nana, who is 86...

315
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:14,447
She really liked sweets.

316
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,660
She had three pieces.

317
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,960
(woman) I feel sorriest for the mother.

318
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:30,839
(woman #2) You'd always wonder if
there was something you could've done.

319
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:34,008
- I gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then. Bye-bye.

320
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:36,135
Bye-bye. (hangs up)

321
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,254
(wind chimes tinkling)

322
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,655
Don't worry.

323
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,575
They took the fence out.

324
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,958
(birds twittering)

325
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:05,597
God, you snore loud.

326
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:08,308
(alarm buzzer)

327
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,643
Those girls have a bright future
ahead of them.

328
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:57,397
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

329
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,485
We didn't see the girls together as
a group until convocation, September 7th.

330
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:08,908
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese came to
school as though nothing had happened.

331
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,119
We felt if we looked hard enough,...

332
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:15,039
..we might begin to understand what
they were feeling and who they were.

333
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:19,626
All right, so if we have - these are
Venn diagrams, as you remember...

334
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,463
If we have A and B intersecting,...

335
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:25,632
..and A and B...

336
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,760
If A intersects B, we have this area.

337
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:34,475
And if A is the union with B, we have
all of the circle, plus the intersection.

338
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:40,606
These are the laws of
intersection and union. OK?

339
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,659
How's it going?

340
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,954
Not bad.

341
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:04,837
"Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady. "

342
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:07,882
The first one is... Ralph.

343
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:11,052
Um, he was nice.

344
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,429
It was really sad when he died.

345
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:18,976
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I just said that.

346
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,102
I am so sorry.

347
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:36,493
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,...

348
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:39,913
..I talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here...

349
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:43,708
..and realised that nothing
about this serious matter...

350
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,503
..has been discussed at this school.

351
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:49,714
Quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

352
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,676
(teacher) We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

353
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,803
Certainly better than red.

354
00:33:55,928 --> 00:34:00,724
They told us there were
80 suicides a day in America,...

355
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,726
- ..30,000 a year,...
- (all) Cheese!

356
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,272
..and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

357
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:09,066
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

358
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:13,696
Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?

359
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,157
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

360
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,077
Hi. I'm Chase.

361
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:24,289
I know who you are.

362
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:28,501
I've only been going to this school
my whole life.

363
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,713
You don't have to talk to me.

364
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:45,310
(teacher) For example, we have
two different types of economics -

365
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:50,356
..or so-called two different types.
The first one is called macroeconomics.

366
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:54,193
Look. She's laughing.

367
00:34:56,236 --> 00:35:00,991
He made her laugh! I've never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

368
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:05,746
The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest...

369
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:08,415
..and made terrible
sources of information.

370
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,834
Squeezebox is all right.

371
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,505
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl
in the school for sure.

372
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:18,467
Do you wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

373
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,220
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

374
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:24,514
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what I mean.

375
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:29,519
But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...

376
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:34,232
..was Trip Fontaine, who only
eight months before the suicides...

377
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:38,236
..had emerged from baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

378
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,906

All the girls at our school
were in love with Trip.

399
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,829
All the girls except for Lux.

400
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:18,249
Trip told us his passion for Lux started...

401
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:22,420
..when he went into the wrong
history class during fifth period.

402
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:25,882
He went out to his car
to smoke the marijuana he took...

403
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:30,552
..as regularly as Peter Petrovich,
the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

404
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:38,602
On this particular day
he ran into Mr Woodhouse...

405
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:41,104
..and ducked into the nearest class.

406
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:58,789
(Trip) She was the still point
of the turning world, man.

407
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:03,501
I never got over that girl. Never.

408
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:09,298
I mean... you know,
I loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

409
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:11,509
That was real.

410
00:38:12,218 --> 00:38:16,389
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
I didn't know what had hit me.

411
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:18,975
I didn't know what to do...

412
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:22,854
..cos it was so easy
with all the other girls,...

413
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:25,022
..but she wouldn't look at me.

414
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,275
I, uh...

415
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,903
I was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what I mean.

416
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:37,117

(documentary narrator)
The word hurricane was the name...

436
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,920
..given to nature's strongest storm.

437
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:18,799
A hurricane occurs when high pressure
and low pressure masses of air...

438
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,218
..come in contact with one another.

439
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:27,766
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

440
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,145
One mass is warm,
while the other is cold.

441
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:36,482
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

442
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:43,364
Likewise, the low pressure slides down
the sides of the high-pressure area.

443
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:48,369
They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.

444
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:54,500
In this footage, taken from
US Navy weather patrol aircraft,...

445
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:57,044
..we can clearly observe
the two masses,...

446
00:40:57,128 --> 00:41:02,133
..one high pressure and one low,
coming in contact with one another.

447
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:08,472
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength...

448
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:11,600
..that strikes with forceful determination.

449
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:22,068

the most powerful storm known to us...

515
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:36,514
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

516
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:39,601
- Ah. What position?
- Defensive cornerback.

517
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:42,145
Ah. Good. Good.

518
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:45,273
I was a... (coughs)
I was a safety in my day.

519
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:49,194
That's a crucial position, sir.
Nothing between you and the goal line.

520
00:47:49,277 --> 00:47:51,570
- Exactly! Exactly.
- (school bell)

521
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,155
Oh, well...

522
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:57,075
So the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day,...

523
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:02,080
..then afterwards we have the dance and...
all the other guys are taking dates.

524
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:06,418
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

525
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:11,048
Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

526
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,557
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what I can.

527
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,393
Thank you, sir.

528
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,189
- It's a graph.
- Oh.

529
00:48:29,982 --> 00:48:31,442
Mm.

530
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,867
Trip Fontaine and some of the...

531
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:45,748
..other boys in the football squad asked to
take the girls to the Homecoming dance.

532
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:48,584
You know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

533
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:52,880
- I'm gonna be a chaperon at the dance.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Please!

534
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,424
Your father and I will discuss it later.

535
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,139
Mr Fontaine,
may I speak with you, please?

536
00:49:03,098 --> 00:49:05,767
Now, my wife and I have had a little talk...

537
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:09,104
..and we've come to a decision
about your request.

538
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:23,702
Yes!

539
00:49:27,913 --> 00:49:31,083
- (whistle)
- I'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

540
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,295
- I need three guys to take the other girls.
- (whistle)

541
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:43,053
I'll give you three joints, Trip.

542
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:46,515
Come on, Trip, man. You pick me,
we can take my dad's Caddy.

543
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,684
You gotta pick me, Tripster!

544
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:52,480
Trip, man, you owe me.

545
00:49:52,563 --> 00:49:55,398
I saved your ass
with Woodhouse that time.

546
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,233
- (shrieks) Thanks, Dad!
- OK.

547
00:49:57,317 --> 00:49:59,986
- Who are the other boys?
- Ah, let's see.

548
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:03,406
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.
He's a very good student, dear.

549
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,201
And, uh... Kevin Head.

550
00:50:06,242 --> 00:50:08,495
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

551
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:10,663
They're just gonna raffle us off.

552
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:17,253
It made no difference which pattern
of their dream dresses the girls chose.

553
00:50:17,337 --> 00:50:21,716
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the
bust line and two to the waist and hems.

554
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:25,428
And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.

555
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:27,888
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

556
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:31,517
OK. Come on.

557
00:50:34,728 --> 00:50:38,190
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, there we go.
OK, come on, together.

558
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:41,193
- There's a leak.
- And Cheddar cheese!

559
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:47,741
I'm so excited!

560
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:10,388
- You ready?
- Let's go.

561
00:51:10,513 --> 00:51:13,224
- Ready, man.
- Let's do it.

562
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:21,566
In the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,...

563
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:24,318
..Kevin Head because
he had the killer weed...

564
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:27,280
..and Joe Hill Conley
because he won school prizes -

565
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:30,866
..which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

566
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:35,203
- Hello, boys.
- (boys) Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

567
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,330
Come in.

568
00:51:37,414 --> 00:51:39,499
(Trip) Thank you.

569
00:51:51,595 --> 00:51:54,806
- Uh, who... who... who's driving?
- I am.

570
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,017
How long have you had your licence?

571
00:51:57,142 --> 00:52:00,060
Two months, but I had
my learner's permit for a year.

572
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:03,981
We almost never let the girls
go out in cars unless it's necessary.

573
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:08,152
There's so many accidents nowadays.
I'm sure you will be very careful.

574
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:11,322
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- OK, third degree's over!

575
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:14,074
Girls!

576
00:52:16,285 --> 00:52:20,289
- I better get going. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

577
00:52:20,372 --> 00:52:22,416
Bye, dear.

578
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,794
See you later.

579
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:31,132
Girls, come on down.

580
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,135
The boys are here.

581
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:46,898
(dreamy music)

582
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:00,787
We got white ones.

583
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:05,541
We didn't know what you were wearing,
and the guy, the flower guy, said...

584
00:53:05,624 --> 00:53:08,127
..that white would go with anything, so...

585
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:11,171
I'm glad you got white.

586
00:53:12,965 --> 00:53:15,426
(Mrs Lisbon) Why don't you pin them on?

587
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:19,471
(nervous giggling)

588
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:30,482
(Mary giggling) Don't stick me!

589
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:45,455
There we go. All right. Let's do it.

590
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,625
Bye, Mom.

591
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:51,002
Bye.

592
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:03,097
Oh my gosh, look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

593
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,390
Mr Leo's having an affair with the maid.

594
00:54:05,515 --> 00:54:07,976
I saw him follow her
into the laundry room.

595
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:11,980
- Eugh! He's so fat, and that red nose.
- Totally an alcoholic.

596
00:54:12,063 --> 00:54:14,608
What about the Hessens?
You know they're Nazis.

597
00:54:14,691 --> 00:54:16,651
They're Nazi sympathisers, Bonnie.

598
00:54:16,777 --> 00:54:21,281
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

599
00:54:21,782 --> 00:54:25,660
Nice aluminum siding(!)
Do they really think that looks OK?

600
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:29,080
Mr Kriegers ordered that
from TV late at night.

601
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:34,294
- It's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.
- I have never seen them barbecue on it.

602
00:54:34,377 --> 00:54:37,421
Actually it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy "the Shark".

603
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:41,759
- Leads to a river where he has his boat.
- Yeah. Paul goes there all the time.

604
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:45,012
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

605
00:54:45,137 --> 00:54:47,181
- No way.
- Yeah.

606
00:54:47,598 --> 00:54:49,475
Cool.

607
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,407
- (Bonnie) Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, I got mints.

608
00:55:06,616 --> 00:55:08,827
He'll smell it on your clothes.

609
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,664
I'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

610
00:55:14,082 --> 00:55:15,959
Don't let it die a virgin.

611
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:18,920

- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

01:01:20,812 --> 01:01:24,315
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

687
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:28,236
My dad.

688
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:31,948
Just tell him you had to put
the crown in your locker.

689
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,244
- Hey, see that divot there?
- Uh-huh.

690
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:40,206
That's where I reamed this guy today
in a cross-body block.

691
01:01:40,748 --> 01:01:42,834
- Really?
- (growls)

692
01:01:44,502 --> 01:01:48,047
- (Parkie) Maybe they went with your dad.
- I doubt it.

693
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:52,634
- We're cooked.
- Luxie is. We're not.

694
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,430
(panting)

695
01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:13,405
Does anyone have any mints?

696
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:15,991
- Sorry.
- No.

697
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:22,872
Bye, Parkie.

698
01:02:24,999 --> 01:02:28,335
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

699
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:30,880
Why not?

700
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:33,007
Just don't.

701
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:36,552
OK.

702
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:39,889
Will you call me?

703
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:42,057
Uh, absolutely.

704
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:49,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
01:02:49,523 --> 01:02:51,400
Bye.

706
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:00,883
(birds cheeping)

707
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:32,555
(Mrs Lisbon) Where have you been?

708
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,894
Get in!

709
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:49,280
(adult Trip)
I walked home alone that night.

710
01:05:49,364 --> 01:05:52,158
I didn't care how she got home.
It was weird.

711
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:56,955
I mean, I liked her, I liked her a lot,
but out there on the field...

712
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,251
It was just different then.

713
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:07,548
That was the last time I saw her.

714
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:14,263
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

715
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:17,182
But at least I tasted it once, right?

716
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,607
It's time for your
six o'clock group meeting.

717
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:44,917
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

718
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,044
(door shuts)

719
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,922
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

720
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,009
The girls were taken out of school...

721
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:57,221
..and Mrs Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.

722
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,309
She had done more than
just take the girls out of school.

723
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:05,687
That Sunday,
arriving home from a church sermon,...

724
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,774
..Mrs Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.

725
01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:10,734
Now!

726
01:07:10,817 --> 01:07:12,903
(sobs) But, Mom!

727
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:15,280
This is final, Luxie.

728
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:18,909
- It's not fair!
- I said now!

729
01:07:21,661 --> 01:07:23,705
(sighs)

730
01:07:36,217 --> 01:07:38,302
Now, Luxie!

731
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:53,317
Come on.

732
01:07:53,442 --> 01:07:55,528
Hold on.

733
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:01,784
Kiss! Please don't make me do this.

734
01:08:01,867 --> 01:08:03,952
Burn it.

735
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,544
(coughs)

736
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:18,341
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith!

737
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:21,136
- Come on. Don't make me burn this.
- No.

738
01:08:22,846 --> 01:08:24,889
(girl) What's that smell?

739
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:30,395
It's all right. That'll do for now.
Give me these. Give me these.

740
01:08:31,146 --> 01:08:33,231
I'll put them in the trash.

741
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:42,573
(coughs)

742
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,419
(chain saw revs)

743
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:07,305
(men whoop)

744
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:14,479
This was the time we began to see Lux
making love on the roof...

745
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:16,397
..with random boys and men.

746
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:18,983
- Is she naked?
- You can't tell. Hold on.

747
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:21,152
Well, get it focused.

748
01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:25,615
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

749
01:09:26,282 --> 01:09:29,952
- They're rolling around up there.
- Let me see. Let me see.

750
01:09:30,036 --> 01:09:34,123
Hold on. And she's on him and
he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

751
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:38,043
- Come on, let me look.
- No, it's my... It's my telescope, Chase!

752
01:09:38,168 --> 01:09:40,962
- (laughs)
- Yes, and what else?

753
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:45,884
Our male up there
seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform!

754
01:09:47,928 --> 01:09:52,224
That Burger Chalet - you never think
those guys ever get lucky.

755
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:55,852
She turns to me and asks me
if I thought what we'd done was dirty.

756
01:09:55,936 --> 01:09:58,230
I knew what to say. I said no.

757
01:09:58,313 --> 01:10:01,316
Then she grabs my hand
and goes "You like me, don't you?"

758
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,237
I didn't say anything.
It's best to keep chicks guessing.

759
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,532
(woman) Chase, honey!
Come practise your violin before dinner!

760
01:10:12,076 --> 01:10:16,247
You're not gonna believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

761
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:19,458
- Her hands are moving down.
- I gotta see this!

762
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:23,587
- This is beautiful.
- No, no. She's on top of him.

763
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,465
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

764
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:30,094
Now they're done, he's getting up.

765
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:34,932
- That's it?
- Popcorn.

766
01:10:35,015 --> 01:10:36,475
That was quick.

767
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,234
(mutters)

768
01:10:50,488 --> 01:10:53,742
Ooh, good morning!
Good morning (mumbles plant name)

769
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,703
Have we photosynthesised
breakfast today?

770
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:07,672
(mutters)

771
01:11:07,756 --> 01:11:09,799
Hello, Ronald.

772
01:11:10,467 --> 01:11:12,134
Hi, Eric.

773
01:11:12,217 --> 01:11:15,679
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

774
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,933
You checked out back?

775
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:27,191
(woman) They found a new math teacher.

776
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:31,195
- Well, he's gonna have to get another job.
- I know.

777
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:36,158
(sighs) How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

778
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:59,472
- Just go away. This is our tree.
- Girls!

779
01:11:59,555 --> 01:12:03,142
Girls, it's a little late. This tree is dead.

780
01:12:03,226 --> 01:12:06,896
- Why not leave it up to nature?
- If we did, there'd be no trees left.

781
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:09,690
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

782
01:12:09,774 --> 01:12:13,318
If boats hadn't brought the fungus,
this wouldn't have happened.

783
01:12:13,402 --> 01:12:15,695
OK? Let's go.

784
01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:19,032
No?

785
01:12:19,491 --> 01:12:21,368
All right. That's it.

786
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:25,664
I have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

787
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:30,460
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- It had yellow leaves. The tree is dead.

788
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:33,880
Our daughter said Aritex is
a less aggressive therapy.

789
01:12:33,964 --> 01:12:37,801
It doesn't work. I leave that tree,
they'll all be gone by next year.

790
01:12:37,884 --> 01:12:40,095
Will be anyway, way things are going!

791
01:12:40,178 --> 01:12:42,472
I don't want to call the police.

792
01:12:42,514 --> 01:12:47,601
Our daughters are standing on their own
front lawn. Since when is that a crime?

793
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:50,938
Right.

794
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:52,898
(Mr Lisbon) Uh...

795
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,621
Clive, did you see those girls in the
nighties? That's the shot that I want, OK?

796
01:13:07,705 --> 01:13:10,666
Honey, move forward.
I want those girls in the nighties.

797
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,253
Oh, God. OK.
Here, let's just back up a little bit.

798
01:13:16,588 --> 01:13:18,673
There you go. Is that good? OK?

799
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:23,553
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the East Side teenager...

800
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:27,891
..whose suicide last summer focused
awareness on a national problem,...

801
01:13:27,974 --> 01:13:34,064
..put their own lives in jeopardy by trying
to protect the elm that Cecilia so loved.

802
01:13:34,147 --> 01:13:36,232
(chain saws buzz)

803
01:14:26,364 --> 01:14:29,367
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

804
01:14:31,786 --> 01:14:35,456
Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.

805
01:14:40,461 --> 01:14:42,880
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

806
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,385
(Trip) You're a stone fox.

807
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:56,184
The girls' only contact with the outside...

808
01:14:56,268 --> 01:15:00,105
..was through catalogues they ordered
that filled their mailbox...

809
01:15:00,188 --> 01:15:05,861
..with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.

810
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:08,613
Unable to go anywhere,...

811
01:15:08,697 --> 01:15:12,617
..the girls travelled in their imaginations
to Siamese temples...

812
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:17,831
..or passed an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

813
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:22,460
We ordered the same catalogues...

814
01:15:22,543 --> 01:15:26,672
..and, flipping through the pages,
we hiked through passes with the girls,...

815
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:31,010
..stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks,...

816
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,305
..placing our hands
on their warm, moist shoulders...

817
01:15:34,388 --> 01:15:37,266
..and gazing of fat papaya sunsets.

818
01:15:38,893 --> 01:15:41,645
We drank tea with them
in a water pavilion.

819
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:44,565
We did whatever we wanted.

820
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,862
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

821
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:55,492
The only way
we could feel close to the girls...

822
01:15:55,575 --> 01:16:00,538
..was through these impossible trips
which have scarred us forever,...

823
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:04,125
..making us happier
with dreams than wives.

824
01:16:06,086 --> 01:16:11,132
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.

825
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:13,259
But they were slipping away.

826
01:16:13,676 --> 01:16:18,848
The colour of their eyes was fading, along
with the locations of moles and dimples.

827
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:21,017
From five they had become four,...

828
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:25,813
..and they were all living in the dead,
becoming shadows.

829
01:16:25,896 --> 01:16:29,483
We'd have lost them completely
if they hadn't contacted us.

830
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:31,693
OK, one long,...

831
01:16:32,403 --> 01:16:34,363
..two short...

832
01:16:34,988 --> 01:16:37,116
- ..and one long.
- Mm-hm.

833
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,951
You got that? That's it.

834
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:44,498
"Help."

835
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:47,042
"Send...

836
01:16:48,252 --> 01:16:50,170
..bo...

837
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:51,755
..bo."

838
01:16:53,715 --> 01:16:55,216
- Bo-bo?
- Bo-bo.

839
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:58,344
That's what it says: bo-bo.

840
01:16:58,428 --> 01:17:02,724
"Help send bo-bo"?
I thought you knew Morse code.

841
01:17:31,168 --> 01:17:33,253
Something here for you.

842
01:17:41,011 --> 01:17:43,096
I got one, too.

843
01:17:45,474 --> 01:17:48,393
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

844
01:17:48,477 --> 01:17:52,647
Tom Faheem suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house,...

845
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:54,940
..but that had logistical problems.

846
01:17:55,066 --> 01:17:58,361
In the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to work out.

847
01:17:58,944 --> 01:18:00,988
We called them on the telephone.

848
01:18:01,364 --> 01:18:03,032
727...

849
01:18:03,115 --> 01:18:06,202
- ..8221 .
- 8221 .

850
01:18:06,327 --> 01:18:08,621
(whispers) Get ready.

851
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:13,209
- (Mary) Hello?
- Go!

852
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:18,130
(Todd Rundgren) # Hello, it's me

853
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,679
# I've thought about us
for a long, long time

854
01:18:25,805 --> 01:18:27,889
Call us. 727 0487.

855
01:18:33,353 --> 01:18:35,814
- (phone rings)
- Shit! It's them.

856
01:18:41,403 --> 01:18:44,447
(Gilbert O'Sullivan)
# To think that only yesterday

857
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:46,991
# I was cheerful, bright and gay

858
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:49,744
# Looking forward to - who wouldn't do? -

859
01:18:49,828 --> 01:18:52,622
# The role I was about to play

860
01:18:52,706 --> 01:18:55,375
# But in my hour of need

861
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:58,001
# I truly am indeed

862
01:18:58,085 --> 01:19:00,045
# Alone again

863
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:02,089
# Naturally

864
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:08,262
(The Bee Gees)
# Run to me whenever you're lonely

865
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:14,601
# Run to me if you need a shoulder

866
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:21,275
# Now and then you need someone older

867
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:23,652
# So darling

868
01:19:23,777 --> 01:19:27,448
(Carole King) # So far away

869
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:33,786
# Doesn't anybody stay
in one place any more?

870
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:40,084
# It would be so fine
to see your face at my door

871
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:48,217
# Doesn't help to know you're just far

872
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:50,386
# Away

873
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:52,555
I gotta go home. See ya tomorrow.

874
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,099
I'll see you later.

875
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:02,189
- (Lux) We're suffocating.
- (Mrs Lisbon) You're safe here.

876
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:04,149
I can't breathe in here.

877
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:07,944
No answer.

878
01:20:29,841 --> 01:20:32,343
- (Tim) What time is it?
- (Chase) Any time now.

879
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,388
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

880
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,644
(Tim) Yeah, it's them.

881
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:44,647
(all) Let's go!

882
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,619
(whispers) I have keys to my mom's car.

883
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:08,920
- (clatter)
- Shh!

884
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:24,769
Maybe we should knock.

885
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:28,189
(knocks)

886
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:31,776
We're here.

887
01:21:42,202 --> 01:21:44,246
About time.

888
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:46,415
We've been waiting for you guys.

889
01:21:46,957 --> 01:21:50,377
We got a car, a full tank.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

890
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:52,838
It's just a Cougar, but it's got a big trunk.

891
01:21:53,338 --> 01:21:55,090
Can I sit up front?

892
01:21:56,633 --> 01:21:58,093
Sure.

893
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:04,057
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

894
01:22:05,433 --> 01:22:07,101
Where are your parents?

895
01:22:08,019 --> 01:22:09,479
Asleep.

896
01:22:09,562 --> 01:22:12,982
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

897
01:22:13,816 --> 01:22:16,277
Come on, it's getting late.

898
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:21,574
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

899
01:22:21,657 --> 01:22:25,411
They take for ever.
My mom's an insomniac.

900
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,251
We better take our car.
There's more room.

901
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,213
Think you can handle a station wagon?

902
01:22:37,297 --> 01:22:40,342
Sure. It's not a stick, is it?

903
01:22:40,425 --> 01:22:42,928
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

904
01:22:43,178 --> 01:22:46,515
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

905
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,143
But maybe we should go.
I heard somethin'. Could be your mom.

906
01:22:50,894 --> 01:22:52,979
Come on in.

907
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:07,118
I'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

908
01:23:25,219 --> 01:23:27,304
(girls giggling)

909
01:23:32,476 --> 01:23:34,687
(humming)

910
01:23:39,274 --> 01:23:41,192
(thud)

911
01:24:03,256 --> 01:24:07,218
These girls are making me crazy.
If I could feel one of 'em up just once...

912
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,514
What?

913
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:18,354
(creaking)

914
01:24:18,437 --> 01:24:20,522
(hissing)

915
01:24:29,907 --> 01:24:33,243
We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.

916
01:24:33,744 --> 01:24:35,829
We argue about it still.

917
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:42,794
Most likely Bonnie had died while we
were waiting in the living room,...

918
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,962
..dreaming of highways.

919
01:24:46,005 --> 01:24:49,175
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

920
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:54,514
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

921
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:57,141
Lux was the last to go.

922
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,310
(engine running)

923
01:25:00,937 --> 01:25:02,855
(coughs)

924
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:11,279
It's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

925
01:25:11,363 --> 01:25:14,491
(reporters' voices overlapping)

926
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,124
(babble of voices)

927
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:30,882
This has been Lydia Perl
with Channel 8 News.

928
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,644
(Mrs Lisbon) None of my daughters
lacked for any love.

929
01:25:45,104 --> 01:25:47,898
There was plenty of love in our house.

930
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:52,028
I never understood why...

931
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:29,606
After the suicide free-for-all the Lisbons
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

932
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:34,652
They had Mr Hedlie pack up the house,...

933
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:37,906
..selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

934
01:26:40,241 --> 01:26:42,744
Mr Lisbon put the house on the market...

935
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:45,746
..and it was sold to
a young couple from Boston.

936
01:26:46,372 --> 01:26:50,376
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

937
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,086
(clock ticking)

938
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:58,300
We had pieces of the puzzle, but however
we put them together, gaps remained -

939
01:26:59,009 --> 01:27:02,763
..oddly shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them...

940
01:27:02,888 --> 01:27:05,224
..like countries we couldn't name.

941
01:27:08,644 --> 01:27:15,274
What lingered after them was not life,
but the most trivial list of mundane facts.

942
01:27:18,444 --> 01:27:20,613
..a clock ticking on the wall,...

943
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,117
..a room dim at noon,...

944
01:27:25,243 --> 01:27:29,831
..the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

945
01:27:34,502 --> 01:27:38,256
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

946
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:48,223
Our parents seemed
better able to do this,...

947
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:51,560
..returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises...

948
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:54,813
..as though they'd seen this all before.

949
01:27:55,272 --> 01:28:00,610
It was full-fledged summer again, over
a year since Cecilia had slit her wrists,...

950
01:28:00,694 --> 01:28:03,280
..spreading the poison in the air.

951
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:06,575
A spill at the plant
increased the phosphates in the lake...

952
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:10,996
..and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,...

953
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:13,623
..infiltrating the genteel mansions.

954
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:18,461
Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season...

955
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:21,505
..everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

956
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:25,676
The O'Conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution...

957
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,014
..of making the theme of their daughter
Alice's debutante party "Asphyxiation".

958
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:34,060
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

959
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,438
(woman) She'll give him a heart attack!

960
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,530
(muffled voices)

961
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,968
(muffled voices)

962
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,608
Hi, Parkie.

963
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,027
(vomits)

964
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,407
Al's got the acting bug, you know.

965
01:29:33,075 --> 01:29:35,369
- She caught it from Pinkie.
- (laughter)

966
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,707
And I want to announce tonight
that next fall...

967
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:43,168
..Alice is going to
a little school in New Haven(!)

968
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:45,838
(laughter)

969
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:49,216
I hear they have
a great drama school out there.

970
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:53,511
- In fact, Sam, didn't your father build it?
- That's the law school.

971
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:59,017
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

972
01:29:59,392 --> 01:30:01,477
(all toast)

973
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:09,360
I've had it.

974
01:30:09,444 --> 01:30:11,654
Goodbye, cruel world.

975
01:30:17,744 --> 01:30:20,538
No, no, no, you don't understand me!

976
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:23,123
I'm a teenager. I got problems!

977
01:30:23,915 --> 01:30:26,001
(laughter)

978
01:30:33,717 --> 01:30:36,636
So much has been said
about the girls over the years.

979
01:30:39,431 --> 01:30:41,933
But we have never found an answer.

980
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:47,814
It didn't matter in the end
how old they had been,...

981
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:51,526
..or that they were girls.

982
01:30:53,903 --> 01:30:56,781
But only that we had loved them,...

983
01:30:56,864 --> 01:30:59,367
..and that they hadn't heard us calling,...

984
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:03,579
..still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...

985
01:31:03,663 --> 01:31:06,582
..where they went to be alone
for all time,...

986
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,338
..and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.
