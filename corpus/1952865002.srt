1
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:45,206
You have one new message.

2
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,572
Hello, Mary, this is Harris

3
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,939
l'm just reminding you
l have a class tonight.

4
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,539
l'll be out at eight.
l'll call you then.

5
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,738
What time is your class?

6
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,270
Seven.

7
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,204
You come home aftewards?

8
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,172
l don't know. l may be seeing Mary.

9
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,938
You haven't seen her this week.

10
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:14,870
No.

11
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:21,874
No. She's been busy. l've been busy.

12
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,805
Her mama says she's seeing someone else.

13
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,770
He lives in Raleigh.

14
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,503
They don't like him.

15
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,937
-Do they know him?
-No.

16
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,735
Well how do they know
they don't like him?

17
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,302
They like you.

18
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:44,269
They like her to go steady with you.

19
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:50,171
You used to go steady. In high school.

20
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,002
Well, we're not in high school now.

21
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,802
You don't think going to law
school at night is too much for you?

22
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,468
l don't think so, Mama.

23
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,669
l don't want to be a cop
for the rest of my life.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,936
A law degree will do you no
good if your health is ruined.

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,934
l've got to go, Mama.

26
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:29,337
This house was built
in 1923 by my father.

27
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:33,970
He had built the first of his
tobacco warehouses by that time.. .

28
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,001
buying and selling tobacco.

29
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,402
And early on, he became rich doing it.

30
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,167
My father was his own auctioneer.

31
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,833
And he was known as a superb one.

32
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:52,268
His idol was James Buchanan Duke.

33
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:57,736
His ambition was to be
as rich as Mister Duke.

34
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:05,770
When l was born, he wanted he named
after Mister Duke's daughter, Doris.. .

35
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,465
but my mother said no.

36
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:17,071
Here's a picture of Mister
Duke and his daughter, Doris.

37
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:20,767
And over here is a
picture of me and my papa.

38
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:26,134
-Did you ever meet the Dukes?
-No. My papa did, of course.

39
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,465
And l never got tired
of hearing about them.

40
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,998
Especially Doris.

41
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:42,572
l used to collect every picture and
article about her l could find.. .

42
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:44,730
Later,

43
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:50,501
when growing and selling tobacco
got to be a losing proposition.. .

44
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:54,298
everybody including
my papa was wiped out.

45
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,996
Except the Dukes.

46
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:00,730
l asked my papa about that one time and

47
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,231
he said, well that's
because they're Dukes.

48
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,063
What did he mean by that?

49
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,098
He meant, l suppose that
they were invincible.

50
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:12,464
Of course they weren't. Is anybody?

51
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:20,365
They told me at the office that you
were thinking about selling the house.

52
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:24,531
Well, that's the right idea,
but l go back and forth about it.

53
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:29,065
lt is expensive to keep
up, the taxes are high,

54
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,729
and it's much too large for one person.

55
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,328
But l've lived here all my life.

56
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,361
And when l think about leaving.. .

57
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:41,927
l just can't.

58
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,627
You have the warehouse, too.

59
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,861
That's still in good
condition, l'm told.

60
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,795
Yeah, that holds up pretty well.

61
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,997
l've been renting it out, which doesn't
make me rich. But it does pay the taxes.

62
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:00,128
lf you decide to sell your house
or warehouse, will you let me know?

63
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,826
l will. l certainly will.

64
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,526
-Councilman Early.
-Yes, Mister Mayor.

65
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,660
Anything to report on
our downtown project?

66
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:39,661
What about those men that bought all
those Liggett & Meyers warehouses?

67
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:42,493
l'm always hearing about how someday
they're going to tear them down.. .

68
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:46,728
or turn them into apartment houses or
something, and then another year goes by.

69
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,991
We keep in touch with
them, but so far.. .

70
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:53,128
l drop in on them from time to time
and ask if there's any progress.

71
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,258
And what do they say?

72
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:58,460
That you can't rush a
project as big as this.

73
00:06:58,523 --> 00:07:02,126
But ten years? It's almost
been ten years, hasn't it?

74
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,691
More than that. And now this economy?

75
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,992
How to get people to move back
into the city is the problem.

76
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,591
There are no stores left

77
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,525
so eveybody's moving
out to be near the malls.

78
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:14,723
lt's a shame.

79
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,525
What about the Thanksgiving
Day Parade for downtown?

80
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,190
Are we going to repeat it this year?

81
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,358
Or have a Christmas
parade in December instead.

82
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:28,024
Time is getting short if we intend
to have a Thanksgiving parade.

83
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,323
Well, to be brutally honest,

84
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,424
l don't know if a parade of
any kind will get us anywhere.

85
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,356
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years.

86
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,491
Last year, the attendance was pitiful.

87
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:43,024
l couldn't even get my own kids to go.

88
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,089
Do we have to make a decision tonight?

89
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,623
Can't we postpone this
till our ne_ meeting?

90
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:53,423
l personally would like a
little time to think it over.

91
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:55,421
That's okay with me.

92
00:07:56,321 --> 00:08:00,558
Do l hear a motion that we postpone
any decision until ne_ week?

93
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:01,888
l so move.

94
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:04,956
-All in favor?
-&ye.

95
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,718
-Hi, Harris.
-Mary.

96
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,051
l was just about to call you.

97
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,687
l made reservations for
tonight. You said you'd be free.

98
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,420
l know. l'm sorry. l already
made a date for tonight.

99
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,119
l'm sorry. A friend from work.

100
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,118
l miss seeing you, Mary.

101
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,420
-l miss seeing you, too.
-Have a good night.

102
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,117
You look pretty.

103
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:23,117
Doesn't she look pretty, Frank?

104
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,284
She always does.

105
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:27,617
Thank you.

106
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,251
What time is he picking you up?

107
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:33,285
His name's Howard, Frank.
He's not picking me up.

108
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,783
l'm meeting him at a restaurant halfway

109
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,450
between here and Raleigh.

110
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,617
lt's driving me crazy.

111
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:51,185
She lets him treat her any old way.

112
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:55,316
l bet she ends up marrying him.

113
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:56,882
Why do you say that?

114
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,315
You don't know that.

115
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,248
l do know that.

116
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,017
Sometimes l think l lose
my mind from worrying.

117
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,748
-Can l help you?
-Hi. Reservation for Howard Mercer.

118
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:42,182
Oh, he's not arrived yet.
May l seat you at his table?

119
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,280
Hi, this is Mary. Leave a message.

120
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:11,014
Hello, Mary. This is Harris again.

121
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,713
Are you free tomorrow night?

122
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,279
Please forgive me for being late.

123
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:32,513
Something came up at the last minute.

124
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,311
Anything good?

125
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:38,412
Looks like it. l'm just getting a salad.

126
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,045
Do you want a drink?

127
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,912
Oh. No, thanks. l had a Coke.

128
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:49,511
Have you thought any more
about moving to Raleigh?

129
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,443
Honestly, no.

130
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,711
Will you promise me
you'll think about it?

131
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:57,844
Yes, l will.

132
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:08,777
l thought l heard you
come in. Did you call Mary?

133
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:10,375
Yeah.

134
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:16,910
How much longer are you
going to study, Harris?

135
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:20,111
Not much longer, Mama.
You go on back to bed.

136
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,879
Mrs. Taylor told me yesterday that
the law was very competitive.. .

137
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:29,344
and that it was important to go to
certain schools to get your degree.

138
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,175
l went to the only school
l could afford, Mama.

139
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,710
She said lawyers here
are a dime a dozen.. .

140
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,943
and are having a hard time
just like everybody else.

141
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,310
Mama, go on to bed now. l
want to finish my studying.

142
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,342
l worry so about you.

143
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:47,610
l know you do. l wish you wouldn't.

144
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,509
l'm gonna be all right.

145
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,341
You're all l have, Harris.

146
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,207
That's not so, Mama.

147
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:04,641
You have Pete.

148
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:07,007
But where is Pete?

149
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,241
Wandering around the world?

150
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,774
When was the last time l saw Pete?

151
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,441
Please go to bed now, Harris. It's late.

152
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,808
l worry about you staying up so late.

153
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,807
Yes, Ma'am. l'm going
to bed in a little.

154
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:29,673
Promise me.

155
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:31,839
l promise.

156
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,037
-Auntie?
-Willa?

157
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:23,337
Were you in bed?

158
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,903
Is something wrong?

159
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:29,639
-No, no, l 'm all right.
-Oh, thank goodness.

160
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:35,408
Well, to tell you the truth,
l feel a little uneasy.

161
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:40,706
-Is there any reason?
-No, no apparent reason. l just.. .

162
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,502
You want me to come over?

163
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,503
Oh, l hate to ask you,

164
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,969
but l would appreciate it.

165
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,870
l'll come right away.

166
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:51,769
Thank you, precious.

167
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,569
You damn fool. Do you want
to burn this barn down?

168
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,669
l told you it's in my contract there
is to be no smoking in this warehouse.

169
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,135
lf you want to smoke, you go outside.

170
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,702
Excuse me. l'm a little jumpy tonight.

171
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,269
The Company would like to
establish themselves here.

172
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,634
lf we help them to do that,

173
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,201
they will look favorably on all of us.

174
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,968
How did you find this warehouse?

175
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,000
Luck.

176
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,234
The Company sent me to look for towns

177
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:42,369
or cities that might
benefit from our services

178
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,900
Durham was on my list.

179
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:49,902
And when l came here l found all
these empty tobacco warehouses.

180
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,001
l took pictures of them, and l sent
the pictures back to the powers that be.

181
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,301
And they got in touch with me and
told me to try to rent this warehouse.

182
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,870
The owner was anxious to rent, as long as we
understood that no smoking was allowed here.

183
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,334
She had seen a number of warehouses
set on fire by careless smokers.

184
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,966
And l don't want the two of you speaking

185
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,132
anything but Spanish
while we're in Durham

186
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,732
Anybody ask you a question in English,

187
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:19,565
pretend you don't understand.

188
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,266
Yeah, what if they ask
those questions in Spanish?

189
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:25,598
Come and get me.

190
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,031
l'll answer.

191
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,765
The Company wants me
to do all the talking.

192
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:52,429
Where's Mama?

193
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,598
She went to bed with a sick
headache worrying about you.

194
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:01,098
She's afraid you'll be
swept off your feet like

195
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,630
she was and marry the wrong person.

196
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:05,097
Who said anything about getting married?

197
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,130
Where did you meet
this... what's his name?

198
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,430
-Howard.
-Where did you meet him?

199
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,097
He's a lamer.. .at the firm.

200
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,963
Why don't you bring him by the
house some time so we can meet him?

201
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:21,197
Your mama thinks you're ashamed of us.

202
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:23,096
l'm not ashamed of you.

203
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,562
Well, your mama thinks so.

204
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,329
Well, l'm not.

205
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,629
Your mama likes Harris.

206
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,528
l like Harris.

207
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,429
His mama says he's going to
law school just to please you.

208
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:04,627
Auntie?

209
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:12,893
Auntie?

210
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,796
Isn't this the craziest
you ever heard of?

211
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,694
A woman as old as

212
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,527
l am... here alone most of my life...

213
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,660
is suddenly in a panic.

214
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,460
l am so ashamed.

215
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,760
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

216
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,826
l'm here now and you're perfectly safe.

217
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:39,426
Well, God bless ya.

218
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,227
-Auntie?
-Yes, Ma'am.

219
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:58,059
Who did you rent your warehouse to?

220
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:02,659
l don't remember his
name. He seemed very nice.

221
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,658
-Why?
-Was he a Mexican, Ma'am?

222
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,858
l don't think so. Why?

223
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:11,359
Because when l was passing
your warehouse just now.. .

224
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,827
There were two Mexican men in front.. .

225
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,691
sitting in chairs, smoking
cigarettes and drinking beer.

226
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,659
Oh my heavens. l
particularly made a point

227
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,193
in telling him smoking in or around
the warehouse was absolutely forbidden

228
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,325
l think l'm going to call him right
now and makes sure he understands that.

229
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:33,958
-lt's twelve o'clock, Auntie.
-Well l'll wake him up.

230
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:36,323
l feel very strongly about this.

231
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:47,755
Please leave a message.

232
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,455
This is Georgiana Carr.

233
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:55,959
Have Mr. Leroy.. .call me
immediately when he gets this message.

234
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,389
it's about my warehouse.

235
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,657
l got his answering service.

236
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:07,523
His name is Leroy. l'll have
it out with him in the morning.

237
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,088
Did he pay you by check?

238
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:16,689
-Uh, no. Cash.
-Cash?

239
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,222
Yes, that's the way he wanted it.

240
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,590
Oh, l'm exhausted. Are you tired?

241
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:26,387
Yes, Ma'am.

242
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,853
You have one new message.

243
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,454
Hello, Mary. This is Harris again.

244
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,085
Are you free tomorrow night?

245
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:38,118
Sit down. l have your
breakfast ready in a minute.

246
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:39,450
l can't. l m late.

247
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:41,517
l overslept.

248
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:08,583
Good morning. Who's in charge here?

249
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:09,482
No comprendo.

250
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,218
Is Mr. Leroy in the warehouse?

251
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:33,815
What is Mr. Leroy's first name?

252
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,282
l don t know. He just
said, ''Leroy speaking''.

253
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:38,415
He didn't say if it was first or last.

254
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:40,882
-He didn't say if it was first or last.
-How do you know that?

255
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:44,516
He told me. From near
Brownsville, l think he said.

256
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,347
The town's called Vernon.

257
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,882
Let's go into town and
bring the police out here.

258
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:56,714
Gus Leroy. Thank you for seeing me.

259
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,314
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

260
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,747
l'm with the Environmental
Services Corporation.

261
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:05,747
In Vernon, Texas, we have
a thriving business there.

262
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:07,447
And in Gilyas, Louisiana.

263
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:09,112
What is it you do?

264
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,947
l'm in the business
of disposal of waste.

265
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:11,746
We go around the county.. .

266
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,347
looking for firms in
need of our service.

267
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,913
-Do you know how many pounds...
-What do you want from me?

268
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:18,314
l have very little authority
Actually, quite the opposite.

269
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:21,981
l'm not asking you for anything.
Do you know Miss Georgiana Carr?

270
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,446
-Yes.
-You know of her warehouse?

271
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,913
-Yes.
-l just rented that for six months.

272
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:27,312
Your company?

273
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,246
Yes sir. l did. For my company.

274
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,212
What do you intend to do with it?

275
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,380
We just, last night,
placed fifty canisters...

276
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:35,812
of hazardous waste there.

277
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:39,714
Good god. Does Miss Georgiana know this?

278
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:41,579
Well, we tried to tell her
when we leased the space.. .

279
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:43,512
but she was never
interested or concerned ...

280
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,379
with what the tenants put
in her warehouse, she said.

281
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:48,479
-Is it legal what you're doing?
-Yes, sir. We checked very thoroughly.

282
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,778
There are no environmental
laws in the City of Durham.. .

283
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,045
or the State of North
Carolina that we are breaking.

284
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:54,344
Please don't be alarmed.

285
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,945
The waste is transported in
the kind of canisters approved

286
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,611
by all Federal agencies.

287
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,111
-When did you get in?
-Last night.

288
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,812
l travel usually at night. Less traffic.

289
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,912
Anyway, l won't take
up more of your time.

290
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:11,211
One day, I'd like to discuss a plan.

291
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,743
My company would like
you to think about.

292
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,545
-Is this about hazardous waste?
-In a sense.

293
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:19,476
Oh, l don't know, sir.

294
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,776
We're very conservative here.

295
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,577
l don’t think we're ready
for anything like that.

296
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:27,544
l understand. But remember this.

297
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,377
Someone has to address the problem

298
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,576
if all categories of
waste continue to grow.

299
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:35,477
Someone has to take responsibility
to find a solution to this problem.

300
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,076
Our plant in Vernon,

301
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,143
Texas, has rejuvenated a dying town

302
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:40,676
And from all l've observed here,

303
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,676
l'm confident it could
be the same for Durham.

304
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,143
We have no unemployment
in Vernon now.. .

305
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:47,643
And it's shrinking every day
in our... plant in Louisiana.

306
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,909
-No unemployment?
-No.

307
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,708
Mr. Mayor, l hate to interrupt you,

308
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,741
-but your next appointment is here.
-Thank you.

309
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,376
-We'll talk about this later, Mr....
-Gus. Gus Leroy.

310
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:04,410
l think you should know
that Durham is one.. .

311
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,909
of several cities in the South where my
company's considering opening a branch

312
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:11,110
Thank you for telling me. l will
be in touch with you very soon.

313
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,840
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

314
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,808
-l want to file a complaint.
-Yes, Ma'am.

315
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:32,575
My aunt here has a warehouse.. .

316
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,207
near her property which
she rents out for storage.

317
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:39,810
And she just recently rented it out to
a Mr. Leroy from Brownsville, Texas...

318
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,740
at which time he gave her
cash payments for six months

319
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:44,372
Excuse me, Willa.

320
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:49,342
l don't believe Mr. Leroy
is from Brownsville, Texas.

321
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:53,308
He's from Vernon, which
is near Brownsville.

322
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:58,741
Well, wherever he's from, he gave
her cash payments for six months.

323
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:01,707
He has two Mexican men
guarding the property.

324
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,673
Who don't speak English,
or pretend they don't.

325
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,371
And when we went over
there this morning.. .

326
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,906
-What was his name?
-Whose?

327
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,972
The man your aunt is
renting the property to.

328
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,204
l told you. Leroy.

329
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,239
Is that the first name or the last one?

330
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:19,071
l don't know. And my
aunt doesn't either.

331
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,004
Now, what would you like me to do?

332
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:27,305
Have someone go over to the warehouse.

333
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,505
And tell Mr. Leroy and his men...

334
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,738
That Miss Carr has the right

335
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:38,073
to inspect her warehouse
any time she wishes

336
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,807
And there is to be no
smoking in the warehouse ever.

337
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,103
l am very firm about that.

338
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:47,602
All right.

339
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:55,507
l'll go out to your warehouse just as soon as
l finish here, and l'll see what's going on.

340
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:01,869
Thank you.

341
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:23,205
-How's Durham?
-Oh, about the same.

342
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,900
Be careful, honey.

343
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:32,767
What do you mean?

344
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,568
Just be careful is all. .

345
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,667
What do you mean, be careful?

346
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,735
How about dinner again tonight?
l promise not to be late.

347
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,535
-l can't. l have an engagement.
-Break it.

348
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:55,066
-l can't.

349
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,301
Break it. For me.

350
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:03,068
l'm sorry. l just can't.

351
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:17,666
He's soon after every
new girl that works here.

352
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,233
And when he's through
with them, they're fired.

353
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:25,798
He has a wife and two children,

354
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:28,834
but that's a well kept
secret around here.

355
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:47,098
Are you married?

356
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,164
Yes.

357
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:54,464
l also have two children.

358
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:58,432
And for the sake of the
children, we all live together.

359
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,265
-Oh no.
-Neither of us are very happy.

360
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,832
When the children are grown...
the marriage will be dissolved.

361
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,097
Any other questions?

362
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:10,530
No.

363
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:13,764
Don't be too hard on me, Mary.

364
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:18,431
l do the best l can in a
very difficult situation.

365
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:29,830
-Oh, Mr. Leroy.
-Hello, Miss Georgiana Carr.

366
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:32,764
l got your message. l
was about to call you.

367
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:35,964
When l'm finished here this morning,
l'll be over to your house, if l may.. .

368
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,762
to talk about extending our lease.

369
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:39,695
You've been well, l hope.

370
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,495
Yes, thank you.

371
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:45,397
This is my niece, Willa Jenkins.

372
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:49,694
How do you do?

373
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:53,263
-Hello.
-And you've been well, l hope?

374
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:56,396
Well enough, considering
the business l'm in.

375
00:29:56,894 --> 00:30:00,029
What business are you in, Mr. Leroy?

376
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,128
Hazardous waste disposal.

377
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:03,027
Spent half the night

378
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,695
getting our canisters settled
in your beautiful warehouse.

379
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,832
You mean to tell me you have hazardous
waste stored in my aunt's warehouse?

380
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,062
Yes. But don't be concerned.

381
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,761
They're stored in
canisters specially designed

382
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,594
according to government regulations.

383
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,126
Would you like to see them?

384
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,893
Uh, no thank you

385
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:25,426
Miss Willa?

386
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,295
-Yes, l would.
-Come along.

387
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,926
Here are the canisters,

388
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,427
all properly labeled
listing the contents.

389
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:48,426
-Where did these come from?
-Louisiana

390
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,192
We're hoping in a week
we'll find room for these

391
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,458
in our treatment plant in Texas.. .

392
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,826
where they'll be made
safe for permanent storage.

393
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:57,626
-Where will that be?
-Some place in Texas.

394
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,394
Finding a final resting place
gets more difficult all the time.

395
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:17,726
What do these things look like up close?

396
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,491
Like nothing, really.

397
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:22,026
l mean, you can't see inside
the canisters, of course.

398
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,926
They have tags on them
saying ''hazardous waste''

399
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:27,290
which gives me the creeps.

400
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:30,992
Anyway, l'll feel better
when they're out and gone.. .

401
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,757
and l hope you won't let him come back

402
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,824
and store more of
them in your warehouse.

403
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,825
What does it mean, hazardous waste?

404
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,459
-What do you think it means?
-Dangerous.

405
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:43,757
More than dangerous. More than.. .

406
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:48,757
These two ladies are allowed to go in

407
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:49,454
and out of the ware house at any time.

408
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:52,057
And you may speak English to
them if they ask you a question.

409
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:53,322
l'll see you ladies later.

410
00:31:56,288 --> 00:32:01,893
They brought them from Louisiana.
They're sending them to Texas in a week.

411
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:08,795
Only to be buried, so they
say, if Texas will have them.

412
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,722
What has the world come to?

413
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:21,288
What's in there?

414
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:23,354
Death.

415
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:26,520
Ma'am?

416
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,021
Death.

417
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:38,687
What's in these canisters?

418
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:40,753
They're all labeled.

419
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:47,289
-Hazardous waste.
-lt's harmless in the canisters.

420
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,255
The ladies that were just
here filed a complaint.. .

421
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:52,954
that they were not allowed
earlier in her warehouse.

422
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:57,289
And there has to be no smoking
around or in the warehouse.

423
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:02,688
l understand, Officer.
It's all taken care of.

424
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,552
What are you thinking about?

425
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,086
Mr. Leroy and my ex-husband.

426
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:23,421
-What, do you think they look alike?
-No, not at all.

427
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:27,153
lt is the way he assumed
you'll be delighted

428
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:30,286
by anything he chooses to
do no matter how outrageous.

429
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,020
l certainly hope you have no
intention of extending his lease.

430
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,218
-Well...
-l don't want to tell you what or

431
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,220
But in my opinion... the sooner
you get him out of your warehouse

432
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,817
Well, how can l do that?

433
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,553
By saying he got the warehouse
under false pretenses.

434
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:52,651
He didn't tell you what he
was going to store in there.

435
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:56,553
Well he tried to tell me, but
l said l wasn't interested.

436
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:02,586
Well, if you had known what you know
now would you have rented it to him?

437
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,717
-Well, l suppose not.
-Well?

438
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,617
Do you ever hear from your husband?

439
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:14,251
Why on earth do you bring him up?

440
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:19,586
Well, l didn't bring him up.
You mentioned him first, honey.

441
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:22,581
No.

442
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:26,716
l never hear from him,
and l hope l never do.

443
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,082
So, if you agree with me,

444
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:36,519
that it would be the better...
part of wisdom to break his lease,

445
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:39,683
l think we should go to a lamer
and explain the circumstances.

446
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:43,484
l'm sure he'll tell you you'll
have no trouble asking.. .

447
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,382
him to leave as long as you
return the money he has paid you.

448
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:47,815
All in cash, right?

449
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:52,414
Yes, that' s right.

450
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,082
So, why don’t' we go and
see a Iawyer right now?

451
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:04,248
Would you mind if l
didn't go this afternoon?

452
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:08,816
l'm tired and it's been quite
a strenuous morning for me.

453
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:12,582
Sure. Do you mind my going?

454
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,114
No. Certainly not.

455
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,878
-Hey, Kate.
-What can l do for you?

456
00:35:50,677 --> 00:35:52,045
l need the use of a computer.

457
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,911
l'm looking for something
on hazardous waste.

458
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,278
Okay. take your pick.

459
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,010
Thanks.

460
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:35,711
-Is Mr. Leroy here?
-No, Ma'am.

461
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:39,878
-Do you know when he'll be back?
-l don't know, Ma'am.

462
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,311
-Do you know who l am?
-Yes, Ma'am.

463
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,278
-Did you know l own the warehouse?
-Yes, Ma'am.

464
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,076
-Do you know what they did here at one time?
-No, Ma'am.

465
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:59,543
-They bought and sold tobacco.
-Yes, Ma'am.

466
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:04,643
-You didn't know that, did you?
-No, Ma'am.

467
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,243
There were several tobacco
companies here then.

468
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:16,811
Every day taking tobacco leaves, grinding
them up and making them for cigarettes.

469
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:24,613
By five o'clock the dust from the ground
up tobacco would just cover the town.

470
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,541
lf you were out of doors,

471
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,875
your face and hands would
be covered by the dust.. .

472
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,774
till you turned a shade of brown.

473
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:40,975
l want to go inside.
l want to see it again.

474
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:43,005
Yes, Ma'am.

475
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:59,474
The last time l was here
l was with my father.

476
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:05,640
He hadn't been feeling well all winter.

477
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:08,039
lt was our first spring day.

478
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,972
A lovely spring day.

479
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:16,443
He said to me, ''take a walk
with me over to the warehouse''.

480
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:20,073
l want to see whether
or not l should sell it.

481
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:24,473
lt would break my heart to sell it.

482
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,373
But what good will it do me or you...

483
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,973
now that tobacco no longer makes a dime.

484
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,873
My father has this
warehouse built, you know.

485
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:42,040
Eight years before l
was born. Or was it ten?

486
00:38:43,736 --> 00:38:45,204
Or was it seven?

487
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:51,104
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

488
00:38:54,636 --> 00:39:00,475
l don't want them in the
warehouse. But l need money.

489
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,504
l don't want them in any warehouse.

490
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,136
Willa says they mean death.

491
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:12,571
l certainly don't want
death anywhere near me.

492
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:20,036
Certainly not in my warehouse.

493
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:26,971
But how long can l
keep it? l don't know.

494
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,301
l don't know.

495
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:42,934
You're going to have to hustle.

496
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,569
Vernon just called me. They have
an opening for our canisters.

497
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:48,469
They want them there in two days. l'm
expecting another hundred tomorrow.

498
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,768
-Yes?
-Gus Leroy? It's the Mayor speaking.

499
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:58,470
l was wondering if l could call
a meeting with the council.. .

500
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:00,434
and a few people
around the community.. .

501
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,135
who have expressed interest in what
you can tell us about your Vernon plant.

502
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,935
Yes, sir. How about tomorrow
night at seven o'clock?

503
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,067
-Thank you.
-l'll be there.

504
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:25,736
l had a nice talk with the
attorney, Bruce Jackson.

505
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,999
Are you all right, Auntie?

506
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,932
Are you worried about
your warehouse? Don't.

507
00:40:47,497 --> 00:40:50,399
We'll be free of Mr.
Leroy, l'm sure of that

508
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,399
The lamer says you will have no trouble

509
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:55,431
getting out of your deal with him.

510
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:58,699
Just say that since you were not,
at the time of the contract.. .

511
00:40:58,763 --> 00:41:00,631
aware of how he was going
to use your warehouse.. .

512
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,698
you would like to void the agreement.

513
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:07,466
And you'll return the money he gave
you. That's good news, isn't it?

514
00:41:09,163 --> 00:41:11,498
-Willa.
-Yes, Ma'am.

515
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:17,899
-You have to know something.
-What is it, Auntie?

516
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:20,364
-l'm ashamed to tell you.
-Why?

517
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:22,463
Because l am.

518
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,197
l have very little money, Willa.

519
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:33,932
l know that. l have little money too.

520
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,964
But you have your trust fund.

521
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:37,230
-l know it's modest, but surely

522
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,563
-Willa.
-Yes.

523
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:48,067
l was told last week. There
are no funds in my trust.

524
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:50,796
When l heard that,

525
00:41:52,494 --> 00:41:56,631
l called Crosby Gaige
about selling the house.

526
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:58,095
l don't know.

527
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:03,664
But that morning, Mr. Leroy
came about renting the warehouse.

528
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:07,497
And he gave me cash. So l
postponed selling the house

529
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:13,262
So l postponed selling the house.

530
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,763
l paid my bills and for
that dental work l had done.

531
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:22,329
And l needed some.. .whatever.

532
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:29,629
l have practically
nothing left to return.

533
00:42:34,692 --> 00:42:37,694
Oh, l should have sold
this house a long time ago.

534
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,894
lt was pride that kept me from doing it.

535
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:50,063
l couldn't bear to have my friends.. .

536
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:54,994
know that l had to give up my home.

537
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:03,962
Then last night, l though
what friends are left?

538
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:05,724
They're mostly dead.

539
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,290
Mostly.

540
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:18,495
When our troubles first began,
and so much money was lost.

541
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:23,795
And the tobacco empire was broken up
and there was bankruptcy everywhere.

542
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:30,895
Papa used to say it was a
curse put upon us for our sins.

543
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:37,493
What sins?' l asked him. The sin
of buying and selling tobacco?

544
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:40,690
No, he said.

545
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,390
For the sin of pride.

546
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:50,658
The sin of thinking
we were invulnerable.

547
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,857
That our good fortune
would last forever.

548
00:43:56,655 --> 00:44:01,326
Because we deserved our good
fortune. And it would never ever end.

549
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:06,825
Well.. .it did end.

550
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:16,126
And every night in the year Papa
died, l would hear him in his room.

551
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:20,155
Asking God to...

552
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:23,388
forgive him for his sin of pride.

553
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:35,321
l'll sell my house now.. .

554
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:42,154
and start over.

555
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:48,322
l'll explain to Mr. Leroy what happened.

556
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,623
But l'll give him his money
as soon as my house is sold.

557
00:44:55,585 --> 00:45:01,757
And then maybe l'll sell the warehouse.

558
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:06,586
Maybe.

559
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:15,419
Can l come in?

560
00:45:15,652 --> 00:45:17,586
In school l was taught when
you ask can' in a question.. .

561
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:19,753
you're asking, am l able to come in.

562
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,585
And may means, do l have permission.

563
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:23,319
Didn't you learn that in school, Mother?

564
00:45:23,884 --> 00:45:29,055
No, l'm afraid l didn't, honey. l
barely went to the fifth grade, remember?

565
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:33,220
l didn't learn much except
for what life has taught me.

566
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,953
l was married to your
father when l was fifteen.

567
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:38,285
Had you when l was
seventeen. Divorced...

568
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:39,885
Oh, l was teasing. Forgive me.

569
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,084
You are forgiven.

570
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:50,819
-l've been fired, Mama.
-What?

571
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:55,487
l've been given my notice
and two weeks severance pay.

572
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,185
-Why?
-Why?

573
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:02,183
l don't know why.. .

574
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:07,550
except for Howard.

575
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:11,050
He asked me if l would
go out with him again,

576
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:12,616
and l refused, and he asked why.

577
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:15,317
l said because I'd been
told he has a wife.. .

578
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:20,485
and two children.

579
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:22,881
Was he married?

580
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:24,782
Yes.

581
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,815
And were there children?

582
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:33,349
Yes

583
00:46:35,448 --> 00:46:36,382
Mercy.

584
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:43,215
Mama.

585
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:46,347
Yes?

586
00:46:48,813 --> 00:46:50,882
l don't want to stay in Durham.

587
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:56,515
l want to go away.

588
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:04,917
l'm twenty four. l've never
been further than Raleigh.

589
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,347
The Wiggins twins are in Atlanta.

590
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:10,447
They say l can come stay with them until

591
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:14,082
l find work and a place of my own.

592
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:19,481
When do you want to leave?

593
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:21,413
Tomorrow.

594
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:26,780
Tomorrow?

595
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:35,378
Yes, Ma'am.

596
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,813
-Oh hello, Mr. Leroy. Please come in.
-Thank you.

597
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:04,515
-Hello, Miss Georgiana.
-Hello, Mr. Leroy. Won't you sit down.

598
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,545
Thank you.

599
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:21,513
l won't be long. l've just
gotten word from Vernon.

600
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,444
They would like the
canisters there in two days...

601
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,411
and we're getting a new
batch here from Louisiana.

602
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,378
-lt's been a beautiful day, hasn't it?
-Yes.

603
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:38,211
Estaquio tells me you were
over looking at your warehouse.

604
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,544
l don't know how long it's
been since l was inside.

605
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:45,344
l am very satisfied with your
warehouse, Miss Georgiana.. .

606
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:48,912
and I'd like to extend my
lease for another six months

607
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:51,577
and for five years beyond that.

608
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,110
l have authority from my company

609
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:55,176
to redo the financial arrangement...

610
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:58,243
and l think you'll find them much more
favorable to you than they are at the present.

611
00:48:58,307 --> 00:49:01,344
What are they paying you now,
like 500 dollars a month, yes?

612
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:05,478
Well, l think you should get a lamer
to negotiate the five year contract

613
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:09,511
Cause my company's going to need
to get a sense of the potential.. .

614
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,977
to sense if the city will be
friendly to an operation like ours.

615
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,276
-Mr. Leroy...
-All this takes time and money.

616
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:18,276
But you will have a
friend in court in me.

617
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:22,274
Because l think the
opportunities here are tremendous.

618
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,542
They just need to have
the imagination to see it.

619
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:26,074
l have a feeling they will.

620
00:49:28,306 --> 00:49:30,242
So to get down to
more practical matters.

621
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:38,878
l would suggest that the ne_ six
months of the lease should start now.

622
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:44,643
And instead of six hundred a
month... as l believe it calls for,

623
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:46,040
let's raise it to a thousand.

624
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:51,575
So, should we start our
new partnership together.. .

625
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:53,874
by my drawing up an agreement
for the ne_ six months?

626
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,941
Then tomorrow, l promise you,

627
00:49:57,006 --> 00:50:01,075
l will make you an offer for the use...
of the warehouse for the ne_ five years.

628
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:05,307
Well thank you for your very kind offer.

629
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:11,944
But l don't really want to
extend your contract, Mr. Leroy.

630
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:17,840
When l rented you the warehouse,

631
00:50:17,904 --> 00:50:20,274
l had no idea what you'd
be putting in there.

632
00:50:20,304 --> 00:50:23,940
l tried to tell you what l was hoping to bring
here, but you said you didn't care to know.

633
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:28,774
Still, l had no idea, no earthly
idea, that you would bring in those...

634
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,972
-what do you call them?
-Canisters.

635
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:34,172
No, l know about that. But, l
mean, what do you put in them?

636
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:36,672
-Hazardous waste.
-Yes.

637
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:41,508
See, l would want
them removed right now.

638
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,139
But if you've made arrangements
for them to be here for a week.

639
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:48,072
Well, l was indeed counting
on it for the ne_ six months.

640
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:51,005
-That's what my contract says.
-l know and l'm sorry.

641
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:53,104
l have contractual obligations on

642
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:54,503
our end based on our agreement.

643
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:03,970
You really insist on doing this?

644
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:19,707
l have no alternative but to get
me a lamer and take you to court.

645
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,471
l will find a way to refund your money.

646
00:51:23,535 --> 00:51:25,236
l don't care about the money.

647
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:29,071
l care about all the work and
planning that's gone into this.

648
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,603
Miss Willa, don't you think
your aunt is being unreasonable?

649
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:37,237
No, l don't. l think
she's being very sensible.

650
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,504
How dare you threaten her
with the law? How dare you?

651
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,802
Have you ever heard of Vernon, Texas?

652
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:46,834
No.

653
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,169
Well, it's a town of maybe 800 people.

654
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:54,134
And it was dying on the vine.

655
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:57,001
Young people were leaving in droves.

656
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,335
My company went to
the town officials.. .

657
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,901
and offered to build them a
park and a swimming pool.. .

658
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:05,269
if they would let us come in and
establish a hazardous waste facility.

659
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,833
They agreed.

660
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:11,170
And we were careful in the
planning and location of our system.

661
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:15,067
We used local people whenever possible.

662
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,535
And the town is prospering
and the people have jobs.

663
00:52:20,632 --> 00:52:24,936
l feel strongly about the responsibility you
take on when you get involved in all this.

664
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:29,869
lf we let people who are interested
only in profits take hold.. .

665
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:33,434
no one will be safe in
time. Not you, not your aunt.

666
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,300
Not me. No one.

667
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:40,566
Now l'm not saying that our
record in Vernon is perfect but.. .

668
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:43,334
mistakes are corrected as
soon as they are uncovered.

669
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:48,801
Well, you look at Durham's
downtown. It is dying. Literally.

670
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:53,535
Now l told my company that l believe
there is an opportunity here in a place.. .

671
00:52:53,564 --> 00:52:56,699
that needs help, and l think
they're very interested.

672
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,699
They're just waiting to see
how this first phase works out.

673
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,668
l'm not your enemy, Miss
Willa... and l don't want to be.

674
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:15,498
Let's stay away from lawyers and courts.

675
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,730
Give me a month.

676
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:23,697
Let me send on this bunch
of canisters to Vernon...

677
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,697
and bring in the next
one from Louisiana.

678
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:28,498
Let me talk to the city
about the plans l have.

679
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:30,896
And at the end of the month.. .

680
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:36,000
if you still think l'm just...
a mercenary and opportunistic,

681
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:37,296
then l'll go away.

682
00:53:38,096 --> 00:53:41,064
l'll leave you, your
aunt and your warehouse.

683
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:42,996
And you'll never hear any more from me.

684
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:49,831
l'm going to go into the ne_
room And you talk it over.

685
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:54,298
And then when you come to a decision
about what you want to do, you call me.

686
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:04,462
Tell me what to do, Willa.

687
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:07,062
No, l won't do that.
It's your warehouse.

688
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,029
A month isn't a very long time.

689
00:54:12,694 --> 00:54:14,762
Would you be angry with me

690
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:17,930
if l agreed he could stay on?

691
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:18,627
No.

692
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,127
Would you think l was weak?

693
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,960
No. Not that either.

694
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:27,561
The town is dying.

695
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:30,694
Do you remember what it was like,

696
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:33,261
how splendid it was...
when you were a girl?

697
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:35,626
Yes.

698
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:43,730
l thought he was very impressive when he
was talking about Vernon, Texas. Didn't you?

699
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:46,194
Yes, l was impressed.

700
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:54,062
Then l will agree to have
him stay for one month.

701
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,860
-Do you agree?
-l agree.

702
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:05,726
Mr. Leroy?

703
00:55:08,424 --> 00:55:12,861
We have decided we want
you to have your month.

704
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:18,560
Thank you. You won't
regret this. l promise you.

705
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:22,991
Yep.

706
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:25,358
Harris is here.

707
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,725
He said you asked him to come over.

708
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:29,791
Yes, l did.

709
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,924
He's in the living room.

710
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:35,256
All right.

711
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,992
You were a senior in high school
when this was taken, right?

712
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,723
Yes.

713
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:49,624
You haven't changed
much since high school.

714
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:51,923
Oh, yes l have.

715
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,724
Well, you can't tell by
looking at your picture.

716
00:55:56,022 --> 00:55:58,357
-Haven't you changed?
-l guess so.

717
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:04,891
-How's law school?
-A lot of work.

718
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:07,991
Still thinking about practicing here?

719
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:10,357
Yeah. l do.

720
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:17,889
-Harris...
-Yeah?

721
00:56:18,454 --> 00:56:19,655
l'm leaving Durham.

722
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:23,723
-Moving to Atlanta.
-Why?

723
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:27,423
l have my reasons. l'll
tell you about them someday.

724
00:56:28,354 --> 00:56:30,622
I’d like you to do me a favor.

725
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,223
l want you to take me to
the airport tomorrow night.

726
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:38,025
-All right. What time are you leaving?
-Nine o'clock.

727
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,988
Why aren't your parents taking you?

728
00:56:43,786 --> 00:56:47,857
They'd like to, but
they're both very upset.

729
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:50,956
And l think it would be
easier if we say goodbye here.

730
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:53,154
Isn't this kind of sudden?

731
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,787
Yes, l guess.

732
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,254
When did you decide you wanted to leave?

733
00:56:58,419 --> 00:56:59,653
-Today.
-Today?

734
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:02,086
Why Atlanta?

735
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,621
l remembered the Wiggins twins
are there, and l called them.

736
00:57:06,452 --> 00:57:08,987
They said I’d have no trouble
finding a job there.. .

737
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,387
and l could stay with
them until l did find one.

738
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:14,186
What if you don't like Atlanta?

739
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:17,153
Then l won't stay.

740
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:22,421
l'll try Houston or New Orleans.

741
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:24,686
You know anyone in
Houston or New Orleans?

742
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:25,984
No.

743
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:28,654
What if you don't like
Houston or New Orleans?

744
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:34,454
Then l'll have to come
back here and find a job.

745
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:40,086
Don't look at me like that, Harris.

746
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,885
You're worse than Mother and Frank.

747
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:48,887
Haven't you ever wanted to
leave? Are you so content?

748
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,451
l bet if you didn't have.. .

749
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:57,751
Never mind.

750
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:01,319
-What were you going to say?
-Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing.

751
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,984
l want to know what
you were going to say.

752
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:11,017
l bet if you didn't have your
mother dependent on you.. .

753
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,850
you'd be thinking about leaving too.

754
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,852
What kind of future
is there for you here?

755
00:58:18,183 --> 00:58:21,553
A cop. Thirty thousand a year.

756
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:24,517
-Only losers settle for that.
-You calling me a loser?

757
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:27,284
l'll call you that if you stay
here, Because that's what you'll be.

758
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:29,951
A loser cop. A loser lamer.

759
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:34,383
Thanks a lot, Mary.

760
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:39,049
Harris...

761
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:43,415
Harris!

762
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:45,848
Harris!

763
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:50,449
l didn't mean it like that.

764
00:59:00,547 --> 00:59:01,881
l'm going to have to call you back.

765
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:08,048
-Busy at work?
-Yes. We're shipping them out.

766
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:10,948
We're expecting out ne_
shipment tomorrow night.

767
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,417
-Will you be busy here tonight?
-No.

768
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,582
Would you be able to have
dinner at Aunt Georgiana's?

769
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:22,049
She's decided to sell her house.
She thinks it'll sell right away.. .

770
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:24,847
and this is the last chance
for her to cook in her kitchen.

771
00:59:24,913 --> 00:59:28,483
She would be so pleased
if you could join us.

772
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:31,781
-What time?
-What time is good for you?

773
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:33,879
Six.

774
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:46,881
Tomorrow night, l have an appointment
with the Mayor and the City Council.

775
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:48,079
I’d like it if you can be there

776
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:49,780
and let me know how you
think the meeting went.

777
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,712
-What time will that be?
-Seven.

778
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:54,144
l'll be there.

779
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:04,079
-Hello?
-Miss Willa?

780
01:00:04,144 --> 01:00:06,279
-Yes.
-lt's Crosby here from the real estate office.

781
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,445
How are you Crosby?

782
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,314
Oh, l'm very well, thank
you. l'm sorry to trouble you.

783
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:13,513
May l have a word with your
aunt? l'll just be a second.

784
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:14,444
l'll get her.

785
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,077
lt's for you, Auntie

786
01:00:24,743 --> 01:00:26,744
-Yes.
-Miss Georgiana?

787
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:28,277
Yes?

788
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:31,112
l have a Miss Lucy Calhoun who's
interested in viewing tomorrow night.

789
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,212
-Oh good heavens.
-She's very rich and knows the house.

790
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:37,480
Why does she want to come tomorrow night?
Why doesn't she come in the daytime?

791
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,077
That's what works for her.

792
01:00:40,942 --> 01:00:43,044
Oh, all right. Thank you.

793
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:48,080
Well, he has this very rich
lady who passes the house often.

794
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:49,810
She has lots of money.. .

795
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:52,845
and she wants to come tomorrow
night and go through my home.

796
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:56,278
-What time will that be?
-Seven o'clock.

797
01:00:56,941 --> 01:01:00,377
l would be ever indebted to you
if you could be here with me.

798
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:03,277
Well, I’d like to be here,
Auntie, but l promised Mr. Leroy...

799
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:07,344
I’d be at his meeting with the Mayor
and the City Council tomorrow at seven.

800
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:09,910
Oh, honey, don't leave me
alone here, tomorrow night.

801
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:13,611
l will be ever in your debt if
you'll just do this one thing for me.

802
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:15,776
All right, all right.
Don't worry. l will.

803
01:01:26,907 --> 01:01:28,108
You're very prompt.

804
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:32,845
l can't be with you tomorrow night
at the meeting after all, Mr. Leroy.

805
01:01:33,074 --> 01:01:36,377
Auntie has a rich lady
interested in her house...

806
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:38,475
and she can only come
to see it tomorrow night.

807
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:40,007
Auntie was in a panic

808
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,840
over being alone with her
and the real estate agent.. .

809
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:44,475
-and l promised her I’d be here.
-l understand.

810
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,143
Well, l'll come over after the meeting
if l may and tell you how l think it went.

811
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:51,873
I’d like that.

812
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:56,643
Mr. Leroy. l'm so glad
you could be with us.

813
01:01:56,939 --> 01:02:01,043
At this may be the last meal
l'll ever cook in this house.

814
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:04,141
Come in. l have soup waiting for us.

815
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:16,010
Now, Mr. Leroy, you can sit at the head
and we'll sit on either side of you.

816
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:28,971
Thank you.

817
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,804
This is delicious, Miss Georgiana.

818
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:54,870
Oh thank you, sir.

819
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:07,403
You're selling your house?

820
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:11,703
Yes.

821
01:03:17,135 --> 01:03:20,705
l'm sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me.

822
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:24,536
l feel so stupid. Maybe l better go.

823
01:03:24,602 --> 01:03:27,371
No, please don't. l'll go see her.

824
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:30,303
My aunt is very emotional
about selling the house.

825
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:35,005
She was born in this house, you
know. She's never lived anyplace else.

826
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:57,604
That was her father. My
grandfather, James Wilfred Carr.

827
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,136
-Were you born in this house too?
-No. No.

828
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,602
-Were you born in Durham?
-Yes.

829
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,702
My mother and Aunt
Georgiana were sisters.

830
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,035
l left here at 22 when l got married.

831
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,701
Went to live in Texas.

832
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,636
-Texas?
-Yes. Were you born in Texas?

833
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:19,735
-Yes.
-Your family there?

834
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,334
No. No, my mother and father are dead.

835
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,336
l have no brothers or
sisters. l'm divorced too.

836
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,333
My work, l guess, is my family.

837
01:04:35,098 --> 01:04:35,832
Mr. Leroy.. .

838
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:41,036
Please don't call me Mr.
Leroy and Mr. Gus. Call me Gus.

839
01:04:41,898 --> 01:04:45,301
-Gus it will be.
-Thank you, Willa.

840
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:47,932
You're welcome, Gus.. ..

841
01:04:51,731 --> 01:04:53,499
-Gus...
-Yes?

842
01:04:57,263 --> 01:04:59,165
Never mind. l'll ask you later.

843
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,765
You still worried about the canisters?

844
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:06,533
Yes. How safe they are.

845
01:05:06,597 --> 01:05:08,231
lf l get interest from
the Council tomorrow,

846
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:10,032
and my company likes
what they have to say.. .

847
01:05:10,064 --> 01:05:11,598
things can move very fast.

848
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:14,199
-l'm sure.
-l'm going to need an assistant.

849
01:05:16,164 --> 01:05:18,332
Do you know of anyone
you could recommend?

850
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:21,764
l would prefer someone who
knows Durham and its people.

851
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:25,199
-How old?
-Someone mature and dependable.

852
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:28,465
Would be interested in what
we're hoping to achieve here.

853
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:31,398
Well, let me think on it. No
one comes to mind right off.

854
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,830
Would you be interested?

855
01:05:39,463 --> 01:05:44,967
Why heavens. l don't know.
It never occurred to me.

856
01:05:47,761 --> 01:05:49,663
I’d be interested in working with you.

857
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:54,730
Well goodness. l'm very flattered.

858
01:05:55,495 --> 01:06:00,933
l don't know. l know so
little about all of this.

859
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:04,730
-Would you think about it?
-Well, yes, l suppose so.

860
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,130
-l mean seriously think about it.
-l will certainly.

861
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,428
When would you need to know?

862
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:22,796
l promise not to do that again.

863
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,228
-All right. See you tomorrow.
-Maybe.

864
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:42,628
-lt's supposed to rain tomorrow.
-That's right.

865
01:06:47,659 --> 01:06:48,459
Harris.. .

866
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:57,928
-l didn't mean you were...
-l know what you meant.

867
01:07:05,825 --> 01:07:07,493
l'm too sensitive for my own good.

868
01:07:09,257 --> 01:07:10,692
And l want to tell you something.

869
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,293
l think we're both too
sensitive for our own good.

870
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:25,590
-Yes.
-Miss Georgiana? Crosby here.

871
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:31,093
Oh hello Crosby. Isn't this
rain something? Oh goodness me.

872
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:34,424
l'm sorry, but our lady's
temporarily canceled.

873
01:08:35,288 --> 01:08:37,322
She's unable to make
it out in this rain.

874
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,455
-l see.
-My apologies.

875
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,522
But you think she's
definitely interested?

876
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:45,555
Most definitely she is!

877
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:49,889
Oh. Well, thank you for calling me.

878
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,888
That was Crosby.

879
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,022
Seems our lady customer has canceled.

880
01:08:58,086 --> 01:09:01,422
Too much rain, she says, to venture out.

881
01:09:01,886 --> 01:09:05,356
But he says she's still very interested.

882
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:08,987
Oh, l'm so disappointed.

883
01:09:12,253 --> 01:09:14,488
Why risk flying in this rain?

884
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:16,454
Can't she wait until tomorrow?

885
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,655
-No, she's determined to leave.
-What if her flight is canceled?

886
01:09:22,718 --> 01:09:24,186
She says she'll take the bus.

887
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:25,952
God she's stubborn.

888
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:31,222
-You raised a stubborn daughter.
-You raised her too.

889
01:09:31,285 --> 01:09:33,053
Why does she want Harris
to take her to the airport?

890
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,319
Why can't we take her?

891
01:09:34,385 --> 01:09:36,620
She says she wants to
say goodbye to us here.

892
01:09:37,985 --> 01:09:40,220
Oh Frank, l'm going to miss her.

893
01:09:40,252 --> 01:09:41,685
Now, Miriam, come on.

894
01:09:42,651 --> 01:09:44,753
Please.. .Come on.

895
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:46,351
lt's Harris.

896
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:50,651
Come on in.

897
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:56,254
-Hello folks.
-Mary! Harris is here.

898
01:09:58,151 --> 01:10:00,219
Frank, go help her with her bags.

899
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:01,618
Yeah.

900
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:12,519
Were you surprised when
you heard she was going?

901
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,185
Yes, Ma'am. l was.

902
01:10:19,283 --> 01:10:21,151
Promise me you'll call
when you get to Atlanta.

903
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,184
- l don't care what time it is.
-Yes, Ma'am.

904
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:24,916
l love you both.

905
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:45,417
lt's a terrible night tonight, isn't it?

906
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:49,083
Yeah. It is.

907
01:10:55,414 --> 01:10:56,281
They're gone.

908
01:11:00,814 --> 01:11:02,282
She's on her way.

909
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:16,649
Gus Leroy.. ..Yes, Mr. Bob.

910
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:21,081
l had the Louisiana
team start very early

911
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:23,782
because of the rain. Around five.

912
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:28,149
lt wasn't daylight yet
when they left Louisiana

913
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,447
and hadn't started raining.

914
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,647
Yes, sir, it's raining now.

915
01:11:37,045 --> 01:11:38,247
l'll keep you posted.

916
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,948
Thank you all for coming
on such a rainy night,

917
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:52,379
and on such short notice.

918
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:58,049
But l felt it was important for the
well being and prosperity of our city.. .

919
01:11:58,344 --> 01:12:00,814
that we listen to what
this gentleman has to say.

920
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:04,114
-Where is he?
-Well, he'll be here in a few minutes

921
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,114
and l want him to explain...

922
01:12:07,311 --> 01:12:09,046
who he is and why he
wants to come here.. .

923
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:11,713
and what he thinks he
can do for our city.

924
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,045
-You look very pretty.
-Thank you.

925
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:27,311
You had a bath?

926
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,178
Yes, l feel so much better.

927
01:12:34,177 --> 01:12:36,711
How long do you think
that meeting will be?

928
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:40,612
l have no idea. l presume
no more than an hour.

929
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:43,478
What if they turn his project down

930
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,478
and say he can't start a plant here.

931
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:51,280
Do you think he'll still be able
to rent my warehouse for five years?

932
01:12:51,342 --> 01:12:52,143
l don't know.

933
01:12:54,076 --> 01:12:56,044
l've begun to worry about that.

934
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:03,277
l feel they won't turn him down.

935
01:13:03,308 --> 01:13:07,545
Well, if the meeting only lasts one
hour, then he should be here pretty soon.

936
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,643
lf he comes right away.

937
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:11,977
He may have to stay and talk to people.

938
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:16,210
Do you think l'll find
a buyer for my house?

939
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:17,209
l think so.

940
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:21,277
Crosby Gaige has total
confidence that l will.

941
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:22,441
He should know.

942
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:25,944
Crosby says that a lot of his customers
buy houses, pay all kinds of money.. .

943
01:13:25,974 --> 01:13:29,577
for them, and then tear them
down and build a new one.

944
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:32,575
Are you listening to me?

945
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:37,344
l'm sorry. l was thinking
about Gus and his meeting.

946
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:38,942
Gus. Who's Gus?

947
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,674
Mr. Leroy?

948
01:13:44,573 --> 01:13:45,373
Yes.

949
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:49,142
Well, since when did you
start calling him Gus?

950
01:13:49,606 --> 01:13:50,640
He asked me to.

951
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,942
Are you interested in him, Willa?

952
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:00,774
What do you mean interested?

953
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,175
l mean interested.

954
01:14:04,372 --> 01:14:05,206
l don't know.

955
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:10,075
-What do you mean you don't know, honey?
-l mean, l don't know.

956
01:14:17,472 --> 01:14:20,141
Yes l do. l am.

957
01:14:20,605 --> 01:14:22,840
Is he interested in you?

958
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:24,906
l don't know.

959
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,172
l think he is.

960
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:35,205
l hope so.

961
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:45,007
Frank thinks it's foolish
flying in weather like this.

962
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:48,239
But he'd think it was foolish my
leaving if the sun was shining.

963
01:14:51,536 --> 01:14:54,773
-He's my stepfather, you know.
-Yeah, l knew that.

964
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,871
l knew it, Mary.

965
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:01,804
l never knew my real father.

966
01:15:05,303 --> 01:15:07,204
He's dead now, Mama says.

967
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,470
Well, l couldn't have had
a better father than Frank.

968
01:15:20,369 --> 01:15:22,537
How old were you when your father died?

969
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:25,436
Five.

970
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:27,737
Do you remember him?

971
01:15:28,502 --> 01:15:30,637
l think l do, but 'm never really sure.

972
01:15:32,901 --> 01:15:34,435
Were you named for your father?

973
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:38,403
No. My brother Pete was named for him.

974
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:41,468
Where is Pete?

975
01:15:42,834 --> 01:15:45,671
l don't know. Pete's a wanderer.

976
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:48,469
We always finally hear from him.

977
01:15:48,534 --> 01:15:50,403
lt may be six months or a year.

978
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:52,335
And then we'll get a letter or a card

979
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:55,703
saying he misses us and sends his love.

980
01:16:08,134 --> 01:16:08,834
Mary?

981
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:13,801
Yes, Harris?

982
01:16:17,766 --> 01:16:18,900
l'm in love with you.

983
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:28,167
Always have been.

984
01:16:31,766 --> 01:16:33,300
l'm in love with you too.

985
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:39,333
Always have been.

986
01:16:47,165 --> 01:16:49,734
l'm here to talk about what l like
to talk about more than anything.

987
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:51,299
Managing our waste.

988
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:56,602
Well, first of all, I’d like you to
know that l am a paid employee, and proud

989
01:16:56,632 --> 01:16:59,567
to be of the Environmental
Services Corporation.

990
01:16:59,731 --> 01:17:01,966
We have offices in Houston, San Antonio,

991
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,732
and a plant near Vernon, Texas...

992
01:17:03,764 --> 01:17:06,266
a small Texas town of about 800 people,

993
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:08,598
that made me and my company welcome.

994
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,865
As some of you also may know.. .

995
01:17:11,764 --> 01:17:15,300
we were able to lease the
warehouse of Miss Georgiana Carr.. .

996
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,901
to store some of our canisters
containing hazardous waste.

997
01:17:20,163 --> 01:17:24,967
l've sat here so many days and
nights listening to the rain.

998
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:37,834
l'm getting used to the idea
that my days here are almost over.

999
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,565
Now we go all over the Unit_ States...

1000
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:43,564
looking for products to bring
back to our Vernon plant.. .

1001
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:46,398
which converts toxic waste into a form

1002
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,731
that may be safely
buried or disposed of.

1003
01:17:56,662 --> 01:18:01,633
We would like in time to build
a sister plant here in Durham.

1004
01:18:02,195 --> 01:18:04,262
l've seen weddings in this room

1005
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:08,762
and funerals start from here.

1006
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:15,997
Your mama and daddy were
married in this room.

1007
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:18,196
l was the maid of honor.

1008
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:22,164
Now l know the question on all of
your minds is how safe is all this?

1009
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:25,662
Well, let me begin that
discussion by reminding you.. .

1010
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:29,496
that we now live in a nuclear
age and all of its complexity.

1011
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,096
No house pictured
here is still standing.

1012
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,196
The atomic bomb locked
up is of no danger.

1013
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,961
The danger only comes when it's dropped.

1014
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:42,995
Therefore, waste of any kind

1015
01:18:43,193 --> 01:18:45,194
hazardous, toxic or nuclear

1016
01:18:45,227 --> 01:18:48,162
cannot harm you if it
is properly managed.

1017
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:55,297
In gratitude to our friends in
Vernon, for their cooperation.. .

1018
01:18:55,325 --> 01:19:00,364
we have built them a beautiful new
park and a community swimming pool.

1019
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:02,827
To show our appreciation.

1020
01:19:03,726 --> 01:19:06,195
And they have almost full
employment in that town.

1021
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:09,827
And old Durham itself
is half demolished.

1022
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:14,093
Where did the houses go?

1023
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:19,392
Where did the city go?

1024
01:19:19,725 --> 01:19:22,260
l want to say to you what l
say to my friends in Vernon.

1025
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,695
l refuse to live in the
past. l look to the future.

1026
01:19:27,824 --> 01:19:30,093
Emergency 1 183. Hazmat.

1027
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:31,958
All units on duty respond.

1028
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:35,961
-What in the world is that about?
-l have to see. I'm sorry.

1029
01:19:36,157 --> 01:19:38,058
Car 104. 1017.

1030
01:19:39,957 --> 01:19:43,493
l would like to say l am very
impressed with what l just heard.

1031
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:46,559
And as a member of Council,
l would like to recommend.. .

1032
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:50,860
that we get in touch with
whoever we need to in Vernon...

1033
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:54,026
Texas, and let them know of
our serious interest in this.

1034
01:19:54,889 --> 01:19:59,159
Will the Council members that agree
with Shirley's request raise their hands?

1035
01:20:17,588 --> 01:20:18,689
You stay here, Mary.

1036
01:20:19,422 --> 01:20:22,591
l don't want to stay here by
myself. l want to go with you.

1037
01:20:24,321 --> 01:20:27,491
All right. Come on. But
stay where it's safe.

1038
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:34,689
Were you at the scene of the accident?

1039
01:20:35,155 --> 01:20:38,357
No, sir. All l know is the reports
l've been getting on my scanner.

1040
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:40,455
Are you going as fast as you can?

1041
01:20:40,654 --> 01:20:41,254
Yes, sir.

1042
01:20:52,454 --> 01:20:53,922
Are you all right lady?

1043
01:20:57,087 --> 01:21:00,923
No one was killed. l'm
grateful to my maker for that.

1044
01:21:03,586 --> 01:21:06,255
These trucks were
transporting hazardous waste.

1045
01:21:06,353 --> 01:21:07,954
Get the Hazmat team from Raleigh.

1046
01:21:07,986 --> 01:21:09,420
l'll see to the canisters.

1047
01:21:09,553 --> 01:21:12,756
We got a couple of guys on the ground
that are going to need immediate attention.

1048
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,120
Jesus. Jesus.

1049
01:21:41,085 --> 01:21:43,419
-Mister Leroy.
-Yes.

1050
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:46,019
Are you wondering about your canisters?

1051
01:21:47,017 --> 01:21:48,519
The Hazmat team from Raleigh

1052
01:21:48,551 --> 01:21:50,719
came as soon as they were
summoned... and inspected them.

1053
01:21:52,118 --> 01:21:53,919
They say they haven't been hurt at all.

1054
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:56,852
They want us to get
them in to your warehouse

1055
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:59,086
as soon as possible. l
understand it's empty.

1056
01:21:59,584 --> 01:22:03,721
lt is. Do you have men
to help you move them?

1057
01:22:03,784 --> 01:22:05,885
We do. We got in touch
with your supervisors

1058
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:07,451
Jose and Estaquio.

1059
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:09,885
They hired a team of men to move
the canisters into the trucks.. .

1060
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:11,485
and unload them at the warehouse.

1061
01:22:15,183 --> 01:22:16,484
Then l'm not needed?

1062
01:22:16,883 --> 01:22:20,753
No, sir. Not really.

1063
01:22:46,549 --> 01:22:47,683
Here you are, sir.

1064
01:22:47,815 --> 01:22:51,552
-Thank you. Be well.
-Be well.

1065
01:22:54,581 --> 01:22:55,281
Thank you.

1066
01:24:03,378 --> 01:24:04,112
Hello.

1067
01:24:07,478 --> 01:24:08,145
Hello.

1068
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:13,779
l'm so sorry about the accident.

1069
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:16,744
l may be fired.

1070
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:20,279
lf there had been any fatalities.. .

1071
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,912
or if any of the
canisters had been damaged,

1072
01:24:21,944 --> 01:24:23,245
l surely would have been.

1073
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:28,414
Now l'm being accused of negligence...

1074
01:24:30,444 --> 01:24:33,346
and the company will decide
later today whether l can stay on.

1075
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:38,843
l'm sorry.

1076
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:50,911
Back home l knew of an old man

1077
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:52,977
that l only saw once from a distance.

1078
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:56,045
He had a room at the local hotel.

1079
01:24:58,476 --> 01:24:59,609
l was a paperboy then.. .

1080
01:24:59,642 --> 01:25:01,610
and l used to bring
his paper to his room.

1081
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:04,609
When l announced who l was.. .

1082
01:25:04,675 --> 01:25:07,811
he opened the door just wide enough
to stick his hand out to get his paper.

1083
01:25:10,675 --> 01:25:11,876
He never left his room.

1084
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,743
He had all his meals sent up there too.

1085
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:19,344
When he was a young man, he had
an accident that happened to him.

1086
01:25:20,642 --> 01:25:22,509
No one could remember what it was.

1087
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:27,576
But it frightened him so
he'd never leave his room

1088
01:25:27,641 --> 01:25:29,109
for fear of another accident.

1089
01:25:32,874 --> 01:25:35,009
Last night has given
me a fear of accidents.

1090
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:39,942
Fear of the deadliness of accidents.

1091
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:44,109
You should see what an
accident did to those trucks.

1092
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:48,241
What it might have
done to the canisters.

1093
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,075
How do you pass a law against accidents?

1094
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:01,877
Suppose all the canisters held
up in this crash, but one didn't?

1095
01:26:05,772 --> 01:26:07,173
Well you know what would happen.

1096
01:26:15,372 --> 01:26:17,240
So l'm going to resign from the company.

1097
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,306
l'm tired of being a cheerleader.

1098
01:26:25,672 --> 01:26:27,139
l'm going to be a truth teller.

1099
01:26:28,405 --> 01:26:31,474
The truth is, accidents happen.

1100
01:26:32,304 --> 01:26:36,075
Rainy days. Sunny days.
Always the unexpected.

1101
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:38,805
l'm going to have to
tell your aunt that.

1102
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:53,642
Mr. Leroy. l'm sure Willa has told you

1103
01:26:53,937 --> 01:26:56,506
how distressed we were
over what happened.

1104
01:26:57,237 --> 01:26:57,870
Yes.

1105
01:26:58,604 --> 01:27:01,006
Crosby's customer is buying my house.

1106
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,338
Her name is Lucy Calhoun.

1107
01:27:03,404 --> 01:27:06,306
We've signed all the papers and
l've received the down payment.

1108
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:09,473
And she's lovely, Lucy
Calhoun. She's just lovely.

1109
01:27:09,537 --> 01:27:11,537
l feel as if l've known her all my life.

1110
01:27:12,069 --> 01:27:15,405
Oh, and she said the sweetest thing

1111
01:27:15,936 --> 01:27:20,073
That our being brought together
in such a harmonious way.. .

1112
01:27:20,236 --> 01:27:24,473
she felt was surely divine intervention.

1113
01:27:24,936 --> 01:27:28,205
-Not just an accident.
-Certainly not.

1114
01:27:28,669 --> 01:27:34,540
l never would have thought of it if
dear Lucy Calhoun hadn't brought it up.

1115
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,339
Look. Look. The sun is out.

1116
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:45,103
The rain is gone.

1117
01:27:50,702 --> 01:27:53,571
Oh, what a lovely day it will be.

1118
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:06,202
This city, like many in America

1119
01:28:06,867 --> 01:28:08,668
has come to a rough
moment in its history.

1120
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:12,970
A city, after all, is just a
collection of houses and buildings ...

1121
01:28:13,467 --> 01:28:16,702
hopes and dreams that depend on
the fortune and determination...

1122
01:28:16,733 --> 01:28:18,367
and the faith of its residents.

1123
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:22,968
The future, uncertain at best, can be

1124
01:28:23,033 --> 01:28:25,201
fearful or full of promise.

1125
01:28:27,066 --> 01:28:28,467
lt's all in how you see it.
