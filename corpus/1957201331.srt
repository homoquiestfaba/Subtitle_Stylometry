5
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:22,132
I'm out of here!

6
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,090
Hey! Wait!

7
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,748
Hi!

8
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,805
Let's go!

9
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,682
Come on, man, we'll be
on the road all night!

10
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:57,027
- How come you only hang out with babes?
- Let's go.

11
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,699
Jazz, come here, man.

12
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,055
Wine.

13
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,385
Here, look.

14
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,245
You all right?

15
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,040
Hell, what's wrong with you?

16
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,499
What's up with you?

17
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,229
Nothing so far.

18
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,181
Did I hurt you?

19
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:47,602
It's okay, I'll survive.

20
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:52,089
You hit well, for a girl.

21
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:57,542
Yes? I'll take that as a compliment,
if it comes from a macho on a motorcycle.

22
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,688
I like it!

23
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:20,806
Hey, where are we?
It's a miracle!

24
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:27,257
- What's up?
- This engine makes figures.

25
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,625
Are you back?

26
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,568
What's new?

27
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,381
I don't know what he has again.

28
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,701
Maybe there’s too much weight on him.

29
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:44,002
Damn, what a mess.

30
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,487
It broke down again.

31
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,410
- Again?
- Yes, again!

32
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,594
Your big ass won't
get on my engine.

33
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,743
Not even on my engine.
Not with that sweat down his throat.

34
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,264
Very funny.

35
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,933
Pity.

36
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,329
Come on!

37
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,594
Set aside!

38
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,303
Hey, look at his house
that's weird!

39
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,589
Hey, you, wait!

40
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,623
You're late.

41
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:01,511
Here you go?

42
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:07,094
What happened to you?
You said you were an hour ago.

43
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,900
And you call that merchandise?

44
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:13,202
Not worth 500!

45
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:15,776
I don’t want anything.

46
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:20,936
I understand. Negotiate.

47
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,021
Mae, Mae!

48
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,012
Come on!

49
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:34,742
Come on. Damn.
I brought them to 6 but ...

50
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:40,480
Be serious, Roscoe. This motorcycle
worth more than our house.

51
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,613
Well ...

52
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:48,710
If you ever need it
someone to fix it, call us!

53
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,154
We are the best in the area.

54
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,611
Can you fix something like that?

55
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:57,791
If we can? After we finish with the wheels
these, you will not recognize them!

56
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,336
Not me! His.

57
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,475
No, no thought, man!
Don't get your hands on my engine!

58
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,819
Come on, feel at home!
We'll fix it in an instant.

59
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,563
What is he saying?

60
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,834
It says before and after ...

61
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:16,213
- Page 52 ...
- Page 52.

62
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:17,967
That's 55.

63
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:35,955
Okay, it will be ...

64
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,273
Wait.

65
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,175
- Put it here.
- Wait, Mae!

66
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,371
You're pressing me again!

67
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,077
Yes!

68
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,027
- It's not that far, Nick.
- Yes it is.

69
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,513
- No way.
- Yes.

70
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,302
It's a long way from here.

71
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,918
Come on, Kathy, both of you
we know what will happen.

72
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,820
Couples break up when
I go to different faculties.

73
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,481
- Is that what you want?
- I didn't say that.

74
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,525
I'm sure there are some girls
who would be glad to hear that.

75
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,031
I am convinced.

76
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:30,605
Okay, I'll think about it.

77
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:31,884
I love you.

78
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,646
Yes Yes Yes ...

79
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:38,017
What the hell is this?

80
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,431
Don't ask me.

81
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,445
What's up?

82
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:43,938
- What are you doing?
- Good.

83
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:47,487
And the horse?

84
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,067
- Since when do you care?
- Wait a minute, do you know each other?

85
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,449
- Not.
- Yes.

86
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,195
How are you, Kathy?

87
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,029
Kathy ...

88
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:58,601
Kat.

89
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,531
Come on, we're wasting his time.

90
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,664
Don't waste my time,
I was just walking.

91
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,858
Then you are wasting our time.

92
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:11,867
Ok, I got it.
Be careful if you need me,

93
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:13,647
I'll be there.

94
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,516
Will not have.

95
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,126
We'll see.

96
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:22,548
Kat ... A few wise words ...

97
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:25,702
Give up that nothing,
and leaves with a hero.

98
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,726
Here you go ?

99
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,906
See you later, Dick.

100
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,320
It's Nick.

101
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:37,302
Yes, yes ... Nick.

102
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,588
What was that ?

103
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,107
Forget it, I've already forgotten it.

104
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,653
Where have you been ?

105
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,658
I exchanged a word with Kat.

106
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,005
The girl who was riding!

107
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,376
Did you find out his name?

108
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,725
Not only. I have more than that.

109
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,450
I have a black diary.

110
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:12,251
That's great. Very great.

111
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:17,148
Let's take a look at Kat's diary.

112
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,017
- Hey, it's live!
- Come on, let's sit down.

113
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:05,372
- Come on, sit down.
- Kathy, sit next to me.

114
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,721
<i> Thanks, Chuck. </i>

115
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,274
<i> You talked about successful people,
and I have one for you. </i>

116
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,988
Her name is Katherine Winslow,
and you all probably already know it. </i>

117
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,561
<i> Its results are remarkable. </i>

118
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:26,536
<i> In the last year in high school with an average of 4.0,
1600 points in the academic test ... </i>

119
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,857
What's the answer?

120
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,240
In this case, what is the question?

121
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,574
Hey, it's live!

122
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:41,927
Be quiet !

123
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:48,595
<i> I read articles that said it was normal
for teenagers to hate their parents. </i>

124
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,192
<i> But I'm not like that ... </i>

125
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,616
That's because they don't hate you either.

126
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,990
I can't believe I said that.

127
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:58,293
<i> I think people can
become what they want to become, </i>

128
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,039
<i> as long as they are willing
to work, and that's what I did. </i>

129
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:06,047
- And with a little help.
"From whom?"

130
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:07,800
<i> My father's! </i>

131
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,287
<i> And what does he think about that? </i>

132
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:11,031
<i> I don't know, ask him. </i>

133
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,918
<i> Mr. Winslow ... </i>

134
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,603
Turn up...

135
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,613
- Immediately.
- Now !

136
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:22,092
<i> ... very proud. </i>

137
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,800
But it's not my merit
for Katy's results. </i>

138
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:33,045
<i> Me and her mother
We tried to be an example, but ... </i>

139
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:36,985
I can not believe.

140
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,120
A friend of yours?

141
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,394
Mr. Winslow, what do you expect from Katherine?
after you finish college? </i>

142
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,640
It's not up to me anymore,
she manages on her own. </i>

143
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,890
- Thank you, Dad.
"It certainly will be."

144
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,135
And we are proud of her.
I'm Deborah Norris ... </i>

145
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,162
It's over.

146
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,909
- It wasn't bad.
- You were great!

147
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:01,001
Come on, I didn't think so.

148
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:03,882
You won't believe it
whom I saw on TV.

149
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:05,065
Yes.

150
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,589
I do not know.

151
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,116
Yes.

152
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:12,933
Dad, on TV
You don't look like a nerd.

153
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,724
Thanks, Tommy, that makes it easier.

154
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:19,665
Hello?

155
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,574
We are proud of you.

156
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,209
Hello!

157
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,844
Hello!

158
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,350
And Charlie ...

159
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,331
Yes, she's even prettier in reality.

160
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:46,526
By the way, Charlie,
did you call earlier?

161
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,861
It's not Alright.

162
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,387
Thank you again.

163
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:09,676
What is it, Dad?

164
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:17,142
Charlie wanted to know why Thrace
He can't look more like you.

165
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:22,507
Interesting, because Traci believes
I should look more like her.

166
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,961
- It's not possible !
- Sure.

167
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,814
Her old man doesn't believe that.

168
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,929
Your old man wants to eat.
What do you say about this ?

169
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:30,775
Nick, are you having dinner with us tonight?

170
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,262
I can't, I promised my parents.

171
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,494
- Maybe another time.
- Yes, definitely.

172
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,246
"What about my walk?"
- Next time, Tommy. I promise.

173
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,014
You always promise.

174
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,614
You're a sucker.

175
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:51,003
Are we going to Sugar Shack tonight?

176
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,470
Is that a change?

177
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,755
- You smile when you say that.
- That's what I do.

178
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,810
Good.

179
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,654
Am I coming to pick you up at 8?

180
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,047
- Good.
- Good.

181
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:03,879
- Goodbye, Mrs. and Mr. Winslow.
- Goodbye, Nick.

182
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,061
My agenda is gone.

183
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,847
Do not look at me.

184
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:30,037
Tommy, and seriously,
I have all the data there.

185
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,051
Think about what you did today
and you'll find out where you left it.

186
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,856
Good.

187
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,674
I know I had it when I went to
service, because I put my check in it.

188
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,864
Then I went straight to Nick's house
and I didn't touch her there ...

189
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,911
Remain silent.

190
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:52,857
Nothing happened in the meantime,
because Nick brought me straight home.

191
00:20:56,148 --> 00:21:01,135
I withdraw my words.
I know exactly where he is.

192
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:05,067
And I know exactly how to get it back.

193
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:10,496
- You're in those lessons, V.
- And serious.

194
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:15,446
The sum of the squares of the legs is equal
with the square of the hypotenuse.

195
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,947
What am I doing there?

196
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:22,884
So far, I'm coming out.

197
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,978
Roscoe, I can't believe it.

198
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,990
Hi, where's my engine?

199
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:34,378
He really is a genius.

200
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:38,511
- Where's my engine?
- How long have you been here?

201
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:39,966
Where's my engine?

202
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,311
Shall we stay?

203
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,744
You are welcome to stay
as long as you want.

204
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,688
Where's my engine?

205
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,971
What's with you ?
It's right here in front of your eyes.

206
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:54,603
- Don't you see him?
- Is that his engine?

207
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,982
Do you think it's funny?

208
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:08,098
- Isn't that great?
"You tore him to pieces."

209
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:15,946
Yes, as I always said. Can not
Repair something if you don't disassemble it.

210
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:22,998
Great philosophy,
but can you fix it quickly?

211
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:26,486
That's exactly what I want to do.

212
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,490
And when is that?

213
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,630
Well ... I don't know, maybe tomorrow ...

214
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,273
Tomorrow?

215
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,416
Morrisey, I found it.

216
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:42,006
Did you find ?
Do you know the name of this place?

217
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,776
Yes I am sure.

218
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,136
I hope it's as you say.

219
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:55,815
I can't wait to get there
I'm starving. I'm getting french fries ...

220
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,279
You're thinking of something else
apart from food?

221
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,262
Did you think that would happen?

222
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:09,603
Not. And now that it's happened, I want to
to be sure that the job will be done well.

223
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:12,888
So let's go.
Come on!

224
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:30,358
We are all very impressed here,
but let's leave it for today.

225
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,095
He can find out which side ...

226
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,780
Who? him ? No, that's my job.
How do you think we're fixing something here?

227
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:46,574
Roscoe, stop.

228
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:49,585
I left here.

229
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:51,139
Where are you going ?

230
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,775
Across the corner.

231
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,632
What the ?

232
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,359
What are you doing lady ?

233
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:30,689
- I can help you ?
- I'm looking for Kat.

234
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,078
We don't have a cat (cat).

235
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,889
Kathy, your daughter

236
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,509
Do you want to see her?

237
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,507
Tommy, go inside.

238
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,479
What are you doing, trickster?

239
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:48,335
I am sorry,
Kathy isn't here right now.

240
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:51,246
- You don't know where he is?
- I am not sorry.

241
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,511
I know.
The Sugar Shack.

242
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:57,372
It's a club.
She's there with Nick, her boyfriend.

243
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,452
Sugar Shack.
I'm going to check.

244
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:02,587
- Do you know where he is?
- Tommy!

245
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,825
- If not, I can show you.
- Tommy, go inside.

246
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,006
- See you.
- Okay, partner.

247
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:14,635
I enjoyed
let me know you, madam.

248
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:32,113
- Hey!
- Hey and you.

249
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,709
- Do you know where Sugar Shack is?
- Sugar Shack?

250
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:41,389
- Why ?
- Because I want to know.

251
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:43,560
Who was it, darling?

252
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,129
A boy was looking for Kathy.

253
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,944
- Who?
- I don't know, I didn't ask.

254
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:56,726
Do you see that street over there? Go on the street
That, until you pass a large building ...

255
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,442
Leave him alone.
Listen.

256
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,687
You have to go about 4-5 blocks,
and then go on the bridge ...

257
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,392
Then around the corner,
You found Sugar Shack.

258
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:20,882
The spoiled ...

259
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,323
Go away !

260
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,969
They are good.
You do not want ?

261
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:28,047
Let's go.

262
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:33,145
"Do you know you're disgusting?"
- I love you too.

263
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,422
We return in the evening to pay him a visit.

264
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:05,328
You will probably show up
in a soap opera series.

265
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,690
You were great.

266
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:17,699
Why don't you try dancing?

267
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:20,757
- You try.
- I have something else to do.

268
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:23,142
I know what I'm going to do.

269
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:27,005
Jazz, wait for me too.

270
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:40,148
This is a trick for
get to Nick ...

271
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,091
Are we having fun, or what?

272
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,610
- Yes.
- Aren't we drinking something?

273
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:45,955
I want a diet cola.

274
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,400
Diet cola, be serious, Kathy.

275
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,036
Nick, be serious.
Drive.

276
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:57,227
I'm a big boy,
and I'm still thirsty.

277
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,028
I like the band, they are great.

278
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,190
Kathy, do you want to dance?

279
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:23,223
You dance, or do your homework
in your head all night?

280
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,676
I'm not finished.

281
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,190
Jimmy.

282
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,212
The young officer, Jim.

283
00:28:35,237 --> 00:28:36,911
Long time no see.

284
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,375
For about 20 years.

285
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,606
But you look great.

286
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,644
Doesn't it look great?

287
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:46,697
I think you did
One mistake, gentlemen.

288
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:48,883
My name is Gordon Winslow.

289
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,483
- Now excuse me ...
- Jim ...

290
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,253
The camera really doesn't put you off
in a better light.

291
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:57,417
But certainly
Your daughter looks good.

292
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,362
Sara ...
Sara Louis, are you?

293
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:03,603
It looks great, doesn't it?

294
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:06,443
- Yes. Look great.
- Good.

295
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:07,979
Okay, Jim?

296
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,947
Okay, what do you want?

297
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:15,684
What we want is some money.

298
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,155
About 500,000, to be more precise.

299
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:25,617
James, Jim, Jimmy, Jimbo. You got it
part. We want ours too.

300
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:27,612
What time ?

301
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:36,708
What time ? Because you know what?
You have until tomorrow to bring the money.

302
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,822
Hey V., look.

303
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:42,052
Man, I have an idea.
Come on, D.!

304
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:31,190
<i> I'm going to release some funky lyrics,
which sounds like this ... </i>

305
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:33,412
It's not what you say it's how you say it

306
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,767
Gimmie a microphone

307
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,065
on stage, I display it

308
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,986
Playin' me right, or you get played out

309
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,488
like polka-dots, and people will shout

310
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,446
dirt words, cause your a nerd

311
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:45,222
I'm first to 3rd, it's absurd
to think that' you've heard

312
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:46,927
better rhymes than these

313
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:49,549
I'm bringing soccer
MC, down to their knees

314
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,698
Tease your thoughts,
like a feather to a toe

315
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:53,962
Althought the beast is
slow, my grooves still flow

316
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:56,771
My rhymes are Sofa-Hot, it makes your heart dance

317
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:58,940
Melodic tones move your mind to a quick trance

318
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,865
Everytime I rhyme I find the audience is mine

319
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,090
Over every line

320
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:05,543
Sparkle like a gem with a golden voice

321
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,164
Why do they love you man?

322
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,716
I'm the people's choice

323
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,706
Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

324
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:14,402
I wanna thank you, uh

325
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,402
Just thank you, baby

326
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:20,829
I wanna thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

327
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:23,242
I wanna thank you, uh

328
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,549
Just thank you, baby

329
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:26,694
Let's swing it

330
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,188
Commin outta my ears

331
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,557
The competition?

332
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:53,498
In tears!

333
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:54,414
Dance moves?

334
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,753
By the dozen

335
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:56,778
Battles?

336
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,299
Pasted up, 'cause I love 'em

337
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:01,186
Settin' up suckers like pins on a bowling ball

338
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,891
and you're all gonna fall

339
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:05,769
you won't hit, it's a
bottomless pit of rhymes

340
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:08,023
Coming straight from
the mind of a genius

341
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,728
And I can't be modest

342
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:12,152
When I make a dirty bet I keep it like I promised son

343
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,634
Shake like a leaf when you see me coming in

344
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:17,192
And frankly, you're better off runnin'... fast

345
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:18,897
And don't look back whack

346
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:20,180
Go take a nap

347
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,402
Get off the crack jack

348
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:23,841
Crowds move by the sound of my golden voice

349
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,049
Why do they love you man?

350
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,074
I'm the people's choice

351
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,464
Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

352
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,644
I wanna thank you, baby

353
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:38,773
I'm the people's choice

354
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,904
You don't look bad.

355
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:51,052
Neither do you.

356
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,072
What ?

357
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,469
I was thinking.

358
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:06,536
- What ?
- To you and my agenda.

359
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,369
Agenda?

360
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:15,026
You have 24 hours to return it to me, as
You found it. Sorry, the way you stole it.

361
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,811
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

362
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:25,111
If that's all you want,
why did you dance with me

363
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:28,958
Let me show you I can.

364
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,092
What are you doing ?

365
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:47,803
You made me laugh enough for one night.

366
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,931
I hope you are happy. You made me
laughing in front of friends.

367
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,258
I am sorry,
it was not intentional.

368
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:02,817
But what was your intention?

369
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:07,678
I don't understand, at first you didn't want to go out,
and now, you're behaving like a slut ...

370
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:10,004
I talk with you !

371
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:13,386
You act like that bitch,
what is her name ...

372
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:16,863
And you don't drink, so that's it
You can't use it as an excuse, can you?

373
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,856
I'm willing to forgive you for that.

374
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,779
Hey, I said I'm willing
I forgive you for that.

375
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:33,545
Good ?

376
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,999
I forgot.

377
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:44,430
Nick, no!

378
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,181
I said no !

379
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:50,003
That's all you tell me
Lately.

380
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:52,617
Maybe it means something.

381
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:57,150
Maybe you're looking for a fat man,
or for that weird inside.

382
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:00,734
Do you know anything, Nick?
You really are an idiot.

383
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:05,531
Get in the car, Kathy!

384
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:09,900
I said get in the car!
Hey, I'm talking to you.

385
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:56,318
Come on, climb!
Hurry up !

386
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,452
What was that ?

387
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:19,340
Who were those?

388
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:22,471
I don't know, you bastards.

389
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:23,989
I think so.

390
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:29,764
- I have to go.
- So fast ?

391
00:36:32,438 --> 00:36:34,445
So, what are you doing tomorrow?

392
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,528
I don't know what to do tomorrow, man.

393
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:41,135
- What are we doing ?
- I'm waiting.

394
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:45,128
- Me ?
- My agenda!

395
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,346
Good night.

396
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:05,179
Melted again!

397
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:16,009
- Hi.
- Hi.

398
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,648
Who was that?

399
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:20,450
It was the boy who brought me home.

400
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:23,040
Who is ?
What's his name ?

401
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:26,661
- I do not know.
- You do not know ?

402
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:27,686
No

403
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,738
What ?

404
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:40,310
- What happens ?
- Nothing, Kathy.

405
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:46,443
I recommend you in the future
don't go with strangers anymore.

406
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,751
Dad, if you'll let me explain ...

407
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:54,177
No need to explain.
Not to be repeated.

408
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,356
Good.

409
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:00,493
Thank you.
Good night dear.

410
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:04,331
Good night.

411
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:09,028
Don't worry, Kathy,
everything is alright.

412
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:44,828
"What's the matter, boys?"
- Look who's here!

413
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,750
We play baseball on your motorcycle.

414
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:52,180
It's not mine, it's Sir D.'s.

415
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:54,704
Who is Sir D.?

416
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:57,571
My companion.

417
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:01,847
Take this, comrade!

418
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,364
See you later, sucker.

419
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,389
We don't want to wake mom and dad.

420
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:34,837
What are you doing here ?

421
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,780
You called me.

422
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:38,432
Seriously ?

423
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:41,414
Do not you remember ?

424
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,663
Just like I found it ...

425
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:52,236
Sorry, how I stole it!

426
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,774
So ...

427
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,320
Who is Monique?

428
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,042
Who?

429
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:06,125
You do not know ?
You have her phone number.

430
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,397
And that's you, isn't it?
John Van Owen.

431
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:14,395
Where from...
Give me that !

432
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,482
- Where did you get that from ?
- It slipped out of your pocket.

433
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:22,019
So, is it in the area?
Shall we call her?

434
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:27,438
No, wait, don't tell me.
She's your sister, isn't she?

435
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,467
This was your agenda,
and now you're taking things from me?

436
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:36,795
I made sure I got it
agenda back.

437
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,492
We're even.

438
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:47,819
Yes, we'll see.

439
00:41:57,996 --> 00:41:58,861
Well

440
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:00,985
Well?

441
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:06,266
See you later.

442
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,497
See you now.

443
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,030
See you now ...

444
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,359
You can't stay here,
I need to change.

445
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:24,227
Change ...

446
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:26,303
Do you think I won't do it?

447
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:37,124
Kathy, my mother said ...

448
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:38,703
Tommy, get out of here!

449
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,975
- You came back !
- What's up buddy ?

450
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,715
Are you her new friend?

451
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,586
Tommy, get out of here!

452
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,367
- Is the motorcycle outside yours?
- Tommy!

453
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:51,507
- Yes, have you ever been with one?
- Not.

454
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:52,779
I'm going to go ...

455
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:57,538
- Yes ? When?
- Soon.

456
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,529
After you finish having sex?

457
00:42:59,554 --> 00:43:02,591
Tommy, get out!
That's not funny !

458
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:04,761
- Promise?
- I promise.

459
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:16,396
Kat, if you need to
by me, I will be out ...

460
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,160
Damn !

461
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:27,476
Come on. Put your foot in here.

462
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,256
Hands, right here

463
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,465
- How long have you lived here?
- What is your occupation ?

464
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:47,804
- Say it.
- No, you say.

465
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:50,425
Good. How long
do you live here

466
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,698
Since I was born, why?

467
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:54,844
How is it ?

468
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:56,793
What do you mean?

469
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:00,511
You know, have parents
and stuff like that ...

470
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:06,210
- A brother ... All this ...
- It's nice.

471
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,038
You know you can count on them.

472
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,505
I presume.

473
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:15,730
- What did you want to ask me ?
- Leave it.

474
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:19,646
"Really, what did you want to ask me?"
- Leave it.

475
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:22,366
Does not matter.

476
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:25,098
Where are you from ?

477
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:26,251
From around the area.

478
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:29,824
- From the area?
- Yes.

479
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,517
Don't say too much.

480
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,842
- Not ?
- Not.

481
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:41,007
It doesn't matter where you are from,
but where are you now.

482
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:44,868
And now, I'm with you, Kat.

483
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,061
- Tell me ...
- What the ?

484
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:39,498
How are you having fun around here, student?

485
00:47:41,142 --> 00:47:43,101
Or are you too busy for that?

486
00:47:43,768 --> 00:47:44,744
Not.

487
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:48,860
I don't think it's bad
to work hard.

488
00:47:49,488 --> 00:47:50,546
Imagine.

489
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:57,053
What's important to you?

490
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:00,818
Be honest with yourself,
and disobey others.

491
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:06,582
If you live life for someone else,
It means you don't live.

492
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:09,141
This is the reality.

493
00:48:10,938 --> 00:48:13,588
- Imagine!
- Imagine ...

494
00:48:17,926 --> 00:48:21,949
Sometimes I want to do something wild,
because I never did.

495
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,408
Why don't you?

496
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,810
After you.

497
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:32,425
Well, thanks.

498
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:36,440
- For what ?
- For all.

499
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:48,691
What is this for?

500
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:51,543
To know the difference
between me and Monique.

501
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:57,214
I know the difference between
you and the rest.

502
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:01,116
- Seriously ?
- Yes.

503
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:05,902
- Katherine ...
- Father...

504
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,196
I haven't heard from you all day.
Your mother was scared.

505
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,742
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

506
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,056
You did not think !

507
00:52:16,837 --> 00:52:18,271
You could at least give a call.

508
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:21,634
He couldn't, he was with me.
There were no telephones in the area.

509
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:23,732
Where have you been ?

510
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,041
It was on my engine,
we took a walk.

511
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:30,250
Yes I know.
I met his two friends.

512
00:52:32,064 --> 00:52:32,736
What the ?

513
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:33,527
Who ?

514
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:37,187
Don't act like you don't know about
what is it about. I saw you last night.

515
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:41,172
Go away
and leave my face alone.

516
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,095
But Dad, you don't understand.

517
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,628
No, miss,
you do not understand.

518
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:48,674
Nick arrived at the hospital last night.
Looks like your friend put him in there.

519
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:50,793
Did you do that?

520
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:55,166
Yes. The sucker wanted to play baseball
with my comrade's engine.

521
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,083
Get in.
I'll take care of that.

522
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:57,922
But Dad ..

523
00:52:57,947 --> 00:53:02,216
Inside! Now.

524
00:53:06,074 --> 00:53:07,980
See you tomorrow, Kat.

525
00:53:09,702 --> 00:53:13,430
I don't want you to approach her anymore,
tomorrow or another day.

526
00:53:14,732 --> 00:53:17,130
Isn't that her decision?

527
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:20,674
Get the hell out of here.

528
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:44,030
He needs to know what's going on.

529
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,023
- We need to tell him.
"What can we tell him?"

530
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:48,672
The truth.

531
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:08,365
Tell me, how do I do?

532
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,020
Concrete.

533
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:23,554
I had to tell you this
for a long time.

534
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:25,877
My real name
it's not Winslow.

535
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:33,668
It's Hacket.

536
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,670
James Anthony Hacket.
Jimmy.

537
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,001
Your mother's name is Sara.

538
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:48,816
We had just gotten married.

539
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,511
I was a cop, a novice.

540
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:59,830
And my partner, Walsh,
he wasn't a brain guy.

541
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:10,198
I guess it was me.
I was right, and Walsh, no.

542
00:55:11,213 --> 00:55:14,160
So those in Home Affairs
they decided to do something about it.

543
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:22,387
I did what I thought was right.
Two more police officers were charged with Walsh.

544
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:27,317
They made some threats ...
Your mother was pregnant.

545
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:36,523
And when we were offered to join the program
for the protection of witnesses, I accepted.

546
00:55:36,548 --> 00:55:40,325
In a week, I became
Gordon and Grace Winslow.

547
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,141
I had birth certificates,
college diplomas ...

548
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:52,390
I came here a little
after that you were born.

549
00:55:54,597 --> 00:55:59,654
And that was his end
Jimmy and Sara Hacket, so far.

550
00:56:06,974 --> 00:56:07,831
Last night...

551
00:56:07,856 --> 00:56:13,947
I saw my friend
yours with two men.

552
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,029
The other two cops.
They saw me on TV.

553
00:56:20,394 --> 00:56:21,593
What will they do?

554
00:56:22,973 --> 00:56:26,412
They said to give them the money
I've kept them all these years.

555
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,360
What will happen ?

556
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:32,833
We can't be yet
than caring.

557
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:39,420
Especially with strangers.

558
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,111
He's a bad man, Kathy.
Stay away from him.

559
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:46,337
It's not what you think.

560
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:47,857
How do you know ?

561
00:56:49,186 --> 00:56:51,924
Know. If you knew him,
You know that too.

562
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,690
That's what I want to say. I don't know him,
and you don't know him either.

563
00:56:56,074 --> 00:56:57,338
I know you, Dad.

564
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,829
But that means I can
did he trust you

565
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:03,285
You lied to me all my life!

566
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:05,176
I didn't lie to you, I protected you.

567
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:09,876
Everything I did, good or bad,
I did it for you.

568
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:13,831
Can you say the same about him?

569
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:18,031
It's not fair.
You know.

570
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:24,248
I love you, Katherine.

571
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,339
I love you so much.

572
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:33,380
I gave up my life,
to give you a new one.

573
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:52,311
Father...

574
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:57,259
Are you sure about Johnny?

575
00:57:57,969 --> 00:57:59,796
I want you to stay away from him.

576
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:06,428
Not only for your own good, but also for
the good of your brother, of your mother, and of mine.

577
00:58:32,006 --> 00:58:34,184
What are you doing ?

578
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,042
I was in the area, and I thought
that maybe you want me to take you.

579
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,059
I have someone to go with.
Thank you.

580
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:47,329
- Are you feeling alright ?
- Yes.

581
00:58:51,785 --> 00:58:54,278
- Okay, see you tonight.
- Not.

582
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,732
Not ?

583
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:05,666
Not. Not tonight,
not tomorrow, not at all, okay?

584
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:08,877
I understand.

585
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,065
You're too busy
What do you have to do with it, right?

586
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:15,842
Maybe so, and maybe I did
a good reason to do so.

587
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:22,024
I bet someone gave it to you
this motivation.

588
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,076
Tell me one thing ...

589
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,388
Who are you honest with now?

590
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:43,670
Sometimes I feel like I know you ...

591
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:47,406
But how can you know a person
which you just met?

592
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:54,931
You make me feel special, but from where
I know you don't do that to all the girls?

593
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:59,772
How do I know this isn't just?
Another town, and I'm another Monique.

594
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,659
Are you talking, or your father?

595
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:06,783
I.

596
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,772
I do not know.

597
01:00:13,973 --> 01:00:17,617
Know something ?
You really don't know.

598
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:21,813
You don't know me at all.

599
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:28,267
Well ... You did it this time.

600
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,568
I don't know if Nick
he will get you back.

601
01:01:30,568 --> 01:01:33,158
You could at least visit him at the hospital.

602
01:01:33,158 --> 01:01:36,514
Or call him.
Who do you think You Are ?

603
01:01:36,514 --> 01:01:40,920
Anyway, I don't think it's too late,
if she agrees.

604
01:01:40,945 --> 01:01:44,545
You're kidding ? Do you think she forgives her,
after humiliating him like that?

605
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,872
No way.

606
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:53,835
Tell him how sorry you are
and how much you love him.

607
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,221
Johnny?

608
01:02:22,491 --> 01:02:24,069
Johnny!

609
01:02:24,483 --> 01:02:26,119
What do you think ?

610
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:29,247
You look like the world!

611
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:31,524
Thanks, I did it.

612
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:34,043
Shown.

613
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,104
What's up ?

614
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:41,848
"You mean Kathy?"
- So.

615
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:44,565
Every time I talk about
you, he tells me to shut up.

616
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:47,732
And to me at school, when it happens
So, it means that the girl likes you.

617
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:49,719
Yes ?

618
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:54,156
She thinks I'm a little small,
but I managed to get here.

619
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,142
I was thinking maybe we could take a tour ...

620
01:02:57,994 --> 01:03:00,058
You promised me, remember?

621
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:05,027
Yes. But not now, kid,
I'm a little busy, you know?

622
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:14,630
- Let's go !
- Yes !

623
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:15,655
Alright!

624
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,735
- Come on, put it on!
- I understand.

625
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:57,145
All right.
Help me a little.

626
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:19,834
- She has nothing, Mae.
- Roscoe, listen to me!

627
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:23,407
- That piece won't fit in here.
- Yes, it fits, Mae.

628
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:37,590
Thanks, Johnny, it was concrete!

629
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:40,306
Do you want to see my room?

630
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:41,649
I do not know...

631
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:44,814
It's fine. Kathy has to come
take me later from training.

632
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:47,595
Yes ? Should you be there?

633
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:51,431
I do not care. It's her fault that
I snuck in to come to you.

634
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:55,146
It's fine.
She does what her father tells her.

635
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,460
Yes.
See you.

636
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,025
Hey, Tommy, I'm gone.

637
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,155
All ?

638
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:09,653
Like yesterday.

639
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,080
See you later, buddy!

640
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:28,222
So what will we ...
Look what we have here?

641
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,472
- What are you doing here ?
- What you want ?

642
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:33,203
Why aren't you training?

643
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:35,146
What are you doing here, boy?

644
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:39,725
We are friends with your father.
We came to get some important documents.

645
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,477
Asa e. Act.

646
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:44,190
I do not know you.
I'll call the police.

647
01:06:44,215 --> 01:06:47,476
- You don't want to do this.
- Dial 911!

648
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,475
9-1-1.

649
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,338
Don't come near!

650
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:59,402
I can locate these calls.
I saw it in "America's Most Wanted"!

651
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:02,496
Yes ? You saw the show
when did i show up

652
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:05,227
Help !

653
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:08,011
Back!
- Come here, boy!

654
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:10,596
I'll catch you!

655
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:12,716
Stay away!

656
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:17,319
Don't come near me!

657
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:20,981
You're mine, baby.

658
01:07:21,006 --> 01:07:23,499
Where did you think you were running, buddy?

659
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:28,088
- Remain silent !
- Help !

660
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:31,244
- Help !
- Help !

661
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:39,669
Shut up, you idiot!

662
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:01,745
Tommy?

663
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:04,139
I don't think you heard right.
We're leaving!

664
01:09:04,522 --> 01:09:07,975
- All.
- I have ears, let's go.

665
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:11,524
Beat the plains.

666
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:15,600
You really fell in love.

667
01:09:17,397 --> 01:09:19,265
Are we leaving or not?

668
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,736
Not until you say goodbye.

669
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,280
But I know you made me.

670
01:09:33,037 --> 01:09:36,298
No way.
Not.

671
01:09:54,871 --> 01:10:00,832
It's true. You think we want to see you
always wondering, what would have happened?

672
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:04,118
No, man.
You've already gone too far.

673
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:34,109
What are you doing, Kathy?

674
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:36,899
Nothing.
I was thinking.

675
01:10:36,924 --> 01:10:38,938
Where's Tommy?

676
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:41,095
I thought he was with you.

677
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:47,486
Kathy, I asked you to go
after him at training.

678
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,514
I was, but he wasn't there,
and I thought he was with you.

679
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:57,712
Kathy, did you check into his room?

680
01:10:57,737 --> 01:11:00,422
No but...

681
01:11:05,786 --> 01:11:08,681
- It's not here.
- What the ?

682
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:25,736
It's like I told you
don't come here anymore.

683
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:28,446
I need to talk to Kat.

684
01:11:28,745 --> 01:11:30,663
It's not here.

685
01:11:31,277 --> 01:11:33,483
It's behind you.

686
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:36,822
Do you want to talk or not?

687
01:11:44,477 --> 01:11:48,313
I understand.
You still do what my father says, don't you?

688
01:11:49,302 --> 01:11:51,508
This is for you.

689
01:11:57,982 --> 01:11:59,420
What is it ?

690
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:03,367
It's a tape.

691
01:12:06,003 --> 01:12:09,082
<i> Hi, Mom, Dad and Kathy. </i>

692
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:13,431
<i> I recorded this
box to tell you </i>

693
01:12:13,456 --> 01:12:17,964
<i> how much fun we have together
with my new friends. </i>

694
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:22,534
<i> They told me a lot about you, Dad, </i>

695
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:27,662
<i> and I don't think you behaved
right with them. </i>

696
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:32,961
<i> So I'll stay here until you do. </i>

697
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:39,786
<i> If you change your mind in the next
24 hours, I'll be home. </i>

698
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:43,863
<i> If not, no. </i>

699
01:12:45,588 --> 01:12:50,575
So do what you have to do,
and everything will be fine. </i>

700
01:12:53,784 --> 01:12:58,580
I told you he was involved, too.

701
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,201
Dad, it has nothing to do with this.

702
01:13:01,226 --> 01:13:04,019
God, Kathy, you really believe it
Did he come to see you?

703
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:06,336
He came to bring us this tape.

704
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:11,504
- I'll call the police.
- Not !

705
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:15,238
These young people are on this street,
there must be something there.

706
01:13:21,973 --> 01:13:24,230
Hi, Mr. Winslow.
What are you doing ?

707
01:13:26,078 --> 01:13:28,040
What ?
What I said ?

708
01:13:33,392 --> 01:13:35,790
Something happened to Tommy.

709
01:13:36,064 --> 01:13:37,892
Tommy?
I just saw him.

710
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:40,432
- Where?
- They were going downtown.

711
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,183
Where in the center?

712
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:44,116
You were the mall ...
What do you call it on the street?

713
01:13:44,141 --> 01:13:46,444
Growstreet ...
They were there.

714
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:47,195
Who?

715
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,673
Tommy and the guy from Sugar Shack.

716
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:54,293
It seemed to me that something was wrong,
Tommy looked scared.

717
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:57,642
You're wrong.
You are all wrong!

718
01:13:57,801 --> 01:13:59,972
I know he has nothing to do with this.

719
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:02,416
How can you know for sure?

720
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:05,136
I trust him, Dad.

721
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:07,665
What does that mean?

722
01:14:08,664 --> 01:14:11,759
He went too far.
I'll call the police.

723
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:13,695
Father...

724
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,258
We must be careful.

725
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:19,160
- They'll do something.
- I can not take it anymore !

726
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:29,943
Trust him, great!

727
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:32,845
It's an emergency, please!

728
01:14:40,552 --> 01:14:41,749
Not !

729
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:05,963
Johnny, we need to talk!

730
01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:09,599
We have to talk.

731
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:19,942
You need a psychiatrist.

732
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:29,299
Please listen to this.

733
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,703
What is this ?

734
01:15:35,384 --> 01:15:37,834
My brother was abducted.

735
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:41,837
<i> So I'll stay here until then ... </i>

736
01:15:42,862 --> 01:15:49,169
<i> If you change your mind in the next ones
24 hours, I'll be home. </i>

737
01:15:49,194 --> 01:15:52,838
<i> If not, no. </i>

738
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:59,438
So do what you have to do,
and everything will be fine. </i>

739
01:16:00,832 --> 01:16:01,832
Then no

740
01:16:03,804 --> 01:16:06,255
We have to hurry.

741
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:10,649
Then no

742
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:15,664
That sound ...
I know that sound.

743
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:18,183
What sound?
Where is it heard?

744
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:20,014
Do you hear him?

745
01:16:20,937 --> 01:16:21,937
Then no

746
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,407
That beating ...

747
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:35,910
You took me there, I was ...

748
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,502
- On the job site!
- Yes.

749
01:16:40,343 --> 01:16:42,165
Where am I ?

750
01:16:42,749 --> 01:16:44,379
Drive!

751
01:16:44,404 --> 01:16:46,035
Where am I ?

752
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,528
- Around here !
- Where am I ?

753
01:16:47,634 --> 01:16:49,552
Is he here somewhere?

754
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,257
I don't know, it can be anywhere!

755
01:16:58,752 --> 01:17:03,452
Hey, fool, look at this.

756
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:06,209
Here's what we have here.

757
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,642
The Martians landed.

758
01:17:09,642 --> 01:17:13,766
They're cute.
They have beautiful motorcycles ...

759
01:17:17,905 --> 01:17:19,919
Take that thing out of my eyes.

760
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:22,196
You are ours.

761
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,482
Just because we can't hear them,
It doesn't mean I'm not here.

762
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:30,337
Forget it.
Let's go.

763
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:37,569
Who is the Martian leader?
Is he your leader too?

764
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:41,022
You're not even close.

765
01:17:41,604 --> 01:17:43,810
You are ours.

766
01:17:51,485 --> 01:17:57,431
Leaves...
And they're gone!

767
01:18:02,773 --> 01:18:06,418
You know, kid, if your father
don't give in,

768
01:18:07,372 --> 01:18:09,674
you will get a picture
on a can of milk.

769
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:11,088
Do you know what that means?

770
01:18:11,088 --> 01:18:16,233
It means that my friend here,
the cute one, if he doesn't get what he wants,

771
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:17,911
he gets very angry.

772
01:18:17,936 --> 01:18:20,519
- I'm getting very angry!
- Shut up !

773
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:28,073
After the whole thing is over
That, I will buy a house.

774
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:29,632
One exactly like this.

775
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:36,477
- What was that ?
- What the ?

776
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:38,860
To stay.

777
01:18:39,555 --> 01:18:43,391
What the ?
You're confused, I don't hear anything.

778
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,140
I told you, officer,
my nephew is gone.

779
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,608
Do you have any idea where he is?

780
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:34,935
Back to Harward, where else?

781
01:19:35,449 --> 01:19:39,871
That's right, he has an exam
important in chemistry, tomorrow.

782
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:42,682
That's his specialty, chemistry.

783
01:19:42,707 --> 01:19:47,598
And a little and modern dance.

784
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,957
If it sounds like boarding school ...

785
01:19:54,274 --> 01:19:56,288
What the hell ?

786
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:08,546
Hi, what are you doing?

787
01:20:08,661 --> 01:20:14,223
Tommy! You all right ?

788
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:16,614
Mom, calm down!

789
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,822
Everyone is looking at us!

790
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:28,157
God, they made you
this hair?

791
01:20:28,192 --> 01:20:31,131
No, I did it!

792
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:33,324
It's bad, isn't it?

793
01:20:35,612 --> 01:20:37,434
I'll be there in a moment.

794
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,293
I didn't hurt anything, Mom.

795
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:54,375
Thank you.

796
01:20:57,671 --> 01:20:59,338
It does not matter anymore.

797
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:08,952
See you later.

798
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:10,991
- Not too late.
- Good.

799
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,732
Do you know I left here?

800
01:21:19,757 --> 01:21:22,442
I thought we were leaving!

801
01:21:23,882 --> 01:21:27,430
What are you going to do, student?

802
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:34,050
I don't know, college doesn't start
tonight, smart!

803
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,534
Then let's go.

804
01:21:46,707 --> 01:21:48,049
Kathy.

805
01:21:50,324 --> 01:21:51,762
Do you know what you're doing?

806
01:21:53,787 --> 01:21:54,721
I hope not.

807
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:56,159
I hope you like being loved
a motorcyclist,

808
01:21:56,184 --> 01:21:59,062
because you will never see me again
on me or my car.

809
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,830
Imagine.

810
01:22:10,682 --> 01:22:13,080
- Hold on tight.
- Where are we going?

811
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,381
I forgot something...
