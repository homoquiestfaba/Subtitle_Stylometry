1
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,012
- Alice!

2
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,782
Where the hell are you Alice!?

3
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,054
Alice!

4
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,026
Alice where the hell are you?

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,029
- I'm coming!

6
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,598
Oh, dear god.

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,434
- Alice!

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,271
Where the hell are you, Alice?

9
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:20,079
Why don't you make yourself
useful and clean me up?

10
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,153
What are you doing?

11
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,389
I said what are you doing?

12
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,525
Alice?

13
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,960
Alice?

14
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,396
Alice please...

15
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,140
- Mama!

16
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,508
Mom!

17
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,012
- Honey, honey, honey?

18
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,548
- Mommy, why did the boy come?

19
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,951
- Oh no, it's just
a bad dream, honey,

20
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,319
it's just a bad dream.

21
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,687
Shh.

22
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,754
Hey guys.

23
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,123
- Hey.

24
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,290
- Hi.

25
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,959
- Thank you.

26
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,061
God, is this old or something?

27
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,262
It tastes like shit.

28
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,330
- How do you know
what shit tastes like?

29
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,198
- Morgan...

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,933
Thank you doll, I
appreciate that.

31
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,468
- Sorry it just tastes
like crap to me.

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,237
Oh well, got to go.

33
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,139
Bye hun.

34
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,174
Bye sweetie.

35
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,575
- Bye.

36
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,311
- Love you, my princess.

37
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,315
I wish she liked us more.

38
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,719
- Aw baby, she loves
you more than anything.

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,655
- That's so stupid, so typical,

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,957
I mean what else are
you supposed to say?

41
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,426
- I wish we could have
one morning in this house,

42
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,162
one breakfast without you guys

43
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,763
bickering, bickering, bickering,

44
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,632
always got to complain
about something.

45
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,734
Mama's not perfect,
mama's not perfect.

46
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,968
Guess what?

47
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,770
You're not perfect either.

48
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,409
- High-class chef
cuisine people on a budget.

49
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,744
Want to go through
some of the selections?

50
00:02:58,746 --> 00:02:59,945
- I sure do.
- - Great.

51
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,715
- We have raisin
remoulade, spicy sushi.

52
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,786
Parisian pate,
and truffle tacos.

53
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,355
- Truffle tacos, which is
what we actually made here,

54
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,026
it's prepackaged, you
just add meat, water,

55
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,061
put it in the
microwave, and uh...

56
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,163
Voila!

57
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,331
We're going to pass it around,

58
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,300
everyone will get
a chance to try it.

59
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,708
- Mom!

60
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,676
- Mommy!

61
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,910
- Hey, what's up, baby?

62
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,378
- Oh, I don't feel so good.

63
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,681
Oh boy.

64
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,729
- Hey baby give
me your forehead.

65
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,819
You're warm!

66
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,621
Here, lie down for me.

67
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,499
Hey, you sexy thing.

68
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,035
It's Wednesday.

69
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,340
- I'm so tired though.

70
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,809
I'm sorry I just didn't
realize, and I put

71
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,644
my thing in already.

72
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,581
- Okie dokie.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,856
- I'm sorry, I know it matters.

74
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,959
- It's OK baby, I don't care.

75
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,025
- Mama, mommy!

76
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,660
- What's wrong, what's happened?

77
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,761
What's wrong?

78
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,296
- I had a bad dream.

79
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,531
- Aw, honey, about what?

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,734
- A bad boy.

81
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,773
- It's OK, just a bad dream.

82
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,676
I'll sleep with you, OK?

83
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,843
All right?

84
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,111
Come on.

85
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,448
Oh, my sweetheart,
it's going to be OK.

86
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,929
- And I'll see you
next Tuesday at four.

87
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,764
It's going to be fine
bud, you'll get through.

88
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,166
Thanks for stopping in.

89
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,168
Look who's here, hey baby.

90
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,603
That was my last client
of the day, I am free!

91
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,139
Ah.

92
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,041
- So...

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,243
You got some time, right?

94
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,145
- Sure, I'm done today.

95
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,981
- I have a secret.

96
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,516
- OK, tell me!

97
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,954
- I'm having a baby.

98
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,856
- No, really.

99
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,491
Oh my god...

100
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,296
Let's go tell the kids.

101
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,597
Give me a kiss.

102
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,932
Let me grab my coat.

103
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,509
- Why are you wearing those for?

104
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,144
- We gave her night
vision goggles

105
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,613
so now she can see and
I can get some sleep.

106
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,981
- That's a great idea!

107
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,516
- Good plan, Morgan!

108
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,717
Come here, baby.

109
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,818
- I love you.

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,086
- Goodnight.

111
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,955
- You smart little man.

112
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,224
Hey, kisses girly!

113
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,526
I love you babe.

114
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,694
- I love you.

115
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,330
- Oh, have sweet
dreams, buddy boy.

116
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,498
- OK goodnight.

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,366
- See you in the morning.

118
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,203
- Wait, you're going to work?

119
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,472
- Silly, the
baby's the size of a peanut.

120
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,241
Yeah, I go to work.

121
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,676
- What are we going
to name the baby?

122
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,879
See, I told you, I'm
getting a baby brother!

123
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,714
- I have no idea if
it's a boy or a girl

124
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,582
or anything like
that, but I do know

125
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,504
that we should
name it Wednesday.

126
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,388
- But you'll stop work
when the baby comes, right?

127
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,689
How long until the baby comes?

128
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,691
- Only 6 months!

129
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,727
And yeah, I'm probably going
to stop for a little bit,

130
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,649
just like I did
with you and Ariel.

131
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,098
- Why don't you just
keep having babies?

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,332
Then you don't have to work!

133
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,835
- It kind of doesn't
work that way.

134
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:17,969
- That's a plan.

135
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,838
- We'd end up
homeless or something.

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,340
- This lady on TV,
she has like 20 kids,

137
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,109
and she gets paid
to have a TV show

138
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,978
with her husband, her
and all of her 20 kids.

139
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,480
- I've seen that show.

140
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,582
You don't have to
have a lot of kids,

141
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,084
to live a different kind
of a life, you know?

142
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,520
- Well, right now,
I've got to go to work.

143
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,556
And I will see you
as soon as I can.

144
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,463
- You have a good day.

145
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,364
- You too, hun.

146
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,867
Bye guys!

147
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,550
- Well I'm sorry,
but there's nothing

148
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,719
obviously wrong with Sophia.

149
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,856
There's isn't any evidence
of a stroke or anything.

150
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,059
I think we ought to
take her into the city

151
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,028
to the hospital to
have some tests done.

152
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,733
What happened just before
she started screaming?

153
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,303
- Nothing.

154
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,539
Nothing really happened.

155
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,842
- Well your mother's
getting on in age,

156
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,677
it could be many things.

157
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,614
She should be
properly checked out.

158
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,317
I'll show myself out.

159
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,653
- I'll let you out, doctor.

160
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,464
I think we'll finally try
it my way now, mother.

161
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,442
- Everything alright, Alice?

162
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,212
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

163
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,147
Thank you for coming.

164
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,649
- Mmhmm.

165
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,742
- Oh no, no, no, no, no...

166
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,062
- Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

167
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,998
We have two healthy,
amazing kids,

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,266
we're already so lucky, baby.

169
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,003
- I just feel like
it's my fault.

170
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,572
- Hey, can't say that.

171
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,610
- Maybe if I did something
differently or...

172
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,646
I don't know, something.

173
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,248
I feel like a horrible person,

174
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,984
I mean look at my job, and
I'm just obsessed with money,

175
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,755
and I market mac and
cheese, that's like,

176
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,289
not what I'm supposed to do,

177
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,392
I'm supposed to be
a writer, remember?

178
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,929
- We have a family, we live in

179
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,532
an expensive city, it's logical.

180
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,288
- Hello, Alice.

181
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,323
Listen, I heard
about your mother.

182
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,393
- She doesn't need last
rites, so you can go.

183
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,395
- I'd really like to see her.

184
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,931
- Why do you want to see her?

185
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,667
- Well, because I
worry about her.

186
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,970
- You know you're too funny.

187
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,473
You're worried about her now.

188
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,742
I guess it helps that
she can't talk, huh?

189
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,010
- Alice, may I please?

190
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,045
- No, you may not.

191
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,014
Goodbye.

192
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,083
- You cannot blame me.

193
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,051
- I can blame whoever I want to.

194
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,287
Now, goodbye.

195
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,655
- Alice.

196
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,319
- Hey, lunch break?

197
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,055
- Maybe on that.

198
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,324
- You look upset,
what's up, baby?

199
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,560
- I quit.

200
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,962
- What?

201
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,499
- You know the last
six weeks I've been

202
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,734
trying to deal with
it, and it's just

203
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,803
not getting any better.

204
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,974
The effect that little baby
had on me, it's just huge.

205
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,976
I can't go back
to my normal life.

206
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,577
I can't.

207
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,784
- Do you remember Dr. Wiley?

208
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,319
Well he's sick, and he
can't keep up anymore,

209
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,821
so he's asked me
if I will come out,

210
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,257
and take over his
practice on the island.

211
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,759
So what do you say we
take a drive out there,

212
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,228
and we decide if we
want to stay, huh?

213
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,630
Hm?

214
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,973
- La, la, la, la...

215
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,543
la, la, la, la.

216
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,544
- Ariel.

217
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,778
- La, la, la, la.

218
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,779
- Ariel!

219
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,014
- La, la, la, la.

220
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,916
- Ariel, can
you please be quiet?

221
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,184
I'm trying to concentrate.

222
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,418
- What?

223
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,920
La, la, la
- Shut the hell up!

224
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,154
- Morgan!
- - La, la, la.

225
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,923
- Morgan, don't you ever
talk to her that way!

226
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,057
- Never talk
to your sister that way.

227
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,492
Do you hear me, young man?

228
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,927
- La, la, la, la.
- - Ever again.

229
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,061
- Give me the iPad.
- - La, la, la, la.

230
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,362
- What?

231
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,630
- Give me, now.
- - La, la, la, la, la.

232
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,165
La la la.

233
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,734
- La, la, la.
- - Jeeze.

234
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,204
- Ariel...
- - La, la, la, la.

235
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,505
- Ariel, hey!

236
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,873
- Did you say something, mom?

237
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,508
- Yeah, give me the iPod.

238
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,210
Give it to me, I don't...
- Now!

239
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,245
Give your mother the iPod.

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,714
- Enjoy the scenery, OK?

241
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,685
- How can we enjoy the scenery
if you're forcing us to?

242
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,394
- Was that the...

243
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,897
- Yep, sounds like
a transmission.

244
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,432
- What's going on?

245
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,601
- Mommy, can you call someone?

246
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,202
- Do we have any service?

247
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,971
- Service...

248
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,939
Uh...

249
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,641
Shit, no.

250
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,345
Now we'll have to do
it the old fashion way!

251
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,780
Get out, take a walk...

252
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,649
Find a house, use a land line.

253
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,584
- What's a land line?

254
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,986
- Jeeze.

255
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,053
- Alright, daddy's right.

256
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,588
C'mon, let's walk it, guys.

257
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,123
Country will be good for us.

258
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,860
- Come on, baby.

259
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,963
Hit that little latch for me,

260
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,899
- Cool.
- - So cold.

261
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,166
- I know.

262
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,371
Don't worry, we'll make it.

263
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,108
- This is a great big old house.

264
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,010
They're bound to have
at least one phone.

265
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,145
- I hope so.

266
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,548
- They've got
a fireplace in there,

267
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,317
look at all the chimneys.

268
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,658
- There she is.

269
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,397
- Here we go.

270
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,564
Hi.

271
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,133
- Hi.

272
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,634
Can I help you with something?

273
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,069
- Yes.

274
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,871
Our car broke down, and
our cellphones don't work.

275
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,539
May we use your land line?

276
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,309
- Oh, um, yeah, I suppose.

277
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,477
- Thank you so
much, come on guys!

278
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,118
- Come in, please, sit down,
make yourselves at home.

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,586
I'll show you
where the phone is.

280
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,088
- Thank you.

281
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,991
- The phone's right here.

282
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,226
- Wow, thanks again for this.
- - Your're welcome.

283
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,297
- See what we got going here.

284
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,032
OK.

285
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,673
- Oh, it's so dark in here.

286
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,275
- Old people like the dark.

287
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,177
- She's not that old, Morgan.

288
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,245
- She thinks she is.

289
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,419
What's that?

290
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,321
- I don't know.

291
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,092
- Ah, it's going to be a while.

292
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,693
- Uh, I'll let you do your work

293
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,795
and I'll go keep
your family company.

294
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,467
- Oh, boy.

295
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,003
That's attractive.

296
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,809
- So what brings
you around here?

297
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,278
- We're actually kind
of house-hunting.

298
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,448
- Oh really, what kind of
house are you looking for?

299
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,350
- A good one, that's clean.

300
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,419
- Uh, we're not really sure.

301
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,620
I guess, you know,
we'll probably

302
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,389
figure it out when we see it.

303
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,359
Do you have children?

304
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,627
- No, no, no.

305
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,396
It's probably just my mother.

306
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,099
So what kind of house
would you guys like?

307
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,768
- I want a big one, like this.

308
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,469
- This house really
isn't so big.

309
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,905
- It's pretty big compared
to anything in New York City.

310
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,007
- I was actually, um,
thinking of renting it out.

311
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,542
- You are?

312
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,444
- You know, my mother and I
don't need all this space,

313
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:30,148
and this kind of a house
would really like a family.

314
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,284
- Well they said
they'll be here in 45 minutes!

315
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,086
- Well you're more than welcome

316
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,221
to relax in here while you wait.

317
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,856
- Oh, thank you so much!

318
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,024
- Thanks, actually I think I'd

319
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,592
really like to get
some fresh air.

320
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,527
- Me too.

321
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,694
- Come on, come on sweetheart.

322
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,063
Thank you so much, though.

323
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,264
- You're very welcome.

324
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,299
- Thanks again, really, truly.

325
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,134
- You're welcome.

326
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,870
- Pretty pleasing.

327
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,752
- Not at all when
I was in there.

328
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,142
It is an impressive
place though.

329
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,778
I like the idea of renting as
opposed to buying, you know?

330
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,547
- Yeah, unless
this country life

331
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,215
is completely horrible.

332
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,585
- It could happen!

333
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,489
- Okay, get her number
before we go, OK.

334
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,723
- Yeah.

335
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,659
I'm going to talk to
the kids about it, K?

336
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,427
- Good, good, good.

337
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,367
- Wanna know something crazy?

338
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,236
We could actually
rent this place.

339
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,205
What do you think of that?

340
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,539
- We'd have to clean it...

341
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,274
they remind me of hoarders!

342
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,644
- OK, deal.

343
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,847
Ariel?

344
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,381
Ariel.

345
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,252
Ariel, sweetie, hey, honey.

346
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,690
What do you think if we
maybe rent this place?

347
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,492
Would you like to live here?

348
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,766
- OK mommy.

349
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,402
- Honey, honey look
if you don't want

350
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,904
to live here that's fine.

351
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,472
But tell me.

352
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,745
- No, it's fine.

353
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,947
We just need to make
it bright inside.

354
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,850
- OK honey, we can do that.

355
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,867
What is that?

356
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,203
Oh, cool!

357
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,413
You know what, I bet that
belonged to Alice, honey.

358
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,696
Come on, why don't we
go and give it to her?

359
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,673
Who knows how long it's
been since she saw it.

360
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,389
- I can't believe you found her!

361
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,959
I thought my mother
threw her out!

362
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,128
- Why would she do that?

363
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,533
- I dunno.

364
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,070
- I want you to have her.

365
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,594
- Where you guys been?

366
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,162
- The old house down there.

367
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,763
- That house there?

368
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,834
People go in there and
never come back out.

369
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,838
I'm just kidding, come on.

370
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,307
What's wrong with the car?

371
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,909
- We're driving along,
and we hear this sound

372
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,178
"ba da bum bum" like the
transmission dropped out.

373
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,779
- Uh huh.

374
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,982
Alright, do the key.

375
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,356
- Have a good one.

376
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,757
- I knew when I heard...

377
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,392
- Yeah, a
ghost's in your car, right?

378
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,728
Scary, woo!

379
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,099
- Oh god, that was too weird!

380
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,015
- So, what
brings you guys out this way?

381
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,183
Really?

382
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,620
Oh, well you know, it's funny,

383
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,857
I was actually thinking
of renting out this house.

384
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,826
This house needs a
family, you know.

385
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:40,298
- Really does, can use
some life in it, you know?

386
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,204
- It's just
way too big for me and my mom.

387
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,914
- This could be fun.

388
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,016
What do you think?

389
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,451
- Oh, it really could be.

390
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,653
And we could rent out
the brownstown, right?

391
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,156
If we could make
enough to live off of,

392
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,291
and, it's cheap out here.

393
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,893
It would be so fun.

394
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,661
- And you could have an office,

395
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,763
the house is sure
big enough for it!

396
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,498
- I could, couldn't I?

397
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,202
- OK.

398
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:19,804
Let's just do it.

399
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,272
- OK!

400
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,040
I love you too.

401
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,809
- Sweet dreams.

402
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,409
- Hello?

403
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,078
Oh, yeah.

404
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,151
Well that sounds wonderful.

405
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,820
Um, I'll probably
need a couple of weeks

406
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,822
to clean the place out.

407
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,591
And if it's OK
with you, I'd like

408
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,627
to leave a lot of
the big pieces here.

409
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,797
OK!

410
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,466
I think this is going to
be great for everyone.

411
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,469
OK.

412
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,304
Alright, thanks, I will...

413
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,540
I guess we'll speak soon!

414
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,443
OK, alright, bye bye now.

415
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,919
I've sold everything that I can.

416
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,422
There's nothing left to sell.

417
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,094
I just can't handle
the bills anymore.

418
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,865
So I'm going to rent the house.

419
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,305
If I could leave
you in it, I would.

420
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:08,913
There's a nice family that
would like to live here.

421
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,918
So I think we should let them.

422
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,255
They have children.

423
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,359
Oh god, you're so messy.

424
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,671
- I'm so excited.

425
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,873
Hey!

426
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,807
- Are we going to get
to come and visit?

427
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,008
- Yeah.

428
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,376
- We're moving!

429
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,445
- You guys are really
moving to the country, huh?

430
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,546
- Yeah.

431
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,515
- The country?
- - What's it like?

432
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,916
- It's nice.
- - I dunno,

433
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,417
we just call it the country.

434
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,906
This is boring, I'm
going to go get a snack.

435
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,591
- Thanks guys!

436
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,528
- Hey, thanks for
the help, you two!

437
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,034
I got to tell you baby,

438
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,576
I didn't think we
were going to make it.

439
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,707
But we did.

440
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,342
- Yeah.

441
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,911
- I love you.

442
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,782
- A creature?

443
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,484
- Yeah, our little ones.

444
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,123
- I have your lease all ready.

445
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,593
Um, I think it's OK.

446
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,762
- Thank you so much.

447
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,069
- That's for you guys.

448
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,470
- I'll give this to you.

449
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,572
- Thank you.
- - Here's your pen.

450
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,040
- Thank you.
- - Sure.

451
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,744
- I don't know what to say,
if you need anything...

452
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,181
call me, and enjoy the house.

453
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,816
Oh, and...

454
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,293
You have fun, OK?

455
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,762
Take care of baby doll!

456
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,200
My mom is in the car,
so if you don't mind,

457
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,102
I'm going to get
out of your way!

458
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,204
- Thank you so much.
- OK, I'll talk with you soon!

459
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,973
Alright, bye bye!

460
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,508
- That was so sweet, baby.

461
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,982
- You're going to have
a great life here!

462
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,024
- Ew.

463
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,492
- Ew!

464
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,327
I don't... wait, let's go.

465
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,002
- Ugh, it's so dirty!

466
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,503
Ew, let's get out of here.

467
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,971
- Ew, yucky.

468
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,232
Do you like this house?

469
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,735
- Sure, I guess, there's a
lot of stuff to jump over.

470
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,605
- You don't feel
funny or anything?

471
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,640
- What's that mean?

472
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,810
Ariel, you want to play?

473
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,045
- No.

474
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,980
- What's wrong with you?

475
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,214
- Nothing.

476
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,016
- I wish I had a brother.

477
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,116
- Oh, Jon.

478
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,686
Can you look?

479
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,755
I don't wanna.

480
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,523
It's not funny.

481
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,258
Smudgey's not there.

482
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,893
- OK.
- - Oh, crap.

483
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,529
What are we going to do?

484
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,597
- Why am I laughing?

485
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,998
- Why are you laughing?

486
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
- Well, well, we'll
get another one,

487
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,035
he'll never know the difference.

488
00:28:58,037 --> 00:28:59,870
- You got to be kidding, Morgan?

489
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,872
Morgan notices everything.

490
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,909
- OK...

491
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,280
I'll just have to tell him.

492
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,815
- But he was there
when we got here!

493
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,183
He's somewhere in this house!

494
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,384
- He might be.

495
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,386
But know this, if
we can't find him,

496
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,088
your mom and I will
get you another one.

497
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,289
- I don't want another one!

498
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,958
I want my Smudgey!

499
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,459
I'll find him!

500
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,261
- I hope so!

501
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,997
Not likely.

502
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,100
Here we go.

503
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,869
- I feel so good.

504
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,105
Weird.

505
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,907
Can you stop?

506
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,475
- Excuse me?

507
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,119
You are so... hot.

508
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,954
- Oh, baby!

509
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,023
- Mom, we picked a room!

510
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,191
- Really?

511
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,592
- Yeah, we decided
to share a room,

512
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,928
since you know, like she
has night terrors and stuff.

513
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,464
- Don't you guys
want your own room?

514
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,799
- No, I don't really care.

515
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,900
- No?

516
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,001
You?

517
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,636
- No.
- - Cool, alright!

518
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,371
- Why don't you show me, guys?

519
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,473
- Mommy, look,
it's really pretty.

520
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,774
I picked the small room.

521
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,783
- Hm.

522
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,155
Oh.

523
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,902
- Give me kisses!

524
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:40,938
- Goodnight mama!

525
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,005
- Goodnight!

526
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,874
Oh, oh!

527
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,310
Alright, goodnight guys!

528
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,244
- Goodnight!

529
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,946
- I love you!

530
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,449
Jon.

531
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,051
- What baby?

532
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,553
- You know how I am
about closet doors.

533
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,859
- I remember specifically
closing that.

534
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,165
Just like this, I went...

535
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,601
ba-da-bum.

536
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,978
Gotcha!

537
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,917
Hit that light and snuggle.

538
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,485
There you go, baby.

539
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,053
Come here.

540
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,356
Wrap yourself around your hubby.

541
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,449
- Hey baby...

542
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,052
what are you doing?

543
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,077
- Honey, baby what's wrong?

544
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,178
Why are you crying?

545
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,214
- Mommy!

546
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,415
- Daddy! Mommy!

547
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,583
- Mommy!

548
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:07,818
Ariel!

549
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,152
- What happened?
- - Mommy!

550
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,721
- Honey, what happened?

551
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,589
- What in the
hell is going on, baby?

552
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,724
- Mommy!

553
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,592
- What's wrong?

554
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,359
- Hey baby.
- - Hey, got your coat.

555
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,129
- Thanks.

556
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,735
Man, what the hell
happened last night?

557
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,071
- It was crazy, I don't
know, I don't know.

558
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,008
- Moving is stressful
for certain,

559
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,844
but between Ariel's
nightmares and your...

560
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,581
- You know maybe this like,
new lust I have for you

561
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,250
is something to do with
not grieving the baby,

562
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,152
and maybe I'm flipping it, or..

563
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,753
I mean I'm trying to figure
it out, but you know what?

564
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,888
- Possibility.

565
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,257
- I feel like a
teenager and I like it.

566
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,591
- I'm loving it.

567
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,393
Are you still good
with this move?

568
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,261
- Yeah.

569
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,228
- Yeah?

570
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,630
- Yeah.

571
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,899
And the high-speed internet
guy's coming today,

572
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,067
and you know, that will get us

573
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,368
back in touch with
the outside world.

574
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,335
It's good.

575
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,470
- OK, cool.

576
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,638
There's a great
counselling group at the

577
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,541
community that Willy
used to run, so...

578
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,409
I'll go make an appearance.

579
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,244
- Oh, full day, hope
it's a good one.

580
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,347
- Yeah, I love you, my
hot little teenager.

581
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,392
- Man, I should have done
this a long time ago.

582
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,865
Where's my new little toy?

583
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,835
Mmhmm.

584
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,103
OK.

585
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:16,780
Damn, just when I got my ice
cream and it was perfect...

586
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,082
Everything was nice...

587
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,951
What the hell does he want?

588
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,489
Jesus.

589
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,124
- Hello, Alice.

590
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,159
- Sorry.

591
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,594
- It's fine.

592
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:33,163
- Can I... can I come in?

593
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,733
- Why?

594
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,802
- I'd like to see Sophia.

595
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,937
- What do you have, some
like weird fascination

596
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,006
with her or something?

597
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,008
- Alice, please.

598
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,043
- Come on.

599
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,448
- Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you,

600
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,883
blessed art thou above women,

601
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,151
and blessed is the fruit...

602
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,952
- What are you praying for?

603
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,088
- Her soul.

604
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,358
- You actually think
praying is going to help?

605
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,926
- I have faith that it will.

606
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:04,794
- You don't know shit.

607
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,930
- Look I understand
if you're upset,

608
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,999
it must be difficult
to see her like this.

609
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,800
It is for me.

610
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,670
She was always so beautiful.

611
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,440
- Apparently you can't see what
her soul really looks like.

612
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,809
Or you wouldn't be
saying things like that.

613
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,413
- Alice.

614
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,116
Don't you dare take
this out on her,

615
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:28,752
or me, for you having
failed in life.

616
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,921
- Me having failed?

617
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,024
I gave up my whole life.

618
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,961
Now, thanks for checking on us.

619
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,564
You can go now.

620
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,267
Go!

621
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,947
- Wanna go on a Smudgey search?

622
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,415
- No, I'm good.

623
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,584
- You could bring your doll.

624
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,352
- I'm good.

625
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,353
- We could pretend
it's a little girl

626
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,988
that you're trying to save.

627
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,256
- It's a boy.

628
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,191
- Looks like a girl to me.

629
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,161
- He told me it's a boy.

630
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,797
- That's creepy.

631
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,433
You don't look too good.

632
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,500
- I'm fine.

633
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,369
- I'm going to go get mama.

634
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,313
- Mom.

635
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,083
Something's wrong with Ariel.

636
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,150
- What do you mean?

637
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,919
- She looks sick.

638
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,354
- She seems fine to me, babe.

639
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,923
- No, I'm not kidding, you
have to go out and see.

640
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,625
- Honey, she ate like
a fiend at breakfast,

641
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,393
sick kids don't do that.

642
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:46,496
- Maybe she has parasites
like "Monsters in My Stomach."

643
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,499
This one kid had
parasites in his stomach,

644
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,001
and they were eating
all the food in his gut,

645
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,636
so he was always hungry.

646
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,173
- OK.

647
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,608
Come on.

648
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,111
Ariel.

649
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,746
Sweetie.

650
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,048
You don't feel good?

651
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,018
- I told Morgan I'm fine.

652
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,354
- You don't look fine, honey.

653
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,822
Come on.

654
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,297
Let me look at you, honey.

655
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,833
How do you feel?

656
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,368
Are you OK?

657
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,803
- I'm sad.

658
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,872
- About what, honey?

659
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,907
- I don't know.

660
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,676
- Maybe there's
lead in this house.

661
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:33,877
- Lead?

662
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,012
- Yeah, some kid on
TV, he got retarded

663
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,447
because he ate lead paint.

664
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,516
- We haven't lived here
long enough for that.

665
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:41,551
And it only happens
if you're a baby.

666
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,286
Maybe you need more sleep...

667
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,022
- No, not more sleep, please.

668
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,292
Why are they asking
me so many questions?

669
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,429
Go, go, go, go, go...
- What are you doing, honey?

670
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,065
Was she talking to the baby?

671
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,100
- Yeah, she was
talking to the doll.

672
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,469
It's really creepy, she
does it all the time.

673
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,940
- Thank you so much, it's going

674
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,709
to be great to be back online.

675
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,310
- No problem.

676
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,112
Enjoy.

677
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,465
- Hey Morgan, internet's up!

678
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,600
- Hi!
- - HI.

679
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:04,768
- Can I help you?

680
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,770
- I'm Father Thomas,
I was friends

681
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,872
with the family that lived here.

682
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,174
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought

683
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:15,111
I'd stop by and just say
welcome to the new family.

684
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,847
- Thank you,
that's so sweet of you.

685
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,282
Uh, actually, if you're here

686
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,551
to try to get us to go
to church or something,

687
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:24,020
I'm sorry but I'm not
the church-going type.

688
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,455
- But you can
understand how I might

689
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,691
confuse you with an Irish
Catholic with your red hair.

690
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,561
- Actually, it's
funny, I was baptized,

691
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,897
but I chose to
never get confirmed.

692
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,565
- Ah.

693
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,937
I just wanted to say if
there's anything I can ever do,

694
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,473
if I could help or if
you would like to talk,

695
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:47,610
or, um, doesn't have
to be religious,

696
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,614
just wanted to let you know
that I could be available.

697
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,916
- Thank you.

698
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,684
That's very sweet.

699
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,119
I'm married to therapist though.

700
00:40:56,121 --> 00:41:00,223
- Well, you never know.

701
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:04,594
Anyway, keep me in mind, and
I just wanted to say welcome,

702
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,197
and hope to see you
around the neighborhood.

703
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,665
- Thank you.

704
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,704
- Nice to meet you.

705
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,339
- Nice meeting you too.

706
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,536
- Are you OK, mom?

707
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,304
- Yeah, I'm fine.

708
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,406
- Was that a priest?

709
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,843
- Yeah, yeah, Father Thomas.

710
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,546
- Why don't we go to church?

711
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,916
- I don't think a priest is the
only one who can talk to God

712
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:02,685
for me, and I just...

713
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,921
I don't think it's good to
give your power away like that.

714
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,190
- That's what church is about?

715
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,193
- Yeah, it's about
a lot of things, honey.

716
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,195
But you know, if you
really want to go sometime,

717
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,863
we could check it out.

718
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,633
- Ariel's still asleep.

719
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,002
- Yeah maybe she's tired.

720
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,538
- Oh, I went on
the internet today,

721
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,739
and I found out we can find

722
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,407
Smudgey with the
night vision goggles,

723
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,776
when it's dark, you can
see its glowing eyes!

724
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,245
- Mmm, that sounds pretty cool.

725
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,714
You wanna try it?

726
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,249
- Yeah.

727
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,451
- Come on, you want to go
get, like, some hot chocolate

728
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,953
or something?

729
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,488
- Sure, let's go.

730
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,076
- Mom?

731
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,911
Mom, what are you doing?

732
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:07,050
- Oh, I found the doll.

733
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,520
- Yeah, um...

734
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,889
Do you know where my
night vision goggles are?

735
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,824
- Um, I think
they're in that box

736
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:16,759
from Brooklyn in your bedroom.

737
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,361
- K, thanks.

738
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,599
- Sure.

739
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,182
- Hi, welcome.

740
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,483
- Hi there.

741
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,452
- May I help you?

742
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,053
- Well, my wife and
I just moved here recently,

743
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,256
and I saw your shop and
thought I'd check it out.

744
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,725
- Oh, well,
double welcome, then.

745
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,861
Are you already familiar
with this stuff?

746
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,663
Or do you need some guidance?

747
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:55,331
- Oh, I'm very
well acquainted with it all,

748
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,699
thank you.

749
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,769
You have quite an
impressive collection here.

750
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,638
- Thank you.

751
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,107
I pick everything out myself.

752
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,576
I'm Sagan, by the way.

753
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,811
- Jonathan.

754
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,047
Nice to meet you.

755
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,716
I guess I'll pick out some
surprises for my family.

756
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,718
- That's nice.

757
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,220
Where are you living?

758
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,255
- Old Post Road,
there's a house there...

759
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,556
- Brickford house.

760
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:21,758
- Right, yeah.

761
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,526
- Alice and her mom?

762
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,128
- Space is too big for them,

763
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,697
so they're leasing
out a smaller house.

764
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,265
- Wow, sad.

765
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,701
So much went on there.

766
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,369
- Bad?

767
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,438
- Well, too much family drama.

768
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,676
The husband left, he
took the little boy,

769
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,110
it was horrible.

770
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,379
Alice and Sophie
just kind of became

771
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,214
a couple of old recluses.

772
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,916
- Really, why?

773
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,452
- Well Sophie was
cheating, well...

774
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,320
He said she was cheating.

775
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,624
She was something, gorgeous.

776
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,560
But after Charles
left, she just...

777
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,195
became celibate.

778
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:03,132
- I'm going to shop, thanks.

779
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,497
- Smudgey!

780
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:26,315
No, no, no, no, no!

781
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:29,218
No, no, no!

782
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,856
- What's
wrong? What happened?

783
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,758
Honey, what happened?

784
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,393
- It was down there...

785
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,495
- What's down
there, what happened to you?

786
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,130
Baby?

787
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,132
Honey, talk to me.

788
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,700
What did you see, what happened?

789
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,869
- It was down there.
- - What's down there?

790
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,137
- Hey...

791
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,405
- Hey buddy, what's up?

792
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,507
- Something horrible is
in the basement, dad.

793
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:52,875
- What?

794
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,343
- Yeah, he went down
there looking for Smudgey,

795
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,945
and something was down there,
I don't know what it was,

796
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:57,680
but it scared the
crap out of him.

797
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:58,848
- Like an animal?

798
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,916
- No, it was like a
doll, or a person,

799
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,984
or something, but it chased me.

800
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,452
- Should I go look?

801
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,688
- Yeah, you should, you
should probably take him, too.

802
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,490
What's in the bag?

803
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,524
- Bag?

804
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,892
Goodies for my family.

805
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:12,014
Come on baby, let me
check your temperature.

806
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,095
- Hi dad.

807
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,397
- Hi baby.

808
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,133
- Hey, how was work today?

809
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,001
- So, are we going
downstairs, or what?

810
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,603
- Let's
go do it! Let's go!

811
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,538
- I'm going to make
spaghetti tonight guys, K?

812
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,774
- OK, I have to change first.

813
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,108
- OK.

814
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,417
- It was down here, I know it.

815
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,985
- OK, where'd you see it?

816
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,153
- Behind the furnace.

817
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,088
- OK, let's go look
behind the furnace.

818
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,357
But on the way there, let's
get all the dark spots,

819
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,627
so you make sure it's not here.

820
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,129
Or if it is here, we'll find it.

821
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,001
- No.

822
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,771
No.

823
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,974
- Alright
kid, let's keep looking.

824
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,644
Here's the furnace, don't
be scared, I'm with you.

825
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,512
I'm with you.

826
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,549
All clear?

827
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,783
- Yeah.

828
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,418
- OK whatever it was...

829
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,020
And I believe you saw something!

830
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:12,922
But whatever it was, it's gone.

831
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,124
Lucky us, huh?

832
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,732
We're OK, little buddy.

833
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:24,967
Here we go.

834
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,168
- So nothing?
- - Nope.

835
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,004
- I saw something
down there, I know it.

836
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,438
- OK Morgan.

837
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,606
- How was work today?

838
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,108
- It was good.

839
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,911
I felt like I was actually
necessary, I love that.

840
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:36,345
- Great.

841
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:40,049
- On the way home today,
I found my favorite store,

842
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,686
My Dreams, I got a present
for my whole family.

843
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,023
This is for your brother.

844
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,225
- Thanks, dad.

845
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,893
- This is for you.

846
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,428
Now these are called
dream catchers,

847
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,298
they will help you
stop having bad dreams!

848
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,403
And this is for my girlfriend.

849
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,941
Brainwave meditation, you
just put it in your CD player,

850
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,475
put your headphones on, relax,

851
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,744
it takes you into
a deep meditation

852
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,980
and you don't even have
to work at it, nothing.

853
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,048
- Nothing?

854
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,816
- I'm telling you.

855
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,184
- Thank you.

856
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,819
- You're welcome, baby.

857
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,059
- More, mom.

858
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:26,963
No, more!

859
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:29,126
- Sweetie, you're never
going to eat that much.

860
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,336
- Arial, that's disgusting.

861
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,539
- What, I like spaghetti.

862
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,608
- God, you'd think we
never fed this child.

863
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,844
- She has parasites, dad.

864
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,347
I already told mom, it's
like Monsters in My Stomach.

865
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,116
- Do you think I have parasites?

866
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,951
- Of course you don't.

867
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:51,154
- No honey, I don't think
you have parasites, OK?

868
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,122
I think Morgan is
just scared for you

869
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:55,257
because you've been acting
all weird lately, OK?

870
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,892
Everything's fine.

871
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:09,572
- Will you please
stop it, mom, huh?

872
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,507
Come on, just stop it.

873
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:10,199
- Help me, help me, help me!

874
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,635
Help me, help me, help me!

875
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,561
- Please, stop!

876
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,819
- Shh.

877
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,956
- Oh my god, there's
something under the bed,

878
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,893
it's really big, and it's
got hair, it's really scary.

879
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:46,162
Oh my god, it's...

880
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,630
No, no, no!

881
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:48,531
No!

882
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,299
Oh my god, it's under there!

883
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:51,467
It's under there,
I'm telling you!

884
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,402
Don't go! Don't go,
it's under there.

885
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,271
No, don't, it's
going to get you!

886
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,705
- Honey, there's
nothing there, baby.

887
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,040
- There's nothing there!
- - No, it's there,

888
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,276
it's there, I'm not kidding.

889
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,443
No, don't.

890
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:02,811
- There's honestly
nothing there, baby.

891
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,246
- No, look!

892
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,515
- You are scratched.

893
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,217
Oh my god!

894
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,889
Baby, how did this happen?

895
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,827
Does that hurt?

896
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,529
Does that hurt?

897
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,668
Baby.

898
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,722
- Hm.

899
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,864
Good morning.

900
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,099
- Good morning.

901
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,467
How you doing?

902
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,401
- Good.

903
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,639
It's all well.

904
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,775
So the exterminator is
coming this morning.

905
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:08,477
- Oh, good.

906
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,512
What do you think it is?

907
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,815
- Maybe a nutria, I don't know.

908
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:15,451
- Oh, one of those giant
40 pound rat things?

909
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:16,719
- Actually I think
they're a close relation

910
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,254
to the guinea pig.

911
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:19,888
- Whatever.

912
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,924
- Good morning, guys.

913
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,427
- She had bad dreams last
night, like really bad.

914
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,429
I guess the dream
catcher didn't work.

915
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,331
- Yeah, change is
hard for young people.

916
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,733
- Change?

917
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,135
This was happening way
before we moved, remember?

918
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,839
- Things have gotten more intense
though, since we got here.

919
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,707
Maybe we should just move out.

920
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,643
- No, I want to stay here.

921
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:41,977
I don't want to move.

922
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,679
- I don't either.

923
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,547
OK guys, see you tonight.

924
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:46,782
I love you, I love you.

925
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,484
Love you.

926
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,900
- Alfred, tell
us about it, would you?

927
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,336
- And I just can't
get rid of his clothes!

928
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,638
I know I have to it, I mean who

929
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,442
wants his sneakers and
everything, they're brand new.

930
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,844
But I know I have
to get past this,

931
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,714
I know I have to accept
the fact that he's gone.

932
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:23,485
But I can't, it's
constantly there.

933
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,188
It's like it's.

934
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,257
And now I'm gonna
have to live with it,

935
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:31,093
but I just can't let it go.

936
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,729
- I understand, Alfred.

937
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,706
It's OK, Alfred, go ahead.

938
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,623
- Alice, can we talk?

939
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,259
- About?

940
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,595
- Couple of things,
did anything strange

941
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:08,764
ever happen in
that house for you?

942
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,066
- Strange how?

943
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:14,303
- Unexplainable things?

944
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,239
- There's a lot of
unexplainable things

945
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,875
that have a perfect explanation.

946
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,277
- True, true.

947
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,847
I was wondering, you sat through

948
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,448
the whole meeting
without sharing,

949
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,530
is there anything you'd
like to talk about?

950
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,819
- No, thank you though.

951
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,358
- I know you're still
upset about your mother,

952
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,494
I'm a great sounding board.

953
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,197
- No, thank you.

954
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:46,702
- Anything you say would be
kept confidential of course.

955
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,474
- Look, I never
studied psychology

956
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,610
or anything like that.

957
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:58,947
But I do know things, and I know

958
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:04,052
that when you hold things
in, for a very long time,

959
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,156
they become a part
of you, and I've been

960
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:10,659
holding in things for a
very, very long time, doctor.

961
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,695
- What are you grieving, Alice?

962
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,197
- Life.

963
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,367
Thank you.

964
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,371
- Sophie.

965
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:23,639
Sophie.

966
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,307
- Oh my god...

967
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,542
What are you...

968
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,776
Oh no!

969
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,913
- Dirty, filthy,
crumb-infested whore!

970
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,449
- Please

971
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,651
- Don't cry for her!

972
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:37,693
She does not deserve
it, turn and walk.

973
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,131
- Morgan, can I
please use your extra?

974
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,365
- Yeah!

975
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,267
- We've got a whole big
thing of it, sweetie.

976
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,837
Look, these ones you can
actually see through,

977
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,505
but then there's others, look,

978
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,340
like this one, we can
just put it somewhere.

979
00:57:58,342 --> 00:57:59,942
We can hang it up.

980
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,143
- Sure!

981
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,244
- Jinx!

982
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,817
- Hi.

983
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,185
- Hey.

984
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,353
- Wait a minute, aren't you...

985
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,288
- Hey, yeah, it's me.

986
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,224
- You were the AAA guy?

987
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:18,227
- Yeah, I'm like jack
of all trades, you know.

988
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:21,430
Part time exterminator,
part time mechanic,

989
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,999
I even do massage if
you ever need one.

990
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,033
- I'm good.

991
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,435
- OK.
- - Yeah, thanks.

992
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:29,671
So we got a problem, and I
think it's in the basement.

993
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,206
- Critters?

994
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,175
- I think, I'm not sure.

995
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,309
- This time of year, you know.

996
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,011
- Really?
- - Mmhmm.

997
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,880
- Huh.

998
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,218
Looks good.

999
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,689
Closet's safe.

1000
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,392
- Let me take you down.

1001
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:51,693
- Great.

1002
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,297
Crazy kids...

1003
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,995
They're having some
good filthy fun.

1004
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,738
- Yeah, they're adorable.

1005
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,007
- Alright, come
on, watch your step.

1006
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,808
Don't want you to get
killed or nothing.

1007
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,176
- Nope.

1008
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,712
Wow, you've got to clean this...

1009
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,887
Oh, real problem you got
here is a hoarder problem.

1010
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,323
- That was a rent-in.

1011
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,897
Pretty good shape,
considering it's just those

1012
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,067
two old crusting women been
living here all these years.

1013
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,902
- Gee, nice.

1014
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,105
- Yeah, I calls
'em as I sees them.

1015
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:43,045
- Well, would you look at that.

1016
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,948
You know what's so funny?

1017
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,483
I've been looking
for one of these.

1018
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,686
- You know what's funny is
I've been looking around here

1019
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,754
and there's nothing here,
everything's perfect

1020
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,222
Ah!

1021
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:57,125
It's fine, your house is clean
bill slate, it's all good.

1022
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,728
Woah, ow my head!

1023
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,697
Ah, the door.

1024
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,098
Ah, it's open.

1025
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,334
This house is fine,
just make sure that

1026
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,703
the windows and the doors
are locked at night,

1027
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,371
and I know that you
said you bolt locked it,

1028
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,573
you know, keep these things...

1029
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,040
- Wait.
- - Uh...

1030
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,443
- Sure you don't
want to look around some more?

1031
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,712
- No, your house is
fine, you know there's

1032
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:19,147
nothing going on here,
so just have a good day,

1033
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:20,782
have a good night, have a...

1034
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,118
This is free, don't
worry about it.

1035
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,721
No charge!

1036
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,322
- Thanks.

1037
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,630
- Alice.

1038
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,331
- Father Thomas, hi.

1039
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,067
- Hi, is everything OK?

1040
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,869
What are you...

1041
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,671
How is your mother?

1042
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,073
- She's fine, she's fine.

1043
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:49,244
No, no, yeah I'm
actually here for me.

1044
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:50,312
- Ah.

1045
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,748
Are you alright?

1046
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,186
- In all these years
that have passed,

1047
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:01,123
no one person ever
asked me that question.

1048
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,858
Not one.

1049
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:07,829
Now that my mom is sick,
and her health is failing,

1050
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,166
there's all this
concern out of nowhere.

1051
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,402
- I'm sorry, that must be hard.

1052
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:17,439
- No, no the last
40 years were hard.

1053
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,142
This isn't.

1054
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,048
Nice to see you.

1055
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,916
Thanks for your concern.

1056
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,951
I have to go.

1057
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,814
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop!

1058
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,750
In 50 years we'll be dead,

1059
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:05,654
but that reflection
will always be there.

1060
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,425
Who loves you?

1061
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,375
- Are you still playing
with that thing?

1062
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,558
You got to stop
playing with it...

1063
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,410
- Give it back to us!

1064
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,285
- He's going to tell her.

1065
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,188
- Don't worry, he'll never tell.

1066
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,525
- I think what
you're doing is fine,

1067
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,160
don't you worry about a thing.

1068
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:46,528
Just keep it up.

1069
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,164
We'll see you soon.

1070
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,471
- Excuse me.

1071
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:57,773
- Can I help you?

1072
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,040
- I'm Father Thomas.

1073
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,575
- Father Thomas, how do you do?

1074
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,411
You met my wife the other
day at our new place, Cecile.

1075
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,982
- Yes I did, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

1076
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,317
You're the therapist,
that's right.

1077
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,852
- Excuse me?

1078
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,388
- Oh, uh, nothing.

1079
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,925
I ran into Alice Brickford,
and I'm wondering,

1080
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,326
is she OK?

1081
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,029
I mean did you happen
to speak with her?

1082
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,632
I'm a friend of the family
for a very long time.

1083
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:27,335
- OK, well maybe you should
ask her yourself then.

1084
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,071
- See I wish
it were that simple.

1085
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:32,674
But we had a falling
out years ago, so...

1086
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:36,144
- A priest, having a falling
out, that's not very...

1087
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,514
very godlike of you, huh?

1088
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:42,450
- No, but it is human.

1089
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,453
- So what do you need?

1090
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:50,192
- Um, I'm not sure, I'm
just trying to help.

1091
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,394
- With?

1092
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,563
- Well, I...

1093
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,334
I have a strange sense that
something has happened,

1094
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,269
or is happening.

1095
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,004
- Is happening?

1096
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,774
I'm not following, Father.

1097
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,476
- You see, years ago, when
someone was sensitive,

1098
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,146
it was unacceptable
to use one's abilities

1099
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:15,150
in any way that was outside
of the church, or religion.

1100
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,485
- And that's...

1101
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:18,854
and that would be you?

1102
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,322
- Yes.

1103
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:23,625
Yes, I was never quite sure
what to do with my acute senses,

1104
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,027
so that's why I
joined the priesthood.

1105
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,864
- So what is that you...

1106
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,832
that you sense.

1107
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,804
- A great sadness.

1108
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,441
- My wife and I, we...

1109
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:42,844
we lost a baby recently.

1110
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,781
- Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

1111
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,353
But this is something
different, it's something else,

1112
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:52,988
something that involves Alice,

1113
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,890
but it also involves
your family.

1114
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:56,725
I'm afraid there's a connection.

1115
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:32,060
- Ariel!

1116
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:33,662
- Mommy, mommy, help!
- - Morgan?

1117
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,964
Morgan?

1118
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,265
Morgan?

1119
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,867
- Please help, please!

1120
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,535
Ariel!

1121
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:41,937
- Morgan, what's wrong?

1122
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:44,439
- Mommy! Help
me, please help me.

1123
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,242
- Mommy,
Ariel's locked in there!

1124
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,376
- Ariel?

1125
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,778
Ariel!

1126
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,714
Ariel!

1127
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:53,815
- Mommy!
- - Ariel, are you OK?

1128
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:55,350
Oh my god, here, call your dad.

1129
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,752
Call your dad, tell him to
meet us at the hospital.

1130
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,221
Oh honey, oh my god!

1131
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,024
- Dad, something happened to
Ariel we don't know what...

1132
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,392
- Oh honey, oh my god.

1133
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,829
- Please meet
us at the hospital!

1134
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:09,698
Please dad!

1135
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,534
- Did she get this cut when
she was playing with you?

1136
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:13,835
- I don't know, mommy!

1137
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:16,004
Dad, please come
to the hospital,

1138
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,439
we don't know what's going on,

1139
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,074
we found her like this...

1140
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,208
- Wake up, baby!

1141
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,276
- We just found her!

1142
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:22,744
We don't know what's going on!

1143
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:24,212
Please!

1144
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,781
- Morgan, when we get downstairs
I need you to get the coat.

1145
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,393
- Mommy.

1146
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:41,229
- Oh, Missy, oh,
how did this happen?

1147
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,731
- My arm.
- - Who hurt you honey?

1148
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:43,898
Who?

1149
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,066
- The boy...
- - What boy,

1150
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:46,935
what are you talking about?

1151
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,737
Oh my god, look at her!

1152
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:49,738
- Oh my god!

1153
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,339
Come here, baby.

1154
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,261
- Come on, go to
daddy honey, go.

1155
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:56,911
- Oh, baby.

1156
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:07,722
- Open up.

1157
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,597
You're doing this on purpose.

1158
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,565
Eat this.

1159
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,334
Oh!

1160
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,139
- Eat this, mom!

1161
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,414
Fine, you know
what, I don't care.

1162
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:37,118
Maybe you'll starve to death.

1163
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,156
- Here you go, baby.

1164
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,993
I've got that door.

1165
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,900
What's wrong, little buddy?

1166
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,402
- We shouldn't
go in, I know it.

1167
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,440
- Let's go inside
where it's warm,

1168
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,508
and we'll figure things out, OK?

1169
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,710
Something's not right.

1170
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,880
- Morgan, I will
take care of you.

1171
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:09,184
I will protect you from
anything and everything always.

1172
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,352
Do you believe me?

1173
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,789
OK, let's go inside.

1174
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:23,698
- Hey.

1175
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,233
- She's sound asleep, huh?

1176
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,401
- Yeah.

1177
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:27,735
You know, ever
since we got here,

1178
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:29,938
it's been getting a
lot worse for Ariel.

1179
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,044
And for me, like, I don't
know what's going on with me,

1180
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,046
but it's getting more intense.

1181
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:40,448
And I don't know if
it's my imagination,

1182
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:44,385
or it's this house,
or what, but, god,

1183
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,754
I love the way I feel.

1184
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,657
And I don't want this
sensation to end,

1185
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,759
and it makes me feel so guilty.

1186
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,431
- Well doll-face, I
love how you feel too.

1187
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,735
Maybe we should
talk to Alice, huh?

1188
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,972
- What good do you really
think that would do?

1189
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:06,975
- Well I think Alice
knows something.

1190
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,244
- Hm.

1191
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,047
- Let's go in with the kids,

1192
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,250
it was really scary for
them what happened today.

1193
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,751
- Yeah.

1194
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,020
I'll listen to
that CD you got me.

1195
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,060
- Please, no!

1196
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,664
- Oh my god!

1197
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,232
Oh my god!

1198
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,733
You have to listen to this!

1199
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:08,236
It's so horrible,
oh my goodness.

1200
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,838
Oh my god!

1201
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:21,616
- I'm sorry babe, I don't
hear anything, just...

1202
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,686
just the gong.

1203
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,689
I think it's your unconscious
mind at work, doll.

1204
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,857
- No, please, you got
to listen to more,

1205
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,527
there was a child's voice.

1206
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,865
- I read once when something
really intense happens,

1207
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,968
it leaves an
impression on reality.

1208
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,870
I think that's
what hauntings are.

1209
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,840
- So you think this
place is haunted?

1210
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,978
- No.

1211
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,580
But I think maybe you
picked up on something.

1212
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,416
Something that, you know how

1213
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,518
when there's an
argument in the room,

1214
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,620
and everybody leaves the room,

1215
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,788
there's still tension left over.

1216
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,724
If there's a big argument,

1217
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:04,792
there's going to be lots
of residual tension.

1218
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,394
I believe that.

1219
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,029
- I agree.

1220
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,931
- Thank you, little buddy.

1221
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,336
- Help me, help me, help me.

1222
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:17,005
Ariel.

1223
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,140
Ariel.

1224
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,572
- Morgan?

1225
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,409
- It's me, mom.

1226
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,612
- You OK, honey?

1227
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,215
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1228
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,252
- What are doing,
you have a nightmare?

1229
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,587
- I'm just looking outside.

1230
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:08,089
- At what?

1231
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,391
- The snow.

1232
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,927
I'm hungry, mom.

1233
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,162
- Now?

1234
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,596
- Yes.

1235
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,498
- You can't wait 'til breakfast?

1236
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,334
- No, I need it now.

1237
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,206
- OK honey, come on.

1238
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,308
Mama will feed you.

1239
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,515
Come on, sweetheart, it's OK.

1240
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,937
Let's go get you
something, baby.

1241
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,386
OK?

1242
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,123
- Oh please, bacon and eggs!

1243
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,892
Oh look there, can
we have bacon too?

1244
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:46,728
- Yep, definitely.

1245
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,696
- It's good!

1246
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,566
It's 4:30 in the morning.

1247
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:53,801
- She was really hungry.

1248
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,738
- Oh.

1249
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,807
Not a way to start school
the first day, huh?

1250
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:00,610
Oh baby.

1251
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,480
That was some storm, huh?

1252
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:07,281
- I know, and it's all going
to melt by this afternoon.

1253
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:08,483
- Yeah.
- - Crazy, huh?

1254
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:09,951
- I'm going to lay down, OK?

1255
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:11,285
- I'm going to clean this
up, then we'll all go back

1256
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,621
upstairs and go
back to sleep, OK?

1257
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:14,922
- OK.

1258
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:20,928
- Ai ya.

1259
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:34,942
- Hey, hey? Oh, baby.

1260
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,677
- What are you doing up?

1261
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:39,914
- Why are you

1262
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,118
- Mommy!

1263
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,593
- Who was that?

1264
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,728
Was that Morgan?

1265
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,663
- What's going on?

1266
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,665
- See, there's Morgan.

1267
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,449
- Let's go baby, here we go.
- - Come on, get in.

1268
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,888
- Oh you poor kid,
you must be freezing!

1269
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,257
- Hey baby, what
did you find out there for us?

1270
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:24,959
- Wow.

1271
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,794
Look at this.

1272
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,062
- Take the top off.

1273
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,464
- Where'd you get this?

1274
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,432
- Hey, check this out.
- - It was outside.

1275
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,737
- Look at that, Alice Brickford.

1276
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,207
- Oh my gosh, look it's
from when she was little.

1277
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:40,575
- Yeah, cool.

1278
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,677
Let's see what we
got going here.

1279
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,281
"Bird dropped today, I
hope we heard them sing,"

1280
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,516
OK.

1281
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:51,452
"I wish she would
just disappear.

1282
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:53,988
"Then I could take care of them.

1283
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,524
"I hate her."

1284
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:59,827
Well, you know what, this
might not be good for the kids.

1285
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,863
So we'll read it first,
and if it's good,

1286
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,598
we'll tell you about it, OK?

1287
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,234
- Come on, let's get
you cleaned up, OK?

1288
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:08,236
- What's going to happen?

1289
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:10,438
- Hey guys, what's up?

1290
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,906
- Do I have to go?

1291
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:13,875
- Yeah, of course you do.

1292
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,142
After everything
that's happened here,

1293
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:17,011
you need to just go and
do something normal,

1294
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,813
like going to school.

1295
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:20,448
- Are you going to be OK alone?

1296
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,849
- Of course I'm
going to be OK alone.

1297
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,084
You know what?

1298
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,785
Maybe I go look for the Smudgey.

1299
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:25,920
- Don't!

1300
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,955
He's in the basement,
but don't go.

1301
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:29,724
- OK you know what,
maybe I'll write,

1302
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,459
that's what I'm
supposed to be doing.

1303
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:35,162
- Can we move, like not move
neighborhoods, just houses?

1304
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:39,534
- No, please no,
he told me not to.

1305
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,035
He asked me.

1306
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,236
- Who?

1307
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:43,738
- I promised him.

1308
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,172
- You know what,
let's go now, OK?

1309
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:46,574
Come on, let's go,
I'm going to get

1310
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:48,042
a coffee on the way
back from school,

1311
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,210
and everything's fine.

1312
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,212
Come on, it'll be
good for us all.

1313
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:16,370
- Sophia, listen...

1314
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:18,406
- Oh my god, Thomas!

1315
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,107
Thomas, no!

1316
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,410
No, Thomas, no!

1317
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,211
- I can't make you
leave the seminary,

1318
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:27,348
it's not right.

1319
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,619
- Sophie, I'm in love with you.

1320
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,889
- What we did was wrong,
God is going to punish us.

1321
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,925
No, He will, He will,
God will punish us.

1322
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:42,129
- God is love, Sophie, He
just wants people to love.

1323
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,765
- I'm so sorry.

1324
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,341
I'm so sorry.

1325
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:11,692
- Mom, open your mouth,
I know you can hear me.

1326
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:28,042
- You stupid fucking bitch!

1327
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,378
What, you think you're
going to run away?

1328
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,146
Where you going to go?

1329
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,981
Who's going to want you?

1330
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,283
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1331
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:37,718
You're nothing.

1332
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,420
You're nothing,
you're worth nothing,

1333
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,022
everything that you
have belongs to me,

1334
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,224
because I bought it.

1335
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,860
You wouldn't even exist
if it wasn't for me.

1336
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:51,332
I'm the one who even decides
whether you live or die.

1337
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,001
- Please, mother...

1338
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,605
Please, I can't take it anymore.

1339
01:17:57,607 --> 01:17:59,507
I just can't.

1340
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:04,278
I feel like you hate me so
much, and there's no reason.

1341
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,550
- I can't do this anymore.

1342
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,968
I'm sorry.

1343
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,762
- Hi, Alice.
- - Hi.

1344
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:56,197
- Are you busy?

1345
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,666
- Um, no, no please, come in.

1346
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,234
- Thank you so much.

1347
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,603
I'm so sorry to just
show up like this, but...

1348
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,638
Something crazy is going on.

1349
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,608
- I thought it was just me.

1350
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,611
I guess it is the house.

1351
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,147
- So you know about this?

1352
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,649
- I've been dealing with
this since I'm a child.

1353
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,518
- What?

1354
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,423
- It's um, just something
that's been going on,

1355
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:27,595
and it's still very
much a part of me.

1356
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,997
That's my thing.

1357
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,768
He's in the house.

1358
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,404
- Who?

1359
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,974
What are you talking about?

1360
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,111
- I've lost my
entire life to this

1361
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,081
and his mess.

1362
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,621
It's time to let somebody
know what's really going on.

1363
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,056
Sit down.

1364
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,700
My mother felt
very unfulfilled in

1365
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:08,803
her marriage to my father.

1366
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:14,141
One day he just
stopped wanting her.

1367
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,777
He didn't even know why.

1368
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:19,914
And she had an affair.

1369
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,184
One day, I saw them together,

1370
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,020
and my father found out...

1371
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,455
My mother always blamed me,

1372
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:30,658
saying I was the one that told.

1373
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,560
I wasn't the one that told.

1374
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:34,895
So he left...

1375
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,265
and he took my baby
brother with him,

1376
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:42,036
as if we were both just whores.

1377
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:51,946
Soon after, my mother
had a baby boy.

1378
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,917
And I named him Sebastian.

1379
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:01,755
She wanted me to kill him.

1380
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,924
- Oh my god.

1381
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:07,595
- But I couldn't, I refused to.

1382
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,903
I just wanted to run away.

1383
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,839
I wanted to take
the baby and go.

1384
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,209
And I was so scared,
I was terrified.

1385
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,778
I mean, I was just a child.

1386
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,981
I was just a child.

1387
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:32,086
She thought that
he was some evil,

1388
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:35,956
because of her being
unfaithful to my father...

1389
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,026
- What happened to him?

1390
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,528
- He died.

1391
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:44,231
- Oh my god.

1392
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:47,368
- I think about him
every day of my life.

1393
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:51,572
I'll never, ever forgive myself.

1394
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:56,777
You are the only person
on the face of this earth

1395
01:21:56,779 --> 01:22:01,715
that knows that
Sebastian ever existed.

1396
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:06,086
And that is why I will
never forgive her.

1397
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,857
- Oh my god.

1398
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,862
Sebastian!

1399
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:50,164
Sebastian!

1400
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,032
I know who you are!

1401
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:53,968
I know what happened!

1402
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,937
You poor, poor baby!

1403
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:59,907
Oh my god.

1404
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,177
I'm so sorry.

1405
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,382
You poor baby.

1406
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,087
I feel you.

1407
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,190
I feel you.

1408
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,723
- Help me please, I'm hungry!

1409
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,325
I'm hungry!

1410
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:57,464
- My name is Sebastian.

1411
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:02,469
- What? Ariel!

1412
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,604
- Are you OK?

1413
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:05,205
- What do I do?

1414
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:20,687
- Jon?

1415
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:23,157
- Cecile, hi baby,
look, the school called,

1416
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,225
yeah something
terrible's going down.

1417
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,030
Cecile?

1418
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:31,965
Damn cellphones.

1419
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:33,467
Ugh.

1420
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,881
- Mom!
- - Cecila!

1421
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:49,049
- Daddy!

1422
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:50,050
- Oh!

1423
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:51,452
Oh baby her heart's beating.

1424
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:52,319
She's awake.

1425
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:53,320
- Sebastian?

1426
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:54,688
- No, no baby it's us.

1427
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,090
- Oh no, that's his name!

1428
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,391
- What?

1429
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:58,959
- The bad boy, Sebastian!

1430
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:01,795
- He's not bad, he's not
bad, he needs us, guys.

1431
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,032
- Hello?

1432
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,135
Yes.

1433
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:10,571
Alice?

1434
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,175
Oh no.

1435
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:18,812
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

1436
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,881
- So he is real?

1437
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:23,117
- Yeah, he was.

1438
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:26,086
- I'm so sad, I can't
believe it all happened here.

1439
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,989
- I know.

1440
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,725
- I thought I was crazy.

1441
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,260
- I know, honey.

1442
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:35,963
- Hello?

1443
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:37,164
Alice.

1444
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,632
Hi, what's...

1445
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,367
I'll be there in a few minutes.

1446
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,302
Yeah.

1447
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,240
Sophia died about an hour ago.

1448
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,442
- You should definitely go.

1449
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,777
- Yeah.

1450
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,315
- Help me, help me, help me!

1451
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,288
Help me!

1452
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,197
- Alice...

1453
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,034
That's horrific.

1454
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:16,336
- I should go to jail.

1455
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:19,106
- No, no, no darling
you were too young.

1456
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,775
And you were tortured
the same as he was.

1457
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:26,647
- I let her take my life, the
same way she took Sebastian's.

1458
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,483
Now that she's gone...

1459
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:31,151
And Sebastian...

1460
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,558
You know how good it is to
be able to say his name?

1461
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,330
Anyway.

1462
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,533
Now that Sebastian's
secret is out...

1463
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,838
I don't have anything
to fear anymore!

1464
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:58,845
- Well, uh, I believe

1465
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:01,481
that we are being
haunted by him.

1466
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,084
I need your help.

1467
01:27:04,086 --> 01:27:05,953
- I just don't know what to do.

1468
01:27:05,955 --> 01:27:09,423
I mean maybe, we should think
about going back to the city.

1469
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:12,059
- No, we can't go 'til
we find the Smudgey.

1470
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:13,393
- We'll find the Smudgey first,

1471
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,395
honey, I wouldn't
leave him here.

1472
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,030
I just don't know what to do.

1473
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:18,699
I really don't.

1474
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:20,500
I like being out here, but.

1475
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:22,569
So much just happened
since we got here.

1476
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,705
And I don't know what
he wants from us.

1477
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:28,041
We should go.

1478
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,491
I can't open it!

1479
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:45,892
I can't open it!

1480
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:47,261
Get away from the glass!

1481
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:48,962
- Get away, get away, get away!

1482
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:53,166
- What's going on in here?

1483
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:54,334
You guys alright?

1484
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,776
- Oh god, what's happening?

1485
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,478
What's going on?

1486
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,213
What do you want from us?

1487
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:08,615
- What's going on?

1488
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:10,751
- What do you want?

1489
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:12,052
What are you doing this for?

1490
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,287
Why is this happening?

1491
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,322
- Who is she talking to?

1492
01:28:15,324 --> 01:28:16,556
- The kid!

1493
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:17,624
- Sebastian!

1494
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:18,759
- Talk to me!

1495
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:20,727
Please, tell me!

1496
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:32,839
- It's the devil's baby!

1497
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,274
Oh my god!

1498
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:36,710
- Your name is Sebastian!

1499
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:40,314
- That's enough, if you continue
to feed it, it will live.

1500
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,188
- No, no, mommy!

1501
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,356
No!

1502
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,258
No!

1503
01:28:53,262 --> 01:28:54,995
- If you don't do
what I tell you to,

1504
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:57,497
I'm going to tell the police
what you did all these years.

1505
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,974
- Oh my god.

1506
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,013
- That's why she
wouldn't let me near her.

1507
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:17,918
She was pregnant with my child!

1508
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,786
Oh dear god...

1509
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:22,489
Forgive me please,
Lord forgive me.

1510
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,524
- Sebastian!

1511
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:27,828
Oh, you poor sweet soul.

1512
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,530
- What are you saying, mommy?

1513
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:34,101
- All he ever wanted was
somebody to love him.

1514
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:36,336
That's all he wanted.

1515
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:37,704
- I love you, mommy.

1516
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:41,241
- Oh, we have to stay
here, we have to stay here.

1517
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:43,910
He needs us to help him.

1518
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:49,483
I can love you, I can love
you, little guy, I can.

1519
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,888
- Oh, Jon, I know everything...

1520
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:02,629
- Why didn't you come to me?

1521
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,399
- Because I was scared.

1522
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,568
- Sebastian was his name?

1523
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:10,904
- Yeah.

1524
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,672
- Did anyone love him?

1525
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:15,642
- I did.

1526
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,079
Oh god, I loved him so much.

1527
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,784
I've lived all my life
with a broken heart.

1528
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,322
- It's Sebastian!

1529
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:31,958
- Oh, I can feel him!

1530
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,828
- Oh, it's him!

1531
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,298
Hey, little baby brother!

1532
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:42,302
Oh god, I love you so much!

1533
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,749
- Smudgey!

1534
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,784
It's Smudgey!

1535
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,653
- Yes!

1536
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,698
- Come on!

1537
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,800
Let's go, quick, quick, go!

1538
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:15,435
Come on, quick, quick, quick!

1539
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:16,736
Let's go!

1540
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:18,371
Come on!

1541
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:19,573
Love you, bye!

1542
01:31:19,575 --> 01:31:20,774
- Have a good day
at school, guys!

1543
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:21,908
Hurry hurry, don't miss it!

1544
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,877
- Don't miss it!
- - Go, go, go.

1545
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:25,946
- Wait you're staying home?

1546
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:27,881
- I'm going to hang
out with mom today.

1547
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:29,616
- Don't have too much fun!

1548
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:30,750
- Get out of here!

1549
01:31:30,752 --> 01:31:32,853
Have a good day!

1550
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,625
- I love you, Sebastian!

1551
01:31:38,627 --> 01:31:40,627
- I can't wait to meet you!

1552
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,363
- Alright, hurry up, you guys
are going to miss the bus, go!

1553
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:45,298
- Bye mom, bye Sebastian!
- - Bye sweetheart!

1554
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,534
- Love you guys!

1555
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:56,743
- Ariel...

1556
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,351
Come on, we're going
to miss the bus.
