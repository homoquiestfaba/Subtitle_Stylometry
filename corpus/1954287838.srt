1
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:30,788
Hey David, it's Charlie Franklin
calling to say happy birthday.

2
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,672
Sorry I couldn't get those tickets, man.

3
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:36,023
I know you were counting on me,
but my brother-in-law's in town.

4
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:39,452
I'll give you a call you next week,
and maybe we can get together.

5
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,347
Have a good birthday.
Take care.

6
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:43,464
If you wanna reach me on my cell, you can...

7
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:38,840
You think you know about pain?

8
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,581
Talk to my second wife.

9
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:46,727
When she was 19, she got
between a couple of fighting cats.

10
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,457
And one of them went at her.
Climbed her like a tree.

11
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:55,842
Tore gashes out of her thighs and breasts and belly,
that you can still see today.

12
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:00,497
She got 30 stitches,
and a fever that lasted for days.

13
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,533
My second wife says...that's pain.

14
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,525
She doesn't know shit,
that woman.

15
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:19,432
If I could have stepped in front of that
car today, in the place of that man...

16
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,036
I would have.

17
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:27,092
Perhaps for a moment,
bearing his pain may have numbed my own.

18
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,683
It was the fifties.

19
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:35,577
A period of strange
repressions...secrets.

20
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,867
A time when even the guilty
displayed a rare innocence.

21
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,548
Remembering what happened.

22
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,284
Remembering what we did.

23
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,619
I'm on the wrong side
of fifty, now.

24
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,062
I make $300,000 a year
on Wall Street...

25
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,744
two marriages, no kids...

26
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:58,946
a house in Rye,
a company apartment in the city

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,207
My preseant wife knows nothing about
what happened all those years ago.

28
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:05,544
And I don't know if I mean to tell her.

29
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,113
Why should I?

30
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:24,204
Nothing in my life has been right,
since the summer of 1958.

31
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:31,407
When Ruth, Donnie, Willie,
and all the rest of us met Meg Loughlin...

32
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,045
and her sister Susan.

33
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,819
Whatcha looking for?

34
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,930
Crayfish.
- Can I see?

35
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:16,323
I'm Meg.
- I'm David.

36
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,149
They're really neat.

37
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,192
Jus' catch them and look at 'em a while,
then let them go.

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,650
Do they bite?

39
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:30,087
The big ones do,
but the little ones try and run.

40
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:34,255
Ah!

41
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,901
You never seen a crayfish before?

42
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:45,560
We don't have 'em in New York City.
We do have lobsters, though.
Now, they can hurt you.

43
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,106
Can you keep one like a pet?

44
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,294
No. You eat them silly.

45
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,397
Peoply eat crayfish too.

46
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,997
In Louisiana and Florida, someplace.

47
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:57,338
Doesn't look like there's a lot to eat.

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,817
Let's try and get some big ones.

49
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:02,216
Can I try?
- Sure.

50
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:07,898
What's that?

51
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:12,475
My family, they were in an accident.

52
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,087
Got any more of them...scars, I mean?

53
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,926
A few, but that ones the worst.

54
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,535
Can I see 'em?

55
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,937
I got one.  I got one.
-You got a big one.

56
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,001
First try...

57
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:47,217
Good boys.
Sometimes they kill their own kind, you know?

58
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,168
You'll put 'em back though, won't you?
- Sure, I always do.

59
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,847
I gotta get back.

60
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,323
But I wanted to look around, first thing.

61
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,802
We had never had a woods before.

62
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:02,239
Thanks, David, that was fun.

63
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,512
Hey, back where?

64
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,057
We're staying with our cousins,
the Chandlers.

65
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:10,744
The Chandlers? We're neighbors.
- See you, David.

66
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,670
One more day at your sister's
and, I swear, I would have asked someone to...
bring out the white coats.

67
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:58,192
David, you wanna lend a hand?

68
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,472
Hey Woofer.
- Hi, Dave.

69
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,360
What's in the can?
- Nightcrawlers.

70
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,388
Is Donnie around?
- Yep.

71
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,050
Sick, Woofer.
That's really sick.

72
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,152
Got some black one's too.

73
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:36,867
Gonna collect 'em and
put 'em in with these guys here.
Start an ant war.

74
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:38,372
Want to bet who wins?

75
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:42,259
The red ants will win.
Red ants always win.

76
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,596
Olly olly ox in free.

77
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,039
Hey geeks, it's me.

78
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,845
You guys there?

79
00:08:58,953 --> 00:08:59,453
Gotcha!

80
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:03,157
That wasn't funny, dufus.
- The look on your face sure was.

81
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,993
Hey, give me a hand here, will ya.

82
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:07,662
Race to the top.

83
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,164
Dork.
- Homo.

84
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,627
So you've met her.
- Who?

85
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:27,052
Oh, your cousin.
Yes, down by the rock.

86
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,282
She caught a crayfish,
first try.

87
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,817
Yes, she's pretty good at stuff.

88
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:34,777
Cute too, ain't she?
- Shit, your own cousin?

89
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,592
Second cousin. Mom says
it makes a difference.

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,252
So what's her sister like?
- Susan? Like nothin.

91
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,672
She got really messed up in
that accident.

92
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:46,452
She has to walk with those,
uh, what do you call 'em...

93
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:49,881
The things,
kids with polio wear 'em.

94
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,152
Both parents died too.

95
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,472
Mom said they must have died instantly.

96
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:58,067
Mom says they didn't even know what hit 'em.

97
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:01,903
Fact is, what hit 'em
was a goddam Chrysler.

98
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,565
Anyhow, that's why we got 'em.

99
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:09,470
Mom says Meg's the lucky one.
She said Meg got off easy.

100
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,508
What are you two dorks doin' here?

101
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:17,869
Goin' down to the carnival.
Carnies set up this morning.

102
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,967
Gonna go see 'em set up.

103
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,543
Another summer of kiddies and carnivals.
Whoop-te-fuckin'-doo.

104
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:31,426
Oh look, it's dufus and David.

105
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,837
Shut that trap of yours,
before I shut it for you.

106
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,797
Dad wants to know where you're going.
He says you're grounded.

107
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,787
Tell Dad to stick it up his ass.

108
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:42,477
Now you're really gonna get it.
I'm telling.

109
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,132
Do it, and I tell him
what I caught you and Cheryl doing
with your pillows the other night.

110
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,821
Hey, guys.
- Hi Willie.

111
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:53,672
Have fun at the dentist?
- Shut up, moron.

112
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:58,132
Mom's pissed you left. Says Woofers
tearin' up the garden and
you were suppose to babysit him.

113
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:02,003
I've had it with you kids.
Time to find me some real action.

114
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:08,045
It's summer.
So, why haven't we played the game?

115
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:29,737
Are you sure she can't see nothing?
- She can't see shit.

116
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,878
Get ready to run.
The big tree is the safe zone.

117
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:40,282
1,2,3...24,25

118
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,448
Eddie, stop it. I know thats you.
- Shut the fuck up.

119
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:56,500
19,20...
...39,40!

120
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,527
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

121
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
Oh, Shit!

122
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,237
Brown Pony!

123
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:38,024
Capture!

124
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:49,292
Now what?
- Now...she has to confess.

125
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,368
Only Lila get's to play. The rest of us just watch.
- Me first.

126
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,732
Now tell the truth.

127
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,826
Have you ever kissed a boy?
- No. But you have.

128
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,147
Tell us how you and Cheryl
play with yourselves.

129
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,642
We didn't.
- Liar.

130
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:09,132
Have you ever sucked dick?

131
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,641
A big, long, pussy-pounding dick?

132
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,610
No! Stop it.
I'm telling Dad.

133
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,626
What is it?

134
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,433
Tell us what you bitches
really did with those pillows.

135
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,737
Hi, Meg.
- Oh, Hi David.

136
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:35,467
It's neat, huh.

137
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,048
It's beautiful.

138
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,657
Want to give it a try?

139
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,114
If you wanted to, I mean.

140
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:47,354
If you're too scared to,
I...I don't mind.

141
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:49,661
Sure.

142
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:52,858
C'mon.

143
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,965
I feel like I could just fly off
and see the whole world from here.

144
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:08,773
My parents...

145
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:17,024
I know they always meant to take us
someplace like Playland or Atlantic City.

146
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:20,247
Just never got around to it, I guess.

147
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,775
I heard about what happened.

148
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,108
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:36,600
David, this is...
...is...this is amazing.

150
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,346
You ride like a real pro.

151
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,514
You mean it?

152
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,884
Sure.

153
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,612
I've got two more tickets,
if you want to go again.

154
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:49,189
Oh, I'd love to.

155
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:54,135
But I have to get back early,
Ruth said be home early.

156
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,096
She can be kind of funny sometimes.

157
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:02,340
I know, Ruth's great,
just like one of the gang.

158
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:21,277
I'll tell you what's missing from
that goddam carnival, is a
good old-fashioned hoochiecoo.

159
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,622
What's a hoopiecoo, ma?

160
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,800
Hoochiecoo.
You know, the hoochiecoochie...

161
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,152
Dancing girls, Ralphie.

162
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,537
That...and the freak show.

163
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,389
When I was your age,
we had both.

164
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:37,992
Once I saw a man with three arms.
- There ain't no such thing.

165
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,137
Don't contradict your mother.
I did.

166
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,055
I saw a man with three arms.

167
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:48,618
One of 'em, just a little bitty thing,
comin' outta here.

168
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,286
What else?
What other stuff did you see?

169
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:54,201
Things in bottles.

170
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,995
Stillborns.

171
00:15:56,005 --> 00:16:00,201
Little shrunken things.
Cats and goats, all kinds of things.

172
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:04,122
I tell ya, the carnval was
somethin' when I was a girl.

173
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,932
So tell us about this hoochiecoo.

174
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:09,235
Yeah.I still don't get it.
What's it supposed to be?

175
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:12,971
I told you.  It's dancing girls.

176
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:18,082
Some of 'em half naked, too.
With skirts up to here...

177
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,152
and little teeny brassieres.

178
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:25,752
Maybe just a ruby in the belly.
With dark red circles pain'ted

179
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:28,529
Here and here.

180
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,121
What do you boys think of that?

181
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:40,240
Suppose nothing like that's ever gonna
be sponsored by those little kiwanis, is it.
Not those boys.

182
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,395
But, they'd like to.

183
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:45,977
Hell, they'd love to.

184
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,052
But they've all got their wives.

185
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,947
Finish up your beers, boys.

186
00:16:51,953 --> 00:16:54,162
Time to get going to that carnival.

187
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,539
Don't want to miss the last night.

188
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,546
Meg! I'm takin' these boys
out for a Mr. Softy at the carnival.

189
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:06,567
You stay here and look after your sister.

190
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:08,842
And stay out of the ice box.

191
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,496
Can't have you getting fat on us.

192
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,457
Especially if you ever want to do the hoochiecoo.

193
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,737
Yeah, I heard that one.

194
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,542
Maybe I read it in Playboy.

195
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:32,636
You read that in Playboy
and I fucked Debra Padgett.

196
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:35,347
My old man buys it every month, ass-lick.

197
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:39,267
I heard theres one with Jane Mansfield?
- Yeah, I saw that one.

198
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:43,962
The biggest tits I ever saw.
- Bigger than Carol Baker's?

199
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,683
Bigger than June Wilkinson?
- Shit, bigger than Willie's.

200
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,352
Where's Donnie?

201
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:53,300
Ma said he can't come out until he finishes his dinner.

202
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,657
Has any of you seen a woman?

203
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:01,429
I mean, a real woman.
- Does Meg count?

204
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:05,313
No.

205
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,191
See anything?

206
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,737
Not even a goddam elbow.

207
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,047
Hold it, Hold it.
Wa..wa..wait.

208
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:34,559
Bitch!

209
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:40,668
Screw it.
Screw her.

210
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,968
Maybe we could get her
to play the game.

211
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,487
Goddam little buggers.

212
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,908
Tentworms.

213
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,626
I'll do this one.

214
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:04,140
You kids watch, then
you do the rest, okay?

215
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,118
Holy shit.

216
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,695
Looks like real myum,
before they finish baking.

217
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,939
Okay, you take these.

218
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:31,586
And remember...I want a yard left.

219
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:37,482
And no goin' in the woods.
Woods can take care of itself.

220
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:40,082
I don't want to.

221
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,536
Excuse me.

222
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,562
Are you offended by a few worms, honey?

223
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:48,672
No, I just don't want...
- Well I'll be damned.

224
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:54,024
What we have here boys is a lesson
in femininity.

225
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,599
Meg's squeamish.

226
00:19:56,618 --> 00:20:01,316
You understand how girls
get sqeamish don't you?

227
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:05,620
And Meg here is a lady.
Why sure she is.

228
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:10,702
So what in the name of Jesus
do you think that makes me?

229
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,359
You suppose I'm not a lady?
- No, I just thought...

230
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,822
You better damned well say no to me.

231
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:20,492
Because I don't need that kind of
insinuation coming from a kid...

232
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:23,321
can't even wipe her own face clean.

233
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:28,807
Now you go on downstairs and help
your sister with the laundry.

234
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,367
When you're finished, we'll
have something else for you.

235
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,097
My boys can handle it.

236
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:36,851
Can't you, boys.

237
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,938
I'd like a cheeseburger and a frozen lemonade, please.

238
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,306
Hi David?
Hey Meg, how's it going?

239
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:52,139
Could you lend me some money?
I'm real hungry.
I haven't eaten in almost two days.

240
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,469
Can you make that two please?

241
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,893
Why haven't you eaten?

242
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,868
I can't.

243
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:10,238
How come?
- I'm not supposed to.

244
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,682
I don't get it.
- Ruth says I am fat.

245
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:21,651
She's just kidding.
- No, David, you don't understand, Ruth hates me.

246
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,349
They all do.

247
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,882
Ruth got mad the other day.
I don't know why.

248
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:37,100
Maybe she was just in a bad mood.

249
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,042
Maybe she's not used to having girls around.

250
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,274
It wasn't just that one time.

251
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:54,789
It's all the time.

252
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,335
Nothing I ever do is right.

253
00:21:57,368 --> 00:22:00,640
I go to bed at night and it's all I can think about.

254
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:11,049
Before we came here I used to pain't.

255
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:13,759
Just a watercolor now and then.

256
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,122
I don't suppose I was very good at it, but...

257
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,025
My mother used like 'em.

258
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:24,761
I've tried, but I
just can't pain't anymore.

259
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:29,029
Because I know what Ruth would do.
I know what she'd say.

260
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:32,564
She'd just look at me...

261
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:36,391
and tell me I was stupid and
wasting my time for even trying.

262
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,756
That doesn't sound like the Ruth I know.

263
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:43,182
Come on, why don't you try?

264
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:46,247
Why don't you try making Ruth a watercolor?

265
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:47,947
I bet she'd love it.

266
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:50,793
No, I couldn't, honest.

267
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:52,413
Well, what about me then?

268
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,138
Would you really want one?
- Sure I would, I'd like it a lot.

269
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,918
I will David.

270
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,697
And thank you, David, for everything.
- Don't mention it.

271
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,683
I'm not fooling around here.
You have to hold the hell back.

272
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,832
Better toughen up now.
- Yes, Mrs. Chandler.

273
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,809
Auntie Ruth.

274
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:54,211
Jesus Christ, can't you even do this?

275
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,676
Stupid shit.

276
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,252
Supper's on the table.

277
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:06,900
Give me that rubbish.
It's gonna warp your brain.

278
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:11,916
Hello there.
- Good Evening, Mrs. Moran. I'm Meg.

279
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:16,027
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

280
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:20,064
Would you like to come in, have something to eat?
- I can't, really, I...

281
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:23,510
I just dropped by to give this to David.

282
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:34,529
Thanks, Meg.
- It's kind of stupid, really.

283
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,375
You can throw it away
if you don't like it.

284
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,173
What have we here?

285
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,114
That's really good.

286
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:57,014
She's something, isn't she?

287
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,373
Mrs. Chandler must love having her around.

288
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,217
You must be David.
- Yeah. Hi Susan.

289
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:24,012
Meg says you're nice.

290
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:28,581
What you got there, Sport?
- Just those Perry Como records you wanted.

291
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:36,268
I have something for you.
- Ralphie, Turn that TV down.

292
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:39,788
What is it, David?
- A present.

293
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,573
From Meg.

294
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,395
She pain'ted for you.

295
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,030
Meg, It's beautiful.

296
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,862
Don't try and fool me.

297
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:16,222
She pain'ted this for you, Davy.
- No she didn't.

298
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,422
Look at this.

299
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:21,571
It's a boy by a riverbed.
Of course it's for you.

300
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:25,692
Take it. I don't want it.
- It was meant for you, Ruth.

301
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,707
She just wanted...
- David, don't.

302
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,749
Take a lesson, boys.

303
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,704
Listen close.
This is important.

304
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:35,857
All you gotta do is be nice to a woman

305
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:39,357
and she'll do all sorts
of good things for you.

306
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,675
Take Davy here,

307
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,291
He was nice to Meggy
and he got himself a pain'ting.

308
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:47,974
That is what you got, isn't it David?

309
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:51,227
Is that all you got?
- C'mon Ruth.

310
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:55,427
I know you're a little young,
but these days you never know.

311
00:26:55,431 --> 00:27:00,132
Girls these days are just plain
easy. That's their problem.

312
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:05,542
Promise them a litte something,
and you can have whatever you want.

313
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,743
Trust me, I know
I am talking about.

314
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,747
Look at your own father, Davy.

315
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,922
He screwed half
the women in this town.

316
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:16,382
Everyone knows it.
Your own mama knows it.

317
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,177
Don't be ashamed.

318
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:23,537
At least he's the hard working sort,
provides a decent home for his family.

319
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:29,027
Willie Sr was going to own his own company
when we were married.

320
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:32,992
We were gonna be richer than
my folks were when I was a kid in Haddenfield.

321
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:37,085
And that was pretty rich,
let me tell ya.

322
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,726
Now look what I got.

323
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:44,415
And that lovely Irish bastard
is off to god knows where.

324
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:48,752
I'll tell ya, girls are dumb.

325
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,817
Girls are easy.

326
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,440
Suckers.

327
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:56,370
Straight on down the line.

328
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,762
Now you take this pain'ting back...

329
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:04,195
I know you did it for Davy.

330
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:07,931
And don't go trying to tell me anything different.

331
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:12,691
The thing I want to know is, Meggie...

332
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,321
What are you gonna get out of it?

333
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,553
Now we all know that Davy here
is a nice guy, but...

334
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,357
he's not going to give you a damned thing.

335
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:26,798
So I hope that this pain'ting
is all you've given him.

336
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:33,141
'cause you already got what men want right down here.
And it ain't your goddam artwork.

337
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:42,552
You start giving boys what they want now, and
you're gonna turn out to be nothing but a slut, honey.

338
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:44,546
You know what a slut is?

339
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,763
Do you, Susan?
Of course not, you're too young.

340
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:52,032
Well, I'll tell you what a slut is.

341
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,967
A slut is someone who spreads her legs for a man...

342
00:28:56,974 --> 00:29:00,093
so that he can weasel his way inside.

343
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:02,953
Quit your goddam giggling, Ralphie.

344
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:07,327
Anyone who's a slut
deserves a thrashing.

345
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:11,081
I'm sure anyone in this town would agree with me.

346
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,789
I am just warning you, honey.

347
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:17,592
If I see any slutting going on around this house...

348
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:22,235
your ass is grass, and
Auntie Ruth's the lawnmower.

349
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,221
Who wants a beer?

350
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:39,447
Oh sweetie, was I born yesterday?

351
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,983
I used to pain't for my mother.
I've been trying since day one to...

352
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:49,257
I don't know what you did with your mother.
-I'm telling you you're a slut.

353
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:53,876
Want to spend your time
pain'ting for a boy?

354
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:59,392
Get off me.
You're gonna pay!
- Fine, gladly!

355
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,773
Don't forget your little sister.

356
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:06,493
Nice behavior.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get it all.

357
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:12,279
Right, so that's how I behave.
Spending all day fantasizing about a boy.

358
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:16,514
Good night, girls.
It's been lovely.

359
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,272
Stop. Stop. Stop.

360
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,451
Hey, David, come look.
She's ticklish.

361
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:04,210
Please, leave me alone.
- Get her.

362
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,700
You bitch, what the hell did you have to go and do that for?

363
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:09,822
You saw what he did.
- He didn't do nothing.

364
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,082
You scratched his face.
- I'm telling Mom.

365
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:16,342
I don't care what you do anymore.

366
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:20,227
Your sister is a goddam bitch.

367
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:24,257
Someone want to tell me what
in God's name is going on in here?

368
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:27,498
Meg hit Woofer.
- She slapped him across the face.

369
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:29,737
Someone must have provoked her.

370
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:33,882
We were just tickling her, that's all.
And she hauls off and clobbers Woofers in the face.

371
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,074
You too, Davy?

372
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:41,660
Were you tickling Meg too?
- No, I just came in.

373
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:46,662
I'm not acusing you, honey.
I'm just asking a simple question.

374
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,988
Where is she now?
- I do not know. She just ran out.

375
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,758
Susan, did you see what happened here?

376
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:58,015
And did you try to stop her
from hitting Ralphie?

377
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:02,977
I couldn't.
- You should have tried, honey.

378
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:05,714
Meg's your sister, after all.

379
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:10,695
Do you know what it means...

380
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:16,532
to be in connivence with somebody?

381
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:21,127
It means that you are guilty too.

382
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:25,077
Even though maybe you didn't do anything in particular...

383
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:29,807
it makes you sort of a fellow traveller.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

384
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:33,822
Let me try and make this clear.

385
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,113
You love your sister, right?

386
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:41,742
Because you love her, you would
forgive her something like this, wouldn't you?

387
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:44,937
She didn't mean to hurt him.
She just got mad.

388
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:49,957
Of course she did.
But you'd forgive her, am I right?

389
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:54,672
Well you see now that's just plain wrong, honey.

390
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:58,977
That's just what puts you in connivence with her.

391
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:02,862
What she did was wrong.
It's bad behavoir.

392
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:08,220
And you forgiving her, just because
you love her, that isn't right either.

393
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:14,001
I want you to slip over the side of the bed here.

394
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,054
Lift up your dress and slide down your drawers.

395
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,780
Come on over now.

396
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:24,204
Oh, don't make Auntie Ruth drag you.

397
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:28,342
Disobedience.
That's another thing.

398
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,492
I'll give you five for conniving.

399
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:34,642
And then ten for Meg.

400
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:39,692
And another five for disobeying.
That's twenty.

401
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,592
Boys, you stay here.

402
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:43,032
Girls just cry.

403
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,187
There is nothing we can to do about it.

404
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:49,948
This is for her own good.
And you being here is part of it.

405
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,967
Don't touch her!

406
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:02,927
Not so fun when it's your precious
sister getting slapped around.

407
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,574
Is it, Meggie.

408
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:07,492
Teach you to pick on people your own size.

409
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:15,701
You get off of me.
- I know you do honey.

410
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:23,680
Stop. Stop. Please.

411
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,320
You still owe me two more.

412
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:37,972
Now, give me that ring.

413
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:41,477
It was my mothers.
- Your mother is dead.

414
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,572
And this is my house you're living in,
I make the rules here.

415
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:46,862
Now, give me the goddam ring.

416
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,081
I gotta go.

417
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:58,172
This is what we call a little domestic
dispute. It's just between us.

418
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:00,067
You saw what you saw...

419
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:03,878
but it's nobody's business, but ours.

420
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:06,190
Understand?

421
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,862
What's up guys, what's your flavor?
- I'll have a red popsicles.

422
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:28,177
I'll take a brown cow.
- Thank you, guys.

423
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,416
What time does the fireworks start?
- I think around eight-thiryish.

424
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,249
Sit down, join us.

425
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:05,938
Donnie, get me a couple more beers.

426
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:23,231
You brought a cop here
after my mother.

427
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,682
Sit your ass down, Willie.

428
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:32,023
I said, sit down.

429
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,199
All I want to know is what were you thinking, Meggie.

430
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:43,726
What went through your mind?

431
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:49,962
Did you actually think he was going to take you away?

432
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,568
You and Susan.

433
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:54,060
Get you out of here?

434
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,011
Well, I'll tell ya, it's not gonna happen.

435
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:09,668
He's not gonna take you anywhere,
because he doesn't care to.

436
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,459
What's left?

437
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:16,345
What'd you have in mind?

438
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:21,277
You thought maybe I'd be scared of him?

439
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:37,404
The problem is.

440
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:39,554
What do we do now?

441
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:48,247
There is nothing about that man, or any man, that scares me.

442
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:52,202
If you didn't know that before,
then I hope to hell you know it now.

443
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:56,479
But I can't have you running to the
cops every other day, now either, can I?

444
00:37:58,164 --> 00:38:00,547
So the question is...

445
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:02,572
What now?

446
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,176
I'd send you someplace, if there
was someplace to send you, I would.

447
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:16,882
Damned if I need some stupid little
whore running around ruining my reputation.

448
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:21,020
God knows they don't pay me enough
to bother trying to correct you.

449
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:25,717
I guess I gotta think on this.

450
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,513
Go to your room.

451
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:50,010
I mean all of you.

452
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:57,367
You too, Davy.

453
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:01,226
Sorry, but I got some
difficult thinking to do.

454
00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:06,001
Want a beer or something, for the road?
- No, thanks.

455
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,199
Just don't go telling your daddy who gave it to you.

456
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,317
Thanks, Ruth.
- Auntie Ruth.

457
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:22,562
So'd you think anymore about it?
- About what?

458
00:39:22,678 --> 00:39:24,674
Getting Meg into the game?

459
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:27,038
We got our own game now.

460
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,491
No, I don't think so, David.

461
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,953
... always gonna sleep here all the time.

462
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:41,835
Not lately you don't.

463
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,927
Is it because Meg and Susan?
- That's right.

464
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:51,247
It's not that big of a deal.
It's the same as before.

465
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:56,007
No, it's not the same as before,
and you know perfectly well what the big deal is.

466
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,137
No Mom, I don't know.
- What's the big deal?

467
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,960
He wants to sleep over there again.
- What, next door?

468
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,620
So...let him.

469
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:13,037
Not that you're up on current events around here...

470
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:17,550
but there are two young girls living at the Chandlers' now.

471
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,977
Don't be dense, Robert.
- Dense, hell.

472
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,752
Is there any coffee left?

473
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,009
Thanks, Dad.
- Don't mention it.

474
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,832
Now we're all here.

475
00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:44,742
The game is she's gotta tell.

476
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:47,552
Tell what?
- Something secret.

477
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:51,327
Sounds right. But how's she gonna do it with the gag on?

478
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,342
You don't want her to tell right away, Mom.

479
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,552
You want to tell, Meggie?
- No, she's not ready.

480
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,015
So now what?

481
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,848
Now, we take a book away.

482
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,972
Now confess.

483
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,479
Do another book.

484
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,227
Let's see how long she can go like that.
- It's gonna hurt after a while.

485
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,267
It's still too easy.

486
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:32,007
Don't you want to give her a chance to confess?
Isn't that the idea?

487
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:35,977
No, it's still too soon.
Take the other book, Willie.

488
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:46,105
We should strip her.
- Yes, strip her.

489
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:48,442
Shut up.
- I don't think its a really good...

490
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,323
We got permission.

491
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:53,859
I say, let's strip her.

492
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:56,747
That's the game, isn't it?

493
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,419
Who gets to do it?
- I do.

494
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:03,067
Care about the clothes, ma?
I won't have to do the shorts.

495
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:05,015
No, I do not care.

496
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,590
Now, I won't hurt you.

497
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:17,058
But if you start something...

498
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:20,620
I might just have to.

499
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:23,332
Don't be stupid.

500
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,825
Please.

501
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,741
Now don't kick.

502
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:29,562
Ready to confess yet, Meggie?

503
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:31,408
Let me do the rest.

504
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:34,216
Then maybe we'll let her confess.

505
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,834
Now you can confess.

506
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,158
Get the ropes.

507
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:59,109
Could you...my arms?
They really hurt.

508
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:03,060
That's all you get.
- Come on, confess!

509
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:05,352
Tell us about how you play with yourself.

510
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:07,595
I bet you put your finger in it, don't ya?

511
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,619
Yeah, tell us about the Syph.
- And the Clap.

512
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,620
David?

513
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:17,206
Is David here?
- Yeah, he's here.

514
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:25,412
Where is Susan?
- She's here too.

515
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,212
Who cares about Susan,
where's the confession?

516
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,408
There's no confession!

517
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:38,945
Please, let me go, please.

518
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:42,767
Don't you touch that girl.

519
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:45,847
I do not want any of you
touching her.

520
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,682
Girl like here ain't even clean.

521
00:45:48,686 --> 00:45:51,617
Keep your hands off her.
Hear?

522
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:57,437
But first, we better put that gag back in.

523
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,050
It's pretty dirty.

524
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:05,157
No, it's not that dirty.

525
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:08,218
I can't have her down here screaming all night. Put it in.

526
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:18,394
You want to think about one thing, girl.

527
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:20,622
Two things, actually.

528
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:21,754
First.

529
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:26,477
It could be your little sister hanging
instead of you.

530
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:27,762
And second.

531
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:32,817
I know some of the bad things you've done.
And I'm kind of interrested to hear them.

532
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:37,372
Maybe this confessing isn't such a kids game after all.

533
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:40,317
I can hear it from one of you...

534
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:43,482
or I can hear it from the other.

535
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:45,657
You just think about that.

536
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,699
I wonder what it feels like.

537
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:13,747
Standing down there for so long with
her hands tied up over her head like that.

538
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,658
It's gotta hurt.

539
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,331
Really hurt.

540
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,019
Did you guys even see her?

541
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:27,711
I mean the way she looked.

542
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:31,882
Down there.
- I've never seen anything like it.

543
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:34,972
Why don't we go check on her.

544
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:38,492
Get another look.
- Are you nuts? Mom would hear.

545
00:47:38,496 --> 00:47:41,492
We can be quiet.
- Are you kidding?

546
00:47:41,494 --> 00:47:44,747
If we so much as cut a fart
under the sheets, she'll hear it.

547
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,100
Quiet.

548
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:01,477
Bet she wants some water.

549
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:04,474
You idiot. If we give her water
then we gotta take out the gag.

550
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,282
So what?
She won't make any noise.

551
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:10,712
You won't make any noise, will you Meg?

552
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:13,837
If you do, it'll wake mom.

553
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:18,233
She makes any noise, she gets in trouble too.
She ain't stupid.

554
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,017
My arms and my shoulders...
they hurt alot.

555
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:43,589
I guess we could...
- A little.

556
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:48,342
On one condition.
- Anything.

557
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:51,607
You have to promise not to fight
and not to tell anybody.

558
00:48:51,614 --> 00:48:52,844
Not ever.

559
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:55,703
Tell what?
- You know.

560
00:48:58,774 --> 00:49:02,460
We won't hurt you or anything,
we just want to touch.

561
00:49:02,611 --> 00:49:04,297
No, you're not gonna do that to me.
Not any of you.

562
00:49:04,304 --> 00:49:08,617
We could do it anyway. Who's gonna stop us?
- I am.

563
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:11,672
Oh yeah? How?

564
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:16,132
You will only do it to me once, goddam you,
and only one of you...

565
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,275
'cause I won't just tell...I'll scream.

566
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,665
Ok, then...

567
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,102
We keep the ropes

568
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:28,194
And we gag you again.

569
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:30,173
And that's that.

570
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:32,268
Alright.

571
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,205
Gag me.

572
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,248
Do it, leave...get out of here.

573
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,682
We will.

574
00:49:40,717 --> 00:49:42,177
Open up.

575
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:43,877
We still got a deal.

576
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:45,733
You got your water.

577
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:50,615
But we were never here.
Understand?

578
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:53,346
Good

579
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:56,573
Come on guys, let's giver her
a little slack. Ruth won't notice.

580
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,074
Just look at her.
Morning's a long way off, you know what I mean.

581
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:13,173
See you.

582
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:27,724
C'mon in.

583
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,817
Eat your toast, honey.

584
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:42,799
Come on sweetie, have some.
- I can't.  Mouths too dry.

585
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,067
I'm not waisting food, Meg.

586
00:50:46,074 --> 00:50:48,032
I made this toast for you.

587
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:50,460
What do you want me to do?
Throw it out?

588
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:52,992
Just leave it here.
I'll eat it in a little while.

589
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:54,927
It'll bring bugs.

590
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:57,162
Roaches and ants.

591
00:50:57,169 --> 00:51:00,242
I'm not having bugs in my house.

592
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:03,442
You eat it now.
While it's fresh.

593
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:07,877
I'll eat it sooner, I promise, it's just...
It's hard for me now so...

594
00:51:07,882 --> 00:51:09,977
I'll drink the tea.
Ok?

595
00:51:09,982 --> 00:51:12,832
Nobody said it was easy.

596
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:18,407
You're a woman, Meg, and that's hard.
Not easy.

597
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:21,146
Eat it.

598
00:51:24,632 --> 00:51:28,332
Goddam you, you broke my cup.

599
00:51:32,203 --> 00:51:34,432
You think tea is cheap?

600
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,117
I didn't.  Right, Ruth?

601
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:38,822
What about this?

602
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:42,357
Who's gonna clean up the goddam mess?

603
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,207
I will.
I'm sorry.

604
00:51:45,214 --> 00:51:47,441
Susan...Suzy, come here.

605
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:53,655
You boys get hold of Meg, in
case she decides to get mean or stupid.

606
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,239
Okay, you stand here.

607
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:01,107
This is how we clean the floor.

608
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:03,248
By cleaning the slate.

609
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:06,042
We're gonna make a new rule.

610
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:07,577
You disobey...

611
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:11,029
you wise-mouth me, you sass me,
anything like that, missy...

612
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:13,482
and she pays for it.

613
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:15,205
We'll try that.

614
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:17,565
Do you think that's fair, Suzie?

615
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:21,388
Do you think you should pay
for what your trash sister does?

616
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,053
No.
- Of course not.

617
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,257
But nobody said life is fair.

618
00:52:29,971 --> 00:52:33,851
Pull up this little girls skirt
and pull down her panties for Mommy.

619
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,432
Hey, where you going?

620
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:08,742
Gotta go help my dad at work.

621
00:53:08,745 --> 00:53:12,529
There's a game up at the water tower, later.
Wanna play?
- Nah.

622
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,880
You ever see a guy hit a girl?

623
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:43,817
Yeah, I guess so.
Drunks or kids.

624
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:47,137
You ever figure it's ever okay?

625
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:49,632
You mean justified?
- Yeah.

626
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:57,085
That's a tough one.

627
00:53:57,285 --> 00:54:00,195
I mean a woman can really tick you off sometimes.

628
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:04,222
But you gotta respect the fact
that she's the weaker of the species.

629
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:06,435
It'd be like being a bully.

630
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,532
But even so...

631
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,148
I've seen 'em deserve it now and then.

632
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:17,457
You work in a bar you see that kind of thing.

633
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,632
A woman has a little too much to drink.
She gets abusive, loud.

634
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:23,532
Woman takes a poke at the man she's
with. What's he supposed to do?

635
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:24,995
Just sit there?

636
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:28,117
So he whacks her one.

637
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:31,656
But, Dad, you just said...
- It's the exception that proves the rule.

638
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:34,993
You should never hit a woman.

639
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:37,790
And God forbid I ever catch you doing it.

640
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,117
Sometimes...

641
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,667
there's nothing else you can do.

642
00:54:43,672 --> 00:54:46,197
You get pushed that far.
You see?

643
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:48,879
Look, it works both ways.

644
00:54:50,393 --> 00:54:51,897
Best advice.

645
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:56,201
Keep your hands to yourself, mind
your own business. Men or women.

646
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:58,724
That's how you stay out of trouble.

647
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,573
Hi, Susan.

648
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,717
Ruth around?

649
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:45,113
She's upstairs resting.

650
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,967
I can't make them stop.

651
00:55:54,023 --> 00:55:57,488
Do you know?
- I know.

652
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:02,568
I would if I could.

653
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:18,269
Don't you think it's had enough?
- Bullshit.

654
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,389
C'mon you piece of shit.  Get up.

655
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,994
Your turn to tie her up.

656
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,214
Forget something, Davy?

657
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:40,765
I'm sorry.

658
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:45,792
I have something to tell you.

659
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:26,537
Quit moving.

660
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:34,607
Good morning, Davy.

661
00:59:36,648 --> 00:59:41,039
Grab yourself a beer if you want.
- Maybe later.

662
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:46,863
Shit.
- Dammit, Donnie.

663
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:55,416
Now we gotta cauterize.

664
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,633
Shut up.

665
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:07,096
Shut up or I'll do it again.

666
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:15,499
Answer it.
Go slow.  Go easy.

667
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:18,464
Did you hear me?

668
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,998
I said:
Shut up or I'll do it again.

669
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:28,277
Ruth?  Don't you think, I mean, if it's
somebody, should you be leaving it to them?

670
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:31,302
Don't you think you oughtta handle it, Ruth?

671
01:00:31,306 --> 01:00:33,615
Suppose it's Mr. Jennings again.

672
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,998
Who?
- The cops, Ruth.

673
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:44,192
I can...watch her for you.

674
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:47,515
Watch her?
- To make sure she doesn't run away.

675
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:54,379
You watch her.
Good idea.

676
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:06,122
One sound down here, and I promise I'll kill the both of you.

677
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:10,272
Not just punish you, kill you.
Dead.

678
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:15,746
You got that, Davy?
Are we straight about that? Good.

679
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,072
Very good.

680
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:36,072
Here she is.

681
01:01:37,088 --> 01:01:38,507
Afternoon, Mrs. Chandler.

682
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:42,022
I was in the neighborhood, thought
I'd stop by, see how the girls are doing.

683
01:01:42,028 --> 01:01:45,487
Why! How thoughtful.
They're just fine.

684
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,616
Come in, please.

685
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:57,747
The girls are out shopping right now.

686
01:01:57,752 --> 01:02:01,137
Would you like some coffee?
- No thank you, Mrs. Chandler.

687
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:05,601
How 'bout some lemonade to go?
It's such a hot day.

688
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,526
No thank you.

689
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:15,366
I'm gonna get you out of here, Meg.
I've got some money.

690
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,831
You're gonna be okay.

691
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:21,705
I'm right here to make sure that nothing
happens to Susan.

692
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:28,044
And then we can come back and make sure she's ok, too.

693
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,805
Go back to the cops.

694
01:02:31,598 --> 01:02:33,766
Show them this.

695
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:40,085
Tonight.
I promise.

696
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:52,432
This one's my little shadow.

697
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:54,747
Mrs. Chandler, I...

698
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:57,027
Everyone calls me Ruth.

699
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:01,362
I recieved a phone call from
Mrs. Marino up the street.

700
01:03:01,366 --> 01:03:03,612
It seems her eldest boy, Tony...

701
01:03:03,615 --> 01:03:06,677
Oh! Tony we know him very well.
Such a sweet boy.

702
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:12,511
Tony told his mother that he'd seen several other boys
from the neighborhood over here, beating up on Meg.

703
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:17,437
You know kids, Officer Jennings,
they are always exaggerating.
It was probably just a little rough-housing.

704
01:03:17,444 --> 01:03:20,165
He said they were using her like a punching bag.

705
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:23,216
You boys know about anything like that?

706
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:32,037
How did you know?
- Know what?

707
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:35,214
Did you tell him?
- Tell him?  Tell what? What are you talking about?

708
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:37,142
Don't fuck with me, David.

709
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,622
Mom said you told her it might
be Jennings at the door.

710
01:03:39,628 --> 01:03:41,177
So who the hell do you think that was?

711
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,692
It was just a guess.
- Pretty fucking good guess, man.

712
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:46,292
Look, I was just trying to get Ruth...
- Get her to what?

713
01:03:46,297 --> 01:03:50,348
To get her moving, for Christ's sake.
You've seen her.
She looks like a freakin' zombie, down here.

714
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:52,901
She did get pretty weird.

715
01:03:54,193 --> 01:03:55,920
I guess so.

716
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:59,597
What about Meg?
- What about Meg?

717
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:04,154
We got to, at least, put something on
those burns it'll get infected.

718
01:04:05,336 --> 01:04:06,937
Fuck her.

719
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,034
I'm ain't even sure I'm done with her yet.

720
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,747
But then again...

721
01:04:13,782 --> 01:04:15,584
Maybe, I am.

722
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:18,743
I don't know.

723
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,669
I just don't know.

724
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:16,105
Ralphie, turn that TV down.

725
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,222
I'll leave the bolt on the back door open.

726
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:58,980
They'll think they just forgot.
Give me, maybe, half an hour.

727
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:04,252
Here, take this.
- David, David, I can't, I can't.

728
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:07,987
If something goes wrong.

729
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,237
And they find it on me.

730
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:13,017
They'll know somebody's been here.

731
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:17,324
We'd never get another chance.

732
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:21,800
Leave it for me...

733
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:23,602
At the big rock.

734
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:32,627
Get me word, if you can.
Really.  You need to.

735
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,209
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

736
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:41,578
It's what you do last that counts.

737
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:20,514
Come in.  Close the door behind you.

738
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,718
You stay.

739
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,665
That's what you're good for, girl.

740
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:11,985
You probably got the Clap, now,
but nevermind.

741
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:14,314
They got cures these days.

742
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:18,666
I want my mommy.
- Shut the fuck up.

743
01:09:20,482 --> 01:09:24,767
Who else wants a turn?
Eddie? Davy?

744
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:25,792
I do.

745
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:30,177
I don't know about that. Your brother just
had her, seems kinda like incest to me.

746
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:32,877
Come on, mom.
- I don't think so.

747
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:35,846
Not that that little whore would give a damn, but...

748
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,155
I'd feel...

749
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:43,718
a whole lot better if it was
Eddie or Davy.

750
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:49,573
Maybe not, boy's sensible.
I know I wouldn't touch her.

751
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:52,682
But I'm not a man, then, am I?

752
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:55,977
I just want to cut her.
- Yeah! Me too.

753
01:09:55,981 --> 01:09:57,287
Cut her?

754
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:01,247
Why not let Donnie fuck her?
- Shut up, I'm talking to Ralphie.

755
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,482
Cut her how, baby?

756
01:10:03,488 --> 01:10:07,053
Put something on her, so people'd
know she's a whore.

757
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:16,785
Let us cut her, Mom.
- Ok.

758
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:20,394
Ruth!
- What?

759
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:24,190
You're not really doing this.

760
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:27,492
Kids said we could.

761
01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:30,758
So I guess we will.

762
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:34,982
You know what this bitch tried to do last night?

763
01:10:34,987 --> 01:10:37,108
She tried to get out of here.

764
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:40,275
Somebody left the door open.

765
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:45,782
We figure it was Donnie.
'Cause he was the last one down here.

766
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:49,552
And besides, he's always been sweet on her.

767
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:53,792
Why can't I?
- What?

768
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,072
Fuck her.

769
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,742
Because I said so, goddammit.
It's incest.

770
01:10:58,746 --> 01:11:02,685
You want to go skinny-dipping in your own
brothers' scum?  You're disgusting.

771
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,679
Just like your goddam father.
Don't talk to me.

772
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:07,554
Ruth, you can't do this.

773
01:11:07,632 --> 01:11:09,193
Can't?

774
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,342
It isn't right.

775
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:15,326
Please don't tell me whats right, boy.

776
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,842
Don't you ever tell me.

777
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:25,232
Here we go.

778
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:29,327
We'll have to heat it through.

779
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,737
Otherwise she'll get an infection.

780
01:11:36,243 --> 01:11:39,744
I'm wanna get the hell outta here.
- You're not going anywhere.

781
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,192
I don't want to see this.

782
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,692
Then close your fucking eyes.

783
01:12:38,472 --> 01:12:39,887
You see?

784
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,077
Now it's there forever, Meggie.

785
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:44,289
You'll never have to get married.

786
01:12:44,499 --> 01:12:48,123
Can't take your clothes off.
Not for anybody.

787
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,394
You're better off.

788
01:12:52,665 --> 01:12:54,358
No man will want you.

789
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,617
Never have the burden of kids.

790
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,200
You're lucky.

791
01:12:59,049 --> 01:13:02,177
You thought it was good to be cute.

792
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:04,062
To be sexy.

793
01:13:04,067 --> 01:13:08,192
A woman is better off loathsome in this world.

794
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:15,237
She ain't so much anymore.
- I told you.

795
01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:17,541
See?  A woman knows these things.

796
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:25,480
Nah.  She ain't much at all.

797
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,607
You boys better string her up again.

798
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:34,274
Wait a minute.

799
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:39,787
We got her so no man will ever want her.

800
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:42,021
The problem is, see...

801
01:13:50,877 --> 01:13:53,191
Meg may still want him.

802
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:55,772
Life of toement there.

803
01:13:55,778 --> 01:14:00,161
A woman doesn't want a man all over her body.

804
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:04,109
She just wants him in one particular place.

805
01:14:04,488 --> 01:14:06,952
You girls know what I'm talking about?

806
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:09,332
Well, darlings, you will.

807
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:13,200
A woman wants a man
between her legs.

808
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:15,131
One little spot.

809
01:14:15,298 --> 01:14:18,200
You take out that spot...

810
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,268
You know what happens?

811
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:23,927
You take out all of her desire.

812
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,953
You take it out forever.
It works.

813
01:14:27,237 --> 01:14:29,297
They do it some places, all the time, like

814
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:33,750
it's just the usual thing to do when
a girl reaches certain age.

815
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:38,365
Places like Africa, New Guinea,

816
01:14:38,671 --> 01:14:41,860
They even consider it
a civilized practice.

817
01:14:42,205 --> 01:14:46,497
I'm figuring.  Why not here?

818
01:14:46,994 --> 01:14:51,283
We just take
out that one little spot.

819
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,983
We'll burn it out.

820
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:58,036
And then our Meg will be perfect.

821
01:14:58,037 --> 01:14:59,037
Oh, Fuck!

822
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:07,007
Just where the hell do you think you're going?

823
01:15:07,011 --> 01:15:10,847
Off to tell that stuckup bitch of a mother
of yours?

824
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:13,537
Or how 'bout Officer Jennings?

825
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:15,887
Well, I guess you're with her now.

826
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:20,602
Not quite sure what we'll do with you
yet, but we'll figure something out.

827
01:15:20,608 --> 01:15:25,032
Just be glad you haven't got a little spot like she's got.

828
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:30,055
Then again, you've got two friends
of your own to worry about.  Don't you?

829
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:34,297
Tie him up, boys.

830
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:42,407
Where were we?

831
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:40,765
David?

832
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:45,797
Do you hate me?
- Of course not.

833
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,025
You should.
- And Meg should too.

834
01:17:50,854 --> 01:17:53,195
'Cause it's all my fault.

835
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:58,592
Without Me, Meg could have
gone last night, and not come back.

836
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:00,739
She tried, Susan.

837
01:18:02,924 --> 01:18:04,742
She tried, and they caught her.

838
01:18:04,745 --> 01:18:08,020
They caught her when she came upstairs to get me.

839
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:10,509
She got out somehow.

840
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:14,545
I did it.
I let her out.

841
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:18,222
She was supposed to come back for you later.

842
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,777
Why didn't she just run?

843
01:18:20,782 --> 01:18:24,461
I think...because...

844
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,375
sometimes Ruth...

845
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:31,846
She touches me.

846
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,782
And once she made me bleed.

847
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:37,196
And I told Meg,

848
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:42,227
And Meg got real mad and told Ruth
that she knew what she did.

849
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,094
And then Ruth beat her again.

850
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:46,990
Beat her bad.

851
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:49,972
She should have gone without me.

852
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,174
I didn't mean for her to get hurt.

853
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,982
Easy.  It'll be okay.

854
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,064
No Meg, don't do that.

855
01:19:07,818 --> 01:19:10,419
Yes it's me, and Susan's here too.

856
01:19:13,841 --> 01:19:17,567
It hurts so...bad.

857
01:19:17,575 --> 01:19:19,058
Don't move.

858
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:26,836
I'm sorry, Meg.

859
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,118
I'm sorry.

860
01:19:30,523 --> 01:19:32,729
It's okay, Susan.

861
01:19:35,924 --> 01:19:39,009
We...tried.

862
01:19:41,552 --> 01:19:43,192
Pleasant night?

863
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,312
Suppertime, I think...

864
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:48,129
When I don't come home my parents will worry.

865
01:19:48,164 --> 01:19:52,817
I can't, David.  I can't anymore.
- Just rest.

866
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:58,637
Gotta find something to hurt them.

867
01:19:58,644 --> 01:20:00,760
To get us out of here.

868
01:20:01,055 --> 01:20:02,867
There is nothing.

869
01:20:02,873 --> 01:20:05,891
You know how many things
I've tried?

870
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,652
There's this.

871
01:20:10,419 --> 01:20:11,990
Maybe.

872
01:20:13,863 --> 01:20:16,688
But we need something else though.

873
01:21:34,499 --> 01:21:36,622
Put the knife down!

874
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,650
I said put it down!

875
01:21:43,623 --> 01:21:45,453
Get him out of here.

876
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:02,717
What happened?

877
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,140
It was Ruth, Mr. Jennings.

878
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:07,387
It was Ruth.

879
01:22:07,783 --> 01:22:10,166
She did this to Meg.

880
01:22:10,246 --> 01:22:12,003
Now she's in trouble.

881
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:17,652
Stay here with her.
- C'mon.  It's okay.

882
01:22:39,808 --> 01:22:46,672
David.
- Shh. Don't talk.

883
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:50,207
Do me a favor?

884
01:22:50,643 --> 01:22:52,458
Sure.

885
01:22:55,697 --> 01:22:59,050
Can you get my mother's ring back for me?

886
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,551
Thank you.

887
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:45,235
I thought, at first, you were a dream.

888
01:23:49,178 --> 01:23:52,971
I think you've been that for me.

889
01:23:55,937 --> 01:23:57,887
A dream.

890
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:04,161
But it was no dream.

891
01:24:05,177 --> 01:24:09,413
You have never let go of me.

892
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,278
I don't understand.

893
01:24:25,513 --> 01:24:28,215
Wish I could...

894
01:24:30,213 --> 01:24:33,749
not hurt down there.

895
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:44,525
You're taking care of me now, aren't you?

896
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:45,931
Yes.

897
01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:53,398
And Susan too?

898
01:24:53,857 --> 01:24:56,434
Yes.

899
01:25:00,348 --> 01:25:03,296
I think we're gonna make it.

900
01:25:06,127 --> 01:25:08,416
...think I love you.

901
01:25:18,442 --> 01:25:21,104
No!

902
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:07,877
The past catches up to you.

903
01:26:07,879 --> 01:26:10,086
Whether you like it or not.

904
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:17,221
It can be a gift,
or a curse. If you let it.

905
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:42,648
I will never forget the gift
of Meg Loughlin.

906
01:26:43,789 --> 01:26:47,332
Though I am plagued with
the torment of feeling again...

907
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:49,522
of failing somebody.

908
01:26:51,762 --> 01:26:53,501
But as she taught me...

909
01:26:54,967 --> 01:26:57,937
It's what you do last,
that counts.
