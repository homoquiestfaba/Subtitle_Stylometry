1
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:31,563
It was 1957 and we're driving
from Florida to Utah.

2
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,605
After my mother was beaten
by her boyfriend...

3
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,300
...we hightailed it
for the uranium fields.

4
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,775
We were gonna change our luck...

5
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:43,882
...which hadn't been so hot since
our family broke up five years ago.

6
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:49,887
I spy with my little eye
something that begins with C.

7
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:51,888
-Cactus. Cactus.
-Nope.

8
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,550
-No?
-It's upwards.

9
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,687
-Up. Up in the....
-Clouds. Clouds.

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,324
Okay, your turn.

11
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,733
I was caught up in my mother's freedom,
her delight in her freedom.

12
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:10,343
She was going to get rich on uranium
and I was going to help her.

13
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:55,548
-How does this thing work, anyway?
-Well, I think it causes like a--

14
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:59,886
It makes a black light that causes
uranium traces to glow.

15
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,462
We can walk along the street
and find uranium?

16
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,724
Well, it was everywhere
in Moab, they say.

17
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,458
We were too late in Moab.

18
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:12,298
That guy said nobody had found
uranium in Salt Lake City.

19
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,373
That means we'll have
the place to ourselves, huh?

20
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,976
-Yeah.
-This could be a big break for us.

21
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,807
If this works out,
just think about it.

22
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:26,385
We could get a real house
and we could get rid of this damn Nash.

23
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,249
We'd have no more money worries.

24
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:33,051
It'd be just like
heaven on a June day.

25
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,891
Heaven on a June day.

26
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:49,935
Damn it.

27
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,309
If I had one wish right now, only one
wish, you know what it would be?

28
00:03:55,482 --> 00:04:00,112
I'd like to burn this
goddamn Nash to a crisp.

29
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,414
I'm serious. I hate it.

30
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:06,389
I hate the man who invented it.
I hate the factory who produced it.

31
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,926
Almost makes me want to see Roy.

32
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,724
He was the only one who could
make it stop overheating.

33
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:17,393
My God, he was boring.
Boring and mean.

34
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,506
You sure got crappy
taste in boyfriends.

35
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,943
Come on, let's go get
rich in Salt Lake.

36
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,554
Wait a minute.
You're pulling my leg, right?

37
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,630
No. We came here to look for uranium.

38
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:49,667
If you're looking for uranium,
why didn't you go to Moab?

39
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:52,430
We went there,
but everybody beat us.

40
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:56,372
So you came here just
on the chance you'd find uranium?

41
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,101
Yeah.

42
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:02,413
Do you mind me saying something
that might sound rude?

43
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:07,383
Lady, you got more courage
than you got common sense.

44
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:19,596
-So, what'd the man say?
-Don't ask.

45
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:36,846
My mom had her own way of solving
problems. She left them behind.

46
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,815
That's what she
did with the Nash, just left it.

47
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:43,945
Things are going to start looking up.
I can feel it.

48
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,955
The good times are coming.

49
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,789
My mom had high hopes,
especially for me.

50
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:53,455
I'd been giving her no end
of grief since she left Dad.

51
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,694
I decided I was gonna do better.
I'd have straight-arrow friends.

52
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:02,069
I was gonna get all A 's in school
and keep my nose clean.

53
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,142
I promised it and meant it.

54
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,881
We give new boys
the benefit of the doubt.

55
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,542
This is the second time
you've been in front of me.

56
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,157
I think you'd better give your mother
a call, tell her to come down here.

57
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,555
She works.

58
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,760
She's working.

59
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,890
-It wasn't me who broke their window.
-Please.

60
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:32,004
-Believe them instead of me.
-If you care for me, be quiet.

61
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:36,802
If you'd cared anything about me,
you would've stayed married to Dad.

62
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,507
I didn't really mean that.

63
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,306
I knew it wasn't true.

64
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:44,746
My father went his own way
before they called it quits...

65
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,149
...and took my older brother,
Gregory, with him.

66
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:55,322
Sometimes I had to blame somebody,
and she was the only one there.

67
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,768
-What time is it?
-7, almost.

68
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:39,996
Why didn't you wake me?

69
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:45,270
I started dinner. The potatoes are
frying and I'm heating up hot dogs.

70
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:58,490
-I'm sorry.
-I know you are.

71
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:02,617
I know your father doesn't call
and your brother doesn't write...

72
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:07,062
-...but you know it's not my fault.
-I know.

73
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,723
Okay.

74
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,633
Hello?

75
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,039
Hello, Roy.

76
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,072
A Winchester! Thanks.

77
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:29,945
I found me a room. But it's clear
the hell and gone across town.

78
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:36,328
And I think I got a job lined up doing
tune-ups at a Texaco station.

79
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,797
So how you like it at Winstead's?

80
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:49,875
-How do you know where I work, Roy?
-I've been here almost a week.

81
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,804
And you've been following me
around for a week?

82
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,781
How did you find me?

83
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,884
You like that rifle, Toby?

84
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:06,151
It's the best present ever. I love it.
I'll go pretend I'm shooting.

85
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:09,659
Don't point it at anybody
or I won't teach you to shoot.

86
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,060
-It's not loaded.
-You heard me. Anything or anybody.

87
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,327
-It's got no bullets.
-Don't make me say it again.

88
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:20,064
Fine. I'll just go point it
at the sky then.

89
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,403
Don't.

90
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,043
Roy, don't!

91
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:33,481
Don't, Roy. Toby's still awake.

92
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,693
You are one sweet thing, baby.

93
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:53,461
It's just the sight of you
makes my dick hard.

94
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,471
Don't, Roy.

95
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,672
Don't, now.

96
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,875
He's not going to hear anything!

97
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,826
Look, I'm--

98
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,125
Sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

99
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,463
Come on, you know I didn't mean that.

100
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,968
I'm just so glad to see you.

101
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,862
Most afternoons,
I'd wander around in a trance.

102
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:31,094
Sometimes I'd go downtown,
stare at the merchandise.

103
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,762
Maybe I'd shoplift. Maybe not.

104
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,707
I used to imagine I saw my father
coming toward me.

105
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,146
I'd wait for him to recognize me.

106
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:47,746
I knew it wasn't him. He lived
back East, married to a rich woman.

107
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,253
His nickname was Duke
and that's how I thought of him...

108
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:54,723
...as a duke living in a castle
far away.

109
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,395
A few minutes later,
I'dpick someone else.

110
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,199
-I'm home.
-Hi, honey.

111
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,432
-We going someplace?
-We sure are.

112
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,669
-Where?
-I don't know. Any ideas?

113
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,076
-Phoenix.
-Good. I was thinking Phoenix.

114
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,514
Or Seattle. Plenty of opportunities
in both places.

115
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:23,554
What about your fabulous boyfriend?
The fabulous, boring Roy.

116
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:26,487
-Is he coming too?
-God, I hope not.

117
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:31,289
I looked out the window at work today,
he was across the street watching.

118
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:35,423
-So uncool.
-You didn't think so last night.

119
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:40,061
"I just love my new rifle, Roy!
It's the bestest present I ever had."

120
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,831
Shut up.

121
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,403
There.

122
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,879
Now? We're leaving now?

123
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,041
-What about the food?
-Leave it.

124
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:57,349
-Even the canned stuff?
-Are you coming or staying?

125
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,759
Ask him when the next one
to Phoenix is.

126
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:15,101
-When's the next bus to Phoenix?
-Tomorrow morning. 1 1 :45.

127
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:18,266
-How about Seattle?
-Yeah, what about Seattle?

128
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:22,972
Leaves in, what, three--
No, two minutes.

129
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,309
-Is this the bus to Seattle?
-Yes, it is.

130
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:31,253
Hurry. Come on.
Seattle, here we go!

131
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,119
I always had a good head for figures.

132
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:40,061
If I got a CPA license, I bet we could
make a real go of it in Seattle.

133
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:46,001
I know what.
I'll advertise for roommates.

134
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,352
-Hey, Ter.
-Hey, Jack.

135
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,883
What did your mom say
about skipping school?

136
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:40,753
Who listens?

137
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,490
Did you go to Wanda's last night?

138
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,494
You make out?

139
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:50,034
Make out good?

140
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,430
How good?

141
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,908
Fucked her till her nose bled.

142
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,139
Sure you did.

143
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,404
Hey, Jack. Terry.

144
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:06,484
Oh, look! It's Elvis, Elvis and Elvis.

145
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,780
Does your face hurt?
Because it's killing me.

146
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:17,752
Silver.

147
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,257
-Anybody here?
-Help! Help!

148
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,198
Help! I'm in here!

149
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:31,709
Oh, well. Lois, baby, come here. I got
six hot inches just waiting for you.

150
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:37,745
-Yeah, you wish.
-Oh, Lois. I want you so bad!

151
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,784
Come on,
you make my dick hard, baby!

152
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:46,924
Come on, baby. I'll do better
than Superman. Just give me a chance.

153
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,589
How did you find me?

154
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:54,529
Oh, Lois. Daddy-o's going to make you
happy-o. Tie them ropes around me.

155
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,533
You couldn't even get it up, Silver.

156
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:04,774
We had to talk dirty for a while.
It was a formality...

157
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:09,278
...like crossing yourself with holy
water when you went into a church.

158
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:18,084
After that, we shut up
and watched the show.

159
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,853
We softened. We surrendered. We watched
Superman have dumb adventures...

160
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,363
...with dorky plots
and we didn't laugh at them.

161
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,100
-It looks better with the bow in back.
-He'll love it.

162
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,838
You say he's getting serious already?

163
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:45,347
I think so. He keeps talking
to me about marriage.

164
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:49,249
-He's dying to meet Toby.
-Three dates. You got him.

165
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:52,687
-I'm not sure I want him.
-Don't want who?

166
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,453
It's the tough guy
who can't be bothered to go to school.

167
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,891
Don't want who?

168
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,658
Dwight. Remember?
I told you about him.

169
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,892
Please, use a glass.

170
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:07,672
He's that guy that comes
from the boondocks? The mechanic?

171
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,468
Dwight. What a stupid name.

172
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,712
Dwight.

173
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,025
-Caroline.
-Hello?

174
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,488
Hi.

175
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,926
-The door was open.
-Behave.

176
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,262
Thank you.

177
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,997
Introduce you to everybody.
I'll take your hat.

178
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,442
-This is Marian.
-Marian.

179
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,638
-And Kathy.
-Kathy.

180
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,875
And this is my son.

181
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,680
-So you're Toby?
-No.

182
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,746
-You're not Toby?
-No.

183
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:03,520
He wants to be called Jack. Silly,
but he read those Jack London books.

184
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:08,197
I'll call him anything he wants. People
can call me anything they want...

185
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:12,463
...as long as they don't call me
late for supper.

186
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,036
-A cup of coffee before we go?
-I could stand a cup of java, yeah.

187
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,176
-Have a seat.
-Over here?

188
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,791
-So, Jack, do you like school?
-No.

189
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,824
-You don't like school?
-No.

190
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:40,898
-That's the way it is with kids today.
-He might like it if he ever went.

191
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,865
Have another cookie.
Keep your strength up.

192
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,972
My son's decided to try to drive me
to an early grave. Truly.

193
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,200
Straighten up
and be polite now, honey.

194
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,370
-Who made this?
-I did.

195
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,178
Well, all I can say is, you people
are pretty lucky...

196
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:04,254
...to live in a house
with a cup of coffee like this.

197
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,318
Wait.

198
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,831
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

199
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,306
Just a little trick I learned
in the Navy.

200
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,916
So, Jack, I hear you're invited up
to Dwight's next week for Thanksgiving.

201
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:43,960
You'll love it. Great air, great water.
And for scenery, just step outside...

202
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,688
...and open your eyes.

203
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:50,802
And there's a turkey shoot
Thanksgiving Day. I signed you up.

204
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,268
-Really? Can I bring my Winchester?
-Sure.

205
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,601
-I'll get that turkey.
-You might.

206
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:01,371
Look, it can sit up and talk
just like a normal human being.

207
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,645
Come on, Dwight.
We're going to be late.

208
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,582
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:17,524
Here's your hat.
Not too much television now.

210
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:20,665
Jack. Ladies.

211
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:26,532
I love a man who knows how to dress.

212
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:30,801
-He's so appealing.
-What a dope.

213
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,360
Okay, come on.

214
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:17,020
-I'll make a muslin for you.
-You will?

215
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,351
Drag a lot of dirt up the aisle
with a train, you know.

216
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,352
Please.

217
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:28,827
Allow me.

218
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:34,102
There you go. Just a little trick
I learned in the Navy.

219
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:39,074
-He wasn't that bad.
-Let me try this.

220
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,072
Who made this? Did you make this?

221
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,152
I'd love to live in a house
with a cup of java like that.

222
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,912
You do.

223
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,714
-You need a light?
-Yes.

224
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:56,019
There you go. Kids today, I tell you.

225
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,662
-Are you through?
-I do believe I am through.

226
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:07,871
-Be polite to Dwight this weekend.
-Okay.

227
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,601
-I mean it.
-I said, okay, didn't l?

228
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:14,007
He's gone to a lot of trouble.

229
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,309
And you never know, I mean,
Concrete might be fun.

230
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,882
Concrete, my favorite town.

231
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:27,514
-Welcome to beautiful Concrete.
-Please stop that.

232
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,887
Stop what?

233
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:43,534
Please try to be nice, okay?

234
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:47,673
-All right.
-Thank you.

235
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,115
The air is like wine up at my place.

236
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:05,161
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
That's the God's honest truth.

237
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:10,562
There's good schools, honest people
and the finest fishing in the world.

238
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,365
There's hunting too. I don't flatter
myself, but I'm a whiz with a rifle...

239
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,239
...and Concrete allows me
to prove that.

240
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,870
Dwight kept babbling on
about the virtues of Concrete...

241
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,576
...but all I could think about
was shooting that turkey.

242
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:34,483
Here we are. Welcome to Concrete,
my home sweet home.

243
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,326
Some of the finest people in the whole
state of Washington. That's no lie.

244
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,697
Lots of churches too.
Lots of churches.

245
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,171
A neighbor says, "Looking for
nice churches, go to Concrete.

246
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,537
Looking for sin, go to hell."

247
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:56,272
I think that's funny, don't you? Jack?

248
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:59,050
Toby? Jack, that is. Jack?

249
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,739
Kids, this is my friend Caroline Wolff
and her boy, Jack.

250
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,468
-Hi, I'm Norma.
-Hi.

251
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:29,011
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

252
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,649
Skipper, Norma, and my baby, Pearl.

253
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,079
-Hello.
-Hi.

254
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,550
-Hello, Pearl.
-Hi.

255
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,823
-Let's go in, look at the house.
-Sure.

256
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,462
This is the house.

257
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:49,033
This is the living room.

258
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:54,605
And over here
is the dining room and piano.

259
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:01,274
And this is the kitchen, over here.

260
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:06,077
I plan on getting all new fixtures,
and that stuff will all be taken out.

261
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,845
It'll be much bigger and nicer.

262
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:18,554
And up here are the three bedrooms
and the bath.

263
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,561
Plenty of room.

264
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,694
And this is--

265
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,667
This is a kind of a lounging area.

266
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,672
You know, just in case you want to...

267
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:33,401
...lounge.

268
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,507
-Over there is where I work. Joe.
-Dwight.

269
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:42,450
-How about you kids? You like it here?
-It's fine.

270
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:43,679
-Hi, John.
-Hi.

271
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:47,451
-It's a little isolated.
-It's not that isolated.

272
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:50,789
It's not that isolated.
Pretty isolated, though.

273
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,864
There's plenty to do
if you'd take the initiative.

274
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:58,162
When I was young, we didn't have TV.
We used our imagination.

275
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:03,365
We read the classics, played musical
instruments. A bored kid is a lazy kid.

276
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:07,308
-What musical instrument do you play?
-Sax. Tenor sax.

277
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,879
-Let me do that.
-Thank you.

278
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,445
-Thank you.
-You're quite welcome.

279
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:22,492
-What about the schools? How are they?
-There isn't one. We go to Chinook.

280
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:25,129
-Chinook High.
-A few miles downriver.

281
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:28,289
-Forty miles.
-Come on, it's not that far.

282
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,367
I clocked it. It's 39 miles.

283
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,164
-Come on, just stow it. Stow it.
-It is.

284
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,899
You'd bellyache if the school
was in your backyard.

285
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:40,408
Now just shut your goddamn pie-hole!

286
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,248
So how big is this turkey going to be?

287
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:53,915
-"Turkey shoot" is a figure of speech.
-So there's no real turkey?

288
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:58,222
It's just regulation paper targets.
It's a test of skill.

289
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:04,233
And I just found out yesterday, Jack,
they won't let kids shoot.

290
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:07,603
-You said I could.
-I know.

291
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,970
-It's not fair. You said that I could.
-I know...

292
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:14,772
...but they got it screwed up
and told me wrong at first.

293
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:18,007
-You did tell him.
-I don't make the rules.

294
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:22,950
If I made the rules, I might make
different ones. But I don't make them.

295
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:26,682
Okay. That's okay, honey.

296
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,186
Don't worry. You can watch.

297
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:51,111
-Why ain't you gonna get to shoot?
-Shut up.

298
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,978
Next shooters, on your marks.

299
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:59,615
-Is that it?
-There you go.

300
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,521
-Okay, good luck.
-Thanks, John.

301
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:05,590
Wolff, please. Caroline Wolff.

302
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:08,528
You mean you want to enter too?

303
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,691
I think it's against the rules.

304
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:14,703
That sign says this is an NRA club,
and I'm an NRA member.

305
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:19,567
That allows me to participate
in the activities of other chapters.

306
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,542
-You'll be the only woman.
-Fine.

307
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:26,979
There you go.

308
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:30,349
-I got it. I got it.
-Thank you.

309
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,920
Always a first time for everything.

310
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,896
-Eighty-four!
-Eighty-four.

311
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:50,632
Dwight Hansen.

312
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,141
-Good luck, dear.
-You can do it, Dad.

313
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:57,907
Dwight! Get on up there, buddy.

314
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,385
Come on, Dwight. Show us your stuff.

315
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:39,681
Twenty-four!

316
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:45,827
Twenty-four, Dwight Hansen.

317
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,966
-Nice.
-I could have done better.

318
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,969
-Caroline Wolff.
-Oh, yeah!

319
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,182
Mama, shake that thing!

320
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,079
Ninety-three!

321
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,011
Ninety-three.

322
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:43,951
Ninety-three for Caroline Wolff.
Congratulations, Miss Wolff.

323
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:48,324
-That was real good.
-Thank you.

324
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,553
-Where did you learn to shoot?
-Beginner's luck.

325
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,861
Wasn't she good? Wasn't she good, kids?
I'm really impressed.

326
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:02,237
My gun, bolt's not working.
It's the third gun I've bought.

327
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:06,343
It just won't work right.
Fucking thing.

328
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:08,240
That was really good.

329
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,446
-What gives?
-Mom won the turkey shoot.

330
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:22,559
Oh, God. Now we're in for it. Dad
thinks he's some kind of big hunter.

331
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:27,323
-Well, he killed a deer once.
-That was with the car, Pearl.

332
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,473
Could you pass the salt
and pepper, Pearl?

333
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,152
I got just one thing to say.

334
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:02,562
I'm sitting at the table
with the best damn shot in the county.

335
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,662
You should have seen her.

336
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:09,238
-Almost got every one of them.
-I missed two.

337
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,887
He's good.

338
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,192
Yeah, Toby! Jack.

339
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:39,232
You should do that.

340
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:53,283
Good, Toby! Jack. Sorry. Jack.

341
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,579
I know, not Toby. Jack.

342
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:39,358
I blew it off, man.
I blew this fucking turkey's head off.

343
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:43,526
-With a .22?
-Fucking-A. Winchester .22, pump.

344
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:46,364
Wolff, you are so full of shit.

345
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:49,268
Don't believe me. See if I care.

346
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:52,968
A .22 bullet would only make
a hole in his head.

347
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,944
Yeah, one bullet, maybe.

348
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,650
Oh, I see.

349
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:04,050
So you hit the turkey
more than once...

350
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:08,022
...while he was flying, in the head.

351
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,095
Fuck you.

352
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,464
Fuck you too.

353
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,929
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you, man!

354
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,502
What did he do?

355
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,115
He violated school property
and he flouted the law.

356
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:34,442
Can you say that in English, please?

357
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,746
He wrote obscene words on the wall.

358
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,617
Did you do it?

359
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:43,420
-He didn't do it.
-He wrote obscene words on the wall.

360
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,356
What obscene words?

361
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,866
"Fuck you."

362
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:54,196
That's one obscene word.

363
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:59,733
Look, Mrs. Wolff,
Jack's teachers like him...

364
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:04,041
...but they feel he's fallen in
with the wrong kind of friends.

365
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,673
Is that nicotine stains
on your fingers?

366
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,187
I hope not.

367
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,549
Well, back to the point.

368
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,490
I think two weeks suspension.

369
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:53,496
-So, what do we do?
-What do you mean?

370
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:57,599
I mean, what shall we do?
Because this isn't working.

371
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,000
We barely have any money.
Kathy's moving out now.

372
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:04,107
-And you've gone wild. You lie.
-No, I don't.

373
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:05,572
Yes, you do.

374
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:09,179
You're smoking
and stealing from Marian's purse.

375
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:13,374
I can't handle it anymore.
It scares me. I don't know what to do.

376
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:15,519
So you tell me.

377
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:21,991
I can be better. And I will be.

378
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:29,792
I hate the way I am.
I don't know why I do it.

379
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,765
I talked to Dwight the other day.

380
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:44,310
After Christmas he wants you
to go to Concrete and live with him.

381
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,746
Go to school up there.

382
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:49,950
What are you gonna do,
give me away to him?

383
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:55,622
Well, if you two get along
and things work out, l....

384
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:59,396
He and I might get married.

385
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:07,899
I don't know what else to do.

386
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:10,732
You have to tell me it's okay.

387
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,544
All right.

388
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,747
Just think of it
like an adventure. Okay?

389
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,933
I put in both sweaters. Be sure you
wear them. It's chilly there at night.

390
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,728
Okay, I will.

391
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:53,643
You don't have to go
if you don't want.

392
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,719
It's not too late to change your mind.

393
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:59,482
It's okay. I'll go.

394
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:05,563
Here I am, you lucky people.

395
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:17,667
Sorry.

396
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,564
I'm sick to my stomach.

397
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:00,108
Sick to your stomach?
A hotshot like you?

398
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:03,145
-I'm not a hotshot.
-That's what I hear.

399
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:05,973
I hear you're a real hotshot.

400
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:10,953
Go where you want,
do what you want.

401
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,751
Isn't that right?

402
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:18,551
A regular man about town,
a performer too. Right?

403
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,527
You a performer?

404
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:23,458
I hear you do me.

405
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,434
I hear you're real good at doing me.

406
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,268
-Is that right?
-No, sir.

407
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:33,933
That's a goddamn lie.

408
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:39,645
If there's one thing I can't stomach,
it's a liar, Jack.

409
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,747
-I'm not a liar.
-Sure, you are. You or Marian.

410
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:50,656
Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite
the little performer. Is that a lie?

411
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:56,061
Tell me that's a lie and we'll go back
so you can call her a liar to her face.

412
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,498
You want me to do that?

413
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,499
Did you hear what I said?
You want me to do that?

414
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:09,540
-No.
-Then you must be the liar, right?

415
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,439
And you're a performer?

416
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,512
Let's see your act.

417
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,451
Go on, do your act.
Come on, let's see your act.

418
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,552
-I can't.
-Sure you can.

419
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:24,588
Here.

420
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,790
Do me with the lighter.

421
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:30,525
Go on, take it.
Take it, hotshot.

422
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:31,791
Take it.

423
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,608
Go on, take it. Take it!

424
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,270
You pull that hotshot stuff
around me...

425
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:44,881
...and I'll break every bone
in your body.

426
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:48,246
Do you understand?
I'll pop your head like a zit.

427
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,410
You're in for a change.

428
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:55,958
You're in for a whole other
ball game, buddy. Oh, yeah.

429
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:15,073
So you'll be
in Miss Graham's class, right?

430
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:20,013
-Yeah. Is she nice?
-She's okay. She's pretty.

431
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:24,780
-I hate changing schools.
-I've never. I've been here all my life.

432
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:29,290
Speaking of changing, I had a talk
with Jack on the way up here...

433
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,655
...and he wants to be a better boy.

434
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,594
Things weren't going well in Seattle.

435
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:39,327
The police came to his house
and talked with Caroline about him.

436
00:42:39,504 --> 00:42:42,200
That's right. The police.

437
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:48,275
-Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
-Criminal.

438
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:52,078
So I found our Jack
a little something to do.

439
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,617
I picked up two barrels
of horse chestnuts in the park...

440
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:58,516
...and you can hull them
in the evenings.

441
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,853
I also enrolled you in the Boy Scouts.

442
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:08,927
And I got you a paper route.
Starts every Monday, from 3 to 6:30.

443
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,503
Every afternoon, 3 to 6:30.
Pays 55 bucks a month.

444
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:15,764
What do you say?

445
00:43:18,142 --> 00:43:19,632
I'll do it.

446
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:28,048
-I wanna be better.
-That's what I like to hear.

447
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:37,691
Okay, let's get this place cleaned up.
Let's get the dishes going.

448
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:40,558
Let's show Jack
how we do it in Concrete.

449
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:45,365
Jack? Let's go. Come on.

450
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:48,963
I don't believe that crap.

451
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:53,570
I believe there is such a thing
as a bad boy. Bad clear through.

452
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:58,198
It's gonna be myjob to turn you
around, to set you straight.

453
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:03,336
That's right, to kill or cure.
Kill or cure.

454
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:07,177
Caroline told me about your rich daddy
andprep-school brother.

455
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:11,219
Your fancy days are over.
You're a Concrete boy now.

456
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:48,220
I'm going to get you a Scout uniform.

457
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:49,515
Really?

458
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:52,925
One for me too.
Don't believe in doing things halfway.

459
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:55,531
-If you're serious about the Scouts....
-I am.

460
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,498
Then do it right.
We'll do it right together.

461
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:02,230
I got you a subscription.
I'll take it out of your route money.

462
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:04,340
Boys' Magazine?

463
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:08,938
It's the Scout magazine.
It tells what it means to be a Scout.

464
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:13,709
What kind of boy you need to be
and about merit badges and stuff.

465
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:16,318
"Suggested Good Turns a Scout Can Do:

466
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:20,821
Assist a foreign boy with English.
Help put out a burning field.

467
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:24,358
Give water to a crippled dog."
I could do those.

468
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:29,989
Hell, yes. You're a bright kid and
I want this Scout thing done right.

469
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,496
-I'm not going!
-The hell you say.

470
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:39,006
I'm not! This is Skipper's
and it doesn't fit. I'm staying home.

471
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:43,772
You're gonna shit and fall back in it,
that's all. Now get out here.

472
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:44,937
Look.

473
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:51,443
Shut your pie-hole.
You look fine.

474
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,791
-I look like an idiot.
-You act like an idiot.

475
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,018
You said you'd get me a new one.

476
00:46:57,194 --> 00:47:01,722
I said I'd try to get you a new one.
Besides, this one is new to you.

477
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:05,391
-The sleeves hang down.
-All you do is piss and moan.

478
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:08,800
Piss and moan!
You're all jazzed up in new stuff.

479
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:11,533
They didn't have secondhand in my size.

480
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,041
Pull the other leg, it's got bells.

481
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:17,840
Will you tell Caroline
that you wouldn't join the Scouts...

482
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:23,282
...because him didn't like
his little uniform? Okay.

483
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:27,316
I wanna show you something.

484
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:29,926
"Words for Thought:

485
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:34,622
No boy, given over to dissipation
or negativity, can stand the gaff.

486
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:37,199
He quickly tires and gives up.

487
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:41,498
He is the type who usually
lacks courage at the crucial moment.

488
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:44,869
He cannot take punishment
and come back smiling."

489
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:46,304
Anybody we know?

490
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,309
Hotshot?

491
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:53,943
Anybody we know?

492
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,481
-Fine, but this stinks.
-Hotshot.

493
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:00,317
Me and Concrete are in your blood.

494
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,824
We'll make a man of you.
In years, you'll thank me.

495
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:07,930
You'll remember me.
Me and Concrete. Right?

496
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,123
-How do I look?
-You look fine.

497
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:14,000
Fire.

498
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,240
Food.

499
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,135
Rapids.

500
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,341
Want.

501
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:29,345
People.

502
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,281
Twinkle.

503
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:37,587
Father.

504
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:43,333
We are gathered together...

505
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,693
...in the sight of God...

506
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:47,770
...to join together this man
and this woman...

507
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:50,429
...in the state of holy matrimony.

508
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:56,205
It is an honorable estate, instituted
of God and signifying unto us...

509
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,317
...the mystical union which exists
between Christ and his church.

510
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,818
It is, therefore, not to be
entered into lightly...

511
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:10,723
...but reverently, discreetly,
and in fear of God.

512
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:08,143
Honey, let's not do it
this way tonight.

513
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,278
-It's good this way.
-I know, but I want to see your face.

514
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:16,559
No. I don't like that way.

515
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,395
You don't like to do it face to face?

516
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:22,794
I don't like that way.
I don't like to see the face.

517
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,635
-You mean, never?
-No.

518
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:28,328
-But that's crazy.
-Look!

519
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:32,134
You can get it doggie-style
or laying on your side.

520
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:35,369
This is my house and I get to say.
Got it?

521
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:37,474
Sorry.

522
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:34,992
Want some?

523
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,928
-Some what?
-Coffee.

524
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:40,968
No.

525
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:49,634
-Happy wedding breakfast.
-Good morning.

526
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,747
-Jack.
-Good morning, Daddy.

527
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,645
-Where's the paper?
-It's by the toaster.

528
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:56,843
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

529
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:02,358
-So how is the bride this morning?
-Don't.

530
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:05,757
-The bride doesn't wanna chat.
-That's enough.

531
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:08,762
The bride sure is snotty this morning.

532
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:12,368
So, Jack, how are you feeling
this morning?

533
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,231
I'm okay.

534
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,834
-So did you have fun last night?
-You bet we did.

535
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,269
Good.

536
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:25,774
She's good enough, man.

537
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,749
-She wanted to, but I didn't want to.
-You said no?

538
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,182
You guys are sick.

539
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:33,747
I'm sorry.

540
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:37,026
Look who's coming.

541
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:40,122
-Who's that?
-Arthur Gayle.

542
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,231
What a homo.

543
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:44,525
-He walks like a girl.
-Yeah.

544
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,693
Runs like one, talks like one,
throws like one.

545
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:52,268
And probably takes a pee like one too.
Just squats right down.

546
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,944
He mouthed off to me the other day.
I was gonna sock him.

547
00:53:57,114 --> 00:54:00,277
He called me a bourgeois.

548
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,884
-What's a bourgeois?
-I don't know.

549
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:05,949
Call him a homo.

550
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:08,990
-Why?
-Just see what he says.

551
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:16,925
My, my. What do we have here?
Elmer Fudd and his hunting boys.

552
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:21,063
Look at all that yellow.

553
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:24,865
Didn't your mama teach you
to wash your hands after you pee?

554
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,303
Shut up.

555
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:32,107
Strike one. That was very good.
Very original.

556
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:36,275
Did you just make that up?
That was very, very clever.

557
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:41,081
Why don't you just fuck off,
dick-lick?

558
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:43,488
Excuse me!

559
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:51,366
Has anyone told you you look exactly
like a pile of steaming dog turd?

560
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:57,435
Yeah? Well, at least
I'm not a great, big homo.

561
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:02,738
Come on.

562
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:05,312
Get him. Come on, get him!

563
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:09,784
Take him, Jack.

564
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,117
Come on, take him out!

565
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:15,657
Asshole!

566
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,989
Fucking asshole!

567
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:24,825
Come on!

568
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:30,268
Get him. Get him!

569
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:33,872
Kick his ass, Jack.

570
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:53,290
Get up, son of a bitch!
You stink of dog shit! Get up.

571
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:55,158
I'll kill you!

572
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:00,466
Take it back.

573
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:04,599
Take it back!

574
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:08,841
-Okay.
-Say it.

575
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,606
-I take it back.
-No.

576
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:14,978
Say, "You're not a homo."

577
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:22,557
You're not a homo.

578
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:28,826
Come on, Pepper.

579
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,927
Well. So!

580
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,304
Who won?

581
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:51,030
He can't see out of one eye.

582
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:57,146
Hot damn! You actually gave
Little Lord Gayle a black eye?

583
00:56:57,315 --> 00:57:00,646
-Yeah. It's not black yet.
-But it's all puffed up?

584
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:03,981
Then it's a shiner, right? Right?

585
00:57:04,623 --> 00:57:06,614
How'd it start?

586
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,916
I called him a sissy.

587
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:13,121
He can't sue you for slander.
He fights for the pink team.

588
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:16,199
Goddamn kid's queer.
Did you make him cry?

589
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,797
Yeah. He was ready to.

590
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:23,202
I called him a big-ass
squat-to-pee sissy.

591
00:57:23,376 --> 00:57:25,706
I'd have won bigger,
but he hit when I wasn't looking.

592
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:29,438
He dry-gulched you?
Wait a minute. That's your fault.

593
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:33,481
There's no excuse for getting
dry-gulched. You got me?

594
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:35,847
I'm gonna show you a few moves...

595
00:57:36,021 --> 00:57:40,117
...that'll leave Miss Gayle
wondering what month it is. Okay?

596
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,724
I said to this kid,
"Stop doing that."

597
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:48,025
He said, "What business is it to you?"
I said, "I don't think it's right."

598
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:51,429
He said, "What will you do?"
I said, "Something."

599
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:56,938
He said, "You and who else?" I said,
"The three of us: me, myself and l."

600
00:57:57,106 --> 00:58:00,702
After school, he's waiting for me.
He yells something.

601
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:06,907
People like that, you gotta hurt them
or they'll never leave you alone.

602
00:58:07,085 --> 00:58:09,552
So it was real hot out. Okay?

603
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:13,454
There were horse turds
laying all over the place.

604
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:17,820
I picked up a big, mushy one
and go up to him, not acting tough.

605
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:21,626
Acting more like,
"I'm so scared. Please don't hurt me."

606
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,737
Minding my business. And I say to him,
"Excuse me. What's the problem?"

607
00:58:26,905 --> 00:58:29,532
And he goes....

608
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,438
I go....
I jam that turd in his fat mouth.

609
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:36,704
Then I sucker punch him.
He goes down, and I kick his face...

610
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:40,338
...jump on his head, then
I jam another turd down his throat...

611
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:42,952
...kick his fucking teeth
a couple times.

612
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:48,617
And that was the end. Never bothered
me again, that piece of shit.

613
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:55,496
Just a little tale.

614
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,097
You're getting it.
That's it. Good hit.

615
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,001
Try for my face.

616
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,762
That's it.
Keep yourself in the fight.

617
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:07,210
Keep it open. Open.
That's it. Wide open.

618
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,510
One, two, three, four!

619
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,983
This is nothing
compared to what you'll get.

620
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,554
Keep that guard up.
When you go like that, bring it back.

621
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,815
Keep your guard up!
Try the jab.

622
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:22,652
-I am.
-Try it. Come on.

623
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,789
Want me to call you
Miss Jackie Wolff?

624
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:31,867
Oh, my. Go, Jackie.
Jackie! Jackie.

625
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:35,635
What about the honeymoon night?
Dwight seems so shy.

626
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:41,335
-No, I wouldn't say he was shy, no.
-Come on, Caroline. Fill me in.

627
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:44,106
We're still getting to know
each other.

628
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,217
Okay. So how's Jack doing?

629
00:59:47,385 --> 00:59:48,974
You're not trying.

630
00:59:49,155 --> 00:59:53,681
-Are him and Dwight getting along okay?
-They're like father and son.

631
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:57,987
Really? That's just great.
Caroline, are you okay?

632
00:59:58,164 --> 01:00:02,065
I'm fine. Things are just fine.

633
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:08,266
You said you were going to teach me
how to dry-gulch somebody.

634
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,498
Okay.

635
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:13,940
You can always kick somebody
in the balls. But this one's better.

636
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:19,378
What you do is hit them in the throat
with the side of your forearm, like that.

637
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,710
You wait until--

638
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,552
Now that's dry-gulching.

639
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:27,713
Hit them in the throat,
but do it before they expect it.

640
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,760
You got that?
Before they're expecting--

641
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:33,454
You got that? Now you try it.

642
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,925
-Come on, you try it.
-No.

643
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,592
-Don't be afraid.
-No, you'll hurt me.

644
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:41,170
-Just try it.
-No.

645
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:45,606
Try it. I'll hurt you
if you don't do it. Come on!

646
01:00:45,777 --> 01:00:48,175
Come on.
Let's go, goddamn it!

647
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:52,373
Let's start, you little
fucking sissy all your goddamn life.

648
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:56,315
Quitter! Gonna be a goddamn quitter?
Let's go! Damn you.

649
01:00:56,487 --> 01:01:02,050
Don't go shy. You're acting as sissy as
Little Miss Arthur Gayle, you know that?

650
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:05,594
I'm gonna call you
Little Miss Jackie Wolff.

651
01:01:06,297 --> 01:01:11,063
My, yes. Oh, Jackie.
My, yes. Little Miss Jackie Wolff.

652
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,724
Is that what you want me to call you?

653
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:18,001
Is that what you want the kids
to call you? Jackie Wolff?

654
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,202
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Let's do it.

655
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:24,108
Jesus Christ,
if you're gonna act like--

656
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,449
You just about
got dry-gulched, mister.

657
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,126
Ask him again, please.
I need it so much.

658
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:43,824
I asked him already. I asked him
last week. I asked him this morning.

659
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,695
He wants you to keep the route.

660
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:51,001
Then make him give me the money.
It's mine, and I earned it. It's $220.

661
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:54,771
He won't. He wants to keep it
until you really need it.

662
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:59,577
It's not fair! I ought to be able
to keep my own money.

663
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,882
But it's mine, Mom!

664
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,085
Ask him about my gym shoes.

665
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,385
I can practice barefoot.
For games, I need them.

666
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:14,021
I won't do it, Jack.
I won't be a referee.

667
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:19,800
The bride won't argue.
The bride won't even raise her voice.

668
01:02:19,972 --> 01:02:21,871
I'll tell you what she'll do.

669
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:26,599
The bride will go over there and
slap the hell out of the bride's son.

670
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:29,610
Does the bride's son
want his face slapped?

671
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:34,213
I hate it here, you know that?
I wanna just get up and go.

672
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:39,414
I don't have another get-up-and-go
left in me. Do you understand that?

673
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,686
I can't run anymore.
I've hit a brick wall here.

674
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:50,199
This whole thing isn't perfect for me
either. Let me impress that on you.

675
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:54,271
I don't exactly wake up singing
every morning.

676
01:02:56,074 --> 01:03:01,876
I know you don't believe me now,
but it's the best thing.

677
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,010
Okay?

678
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:14,353
I'm gonna make this marriage work.
I won't join in any fights.

679
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,820
I won't even raise my voice.

680
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,800
You see these?

681
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:28,460
He picked them for me last night
on his way home.

682
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:29,972
Big deal.

683
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,001
I'm trying to concentrate
on the good stuff.

684
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:40,684
What do you think?

685
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:44,376
I think I look like a fool.
But who cares?

686
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,456
Six weeks to graduation
and California here I come.

687
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:59,963
You have to try and concentrate
on the good stuff.

688
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02,532
Come on.

689
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,166
You like my dog?

690
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:18,811
-Yeah, he's nice.
-He's smart too. He can talk.

691
01:05:21,786 --> 01:05:24,152
Sure, I just about believe you.

692
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,847
Pepper, what's on a tree?

693
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,088
Bark.

694
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:33,219
I wanna ask you,
how's the world treating you?

695
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,030
Rough?

696
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,762
I know how you mean.

697
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,802
That's dumb.
A little funny, though.

698
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:51,713
How come your dad
never comes to meetings?

699
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:55,579
I don't have a dad.
I never did.

700
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:59,612
I sprang full-blown
from my mother's imagination.

701
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,422
Wanna walk home with me and Pepper?

702
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:12,594
I knew I'd like you,
because you're an alien.

703
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:14,862
An alien?

704
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:20,137
You and I don't belong in Concrete.
This place would like to kill us.

705
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,675
Come on, that's a little dramatic.

706
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,179
-You think so?
-Yeah.

707
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:28,876
Do you know what chickens do
when one chicken's different?

708
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,612
With black feathers on its head, say?

709
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:34,655
They peck at that black spot
until the chicken's dead.

710
01:06:34,827 --> 01:06:37,420
They can't stand that it's different.

711
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:42,554
We're both different. Your difference
is something other than my difference.

712
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:45,166
But we're both aliens here.

713
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:50,068
See, I don't exactly feel like an alien.
I've got friends, you know.

714
01:06:50,242 --> 01:06:54,768
They're idiots. You act like an idiot
when you're around them.

715
01:06:55,146 --> 01:06:56,737
A prediction:

716
01:06:56,914 --> 01:07:00,780
If you stay in Concrete,
you'll wind up working at the A & P.

717
01:07:00,952 --> 01:07:04,853
Either that, or you'll go on a rampage
with a hunting rifle.

718
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:10,550
And you'll wind up a recluse who
likes to dress in his mama's old clothes.

719
01:07:10,728 --> 01:07:11,853
Maybe.

720
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,757
Maybe.

721
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:16,561
One thing I know...

722
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:19,362
...no matter how many times I repeat...

723
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,300
...my primary goal
is to get out of Concrete.

724
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,405
Burma-Shave!

725
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:27,302
Thank you, Joe Feeney.

726
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,497
And here's a happy tune that features
our happy Norwegian.

727
01:08:31,676 --> 01:08:33,269
"The Laughing Polka. "

728
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:37,640
See, honey? You gotta try
and find the good stuff.

729
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,439
You're a hog.
Don't tell me you're not.

730
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:43,279
How do you know Skipper
didn't do it, or Norma?

731
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:47,185
-I told them to stay away from this candy.
-How do you know I ate any?

732
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,760
I counted them. You hogged down
1 1 chocolates since yesterday.

733
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:51,917
So what?

734
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,963
That makes you a hog!
I just wanna establish that fact.

735
01:08:56,131 --> 01:09:00,832
Mr. Hotshot Hog and I have
just been establishing some facts:

736
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:05,372
One, he's a pig who gobbles down candy.
Two, he lies about it.

737
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:09,671
Three, he lays around on his candy-ass,
day and night, reading.

738
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:14,979
And four, he's not getting $1 0 gym
shoes. That's what we've come up with.

739
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:16,448
Dad, just lay off.

740
01:09:16,622 --> 01:09:19,988
Don't give me that shit!
Shut your goddamn pie-hole.

741
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,680
Why don't you take up for me?

742
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,693
Why don't you help me
straighten him out?

743
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,323
All he ever does is read or listen
to music or sing. I'm sick of it.

744
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:32,765
"Blue Monday."
I'm so sick of that shit!

745
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:36,463
When he's not singing, he's watching
TV. Don't say you don't.

746
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,408
When I come home,
I feel the TV to see if it's warm...

747
01:09:40,578 --> 01:09:45,948
...and it always is. This is the news.
I want you to know I'm wise to you.

748
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:48,984
Big deal!
I don't wanna do my paper route.

749
01:09:49,154 --> 01:09:53,818
I bet you don't. You'd rather
lay on your ass and read all day.

750
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:59,225
You're going to deliver those papers if
I have to walk behind you with a whip.

751
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:02,229
Yeah? Then give me the money
that I earned.

752
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,336
I'm putting it in the bank
for when you need it.

753
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:08,564
-You'll thank me later.
-Make him buy gym shoes.

754
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:12,176
How can I play basketball
without any gym--?

755
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:20,350
It's not the shoes, is it?
Or the candy, or anything else.

756
01:10:20,519 --> 01:10:23,747
It's me. You can't stand
the fact that I exist.

757
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:27,582
No, it's not that at all.
It's just that l--

758
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:31,627
You have to be well-behaved.
Your rich daddy doesn't care.

759
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:35,095
Somebody's gotta train you.
You need to be trained...

760
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:39,761
...not to be a fucking hog
and hog everybody's candy!

761
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:47,367
-What's the matter?
-I will not referee!

762
01:10:48,546 --> 01:10:54,314
I think you've upset your mother, so
let's go to the Scouts and let her rest.

763
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:57,546
Honey, you just lay down
and rest a while.

764
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,082
Now look what you did.

765
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,158
Got her upset too.

766
01:11:15,774 --> 01:11:20,939
Check for the tongue tonight, otherwise
you won't get your lifesaving badge.

767
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:47,395
Whose dog is that on the porch?

768
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:48,927
Yours.

769
01:12:49,568 --> 01:12:52,194
-Mine?
-Yeah, you said you wanted a dog.

770
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:56,966
-A collie. Not that thing.
-Well, he's yours. You paid for him.

771
01:12:57,372 --> 01:13:01,537
-Get ready for Norma's play.
-What do you mean, I paid for him?

772
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,693
My Winchester's gone!

773
01:13:18,863 --> 01:13:23,356
That dog's purebred English bulldog.
A champion. Don't forget that.

774
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:24,863
I don't want it!

775
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:28,060
You're out of luck.
That rifle's in Seattle.

776
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,832
I want my rifle!

777
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,568
Want in one hand and
shit in the other.

778
01:13:32,743 --> 01:13:34,369
That Winchester was mine!

779
01:13:34,546 --> 01:13:39,640
Champ is your dog. I trade some piece
of crap for a valuable hunting dog...

780
01:13:39,818 --> 01:13:44,015
-...and all you do is piss and moan.
-I'm not pissing and moaning.

781
01:13:44,189 --> 01:13:48,819
The hell you aren't! You can just make
your own deals from now on.

782
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:56,796
I said, don't ever touch me again,
because...

783
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,800
...l'm absolutely finished.
This is the end.

784
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,399
I want you to get out!

785
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:08,305
This impassioned testimony helped sway
thejury to acquit...

786
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,176
...Cheryl Crane of the murder
of Johnny Stompanato...

787
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:15,908
...boyfriend of Cheryl's mother,
film star Lana Turner.

788
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:20,579
Thejury returned a verdict
ofjustifiable homicide...

789
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:24,559
...allowing Cheryl to go free
for the killing of Stompanato.

790
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:29,426
The stabbing occurred during an
argument, when Cheryl grabbed a knife...

791
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,801
...said to her mother, "You don't have to
take that!" and stabbed Stompanato.

792
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,533
His threatening behavior
was a factor...

793
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,939
...in thejury's verdict
ofjustifiable homicide.

794
01:14:42,113 --> 01:14:46,743
A violent final chapter in this affair
ends in the famous pink bedroom...

795
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:49,475
...of Lana Turner's
Beverly Hills mansion.

796
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:06,345
-Hello.
-That your car in the ditch back there?

797
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:08,387
-Yeah.
-How did it get there?

798
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:13,819
-It's hard to explain.
-Get in then, we'll have to tow it.

799
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:29,176
Hey. Anybody home?

800
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,783
Your mom said you were sick.
Feeling better?

801
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,578
Yeah.

802
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:37,247
Get some sleep, did you?

803
01:17:38,055 --> 01:17:41,287
-About four hours.
-Well, you must have needed it.

804
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,886
Good.

805
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:48,595
Oh, by the way...

806
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:53,203
...you didn't hear a funny
pinging noise in the engine, did you?

807
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:56,770
God, look at me. I gotta shave.
I look terrible.

808
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:59,501
-What engine?
-I was downtown with Champ...

809
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:04,475
...and I met a guy who recognized him.
Said he'd seen my dog this morning.

810
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:07,550
He told me a story
how he and the dog met.

811
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:10,618
I thought you'd like to hear about it.

812
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:13,479
What do you think about that?

813
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:17,323
I don't know what
you're talking about.

814
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,329
Dwight! Stop!

815
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,568
You steal my car?
You steal my car?

816
01:18:30,742 --> 01:18:33,436
-Stop!
-Don't you steal my car!

817
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,640
Stop! Don't!

818
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:53,091
Only me on this whole earth
to straighten you out.

819
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:57,926
And I'll do it. Kill or cure.
Kill or cure.

820
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:04,430
Now get your ass up.
You're going to school.

821
01:20:02,466 --> 01:20:03,591
Come on, Jack.

822
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,734
Hurry up.

823
01:20:07,805 --> 01:20:10,774
Come on, Wolff. Move it.

824
01:20:37,568 --> 01:20:39,934
A lot can happen in two years.

825
01:20:40,104 --> 01:20:43,265
Skipper and Norma had left
and moved to Seattle.

826
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,408
I was gonna get out too.

827
01:20:45,573 --> 01:20:49,271
But in the meantime
I made some new friends.

828
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,479
-Gorilla blood.
-Psycho, shut up.

829
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:56,984
-Fuck you.
-Hey, look, there goes Carol Baumgarten.

830
01:20:57,154 --> 01:21:00,850
-Ain't she sweet? She's hot for Wolff.
-Yeah, I wish.

831
01:21:01,059 --> 01:21:04,426
Won't do her any good.
He's saving himself for Rhea.

832
01:21:04,595 --> 01:21:05,890
-Know what?
-Fuck off.

833
01:21:06,064 --> 01:21:09,930
He said even the inside of her arm
turns him on. Her arm.

834
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,966
You slay me, Wolff.
She is pretty, though.

835
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,698
I'd sure like to eat
Rhea Clark's pussy.

836
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,636
-Give it a rest.
-No, I mean it. I mean it.

837
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:23,404
I'd like to get down
and really grovel on it.

838
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:26,604
Spend about a week
with my face right in it.

839
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,943
Meeting newsmen,
Mr. Truman pledges to support...

840
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:03,177
-...John F. Kennedy for president.
-I ask your help in this campaign.

841
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:11,654
It's good news, they say that Truman's
gonna campaign for Kennedy.

842
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:15,761
I gave $25 to his office today.

843
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:21,564
-I was thinking, I could go work--
-Here I am, you lucky people.

844
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:33,082
The SOB had been on my back
for a week at work...

845
01:22:33,251 --> 01:22:37,381
...saying I stole his wrench
and poured oil all over his tools.

846
01:22:37,555 --> 01:22:40,716
Well, he went one step too far
with old Dwight.

847
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,350
He spat on the floor as I went by.
I walked back to him...

848
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:48,395
...acting dainty, humble and scared.
Then he took his eyes off me.

849
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:51,261
I dry-gulched that son of a bitch.

850
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:56,372
He never gave me another second's
grief, and that was five years ago.

851
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:00,966
Yeah, come here. Come on.
Come here, Champ.

852
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:03,238
Come here. Come on. Thattaboy.

853
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:07,475
I heard Mr. Kennedy
on the news again tonight.

854
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,212
I don't know. It seems that
every once in a while...

855
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:16,881
...somebody comes along who
doesn't seem like he's such a liar.

856
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:23,225
-Kennedy, the senator from Rome.
-He gives me hope.

857
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:27,029
I know what he gives you
and it sure as hell isn't hope.

858
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:30,604
You're right there.
He is very attractive.

859
01:23:30,774 --> 01:23:34,573
He does have pearly-white teeth.
I don't think that's it.

860
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,770
Come on, boy. Attaboy.

861
01:23:41,051 --> 01:23:47,184
-I'm gonna go work for the campaign.
-No, that's a bad idea. Bad idea.

862
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:51,385
Too many Republicans in town.
They hear you work for Democrats...

863
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,292
...they'll take their cars
someplace else to be fixed.

864
01:23:55,466 --> 01:23:59,229
Right, boy? Right, my little baby boy?
Come to Daddy.

865
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:06,336
Oh, Ricky. Please let me come down
and work for you at the club.

866
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:08,408
What are you doing?

867
01:24:08,578 --> 01:24:09,636
-Champ.
-Get away.

868
01:24:09,814 --> 01:24:11,177
Champ!

869
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:16,110
-Champ. Sit. Sit.
-Treat me like Lucy, I'll act like her.

870
01:24:16,287 --> 01:24:19,814
I'm working for the Kennedy's campaign.
Are you through?

871
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:23,024
-You're not working for them.
-We'll see.

872
01:24:23,194 --> 01:24:27,457
You're not working for the campaign!
Get that through your head.

873
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:31,533
-You're not.
-There's no reason on earth why I can't.

874
01:24:31,702 --> 01:24:35,069
There is every reason in the world.
I just told you.

875
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:38,899
-You can count on it. I'll do it.
-What?

876
01:24:39,073 --> 01:24:40,975
-Count on it.
-I told you why.

877
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:48,176
I'll be through in a minute.

878
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:57,019
You left the lid
off the damn toothpaste again.

879
01:24:57,194 --> 01:25:00,252
Dwight, is that the best
you can come up with?

880
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:05,359
This is my house, and I get to say
about the toothpaste. You got that?

881
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:09,868
Huh? Have you? Huh?

882
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:15,104
If you lived with your dad, Duke, and his
rich wife, things might be different.

883
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:20,841
But he's not here now, is he? ls he?
Oh, Duke. Duke, are you here?

884
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,818
Duke? Dukie? Are you here?

885
01:25:24,988 --> 01:25:27,921
Oh, how sad. Duke's not here.
Oh, boo-hoo.

886
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:32,823
My house. My bathroom. I get to say
about the toothpaste. You got that?

887
01:25:37,033 --> 01:25:40,800
Come on. Come on. Give me an excuse.
Come on.

888
01:26:11,202 --> 01:26:13,896
-Hey.
-You didn't pick this up yesterday.

889
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:17,561
-You got nothing higher than a C.
-Shut up.

890
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:24,046
-Voila.
-You're gonna get caught someday.

891
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:27,238
Oh, I'm so scared. Really.

892
01:26:27,417 --> 01:26:31,444
You act more like those morons
you hang around with every day.

893
01:26:31,622 --> 01:26:36,613
-I'm Psycho. I'm retarded.
-He hears you do that, you're dead.

894
01:26:39,296 --> 01:26:44,198
-Let me copy your math homework.
-No. But I'll show you how to do it.

895
01:26:45,269 --> 01:26:50,707
I tell you I'm thirsty and you offer me
a sandwich. Thank you and fuck you.

896
01:26:52,309 --> 01:26:57,006
I take it back. You don't act like Psycho,
you act like Dwight.

897
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,412
I know it.
He's winning, isn't he?

898
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:12,087
I do act like him
and I feel like him sometimes.

899
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,421
I've gotta get out of this place
or I'm dead.

900
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,966
-You've said that for two years.
-This time I mean it.

901
01:27:19,502 --> 01:27:22,061
I'll live with Gregory in Princeton.

902
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,162
The brother who never calls?

903
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:28,970
-That brother?
-I may go to a prep school like he did.

904
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:31,511
-Like my dad.
-What about your grades?

905
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,140
-What about money?
-Dwight owes me over $1 200.

906
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:38,680
If he hadn't kept my paper route money
I'd be okay.

907
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:43,122
If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,
he would have caught the rabbit.

908
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:51,029
You know what?
I think Dwight was right about you.

909
01:27:51,202 --> 01:27:54,328
I think you do fight for the pink team.

910
01:28:03,747 --> 01:28:06,180
My brother and I had been in touch.

911
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:10,609
He said the road from Concrete
to Princeton starts with SA Ts.

912
01:28:10,787 --> 01:28:14,984
And that I could take them
at the Lakeside School in Seattle.

913
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:17,684
Dwight said I had
as much chance of passing...

914
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:22,024
...as he had of farting his way through
the "Star-Spangled Banner. "

915
01:28:54,064 --> 01:28:57,828
Hi, honey. Would you take
that trash out for me, please?

916
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,305
Thank you.

917
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:36,704
My application forms came today,
and he threw them away.

918
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:40,238
I thought I was helping.
I'd save him some trouble.

919
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:44,037
He's got no chance of getting into
some fancy prep school.

920
01:29:44,247 --> 01:29:47,511
Your nose is always pressed
against the bakeshop window.

921
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:49,948
-What?
-You're afraid that someone...

922
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,713
...is gonna get what you never had.
It makes you mean.

923
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,118
You know something?

924
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:59,626
One day that meanness will snap back
and slap you in the face.

925
01:29:59,796 --> 01:30:04,198
Oh, I'm so scared. I'm so scared.
I'm so scared!

926
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:09,198
This is all you gave me for dinner?

927
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:22,042
When I went to fill out applications,
I ran into a wall.

928
01:30:22,216 --> 01:30:25,586
They wanted letters of recommendation
from teachers.

929
01:30:25,756 --> 01:30:27,551
I could write these myself.

930
01:30:27,725 --> 01:30:32,091
But they wanted my grades on
our official school transcript forms.

931
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:35,229
-And this was a problem.
-I won't do it.

932
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:38,127
You work in the office.
No one will know.

933
01:30:38,301 --> 01:30:41,360
I'm surprised you
want help from the pink team.

934
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:45,872
I'm asking you for help. I heard
I did really well on those tests.

935
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:49,204
But it's not enough.
I've got to cheat and lie.

936
01:30:49,378 --> 01:30:52,109
If they want A's,
I have to give them to them.

937
01:30:52,283 --> 01:30:55,046
-It's so simple. You're the only way l--
-No!

938
01:30:58,488 --> 01:31:01,515
Why should you get to be
the one who leaves?

939
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:05,448
Why not me?

940
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:48,100
You could leave too, you know.

941
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:52,899
No. I've grown progressively fond
of Concrete.

942
01:31:53,077 --> 01:31:58,445
I think I'll stay here all alone and
dress up in my mama's old clothes.

943
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:02,140
You know, like you said.

944
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:32,238
Excuse me. I need some help here.
Fuck!

945
01:33:25,903 --> 01:33:30,738
Jack! Jack, you got letters
from those schools!

946
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:21,890
Hey, Wolff!
Bring that bottle over here.

947
01:34:22,059 --> 01:34:26,086
Brand new,
with a nice shine and everything.

948
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:30,595
Bullshit. Nobody in your family's
ever been in a Corvette.

949
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:32,926
-But you're going to own one?
-Yeah.

950
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,899
-Go pick it up.
-I'm gonna move to Seattle.

951
01:34:36,073 --> 01:34:39,905
I'll get a job at Bendix
and drive to work in my Vette.

952
01:34:40,077 --> 01:34:44,069
My uncle can have any car.
Makes big bucks as an electrician.

953
01:34:44,247 --> 01:34:46,876
-Yeah, how big?
-$1 75 a week, take home.

954
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:50,109
-Bullshitter.
-Even supervisors don't make that.

955
01:34:50,287 --> 01:34:53,948
Then how are you gonna
make enough to drive a Vette?

956
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:57,689
-I'll drive a T-Bird.
-I'm gonna own a Vette...

957
01:34:57,961 --> 01:35:00,725
...even if I have to rob
the Bendix payroll.

958
01:35:00,896 --> 01:35:03,492
You losers. Bunch of losers.

959
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:08,033
-Who you calling a loser?
-Jackie called us losers.

960
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,667
All of you!

961
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:21,613
You're gonna drive a Fairlane,
just like your daddy does.

962
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:24,283
Tell me something, Psycho. Tell me.

963
01:35:24,453 --> 01:35:29,253
How you gonna drive a T-Bird if you're
a janitor like your entire family?

964
01:35:29,426 --> 01:35:34,225
Forget about being an electrician.
You can't even pass 1 0th-grade math.

965
01:35:34,631 --> 01:35:39,261
-Who died and made you King Shit?
-Yeah. You're no better than us.

966
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:42,497
I know, that's my point, Psycho.

967
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:46,439
You guys are my buddies.

968
01:35:47,778 --> 01:35:50,747
You guys are my pals.

969
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,819
My dear old dad's called Dwight.

970
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,354
Welcome to beautiful Concrete.

971
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:40,953
We only take boys who want to work.
Is that you?

972
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,087
I want you to start evenings now.

973
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:49,761
And I'd want you to work all summer.
No vacations.

974
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:52,439
Food-service work isn't easy.

975
01:36:52,609 --> 01:36:55,703
It doesn't come to you
in a year or two.

976
01:36:55,979 --> 01:37:00,676
So, you think you got what it takes
to be an A & P management trainee?

977
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,015
Yeah, it's exactly what I've got.

978
01:37:06,055 --> 01:37:08,988
-Now, where did this--?
-I got another one.

979
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:12,185
You're gonna finish this puzzle.

980
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:17,800
Look. See this one? See this house?
So it's got to go with the house.

981
01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:20,725
I got the top together.

982
01:37:20,904 --> 01:37:23,395
Excellent. You're very good at this.

983
01:37:23,573 --> 01:37:29,408
You're gonna finish this entire puzzle
and I have only put in one piece.

984
01:37:29,578 --> 01:37:32,309
I got it. Found it.

985
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,347
No, right here. Look, I got it.

986
01:37:36,453 --> 01:37:39,354
Carla and Skipper are the best.

987
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,296
-Hi, I'm home.
-Hi, sweetheart.

988
01:37:48,463 --> 01:37:50,524
You're late. We started dinner.

989
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:53,033
-Sorry.
-We had to go ahead and eat.

990
01:37:53,203 --> 01:37:57,229
-Give me a second, I'll get your dinner.
-I'll get some at work.

991
01:37:57,405 --> 01:38:01,033
I don't want you to go to work
on an empty stomach.

992
01:38:01,211 --> 01:38:04,439
-I'm in a rush, sorry.
-There's a plate in the oven.

993
01:38:04,613 --> 01:38:07,774
-Put it on the table.
-What are these?

994
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:10,713
Blueberry muffins.
I made them for you.

995
01:38:15,559 --> 01:38:19,287
I was trying to listen to a record.

996
01:38:28,738 --> 01:38:30,399
Hello?

997
01:38:30,573 --> 01:38:34,838
Yeah, he's here. Are you Tobias?

998
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:40,511
Hello?

999
01:38:42,118 --> 01:38:44,087
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

1000
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,310
All right.

1001
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:49,850
Okay, tomorrow, then.

1002
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:51,720
Bye.

1003
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,890
Well?

1004
01:39:00,337 --> 01:39:03,305
It was Hill School,
the last one I applied to.

1005
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:05,497
They haven't accepted me yet...

1006
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:08,769
...but they're sending somebody in
to interview me.

1007
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:22,645
I enjoy my classes,
especially the advanced ones.

1008
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:27,319
But lately I've been feeling restless.
It's hard to explain.

1009
01:39:27,497 --> 01:39:33,060
Oh, come on, that's easy to explain.
You're bored. Not being challenged.

1010
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:38,872
Toby, your application was very good.
But many boys want to go to Hill...

1011
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:42,372
...and not everybody is comfortable
at prep school.

1012
01:39:42,546 --> 01:39:46,810
I think I would. Both my father
and brother went to prep schools.

1013
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:52,011
-Is that right? Where?
-Deerfield and Choate.

1014
01:39:52,189 --> 01:39:56,680
I see. Well, you might like it.

1015
01:39:56,859 --> 01:40:02,890
Hill was difficult for me, though.
Academically, it was hard.

1016
01:40:03,064 --> 01:40:07,502
Then, my last year things changed.
My classmates grew close in ways...

1017
01:40:07,671 --> 01:40:11,162
...l never would've thought possible.
So close that...

1018
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:16,073
...well, I still think of them
as sort of a second family.

1019
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:19,805
I want that. I do.

1020
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:24,747
She says, "No, I don't want you to
do that." And I said, "Let me get down...

1021
01:40:24,921 --> 01:40:29,618
...and grovel in it." I mean, I ate her
pussy till my tongue was calloused.

1022
01:40:29,993 --> 01:40:32,484
Then, I noticed her nipples got hard.

1023
01:40:32,662 --> 01:40:36,619
You know, not big fat nipples,
but hard raisin nipples.

1024
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,667
So she goes off like
this Roman candle.

1025
01:40:39,836 --> 01:40:44,671
I mean, that woman can scream.
I says, "You liked that, didn't you?

1026
01:40:45,073 --> 01:40:48,100
You like the old Arch Cook special,
don't you?"

1027
01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:50,546
Bye, Richie.

1028
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:00,881
Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly too,
sometimes.

1029
01:41:01,122 --> 01:41:04,854
I can see you've led
rather a sheltered life.

1030
01:41:06,863 --> 01:41:08,555
Yeah.

1031
01:41:11,667 --> 01:41:15,934
You seem like a fine boy, and
I'm going to give you a good report.

1032
01:41:16,104 --> 01:41:20,702
But there are lots of boys applying.
We'll just have to wait and see--

1033
01:41:20,877 --> 01:41:25,814
Hotshot. It's the hotshot boy.

1034
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,841
Guy who thinks he knows everything,
thinks he's smart.

1035
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:34,814
Fella, what you don't know
would fill a book.

1036
01:41:35,658 --> 01:41:38,421
Edsel's a shit car.

1037
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:45,529
He's a mechanic,
he did bad work on our car.

1038
01:41:45,702 --> 01:41:48,828
It's just, he acts like that.
I don't know why.

1039
01:41:49,805 --> 01:41:53,899
-Well, good luck.
-Thanks.

1040
01:42:41,457 --> 01:42:44,789
I know what'll make you feel good.
That man called.

1041
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:51,457
You got the scholarship. They're gonna
give you $2300 a year. Great, huh?

1042
01:42:52,033 --> 01:42:57,470
So I guess you'll be leaving soon.
I'm gonna miss you.

1043
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:04,100
I'm making hot dogs. Want one?
Can you put mustard on bread for us?

1044
01:43:20,762 --> 01:43:26,631
Hey, what are you doing home so--?
Toby got the scholarship. $2300.

1045
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:32,262
Hey, leopard. I say, hey, leopard.
I know you, leopard.

1046
01:43:32,742 --> 01:43:36,872
I can see those spots
that you can't change, leopard.

1047
01:43:37,046 --> 01:43:41,279
Huh, leopard? Huh?

1048
01:43:42,582 --> 01:43:46,645
He thinks he'll go to a fancy school
and fool everybody.

1049
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:49,015
Not a chance.

1050
01:43:51,627 --> 01:43:54,823
I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

1051
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:59,493
I sure do. Sure do.

1052
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:02,136
-Who threw this away?
-I did.

1053
01:44:02,305 --> 01:44:05,569
-You threw it away? Why?
-Because it was empty.

1054
01:44:05,742 --> 01:44:08,006
-That look empty?
-Looks empty to me.

1055
01:44:08,176 --> 01:44:10,667
-To me too.
-Look again, hotshot.

1056
01:44:10,845 --> 01:44:13,042
-Is it empty? ls it empty?
-Dad.

1057
01:44:13,216 --> 01:44:16,082
-Now, now, now, is it empty?
-Stop!

1058
01:44:16,252 --> 01:44:22,212
Now, Mr. Bigtime-Hotshot-
Prep-School-Fucker, is it empty?

1059
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:26,917
-Is it empty? Huh?
-No.

1060
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:31,591
Good. All right. Now, clean it out.

1061
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:40,564
Clean it out!

1062
01:44:42,377 --> 01:44:45,640
Now, was it empty?

1063
01:44:45,814 --> 01:44:49,408
-Huh? Was it empty?
-Yes.

1064
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:38,796
Come on, you fuck!

1065
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:41,930
Come on. Come on.

1066
01:46:07,328 --> 01:46:08,988
Get away from him!

1067
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:11,631
Get away from him or I'll kill you.

1068
01:46:15,671 --> 01:46:17,229
What's going on here?

1069
01:46:17,405 --> 01:46:21,569
I got the scholarship and he went nuts.
He's crazy. I'm leaving!

1070
01:46:21,743 --> 01:46:24,872
Great. Go. Finally. About time.
About time. Go.

1071
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:27,378
I'm gone!
Give me my paper route money.

1072
01:46:27,617 --> 01:46:30,082
-That money is gone with the wind.
-No!

1073
01:46:30,252 --> 01:46:31,479
I spent it.

1074
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:33,220
For things we needed!

1075
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,378
It's gone! Poof!

1076
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:38,957
Know something? It's not
that you're disappointing.

1077
01:46:39,162 --> 01:46:44,564
-You're consistently disappointing.
-Fancy talk. Fancy talk for a whore.

1078
01:46:44,734 --> 01:46:47,930
Yeah, I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

1079
01:46:48,104 --> 01:46:51,435
I got friends in this town
and they tell me things.

1080
01:46:51,606 --> 01:46:55,805
I heard a guy at campaign headquarters
got you a job in Washington, D.C.

1081
01:46:55,979 --> 01:46:58,948
You're gonna run off with him,
right, whore?

1082
01:46:59,113 --> 01:47:03,412
-You're pathetic.
-Miss Whore. Liar! Whore! You know it.

1083
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,207
Mom, you can leave too.

1084
01:47:05,386 --> 01:47:08,720
I'm leaving.
You don't have to stay for this shit!

1085
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:11,189
-I don't, do l?
-No.

1086
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:15,127
-Liar! Whore!
-I could leave with you, couldn't l?

1087
01:47:15,296 --> 01:47:16,560
Yes, you could.

1088
01:47:16,731 --> 01:47:19,702
-I could walk right out, couldn't l?
-Yes.

1089
01:47:19,868 --> 01:47:21,837
-What?
-I'm leaving you, Dwight.

1090
01:47:22,003 --> 01:47:25,372
-No. No, you're not. What about me?
-I'm leaving.

1091
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:27,905
-What about me?
-I'm leaving you.

1092
01:47:28,211 --> 01:47:30,404
Why stay? You don't even like me.

1093
01:47:30,613 --> 01:47:33,444
No, you're not leaving.
You're not leaving.

1094
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:35,845
Keep away from us.

1095
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:40,350
You always sided against me,
thought you were better.

1096
01:47:40,521 --> 01:47:44,479
I tried. I did the best I could.
What about me?

1097
01:47:44,694 --> 01:47:48,628
What am I supposed to do?
Crawl off in some ditch and die?

1098
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:50,957
What about me?

1099
01:47:55,604 --> 01:47:59,801
What about me? What about me?

1100
01:48:00,408 --> 01:48:05,744
When is it ever Dwight's turn
for some consideration? What about me?

1101
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:12,475
I'll tell you one thing,
you'll remember me!

1102
01:48:12,689 --> 01:48:15,055
-It was as easy as that.
-You'll remember me!

1103
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:17,818
Wejust picked up and left.

1104
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:23,158
You can dream of a moment for years and
still somehow miss it when it comes.

1105
01:48:23,332 --> 01:48:28,327
You've got to reach through the flames
and take it or lose it forever.

1106
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,801
I took it. So did my mother.

1107
01:48:31,573 --> 01:48:33,972
We never looked back.

1108
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:46,117
I borrowed money
from everybody we know.

1109
01:48:46,287 --> 01:48:49,552
-So here's the extra $200 for tuition.
-Thanks.

1110
01:48:49,725 --> 01:48:54,095
There's another 50 there, get
yourself a blazer or something, okay?

1111
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:55,752
Okay.

1112
01:48:58,167 --> 01:48:59,792
Well....

1113
01:49:01,104 --> 01:49:03,627
You're sure you're gonna be all right?

1114
01:49:03,805 --> 01:49:08,470
Yeah, Mom, my bus comes in two hours.
I'll be fine.

1115
01:49:15,251 --> 01:49:18,274
I'm going to miss you so much.

1116
01:49:22,658 --> 01:49:24,954
Get on the bus, Mom.

1117
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:33,131
I love you.

1118
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:40,296
I know that, Mom.
I've always known that.

1119
01:49:42,345 --> 01:49:44,176
All aboard.

1120
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:51,243
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

1121
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,088
I love you.

1122
01:54:38,671 --> 01:54:39,662
(ENGLISH)
