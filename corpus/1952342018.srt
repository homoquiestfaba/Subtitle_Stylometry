1
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,220
When the uplink came through
with the work orders,

2
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,270
he had a strange feeling everything
was about to change for him.

3
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,390
Maybe it just had
something to do

4
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,350
With the way the world is today...

5
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,270
Bio-enhanced gangsters,

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,150
information terrorists,
cyborg outlaws.

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,990
Everything so congested
with high-tech overload,

8
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,870
that he was starting to feel
a little numb.

9
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,310
You see, there's an old saying
in his business,

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,230
"it pays to be more than human."

11
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,190
I don't think he was
so sure anymore.

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,350
Move and I'll crush your throat.

13
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,630
I had to be sure you weren't armed.

14
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,390
Can't be too careful nowadays.

15
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,430
There's undercover police everywhere.

16
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,790
Relax, baby.

17
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,310
Goddamn cop!

18
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,430
Goddamn terrorist.

19
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,430
The things people do
to get ahead.

20
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,350
His work order turned out to be

21
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,270
a nicely shaped chip smuggler,

22
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,230
who had some expensive
bio-engineering done

23
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,150
to her insides.

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,230
She was able to charge double,

25
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,110
because of the extra rams
she could carry.

26
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,430
"Morico" was the alias
she had been using,

27
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,350
and she had hoped to
download her data

28
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,390
on a gang of terrorists, known
as "The Red Army Hammerheads."

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,150
The Hammerheads...
They're a cute bunch,

30
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,070
fighting a lost cause.

31
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,990
Someday i expect to see
their scan I.D. S

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,750
Come over the uplink.

33
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,630
But right now, Morico
had been his work order.

34
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,710
Then it was filled.

35
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,390
See? Laundering data
can be dangerous.

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,150
You break the law...
Go to hell.

37
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,470
That guy we passed in
the hall, he's a cop.

38
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,590
Shit!

39
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,430
No problem.

40
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,110
Our courier's been iced
by an L.A.P.D. agent.

41
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,830
He beat us to the data chip.
We're in pursuit.

42
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,790
Are you sure he's L.A.P.D.?

43
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,550
He's a cop, all right.

44
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,310
Get him!

45
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,270
Aarghh!

46
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,150
Go on.
Go, go, go!

47
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,670
Aaah!

48
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,270
Argh!

49
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,270
Ugh!

50
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,030
That knee was brand new.

51
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,470
Fuck, he's quick.

52
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,230
Aw, sensitive man.

53
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,110
Give it a rest.

54
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,630
You son of a bitch!

55
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,310
You toss your weapon aside,

56
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,230
and you step away,

57
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,150
and I'll say you were cooperative.

58
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,910
I don't think this is funny.

59
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,830
Cops are animals.

60
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,910
You don't know who that
woman was back in the room.

61
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,830
You don't know who I am.

62
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,630
- You're a terrorist.
- You're confused.

63
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,390
We're trying to save humankind,

64
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,270
And you...
You protect the machines.

65
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,350
No wonder you protect them.

66
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,030
You're mostly machine. You're not
really human anymore, are you?

67
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,830
86.5% is still a human.

68
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,590
None of you is human.

69
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,590
Never was.

70
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,830
You have no idea
what's going on here...

71
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,670
What this is really all about.

72
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,350
When i'm through with you,
there's no way

73
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,470
they'll be able to put
you back together.

74
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,230
I'm here to tell you
you're finished.

75
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,030
You lose.

76
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,150
Adios.

77
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,790
God, ohh-hh!

78
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,830
This is the Los Angeles

79
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,750
police department.

80
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,510
You are surrounded.

81
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,430
I order the occupants
of building 4-0-8-7

82
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,190
to exit that building

83
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,070
and surrender to police authorities.

84
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,950
Drop your weapons

85
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,150
and exit with your hands up...
Now.

86
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,590
We'll start by replacing his eyes.

87
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,630
Respiration scans read critical.

88
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,550
Human organs are at 9.8.

89
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,310
Fluid levels, 18.2.

90
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,150
You're not really human.

91
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,150
Mostly machine...
You're not really human.

92
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,190
You're mostly machine...
You're not really human.

93
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,870
You're not really human anymore,
are you?

94
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,750
Or are you?

95
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,430
It took them six months

96
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,350
to put him back together.

97
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,150
Synthetic flesh,
bio-engineered organs.

98
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,870
It always scared him that they
might take out his soul,

99
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,910
and replace it with
some matrix chip.

100
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,710
After the techs were
done with his body,

101
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,470
they shipped him to Baja.

102
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,710
He ended up in this
godforsaken refuge

103
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,630
on the edge of existence.

104
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,550
The kind of place where
people on the run

105
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,470
go to be forgotten.

106
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,110
He was there to recuperate.

107
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,710
Cerveza, por favor.

108
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,070
Mind if I sit down?

109
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,950
I am Rosaria.

110
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,630
I'm not looking for company, lady.

111
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,750
I can see that, senor.

112
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,550
I've seen you around.

113
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,350
Not too many gringos
come down here

114
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,470
without some kind of...

115
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,190
sad story.

116
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,110
No one's here without
some kind of story.

117
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,790
Relax.
I won't give awa Y your hideout.

118
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,630
What do you want?

119
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,670
I want to get even.

120
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,510
Even?

121
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,550
With who, senor?

122
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,510
You, terrorist.

123
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,430
- Oh, shit!
- Remember L.A.?

124
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,150
Hey!

125
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,710
He wanted to tell this terrorist

126
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,790
that he had given
a lot of thought

127
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,550
to what she said back in L.A.

128
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,350
About whether he was
more machine than human.

129
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,270
He wanted to tell her
she started him thinking.

130
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,150
I know he really wanted
to tell her all this.

131
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,110
But she was dead.

132
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,030
So instead he sat there
listening to the sound

133
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,950
of approaching engines.

134
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,670
The kind of turbo engines
we use in our vehicles

135
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,870
at L.A.P.D.

136
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,390
Not bad, but a little sloppy,
Alex.

137
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,230
Looks like you're ready
to go back to work.

138
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,510
The cyber transplants
have really taken to you.

139
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,350
Can't tell what's real
and what's synthetic.

140
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,070
- You'll be all machine soon.
- Shut up, Pam.

141
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,670
Pack up, Alex.
Rehab's over.

142
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,830
Farnsworth wants you back online.

143
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,670
I quit, and you tell
Farnsworth that.

144
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,470
And if he doesn't like it,

145
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,430
I know he will find me
and let me know.

146
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,870
To stop the pain.

147
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,830
She's right,
nothing is mine anymore.

148
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,550
Nothing's been mine
since I met you, Jared.

149
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,590
I didn't force you to enlist.

150
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,350
You and Farnsworth did not
give me much choice, did you?

151
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,150
We got you out of prison.
That was the deal.

152
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,950
What's wrong, Alex?

153
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,910
You want me to tell Farnsworth
he misjudged you?

154
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,790
That I misjudged you?

155
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,830
You can't handle the job,
you've lost the edge.

156
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,830
You've become too emotional.

157
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,350
I can't feel anything anymore.

158
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,190
You turned me into
a fucking machine.

159
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,190
I don't know what's
right or wrong.

160
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,190
Since when did you care?

161
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,910
Maybe you should take the time

162
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,750
to find out what you
care about, Alex.

163
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,430
I cared about you, once.

164
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,470
- I'm synthetic.
- That's right.

165
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,310
And i thought you were real.

166
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,190
Well, I never said I wasn't.

167
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,270
Look,

168
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,190
there's a lot of us
working to make

169
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,790
a bad world better.
Remember that.

170
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,710
What do you care about
a better world?

171
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,550
You're a cyborg.

172
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,550
I live here, too.

173
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,110
That was unnecessary.

174
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,030
We'll never
get him back now.

175
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,590
I'll give Farnsworth
the bad news.

176
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,550
The next year was
as grim as it gets.

177
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,590
He slipped into the
black market network

178
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,350
that thrived in
the New Rio grid.

179
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,270
He wanted to try his hand
at smuggling,

180
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,190
but he really didn't
have the knack for it.

181
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,110
His deals...
When he could get them...

182
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,990
Usually ended up with
someone getting dead.

183
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,910
Not the best thing
for staying in business.

184
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,990
Just when he was about
to give up on Brazil,

185
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,870
he got word this morning
some hotshot systems cowboy

186
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,750
wanted to see him.

187
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,590
The systems cowboy went
by the name Marion Face.

188
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,510
He had some japanese tech

189
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,430
that wanted to switch corporations.

190
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,310
The tech needed safe passage
through the electronic web.

191
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,190
A perfect setup for Alex.

192
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,830
It's about time, Marion.

193
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,750
You know you're making a
simple deal very complicated.

194
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,670
Are you enjoying your
retirement, Alex?

195
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,350
Still glad you quit
being a cop?

196
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,230
I hear you've been dealing
out on the line.

197
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,950
You've blown a lot of
transactions, Alex.

198
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,950
Your rep in the Brazil
triad is shit.

199
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,630
You're lucky I even
took a chance on you.

200
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,750
So where's the japanese tech
with the chip?

201
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,470
He'll be here.
Relax.

202
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,390
Well...

203
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,310
Help me relax, Marion.

204
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,150
Pull your hands out
of your pockets,

205
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,030
where i can see them.

206
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,950
See?

207
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,830
There's nothing
up my sleeves, Alex.

208
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,390
Don't worry, Alex.
You're not gonna die.

209
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,470
L.A.P.D. will put you
back together.

210
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,390
They want you for an assignment.

211
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,310
Farnsworth is here.

212
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,190
Let's go.

213
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,710
I also understand the
situation in Rio

214
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,590
was quite messy.

215
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,590
What are you talking about?

216
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,510
I saw the reports.

217
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,190
- How is that possible?
- I have my sources, you know.

218
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,070
You have some nerve
looking into this.

219
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,790
Commissioner.

220
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,830
Gentlemen.

221
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,910
He used to be one
of my best ops.

222
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,790
Get him out of there.

223
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,350
So I'm still alive
for a reason, right?

224
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,190
You're too valuable to let go.
I knew I might need you,

225
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,910
so we allowed you to retire.
How was it?

226
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,950
Pretty fuckin' desperate, huh?

227
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,830
You're only good
at one thing, Alex.

228
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,750
It's all you'll
ever be good at.

229
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,470
You see that now, I think.

230
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,510
I hope you do, because
I need Your skills again.

231
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,430
And what makes you think
I would help you?

232
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,310
Because when they put you
back together last week,

233
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,230
they added a little something.

234
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,990
Your heart...
A bomb.

235
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,910
Enough to make you disappear.

236
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,590
You're living on
their time now.

237
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,550
So how do I stay alive,
commissioner?

238
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,630
The american president and
the prime minister of Japan

239
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,390
are meeting in L.A.
in three days.

240
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,270
The security plans for the
summit have been stolen.

241
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,310
I'd like to keep it quiet.
I can't use anyone

242
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,230
in our department to
retrieve the disks...

243
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,150
Too many goddamn japanese around.

244
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,990
Ever since the U.S.
and Japan merged,

245
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,870
it's been a fight to...

246
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,790
keep down these slant-eyed
bastards.

247
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,470
This is the kind of power play
they are looking for

248
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,550
to get rid of the commissioner.

249
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,310
I need you, Alex.
I've been saving you

250
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,070
for something like this.

251
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,150
Sandrakes is good.

252
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,910
We're wasting our time,
commissioner.

253
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,990
He's just a speed-loader now.

254
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,750
Listen to your queer,
he's right, I can't do it.

255
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,670
Alex, you want to know

256
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,590
who has stolen the security plan?

257
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,390
Your ex-boss, your ex-lover.

258
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,390
Jared?

259
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,030
That synthetic bitch
turned on us.

260
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,950
Gone renegade.

261
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,670
She's selling plans to a...

262
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,630
terrorist organization,
"The Red Army Hammerheads."

263
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,590
Jared is hiding out in Java,

264
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,590
a low-tech shithole
called Shang-Loo...

265
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,270
That is part of the
Southwest Asian Hui.

266
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,310
Some second-class cyborg...
What's the name?

267
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,990
- Julian.
- Julian is fronting for her.

268
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,070
We know Jared's going
to meet with...

269
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,710
The leader...
Hammerheads.

270
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,670
We don't know
who the leader is,

271
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,510
what he or she looks like.

272
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,350
But if you will bring back both,

273
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,230
- We can...
- You go and get them.

274
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,190
We want you to do it, Alex.

275
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,070
You've got the experience.
You know Jared.

276
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,990
You could talk her into giving up.

277
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,070
Convince the goddamn cyborg
to correct her error.

278
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,830
Why did Jared steal the plan?

279
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,750
Go to Shang-Loo and
find out for us.

280
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,590
Forget it.

281
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,350
You know the cliche,
you racist asshole?

282
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,350
What's that?

283
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,990
"Pull it, and you'd better use it."

284
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,910
Give me an excuse.

285
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,950
Heh.

286
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,790
How's that one?

287
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,630
You haven't lost the edge, Alex.

288
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,590
Find someone else.

289
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,390
Remember the bomb in
your heart, Alex!

290
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,230
You've got three days.
The clock is running.

291
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,190
Take this one last assignment,

292
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,110
as a favor to me,

293
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,030
and I'll set you up,
on a real retirement

294
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,750
with all the money and
junk you could want.

295
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,430
He'll be here in a moment.

296
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,350
I think he accepted the story.

297
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,950
By the time he learns the truth,
it'll be too late.

298
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,910
You still believe
he can manage this?

299
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,830
He won't have to do much.

300
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,750
If he can walk, that's enough.

301
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,750
Besides, Jared won't let
anyone else get near her.

302
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,510
There's no guarantee
he'll try to find Jared.

303
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,630
He won't have a choice.

304
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,390
How's that?

305
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,230
I've sent Billy Moon to Shang-Loo.

306
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,110
Alex won't have to find Jared.

307
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,150
Billy will make sure
she finds him.

308
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,270
Get him cleaned up.

309
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,070
Shang-Loo, christ.

310
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,350
Immigration, asshole.

311
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,110
What do you see?

312
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,830
What's out there, Billy?

313
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,910
Nothing.

314
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,790
Just another tourist.

315
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,830
Undercover.

316
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,190
Ah.

317
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,110
Good.

318
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,550
Just another tourist, Billy?

319
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,430
I told you L.A.P.D.
is sending a shark...

320
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,190
...to stop me.

321
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,950
Sharks come in all shapes
and sizes, Billy.

322
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,590
I told you that, didn't I?

323
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,550
Okay.

324
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,230
What are you gonna do about it?

325
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,110
Nothing, Billy.

326
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,190
Nothing for now.

327
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,510
Did I tell you how much
I appreciate all the help

328
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,390
you've given me and Jared,
Billy?

329
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,310
Did I thank you?

330
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,270
Ah, welcome to Shang-Loo, mister.

331
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,390
I am Yoshiro Han, proprietor

332
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,310
of the Shang-Loo hotel.

333
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,070
Room for one. How much?

334
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,070
5000 yen a night, for...

335
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,950
a regular suite.

336
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,710
However, a view of the volcano

337
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,790
can be yours for a measly
10,000 yen.

338
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,470
How much is 10,000 yen
in american?

339
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,590
I'm terribly sorry, mister.
We only accept yen.

340
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,510
American is so very...
How you say?

341
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,390
Questionable, yes?

342
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,310
I'd better pass on that volcano.

343
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,910
What do you want, mister?

344
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,670
Someone in particular?

345
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,630
It's a busy time of year.

346
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,590
Lot of visitors.

347
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,230
Alex Rain?

348
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,070
Good fake name, yeah?

349
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,990
Give me the key.

350
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,830
Up the stairs, fifth
door on the right.

351
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,750
And if you like,
I can arrange guided tour

352
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,830
of the volcano, mister.

353
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,310
Yoshiro.

354
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,950
Alex Rain.
Is he the one, Angie-san?

355
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,950
Easy enough to find out, no?

356
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,550
Hey!
What's the matter you?

357
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,270
No more of their drugs.

358
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,310
If Farnsworth is going
to kill me tomorrow,

359
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,150
I want to be clear.

360
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,790
I hope Jared really
hurts L.A.P.D.,

361
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,870
I really do.

362
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,550
She can sell her data to the
dog boys for all I care.

363
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,510
Damn.

364
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,950
He's a fuckin' speed-loader.

365
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,830
Huh. Maybe he's not the shark,
Julian.

366
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,670
What do you think, Billy?

367
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,310
You think he's a shark?

368
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,150
I don't think they'd
send a junkie.

369
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,110
Not on something this important.

370
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,030
It worries me, especially

371
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,910
with the exchange going
on this afternoon.

372
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,870
Probably just here for
the goddamn volcano.

373
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,750
I have to know.

374
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,430
Relax, baby.

375
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,310
I got you this far, right?

376
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,390
I'll run over later.
I'll see if it's

377
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,270
this cop Alex Rain you're
so concerned about.

378
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,950
Hey, I got you this far...

379
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,750
So relax.

380
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,830
Look, kill him later.

381
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,750
I want you to fuck me now.

382
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,630
Why did you do that?

383
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,350
You're insulting, Billy.

384
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,270
Michelle!

385
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,150
No, Julian...

386
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,870
Julian, what the fuck
are you pulling, man?

387
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,950
I thought we had a goddamn deal.

388
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,870
I thought, uh...

389
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,790
Come on!
Look, look now...

390
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,390
Please, don't do this.
Damn it!

391
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,470
We had a goddamn
motherfucking deal!

392
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,150
I'm your fuckin' partner in this!

393
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,070
I fuckin' set you up
in Shang-Loo,

394
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,990
I helped your ass!

395
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,150
We had a deal,
you plasmo-sucking bitch!

396
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,070
Wait!

397
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,830
You helped a little too much,
Billy.

398
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,870
How does an out-of-town
hustler like you

399
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,590
get the inside scoop
on undercover cops

400
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,430
and terrorists?
Answer me that, huh?

401
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,510
How does it happen?

402
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,030
I was trying to help you, man.

403
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,030
Too bad the sensor read
differently, Billy.

404
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,950
Too bad for you

405
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,830
it said you were L.A.P.D.

406
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,350
Angie-san, Room 16.

407
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,070
Room service.

408
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,670
Hey, how's it, bro'?

409
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,750
On behalf of the Shang-Loo
welcome wagon,

410
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,470
I'd like to introduce my
right arm, Fran Terry.

411
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,310
Angie-liv, yours truly.

412
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,150
Leave me alone.

413
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,870
I guess "leave me alone"
means something different here.

414
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,910
Or are you too stupid to get it?

415
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,790
Bugger get smart mouth, eh?

416
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,670
Like that in a victim.

417
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,270
Make it easy on yourself, bro'.
I'm the boss here.

418
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,150
Anybody smart mouth in Shang-Loo,

419
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,030
only if I say.

420
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,750
What are you looking for?

421
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,750
No, no.
I ask the questions, Boy-san.

422
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,030
So why you here, brother?

423
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,870
To see the volcano.

424
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,710
Look, make it easy on yourself,
bro'.

425
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,750
I can find a place on you
that's still human.

426
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,470
Where you can still
feel something, eh?

427
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,670
I'm just looking for someone,
okay?

428
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,710
The cyborg from old California.
Jared, yeah?

429
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,310
Yeah, we hear she stole
something from the L.A.P.D.

430
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,310
What, they wan' send you
down here to stop her

431
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,030
before she sells something
to those terrorists?

432
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,190
The Red Army Hammerheads?

433
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,030
Since you know so much,
maybe you can tell me

434
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,870
how to find Jared?

435
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,590
Hey bro', why?

436
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,430
Look like missing
persons to you?

437
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,470
Hey, The Hammerheads,
what you think of them, man?

438
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,310
- I don't.
- Hammerheads are rebels, yeah?

439
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,190
They freedom fighters
trying to stop

440
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,190
the spread of information systems.

441
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,910
The cyborg computers who will try

442
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,990
to enslave civilization.

443
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,670
Think of themselves as
protectors of humankind.

444
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,550
You know, maybe you're
one smart cop.

445
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,430
Maybe too smart for cop, brother.

446
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,270
Maybe, just maybe,

447
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,190
you're one sharp motherfucker.

448
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,790
That's a lot of maybes.

449
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,750
Look stop it now, I'm
telling you the truth.

450
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,670
Why, gaijin?

451
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,510
Because i'm going to
be dead in two days.

452
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,510
I've got something inside me.

453
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,390
- Oh, shit!
- Inside you? Bomb, yeah?

454
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,230
Yeah, that's right.
When I get close to Jared.

455
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,030
I got a feeling I'm going
to become colorfull.

456
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,870
So stop fucking with me!

457
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,830
Surgery by surgery, brother.

458
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,870
Getting more machine than human.

459
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,590
How you feel about that?

460
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,630
I didn't have any choice.

461
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,350
Sad, yeah?

462
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,190
At least I'm still alive.

463
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,070
Won't make any difference
you no care, brother.

464
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,910
Just make sure you
stay away from me,

465
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,870
in case your bomb get accident.

466
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,670
Next time...

467
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,510
...I kill all of you motherfuckers.

468
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,430
Ling-kun,

469
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,350
Let's go get plate lunch.

470
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,910
Hey Julian, who the fuck
are these guys?

471
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,670
Who cares?

472
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,150
Oooh!

473
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,150
You're not the maid, are you?

474
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,110
Bring him in here, Michelle!

475
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,990
Did you hear what I said?
He's checked out.

476
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,550
It only works if you
load it, stupid.

477
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,430
Thanks for the tip.

478
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,270
Michelle...

479
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,870
Jared said you were
someone I could trust.

480
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,950
She said you were...
Different.

481
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,670
Who the hell are you?

482
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,750
Someone that can help
you find Jared.

483
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,510
I apologize for Michelle's
unorthodox methods,

484
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,590
but I needed to run
a scan on you,

485
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,510
with a respirator sensor,

486
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,430
just to make sure Jared
wasn't overly optimistic

487
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,270
about your allegiance.

488
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,070
I don't really care
what your scan says...

489
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,990
We can't really talk.

490
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,910
Farnsworth's got a
surveillance unit

491
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,030
implanted in your right eye.

492
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,910
He can hear and see
everything you do.

493
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,670
So you want me to
tear out my eyeball?

494
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,590
Jared came up with

495
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,470
a slightly less drastic measure.

496
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,270
- I trusted Jared once...
- Yeah, and she betrayed you.

497
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,310
- Yeah, she betrayed me...
- She did it for a good reason!

498
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,270
It wasn't her reason.

499
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,950
There is more at stake
than your feelings.

500
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,870
There always was.
Are you gonna help us?

501
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:30,870
You're a goddamned cyborg.
Why should I help you?

502
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,550
And you're a pathetic,
fucking speed-loader!

503
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,470
I don't want to depend on you!

504
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,550
I don't want to have
to rely on you!

505
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,350
Jared gave up her life
believing we needed you.

506
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,310
So she's dead?

507
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,030
Look, are you going
to trust me, Alex?

508
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,110
There's no more fucking time!

509
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:54,950
Okay, do it.

510
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,870
All right, Alex.

511
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,750
- Now this is gonna...
- Sting a little? I know.

512
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,670
No, actually,

513
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,430
it's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

514
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,350
Just do it.

515
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,790
Hold still!

516
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,670
We're busted.
Let's go pick them up.

517
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,710
You know, she's not really dead.

518
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,470
- What do you mean?
- Jared was caught leaving L.A.

519
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,430
She suffered major wounds
to her housing.

520
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,390
Her body died a few hours
after she got here.

521
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,230
So she's gone?

522
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,070
Her body is, but not her data.

523
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,190
Jared's mind and soul, Alex.

524
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,110
The database was transferred
to her memory banks.

525
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,910
Take Jared

526
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,790
to The Red Army Hammerheads.

527
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,870
A meeting's been set for
today at sundown,

528
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,790
on top of the volcano.

529
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,710
They'll wait there
until the sun vanishes,

530
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,590
then they're gone.
And with them,

531
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,470
our best chance to stop Farnsworth.

532
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,950
All units, move to preset positions.

533
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,870
Scan coordinates

534
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,670
for any terrorist support activity.

535
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,070
Welcome to Shang-Loo, gentlemen.

536
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,110
Why did Jared do this?

537
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,030
Ask her yourself.

538
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,910
Plug her into this computer.

539
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,870
You'll be able to talk to her.

540
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,510
Team two, report.

541
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,310
Team two in position.

542
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,110
You know I've got

543
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,030
an encoded explosive in my heart?

544
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,510
That will scramble the signals
they try to send the bomb.

545
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,190
You're safe for now.
As they decode the jammer,

546
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,270
the lights go out.

547
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,390
When all five are gone...
Boom.

548
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,270
Why did you need me?

549
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,110
Jared said you were the best.

550
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,990
That you'd have a better chance
of making it.

551
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,910
Why are you helping Jared?

552
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,630
I want to matter.

553
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,710
I want it to mean something
that I lived.

554
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,430
Isn't that what life's all about?

555
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,350
They are trapped...
Sitting ducks.

556
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,310
Ah.

557
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,070
Team three, report.

558
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,990
Team three set.

559
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,910
On your command, lockup will
commence in 15 seconds.

560
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,630
We can get out the back way,

561
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,590
through the bathroom window.

562
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,470
Go on! Get out!
I'll cover you.

563
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,270
Argh!

564
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,830
Well, it's an exciting resort.

565
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,830
A deep layer scan

566
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,710
confirms that Jared was
in the room with Alex,

567
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,630
commissioner.

568
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,510
Julian must have Jared on disk.

569
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,430
Shit!

570
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,310
The jam on Alex's charge
is holding.

571
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,870
The techs here say it will
take six to 12 hours

572
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,830
to decode the scrambler
Julian put in him.

573
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,750
We haven't got six hours.

574
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,670
The Hammerheads, they could have
the data by then.

575
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,550
Ja.

576
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,510
Sam, look at this.

577
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,470
Julian, wait.

578
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,350
I believe you've left
something behind.

579
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,870
Wait, Julian, here.

580
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,670
Let me help.

581
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,190
You've already erased your
memory banks.

582
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,110
Disciplined to the last.

583
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,830
But there's nothing I want
in your auxiliary program.

584
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,910
You'll be found out soon.

585
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,510
Not if we kill everyone that knows.

586
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,510
You always were

587
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,430
an extremist, Sam.

588
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,390
You were a shitty cyborg.

589
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,070
You were never one of us.

590
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,950
Killing all the humans...

591
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,990
Isn't going to make you
any more real.

592
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,830
I am real.

593
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,630
Commissioner,

594
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,550
we got a little trace image

595
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,470
from the hotel's recorder.

596
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,390
Not much, but have a look.

597
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,190
Take Jared to The Red Army
Hammerheads.

598
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,310
A meeting's been set...

599
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,070
Hey, Sam...

600
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,070
I'll be back.

601
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,990
I don't think so.

602
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,470
That's it.
The sound is ionized.

603
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,310
Alex has Jared with him.

604
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,030
We've got him now.

605
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,070
If the techs can decode the jammer.

606
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,030
This agent has a knack
for survival, hasn't he?

607
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,630
Developed quite a reputation

608
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,750
while he was online, eh?

609
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,790
Alex Rain will be destroyed,
somehow, some way.

610
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,550
He's human, after all.

611
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,630
We'll track him on foot.

612
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,550
He'll try to meet with
the hammerheads.

613
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,310
Billy said it was going
to happen that way.

614
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,190
We'll find the rest.

615
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,950
Well, I hope so.

616
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,670
Jared, can you hear me?

617
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,470
Welcome to Shang-Loo.

618
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,310
Is julian with you?

619
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,230
No. Why did you turn
against L.A.P.D.?

620
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,190
You believed in them.

621
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,990
Not against L.A.P. D...

622
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,910
Against...

623
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,790
Commissioner Farnsworth.

624
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,910
So he's not the nicest guy
in the whole world...

625
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,790
No. Commissioner Farnsworth
has been replaced.

626
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,750
What do you mean, "replaced"?

627
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,670
I just saw him down in Baja.

628
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,470
You saw a cyborg duplicate.

629
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,470
He's dead.
Killed a month ago.

630
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:31,110
The cyborg was retro-cloned
into a perfect,

631
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:33,190
cell-for-cell duplicate
of Farnsworth.

632
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,990
Impossible to detect
with existing scans.

633
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,750
State of the art.

634
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,550
They intend to replace
humans with cyborgs.

635
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,470
Which humans?

636
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,630
All humans, Alex.

637
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,310
They have to be stopped,
before they start a war

638
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,390
between cyborgs and humankind.

639
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,270
You're a cyborg.

640
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,150
Why don't you side with them?

641
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,910
- They are wrong.
- And that's it?

642
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,790
Isn't that enough?

643
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,710
We've got him in sector six.

644
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,590
- There he is!
- Get him!

645
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,550
Give it up!

646
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,950
Alex!

647
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,870
Fuck you!

648
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,910
- What?
- Not you, Jared.

649
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,390
Come on, I want an
answer out of you!

650
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,550
Where is he?

651
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,350
No, no, no.

652
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,390
Have you seen him?!

653
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,870
Please, don't shoot!

654
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,630
No more, please!

655
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,190
Teach you to fuck with me,

656
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,270
you fucking cyborgs!

657
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,030
Streets aren't safe anymore.

658
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,790
Can't even go to the market

659
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,870
Without meeting some punk.

660
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,590
Shang-Loo takes no shit.

661
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,510
I love this town.

662
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,390
Alex?

663
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,310
I stole data on labs
doing the cloning,

664
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,230
and who's been duplicated so far.

665
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,030
The Hammerheads can destroy
labs and duplicates.

666
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,950
The cyborgs sent you, Alex.

667
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,870
You were their only chance
to locate me.

668
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,630
They planted that dermo-bomb
in you,

669
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,510
Hoping you'd get close
enough to me

670
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,430
to take us both out.

671
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,390
But Julian planted
the jammer in you.

672
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,310
Farnsworth techs are
working now to decode it.

673
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,190
There isn't much time left...

674
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,110
For either of us.

675
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,950
Jared, who's the leader
Of the Hammerheads?

676
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,870
I don't know.

677
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,510
You know, I don't know why
I'm helping you, Jared.

678
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,430
Because you know what's right...

679
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,510
And what's wrong,

680
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,430
and you care.

681
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,110
Yeah.

682
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,870
For what it's worth, Alex...

683
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,710
I loved you.

684
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,630
Yeah, terrific.
Cyborg love.

685
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,310
It takes more than
flesh and blood

686
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,230
to be human, Alex.

687
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,270
I'll talk to you later,
Jared.

688
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,150
Go on, I'll cover you.

689
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,990
Move!
Let's go!

690
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,830
I'm coming to get you, Alex.

691
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,390
Shit, another 5%.

692
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,150
Hold on, Jared,
I'll get you to the volcano.

693
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,150
Heads up!

694
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:03,390
You are a very energetic human.

695
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,350
Follow me.

696
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,070
Oh, fuck!

697
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,990
Fuck!

698
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,910
Who is that girl?

699
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,710
Only three lights left.
Shit.

700
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,550
Running out of time, huh?

701
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,270
Goddamn L.A.P.D. assholes!

702
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,990
The governor of Java,
he gives them permission

703
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,070
to come here, and fugitive hunt,

704
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,990
and then they think they can
blow the whole fucking place up!

705
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,670
I saw you leave your room.

706
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,750
Through the floor,
that's very slick.

707
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,590
Who the fuck are you?

708
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:25,470
Max Impact.

709
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,390
Local guide.

710
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,190
For the tourists, eh?

711
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,110
Angie-san told me about you.

712
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,030
He gave me your contract
of service.

713
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,070
Does it really look like I'm
a tourist to you?

714
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,790
Well, I've got to admit,

715
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,710
the hotel deal threw me a little.

716
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,750
Pretty radical escape, though.

717
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,550
No matter what your business
is in Shang-Loo,

718
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,470
you gonna need a guide, eh?

719
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,270
I'm your girl.

720
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,270
Please, Alex-san, come on.

721
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,230
I really need the job.

722
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,990
And you need my help too, no?

723
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,870
Looks pretty busy in
Shang-Loo right now.

724
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,790
Please, Alex-san, come on.

725
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,590
You don't even have to tip me,

726
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,550
or pay me the bump for
illegal acts, eh?

727
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,470
You can even scan me
if you'd like.

728
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,550
See if i'm telling you
the truth, huh?

729
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,270
Sorry, Alex-san,

730
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,190
But the big boss wanted to see you.

731
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,110
And we know you not come,

732
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,030
unless invited special-like, eh?

733
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:18,510
Thought you were going
to leave me alone, Angie?

734
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:22,430
Cyborgs really fuck things up,
yeah?

735
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,910
Specially when they turn renegade

736
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,030
and no tell nobody.

737
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,670
So you know about Farnsworth?

738
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,750
Like i told you, Alex-san...

739
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,630
it's the information age,
brother.

740
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:47,270
Relax, Alex.

741
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,070
If I, like, steal
the disk from you,

742
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,710
you never wake up, bro'.

743
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,350
Take it as a sign of good faith.

744
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,310
Good faith on what, Angie?

745
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,830
I want you to help me.

746
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,430
Your reputation as a hitter

747
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:35,350
is quite renowned in the community.

748
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,950
You have systems access
like nobody else.

749
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,790
Who needs someone like you?

750
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,670
The Hammerheads, huh?

751
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,550
Yes.

752
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,430
The last of them, Alex-san.

753
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,390
I need your help With the cyborgs.

754
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,350
They're replacing the humans
and we can't tell

755
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,190
who's real and who's not.

756
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,110
How can you trust him, Angie-san?

757
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,110
He should die for what he's done!

758
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,510
Max is right, Alex-san.

759
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,110
You've done many terrible things.

760
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,190
You killed her sister.

761
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:33,670
Baja.
Last year.

762
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,550
I thought I was enforcing the law.

763
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,270
And what do you think now?

764
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,110
Bomb!

765
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,150
Get down, bro'!

766
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,670
No die on me!

767
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:06,310
Come on, cowboy,
Angie-san needs help.

768
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,270
I thought you wanted me dead.

769
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,350
Later! Right now, I need
you make others dead.

770
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,510
Let's have that disk, Angie-san.

771
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,310
No!

772
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:41,910
Ah.

773
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,670
You're the last of them,
Angie-san.

774
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,710
No more Hammerhead bosses.

775
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,390
I want you to die
knowing you've lost.

776
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,470
It's over for the humans.

777
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,230
Someone will come and replace me.

778
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,350
There is no one else.

779
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,230
I'll finish it right here and now.

780
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,910
Fuck you.

781
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,350
Ja, doc...

782
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,230
I love to watch you work.

783
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,990
Thanks a lot.

784
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,230
It's over, Max, we've won.

785
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,070
We've won, Max.

786
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,950
Not finished!

787
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,830
Nothing finished!

788
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,790
Angie trusted me.

789
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,630
He was old and tired.
He was scared.

790
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,470
The whole thing's gotten so big.

791
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,950
There's another cyborg
runnin' the real deal.

792
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:40,670
Angie didn't know who,

793
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,670
or how big the operation really is.

794
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,430
He'd think he needs someone
like you to take them out, huh?

795
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,470
And you don't?

796
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,150
You killed my sister,

797
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,030
motherfucker!

798
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,070
If you want to kill me,
just do it.

799
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,950
You need me, Max.

800
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,030
I have to meet Yoshiro
at the volcano now.

801
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,870
Let's go and visit the volcano now.

802
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,630
Come on!
Come on, Max, let's go!

803
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,430
The fucking humans.

804
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,830
Fuck!

805
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,790
Give me your hand.

806
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,910
Argh!

807
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,350
What's going on, brother?

808
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,230
Nothing, Max, nothing.

809
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,150
Come on, let's go.

810
01:14:58,670 --> 01:14:59,790
I picked up their trail,
commissioner.

811
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,590
Subgroups three and four

812
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,510
engage primary target on
east/west coordinates.

813
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,430
They've got to be around here
somewhere. In pursuit.

814
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,310
Commissioner,

815
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:15,190
team eight has lock on
primary target.

816
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,070
I think I've got him.
It won't be long now.

817
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:26,550
Oof!

818
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,190
Team eight, report!

819
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,190
Aaah!

820
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,310
My, we've got a lot of energy
today, don't we, Alex?

821
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:45,070
What happened to our
speed-loading junkie?

822
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,150
We're not the bad guys, Alex.

823
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:50,070
We just want what's right.

824
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,950
The humans treat us like things.

825
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,910
They fail to understand
that we think,

826
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,710
feel, care...

827
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,590
It's not our fault we're alive.

828
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:02,470
I don't understand why
you would help them.

829
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:04,510
In time, the humans will
destroy themselves,

830
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,470
and this precious earth.

831
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:09,070
They have no appreciation
of what we have.

832
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,950
You're really more like us, Alex.

833
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,830
More machine than human.

834
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:16,750
Join us.

835
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,830
Never.

836
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,230
Come on.

837
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:56,070
State of the fucking art, Alex!

838
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,750
The weapon!

839
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,910
Get in, Max!
Come on!

840
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,550
Cargo bay!

841
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,590
What was that?

842
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,470
l... I don't know!

843
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,150
State of the art, Alex!

844
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,430
Give it up, Alex.

845
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,070
You're not human.
You're one of us.

846
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,550
- Give me Jared.
- Fuck you!

847
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,230
Alex, you can't win!

848
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:59,350
Jared belongs to us.

849
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,310
Hold on, Max!

850
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,910
You belong to us.

851
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,710
We own you.

852
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,830
We paid for every part of you.

853
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:14,750
Then take it!
It's yours anyway!

854
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,190
No-oo!

855
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,390
All right, this shouldn't
take long.

856
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,230
Okay...

857
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,950
Here we go.

858
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,990
Alex, are you there?

859
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,910
I'm right here, Jared.

860
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:57,790
So...

861
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,710
you pulled it off.

862
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,550
Even got rid of the
bomb in my heart.

863
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:06,350
Excuse me? We don't have
much time for the download.

864
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:09,350
When I'm downloaded,

865
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:12,110
I'll lose my memory,

866
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:14,030
all my programming...

867
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:15,150
Everything?

868
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,030
You'll only exist as pure data.

869
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,830
I will be dead?

870
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,750
In a sense that's correct. But...

871
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:24,670
Not like a human.

872
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:27,470
- Alex?
- Yes, Jared?

873
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,150
Before I go...

874
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:34,990
Farnsworth asked me to tell you,

875
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:37,910
he left a letter.
It's at your old drop.

876
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,790
Are you crying, Alex?

877
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:52,550
You see?

878
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,270
You can care.

879
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:02,030
Goodbye, Alex.

880
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,910
Get me the hell out of here.

881
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,510
It is over for me,

882
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:18,230
but the struggle goes on to
preserve the human impulse.

883
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:20,230
Alex knows what has to be done.

884
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,270
And he's the one to do it.

885
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:24,110
I did my part.

886
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,030
He is back.

887
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,710
Now, there is hope.

888
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:40,350
Having a bad day, Germaine?

889
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,670
It's not over, Alex.

890
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:54,670
There are many more of us.

891
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:55,830
More than you can terminate.

892
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:59,550
But I've been doing a pretty
damn good job of it.

893
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:02,310
Haven't I, Germaine?

894
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,430
I don't believe this.

895
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,350
Amazing what a tech retard can do,

896
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,270
when he really puts
his mind to it.

897
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,030
And that's what I've done.

898
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,950
- I put my mind to it.
- Let me go...

899
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:17,790
And I'll tell you what you need
to knoW to find two more.

900
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:21,510
I don't think you have
anything I want to know.

901
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:23,550
Alex, please.

902
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:26,470
You know, you were right
about my dirty deals.

903
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:31,070
Wh-what deals?

904
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:32,230
People die, Germaine.

905
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,550
You see, Germaine,

906
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,590
When I pull it, I use it.

907
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,990
"Alex,

908
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:58,870
by the time you read this,
most likely I will be dead.

909
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,790
If you are reading this,

910
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,790
You know about the
cyborg conspiracy

911
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:04,750
that has somehow
grown up around us.

912
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,590
Jared and I have worked it out
to stop what we know of it.

913
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,470
But to really end
this terrible thing,

914
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:13,430
you need someone quite remarkable.

915
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,310
It needs you, Alex.

916
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:18,990
I haven't been kind in
my handling of you,

917
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,150
but it's not a kind world, is it?

918
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:24,790
Some of us just aren't
meant to lead happy lives."

919
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,430
Ready, Alex-san?

920
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:46,910
Yeah, I'm ready now, Max.

921
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,990
So, where are we gonna start, eh?

922
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:50,950
At the beginning.

923
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:54,750
Well, then that means
we're going to New York.

924
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,430
Tell me something, Alex-san...

925
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,550
How are we going to get you through

926
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:02,190
the airport metal detectors?

927
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,190
Piece by piece, Max.

928
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,870
It's a crazy time we live
in, huh, Alex-san?
