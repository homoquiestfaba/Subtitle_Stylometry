Mama, Duh.

1069
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:25,344
Tape: Hello.
How Are You, My Friend?

1070
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:30,317
Second Voice: Yo, Yo.
We're Scruga-Lugga,
Homey.

1071
00:41:32,817 --> 00:41:35,220
What's Up, Y'all?
What We Waiting For?

1072
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:38,090
You're Supposed
To Drive.

1073
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,626
It's Your Mission
Assignment.

1074
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:41,360
Duh.

1075
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,729
Me? You Want Me To Drive?

1076
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:44,797
You Never Let Me Drive.

1077
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:48,067
Is This Some Kind Of Joke?
Where's The Hidden Camera?

1078
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,770
I Would Never Joke
About The Mission.

1079
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:53,172
Ha Ha. Ok.
Thank You, Daddy.

1080
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:56,308
I'm A Really Good Driver.
You'll See. [Giggles]

1081
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:59,112
All Right,
Adjust The Mirror.

1082
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:01,047
Hands At 10:00 And 2:00.

1083
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,782
And Ease Away From The Curb.

1084
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:05,018
Oops!

1085
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,721
Sorry. My Bad.

1086
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:13,358
And I Was Like,
Hey, The Secret Formula
Stays On My 50,

1087
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:15,794
And He Was All, Like,
Give Me The Formula.

1088
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,264
And I Was, Like, No Can Do.
And He Was, Like,

1089
00:42:18,297 --> 00:42:20,266
Well, Bring Out
The Clones.
I Was, Like,

1090
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:22,268
Clones?! Whatcha Talkin'
About, Clones?

1091
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,237
Wham! Bam!
Out Step The Clones.

1092
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,003
Look Just Like Us.

1093
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:27,240
Except For Mama.
Even More Hideous.

1094
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:27,874
Twice The--

1095
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:29,776
Stop Talking Nonsense,
Boy.

1096
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,176
I'm Telling You It's True!

1097
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,845
We Gotta Get Out
Of This Place!

1098
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:36,716
Hey! Penny!
Rise And Shine, Sweetie.

1099
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,183
Vacation's Over.

1100
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:39,819
Aah! Where'd She Go?

1101
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:43,088
Ah. Ah. Ah. Uh. Uh.
Ok, Listen.

1102
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:47,393
No Time To Pack.
I'll Get Us Out Of Here
And Find Penny.

1103
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,765
Ok. Now It's Time To Panic.

1104
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:57,069
Help Us! Help!

1105
00:42:57,302 --> 00:43:00,706
If You Want To Survive,
You Must Come With Me.

1106
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:02,442
Immediately.

1107
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:10,083
What?

1108
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:12,217
Everyone Is Gone!

1109
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,119
Must Alert Dr. Carver.

1110
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:16,021
Penny! There You Are.

1111
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,123
Oh, Penny!

1112
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:21,293
Hmm? Have You Been
Eating Peanut Butter
Or Something?

1113
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:25,098
We Must Hurry. We've Got
To Get To The Other Side
Of The Island.

1114
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,734
There Is Only One Person
Who Can Help You Now.

1115
00:43:28,768 --> 00:43:30,369
Is This A New Part
Of The Mission?

1116
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,405
Uh, Yeah. We're On A Mission
To Save Our Necks.

1117
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:34,239
Now Let's Move!

1118
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:35,742
Penny, I Need You
To Carry The Twins,

1119
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:37,744
And Don't Give Me No Lip.

1120
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:42,449
[Twins Giggle]

1121
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,085
Now, That's More
Like It.

1122
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:48,487
It's About Time
That Girl Started
Listening To Me.

1123
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,288
Ah.

1124
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:53,293
Quickly. We Are Almost
To The Summit.

1125
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,429
Oscar?

1126
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:57,396
Whoa! Oh.

1127
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,298
Oscar, Don't Panic.

1128
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:02,468
Ok. I Told You, Trudy,
I Don't Like Heights.

1129
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,070
Whoo! Aah!
Look Out There!

1130
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,838
It's Not So Bad,
Son.

1131
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:08,774
Unless You
Look Down.

1132
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:10,143
Ha Ha Ha.

1133
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:13,011
Aah! That's Not Funny,
Mama.

1134
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:15,048
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

1135
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:19,117
Penny, Be Careful
With The Twins Now.

1136
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,520
That's Affirmative,
Mother.

1137
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:26,059
Penny! Look Out!

1138
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:26,059
Penny! Look Out!

1139
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,261
Wii-Yii!

1140
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,462

Just See...

00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,869
1433. Ok, We're Here.

1143
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:39,838
Your Monetarial
Compensation, Sir.

1144
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:41,339
You May Retain
The Balance.

1146
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:45,111
Thanks!

1147
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:53,052

[Giggling]

1149
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:10,136
Hey, Pal.

1150
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:10,136
Hey, Penny.

1151
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,538
What's Up, P.?

1152
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,538
How Was Your Trip?

1153
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,038
Um...Bizarre.

1154
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:19,145
Ever Since This Morning,
My Mom's Been Talking Like
She's Straight-Up Street.

1155
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,146
Man, This Whip
Is Whack, Homey.

1156
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,382
Where's The Secret
Formula, Yo?

1157
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:26,485
And Suga Mama, I Can't
Even Understand Her.

1158
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,054
<I> No Hay Nada En Esta Caja.

1159
00:45:29,087 --> 00:45:30,055
And My Dad's
Been Acting--

1160
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:33,425
Daughter, Would You
Mind Holding
Our Currency?

1161
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,860
Kinda Cool.

1162
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:36,862
Well, I Bet He's
Still Not Cool Enough

1163
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,531
To Let You Come To The
Dance Rehearsal Tomorrow.

1164
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:41,534
Whatever, Lacienega.

1165
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:42,534
I Feel You, Girl.

1166
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,236
But As Spare Change
Dancers,

1167
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,172
Got Some Pre-Rehearsal
Shopping To Do.

1168
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,842
He-Ey!

1169
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,842
He-Ey!

1170
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:52,277
What Is It,
Daughter?

1171
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:53,546
Come On, Dad.
Don't Rub It In.

1172
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,649
You Know I'm
The Only One Who Can't Go
To The Dance Rehearsals.

1173
00:45:56,681 --> 00:46:01,520
Do You Think Your
Attendance Will Advance
Our Primary Mission?

1174
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:05,558
Well, Uh, Yeah, I Think So.

1175
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,592
Most Definitely.

1176
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,628
Then Perhaps You
Should Participate.

1177
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:11,329
For Real?!
Oh, Thank You.

To See What These

Mama! Where'd You
Get Those Peanuts?

I Cleaned Out The Minibar
Before We Left.

I Call It
Making A Move.

Aah. Ooh.

1232

Cashew?

1579
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:41,048
Your Real Family's
Still Back On The Island
Being Held Captive.

1580
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,182
Those People Downstairs
Are Peanut Clones

1581
01:05:43,216 --> 01:05:47,154
Sent Here By The Evil
Dr. Marcus Garvey
Carver...Ii

1582
01:05:47,187 --> 01:05:49,089
To Find Your Father's
Secret Formula

1583
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:51,091
So They Can
Take Over The World.

1584
01:05:51,123 --> 01:05:53,459
Hey! Is This Cashmere?

1585
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:55,228
Cashew--Focus!

1586
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:59,866
Are You Telling Me
My Family Is A Forgery?

1587
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:02,469
Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1588
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:05,105
Oh, That's Funny!

1589
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:06,273
That's Real Funny.

1590
01:06:06,306 --> 01:06:07,407
Come On,
Let's Go Downstairs

1591
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,243
So I Can Let Everybody
Know You're Here.

1592
01:06:09,275 --> 01:06:11,245
[Penny Giggling]
You Guys Wouldn't Believe

1593
01:06:11,277 --> 01:06:13,112
Who Hitched A Ride
On The Boat.

1594
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:16,216
Cashew! And He's Got
This Ridiculous Idea

1595
01:06:16,248 --> 01:06:18,451
That All Of You Guys
Are Clones!

1596
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:20,486
Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1597
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,288
Hee...

1598
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:24,658
That Is Ridiculous...
Ha Ha...Right?

1599
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:28,395
Deep Voice: Yeah.
That Is Ridiculous.

1600
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:30,163
Who Said That?!

1601
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:31,063
I Did!

1602
01:06:31,096 --> 01:06:32,466
Now Gimme The Necklace

1603
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:34,500
Or I'm Gonna Go
Upside Your Head

1604
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:37,069
With This 10-Pound
Dirty Diaper.

1605
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:38,505
See? I Told Ya.

1606
01:06:38,538 --> 01:06:41,375
Oh...I Get It.

1607
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:43,110
This Is All A Dream.

1608
01:06:43,143 --> 01:06:48,048
Penny Ate A Bad
Hot Dog, And Now Penny's
Imagining Things.

1609
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,284
Penny Needs To
Go Lie Down Now.

1610
01:06:52,185 --> 01:06:53,387
Get Her!

1611
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,289
Aah!

1612
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:56,355
Aah!

1613
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,357
Aah! Bebe! Let Me Go!

1614
01:06:58,391 --> 01:06:59,326
I Got It!

1615
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,027
Hoo Hoo Hah Hah!

1616
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,463
Oh! Gimme Back
My Necklace,
You Fake Bebe!

1617
01:07:04,496 --> 01:07:07,400
Come On, Cece.
We Gotta Go!

1618
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:11,270
Take Us Home!
Hoo Hoo Hah Hah Hah!

1619
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:13,239
Mission Accomplished!

1620
01:07:13,272 --> 01:07:14,707
Good-Bye. See You, Baby.

1621
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:15,641
We Got It!

1622
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:18,277
Come On, Cashew.
I've Gotta Save
My Family.

1623
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:21,381
And You're Gonna
Help Me.

1624
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:38,231
Let's Do This.

1625
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,000
Good News! Your Clones

1626
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:42,501
Have Located
The Secret Formula.

1627
01:07:42,534 --> 01:07:46,006
They're Returning
To The Island At Any Minute...

1628
01:07:46,038 --> 01:07:49,109
Just In Time
To See Your Demise.

1629
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:50,344
How Could You
Do This?

1630
01:07:50,377 --> 01:07:52,312
What About The Other
Night In The Hot Tub?

1631
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,080
Didn't That Mean
Anything To You?

1632
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:56,382
[Groans] Ehh! Mama!
You And Carver?

1633
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:59,486
We Was In The Hot Tub
Together. What You
Got To Do With It?

1634
01:07:59,518 --> 01:08:02,723
And He Gonna Be
Your Step-Daddy.
How You Like That?

1635
01:08:02,756 --> 01:08:05,259
That's Just
Straight-Up Nasty!

1636
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,995
And Then I Said,
"That's Ridiculous, Right?"

1637
01:08:08,027 --> 01:08:09,428
And Then They Said,
"No More Games."

1638
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:11,398
Then I Said,
"Penny's Dreaming!"

1639
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:12,499
And Then They Said,
"Get Her!"

1640
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:13,799
And Then They Took
My Necklace,

1641
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:17,203
And Then They Got Into
A Helicopter And Took Off
For The Island!

1642
01:08:17,237 --> 01:08:20,406
Proud, That's The Whackiest
Story I've Ever Heard!

1643
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,176
Hee Hee. People
Made From Peanuts?

1644
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:25,446
[Laughter]

1645
01:08:27,713 --> 01:08:29,415
How Do?

1646
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:30,784
Aah!

1647
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:30,784
Aah!

1648
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:30,784
Aah!

1649
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,685
So You Believe Me
Now?

1650
01:08:32,718 --> 01:08:34,154
[Silence]

1651
01:08:34,186 --> 01:08:36,390
Aw, He's Actually
Kinda Cute.

1652
01:08:36,423 --> 01:08:38,458
I Could Just Dip Ya
In Some Chocolate

1653
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,261
And Eat You Right Up,
You So Cute!

1654
01:08:41,293 --> 01:08:44,530
Look, Y'all, I've Gotta
Get Back To That Island

1655
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:46,098
And Save My Family!

1656
01:08:46,132 --> 01:08:49,069
Well, If You Goin',
We Goin', Too.

1657
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:50,403
You Guys
Would Do That For Me?

1658
01:08:50,436 --> 01:08:52,506
We're Your Best
Friends, Penny.

1659
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:55,175
That Means
We're Like Family!

1660
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,277
So If<I> Your Family
Is In Trouble,

1661
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:01,414
Then Doggone It,<I>
Our Family
Is In Trouble!

1662
01:09:01,448 --> 01:09:03,249
Can I Get An Amen?

1663
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:05,118
Such A Dork.

1664
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,454
Oh, Thanks, Guys!

1665
01:09:07,486 --> 01:09:10,123
Now, If We Only
Knew Someone

1666
01:09:10,155 --> 01:09:12,691
With A Really
Fast Boat...

1667
01:09:12,725 --> 01:09:14,794
Hold It! Nuh-Uh!
No Way!

1668
01:09:14,828 --> 01:09:17,397
I Am Not Doin'
That!

1669
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,301
Ah! Don't Touch<I>
Anything!

1670
01:09:22,334 --> 01:09:24,303
If 15 Finds Out
I Stole His Yatch,

1671
01:09:24,337 --> 01:09:26,138
I'll Be Kicked Outta
His Entourage.

1672
01:09:26,172 --> 01:09:28,808
Sticky,
It's Pronounced Yacht.

1673
01:09:28,842 --> 01:09:31,545
Yetch, Yacht--
They Both Boats, Ok, Girl?

1674
01:09:31,578 --> 01:09:32,779
All Hands On Deck!

1675
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:35,815
Operation Family
Liberation Is A Go.

1676
01:09:35,848 --> 01:09:38,150
Uh...You're Not Going
Anywhere, Proud.

1677
01:09:38,183 --> 01:09:40,486
Nubia, I Don't Have Time
To Trip With You
Right Now.

1678
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,257
I Don't Care.
15 Cent Paid Us
To Guard His Boat.

1679
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:47,393
So If You Want It...
You Gotta Match His Offer.

1680
01:09:47,427 --> 01:09:48,829
Cough Up The Cabbage.

1681
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:52,132
Fine. You Want My Money,
Go Ahead And Take It.

1682
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:54,700
It's In My Backpack.

1683
01:09:58,437 --> 01:09:59,271
How Do?

1684
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:00,507
Aah!

1685
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:00,507
Aah!

1686
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:00,507
Aah!

1687
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:01,707
[Splash]

1688
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,444
Punch It, Proud!

1689
01:10:06,311 --> 01:10:08,515
Bye, Nubia!

1690
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:12,718
It's On Now!

1691
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,823
And Now The Time
Has Come

1692
01:10:16,856 --> 01:10:19,526
To Reveal My Crowning
Achievement--

1693
01:10:19,558 --> 01:10:22,195
My Masterpieces!

1694
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:24,530
It Can't Be!
Are Those...

1695
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:26,432
Genetically Engineered
Supergenomes.

1696
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:28,468
Genetically Engineered
Supergenomes?

1697
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,636
But I Abandoned
My Research

1698
01:10:29,668 --> 01:10:33,272
On The Agriculturally
Engineered Supersoliders
Years Ago.

1699
01:10:33,306 --> 01:10:35,342
I Could Never Get Them
To Stabilize.

1700
01:10:35,374 --> 01:10:37,877
Neither Could I.
But If My Hunch Is Correct,

1701
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,448
Oscar Proud's Everlasting
Multiplying Formula

1702
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:45,152
Will Certainly Change That.

1703
01:10:45,485 --> 01:10:47,353
Peanuts.

1704
01:11:03,335 --> 01:11:06,173
Hee Hee Hee Ha Ha Ha Ha.

1705
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:10,610
They've Multiplied...

1706
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:14,180
They've Stabilized...
Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee!

1707
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:15,414
I'm An Evil Genius!

1708
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:18,884
No One Will Ever Mock
The Accomplishments
Of A Peanut Again!

1709
01:11:18,918 --> 01:11:20,719
I Will Rule The World!

1710
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:22,956
