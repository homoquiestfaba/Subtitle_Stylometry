1
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,324
Coming.

2
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,606
I don't want to.

3
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,529
What's up?

4
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,206
Yes?

5
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,367
Isidora, what's going on?
- Nothing.

6
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,083
What do you mean?

7
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,770
You just said something very strange.

8
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,681
Something very strange?
I was dreaming.

9
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,490
Those cats...

10
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,122
Go see to them.
-I'm on my way. They'll have to wait.

11
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,968
Will it be that Dominga has died?

12
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,122
Pick up.

13
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,121
<i> Enrique, is my mother there? </ I>

14
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,841
<i> Hello?
- Good morning. </ I>

15
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,207
Is mom there?
- Yes.

16
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,567
Is she dead?
- Worse.

17
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,085
Your daughter.

18
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,051
<i> Hello?
-Hi, Mom. What's up? </ I>

19
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,966
Nothing much. We're just waking up.
We're so lazy.

20
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,009
<i> Yes.
- How're you? </ I>

21
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,845
<i>Fine, I just got back from Peru. </ I>

22
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,128
<i> How was it?
- Great. </ i>

23
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,683
Shall I drop by to show some pictures
and tell you how it went? </ I>

24
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,844
Today?
- Yes, Mom. Today.

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,766
You caught off guard me a bit.
<i>- Mama, don't whine. </i>

26
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,881
<i>We haven't seen each other in a while.
I'll come at six o'clock with a surprise.</i>

27
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,490
<i> Rosario, I do not like surprises.
- I'll come at six. </ I>

28
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,964
<i>If you put on tea and buy some sweets,
it'll be very cozy.</i>

29
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,327
Okay.
<i>- Greetings to Enrique. </ i>

30
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,644
Greetings from Rosario.

31
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,406
She's bringing a surprise?
Sounds scary.

32
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,408
You know what she wants now...

33
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,931
Well, she's been traveling.
Maybe she just missed you.

34
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,005
Come on, Enrique.
You know she always needs something.

35
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,927
Yes, yes, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

36
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,848
Come here.

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,810
Come.
Liban, come here.

38
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,729
Crazy cat.

39
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,888
First you meow and now...

40
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,205
Isi.

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
You forgot to buy cat food.

42
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,124
Spoiled brat.

43
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,366
Poor things, they're starving.

44
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,323
I'm going to buy them food.

45
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,328
What should I serve for tea?
- Doesn't matter.

46
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,367
Don't spend too much.

47
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,644
I'll be right back.

48
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,847
That thing's broken again.

49
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,202
What do we need?

50
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,770
Cheese, bread...

51
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,487
... Avocado. I don't know.

52
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,325
Is Rosario Coming alone or is she bringing Hugo?
-I hope not.

53
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,926
And please don't call her Hugo.

54
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,768
Did you take your pills?

55
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,561
No.

56
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,087
Isi, it's not you. It's your hips.
You can't use the stairs anymore.

57
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,244
Call Miguelito, ask when they're fixing the elevator.
Scold him for me.

58
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,047
Wasn't Virgina going to drop by today
and bring something?

59
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,886
Tell her not to come.
She's really old.

60
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,883
I'll be right back.

61
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,243
Don't forget the cat, Enrique.

62
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,082
Enrique, the cat food.

63
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,961
Miguelito, this is Mrs. lsidora.

64
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,164
What's wrong with the elevator?

65
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,165
When? Tell me a date.
You have me shut in here.

66
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,644
Virginia, you should not come.

67
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,724
The elevator is broken again.

68
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,448
The elevator.

69
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,729
They'll let me know.

70
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,805
No, that's okay.
Just bring it another time.

71
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,921
The elevator, my dear.

72
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,403
Fine. Bye-bye.

73
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,003
No, that can't be.

74
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,405
No, that's not it.

75
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,967
No, it's dangerous.

76
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,051
It's not that, it's dangerous.

77
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,809
I already told her.
I do not need to repeat it.

78
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,566
Do I have to say everything twice then?

79
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,130
Tell her yourself.

80
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,444
Soledad knows exactly. These two
never understand anything. They know nothing.

81
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,523
I forgot the ham.

82
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,841
What's going on?
-I was confused.

83
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,728
I was confused. Everything is flooded.
There's water everywhere.

84
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,484
Look, look.-

85
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,845
It's flooded. I don't know how long it took.
Look anyway.

86
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,684
Calm down, Isi.

87
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,330
Look.

88
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,561
I don't know what I was thinking.
I don't know how long it was.

89
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,008
I don't know...
Enrique, where are you going?

90
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,483
Could we have forgotten a pill?
- No. I don't know.

91
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,369
Don't be like that.
This isn't the first time.

92
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,530
But this time it was worse.

93
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,042
I heard voices. I heard Sole.

94
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,681
I'll call your daughter, she shouldn't come.
- Don't. Don't tell her.

95
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,845
I won't say a thing.
You had an appointment. Nothing more.

96
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,050
If you call, she will suspect something.
- Then call her yourself.

97
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,967
I'll tell her I was going to
have tea with my friends.

98
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,087
Good.

99
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,243
She's not answering.
- Try again.

100
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,524
She won't answer now that I'm like this.

101
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,090
She'll still come.
- Keep trying till she picks up.

102
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,804
But if she comes...

103
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,809
I'll be here.

104
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,684
I won't leave you alone for a even a moment.

105
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,251
Besides, how long can they stay?
Two hours?

106
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,121
Can you bear two hours?

107
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,085
How should I know?

108
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,887
How the...

109
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,245
That's a whole day's work lost.

110
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,921
Lock up the pigs, please!

111
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,050
The cats, Enrique.
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

112
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,570
Mama!

113
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,730
Do not let them escape.

114
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,801
It's okay, Rosario.
- Are they locked up?

115
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,645
Are they gone?
- Yes, woman.

116
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,442
I'm allergic. It's not a joke,
open the windows please.

117
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,080
The windows, yes.

118
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,450
A breath of air with those cats around
and I have an immediate allergic reaction.

119
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,925
Jesus. And I also had to go up eight flights of stairs
stairs because the goddamn elevator's broken.

120
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,802
You can't go on living here, Mom.
This house will collapse from sadness.

121
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,323
Hello, Enrique.
How are the books? How's everything?

122
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,802
Oh, fine. I've just had
computer problems, is all.

123
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,281
I have already told her that I'll buy
another.

124
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,844
Until it loads, it's just fucked up (pun).

125
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,924
Did you come by yourself?
- Yes.

126
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
By myself.

127
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,689
Look at the gorgeous tea you put together, Mama.

128
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,164
Avocado and all these delicious cakes.
- It's only a tea.

129
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,685
Calm down.

130
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,525
You're almost hyperventilating.
- Yes.

131
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,606
I'm exhausted.

132
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,082
I swear, Peru kills me!

133
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,848
Beautiful skies, wonderful people,
humble...

134
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,846
... But amazing. The food is cheap.
We gorged ourselves.

135
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,050
We have thousands and thousands of photos.
I'll show you.

136
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,683
Look, this is a group of backpackers who
traveled with us for three days.

137
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,446
Can I get youa drink
or are we waiting for anyone?

138
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,170
Yes, Hugo's coming.

139
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,006
That's not a problem, right?

140
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,491
Of course she's welcome, but at what time?
Because we should save her something.

141
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,204
Or should we just hold off entirely till she arrives?
- No, she's coming.

142
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,283
You look at the photos, Mom.

143
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,365
This is an Indian, our guide.
A beautiful Indian, a real one.

144
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,321
I'll go to the bathroom. You'll just die when
you see my surprise, you'll love it.
Really.

145
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,640
What is the surprise?
- It's coming any minute.

146
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,771
What delicious juice!
What a treat.

147
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,403
You going to die when you see the surprise.

148
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,642
Isn't it crazy?

149
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,884
Look what I found.

150
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,368
Mama, Smell this.

151
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,764
Smell this one, Enrique.
It smells like newly cut grass.

152
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,400
How nice this is...
- No! It's not that it's nice...

153
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,928
... But it's 100 percent natural
and it has a medicinal effect.

154
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,166
That sounds wonderful, but I imagine that I
would have to buy one to see the effects.

155
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,281
No, Mom. It's a gift.

156
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,442
Choose one out of all of them.
You may also choose one, Enrique.

157
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,963
This is good for your skin, like a
scrub, but it doesn't scratch.

158
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,771
They make it from something strainge,
I don't know.

159
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,290
Let's see. "The clay takes the dirt
and impurities stored in the pores...

160
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,887
... Helps to remove dead skin cells and works
rejuvenating. "

161
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,284
Enrique, for you. This restores the damaged skin.
Like for that spot in your ear.

162
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,685
It's very professional.
Everything has been researched. I read the leaflet.

163
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,366
I'll show you later, but look at the photos.
Listen.

164
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,321
"Wholesome soaps. "
Are no ordinary soaps.

165
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,727
"The healing bars of soap from Machu Picchu
are traditionally made...

166
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,362
... So the oils and animal fats
saponify... '

167
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,844
Blah blah blah. Never mind. The point is that this is
something that does not exist in Chile.

168
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,561
I found this.
Mom, are you there?

169
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,324
Are you still there, Mom?
-Isi, Which one do you like?

170
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,768
I think I like this this one, it's very--
- No, no, don't choose now.

171
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,844
There are 25 different ones.
Hugo's coming with the rest.

172
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,245
Don't call her Hugo. She's a woman,
her name is Beatriz.
- She wants it that way. End of discussion.

173
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,165
Hugo is not a woman's name.
- End of discussion.

174
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,770
I'll go.

175
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,048
It is Virginia.

176
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,210
Virginia, wait.
I'll come open the door for you.

177
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,041
But mom, I thought we were going to
have tea together, just us?

178
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,646
Didn't you tell her about the elevator?

179
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,641
I don't know.
- You're really forgetful.

180
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,009
I called her.
- Did you call her or not?

181
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,730
Oh, be quiet you.

182
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,083
The elevator is out.
- Go home!

183
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,604
You cannot come up,
the elevator is broken.

184
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Go home. Enrique,
you go down and tell her.
-No, no

185
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,683
What? You want me to go down?

186
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,651
Hey, just go.

187
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,843
You're really stubborn.
- What are you talking about?

188
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,291
You can't live in these conditions.
You can't even have visitors
with a that elevator.

189
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,807
If something bad happens-
this neighborhood gets more dangerous every day.

190
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,407
I want to tell you something important.
Why don't we sit down? Do you want some juice?

191
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,487
Mom, I'm really worried about your health.
You must think about your future.

192
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,361
What future, honey?
- Don't talk nonsense.

193
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,760
I have something to ask you.
Listen first, before you say no.

194
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,647
Look, I propose that I've found you an apartment
that's much more comfortable.

195
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,725
On the first floor, with a garden
for the cats, in a quiet neighborhood.

196
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,410
I can help you with things better than Jose Manuel
because he has become quite busy with his family
and other concerns.

197
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,645
But if you want me to help you...
 Mama, look at me.

198
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,121
If you want me to help you,
you must give me the rights to the apartment.

199
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,250
This is not difficult.
It's very simple.

200
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,721
Is this the surprise or the soaps?
- They're both the surprise.

201
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,090
It's very simple.
It's only two pages. Take a look.

202
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,322
Read it. Should I grab your glasses?

203
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,007
I don't have glasses.
- I know. I'm just teasing.

204
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,051
It's a simple power of authorization form
for the notary,

205
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,168
Because Esteban-- Remember Esteban?

206
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,121
He wants to do us a favor,
so we don't have to go through the whole process
and stand in line.

207
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,251
Why don't we wait for Enrique? That'd be better.
- But why?

208
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,088
He's not my father.
He has nothing to do with this.

209
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,924
Yes, but...
- But what?

210
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,368
You can't trust your daughter once in your life?

211
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,202
That poor woman didn't understand a word you said.

212
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,328
Have a juice. You look exhausted.

213
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,047
Do you fighting again?
- No...

214
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,048
Mama is back acting like she does not understand
and I want to help her, but she says...

215
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,448
What is this?
- Is it not clear?

216
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,050
How can you come here with this
without even discussing it with us? No, no, no...

217
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,766
And why not?
This apartment was my father's and so
it should be mine too. I don't know why you
are staying here.

218
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,241
Why are you interfering?
- This is my house.
- That is clear.

219
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,449
Should I wait to intefere until
she goes mad or dies?

220
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,968
You have to help support me and Mom.
- I do that already!

221
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,249
I'm still here, you know.
- I know that too.

222
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,484
That is Virginia again.
- That stupid old bitch.

223
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,446
Wait. I'm coming to get you.

224
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,884
That's Hugo. She has loads of soap
with her.

225
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,523
How do you feel?

226
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,364
Good.

227
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,887
Alert.

228
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,764
That harpy can't make me sign anything.

229
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,766
She thinks I've lost it.
- This is a big hustle. Believe me.

230
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,526
Well, they're already here, right?

231
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,288
Hello, Rosario.
- Hello.

232
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,569
How's my baby?

233
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,371
You've been sniffing. Is there any left?
- Yes, upstairs.

234
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,326
It's eight storeys up
and the elevator is broken.

235
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,849
How do they like the soaps?
- Great. I've told them a lot.

236
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,571
And you have the apartment?

237
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,725
That old fart doesn't trust me
and my mom is stubborn.

238
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,884
I need your help.
I'm not leaving without that signature.

239
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,448
Ugh, these fucking stairs.

240
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,602
So the soaps were nice?
I have many more.

241
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,810
These are for special diseases.

242
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,681
They may have to do with your mood or
or other specific conditions.

243
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,604
See, like I said.

244
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,163
We were like smugglers at the border.
Did we have to pay or what?

245
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,290
That wasn't so bad.
- Your tea is getting cold, Beatriz.

246
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,125
Hugo.
- Sorry.

247
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,963
I try, but I find it difficult.

248
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,204
It's a little weird, right?
- Yes.

249
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,605
Say Hugo, are you still working with that
"Adventure Tourism"?

250
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,969
Yes, I teach skydiving.

251
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,885
What a strange thing.
- No, it's nice, really.

252
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,408
People of all ages do it.
You could also.

253
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,847
Over my dead body.
- No, it's very safe.

254
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,288
If you would like,
we could jump together.

255
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,124
Look at her face!

256
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,686
You all don't want to jump. She is afraid too.

257
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,890
No, it's that the training is difficult
and I'm busy with casting.

258
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,522
Last week a TV station phoned
to see my reel.

259
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,890
I had forgotten you were an actress.

260
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,965
How nice.

261
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,330
Did you take videos of her when you were little?

262
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,280
They should be here somewhere. She was
always an attention hog, this one.

263
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,090
What are you talking about?

264
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,842
Can we see them?
- If we can dig them out of all this stuff.

265
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,641
No, no, what a drag. Why aren't we
discussing what we need to discuss?

266
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,326
And what do we need to discuss?
- With you? Nothing.

267
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,371
I believe they're in the closet.
Would you help me, Beatriz?

268
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,645
- Mama!
Never mind.

269
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,485
Where have I put them?
-It was in the office that I saw them last.

270
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,121
Teresa!
- Enrique, the cats.

271
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,204
Don't put them in the kitchen, that's disgusting.
- What is it?

272
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,442
It's a cat.
- A pig.

273
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,001
Cut it out.
- Not in the kitchen.

274
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,323
It is their home.
You don't get to change everything around here.

275
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,965
Go away, go away, get!

276
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,608
Hey, dummy! Why did you do that?
Jesus, who raised you?

277
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,481
It's just a cat!
Why the obsession with these animals?

278
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,408
It's from a lack of grandchildren.

279
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,051
What did you say?

280
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,521
What?
- Rosario, calm down.

281
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,361
She kicked him?
- No, nothing happened.

282
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,208
Where do I put it down?
- Here.

283
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,844
My little darling.

284
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,841
They don't understand.

285
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,402
They are usually the kings of the house
and now they are trapped.

286
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,202
You should give cats affection every day,
otherwise they think you no longer love them.

287
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,964
Same with Charo.

288
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,048
These are all the videos we have.
- Look.

289
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,760
Are they all of Rosario?
- No, it's everything.

290
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,971
We haven't watched them in a century.
- This could be it.

291
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,530
'Rosario. Do Not erase. "
Let's watch this.

292
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,523
Of course, if you like.

293
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,926
How old are you there?
- Seventeen.

294
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,683
I was great.
The teachers loved me.

295
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,043
You were much thinner.
-I was much younger, really good.

296
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,284
I was good, good, good.

297
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,569
I have already told you.

298
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,250
What is it, Mom?

299
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,611
Who are you talking to?
-Is this all?

300
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,570
It's missing all kinds of information, conditions
... I dunno.

301
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,769
Who drafted this?
- It is an official document.

302
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,165
This doesn't look good. Are
you going to make money from the sale?

303
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,961
Of course, like all real estate brokers.
It's a job.

304
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,329
Don't you get tired of taking money
from your mother?

305
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,771
How many loans have we made you these last few years?
- We? Enrique, please.

306
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,084
What do you want money for this time?
-I don't have to explain anything to you.

307
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,205
Mommy.

308
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,961
Look, the money is not for me.
It's an investment.

309
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,806
In a serious business, a provemen business.
It can not go wrong, do you understand?

310
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,325
Another new company?

311
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,290
This is why I didn't want to tell them.
They always bring me down.

312
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,207
We have done market research.
This is serious.

313
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,570
Like with the tupperware and ceramics?
-I tell you.

314
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,850
I can't believe you.

315
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,444
The soaps.
-No.

316
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,411
They are 'wellness-centric, environmentally-
sustainable bars of soap".
The idea is to export it...

317
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,131
... And then to find a venue to sell them.

318
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,564
We thought...
-Nothing more to say.

319
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,202
How long will you screw around like this?
You're an adult.

320
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,523
It's not screwing around.
-Don't bother. They always treat me like this.

321
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,287
Hugo, listen, we've been through this so many times.

322
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,729
The kindergarten that she wanted to open.
The retreat to study acting.

323
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,805
But she did not study and blew all the money.
Millions of pesos.

324
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,645
Who do you think you are, you old bastard?
I need a break.

325
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,329
Enrique, please.

326
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,446
What do you want?
Why don't you leave me alone?

327
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,405
You're not gonna take any more of that shit
in your mother's house.

328
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,006
Act like an adult.
-Crazy old son of a bitch.

329
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,969
What do you think you know, moron?

330
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,728
Maybe lsidora doesn't realize about your little
trips to the bathroom, but you don't fool me.

331
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,564
Ahh, so you're the clever one...

332
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,164
Shall we let them squabble?

333
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,884
How beautiful.
They must be doing a commercial.

334
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,286
What is it? Is something wrong?

335
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,966
Anything new inside?
-No, they are still going at it.

336
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,285
It's hard for Rosario.
She is a good person underneath it all.

337
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,761
I love her.

338
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,843
What do you two know
about love? Please.

339
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,290
Don't be a vulture.
-So you say, asshole. Living like a parasite
off of my mother.

340
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,171
Pull yourself together and
do something decent with your life.

341
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,042
How long must we be the only ones that buy your
hammocks, your makeup...

342
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,771
And your hideous ceramics.
-Listen, you prick,

343
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,287
When my mom dies, you will have nothing.

344
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,446
I will ensure that there's nothing left
for you but hideous ceramics.

345
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,443
What's going on?
-This jerk.

346
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,490
Tell him.
-Are you crazy?

347
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,530
Enrique, you'd better check on your wife.

348
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,368
What are you doing?
Don't be desperate, okay? Don't cry, don't cry.

349
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,727
Give me a kiss.

350
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,920
Shut the door.

351
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,647
That old bastard stopped me.

352
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,125
A bump?
Hang on.

353
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,244
I need your help.

354
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,367
We must remain calm.
-You should not fight with the old man.

355
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,251
Goddamnit, this is so not gonna work.

356
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,003
My mother is stranger than ever.

357
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,525
The old witch.

358
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,369
Maybe your mom is confused.
-She pretends.

359
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,969
I'm serious. My grandmother
behaved the same way when she was going senile.

360
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,006
Let her have her "incapacitated state".
I won't be taken in by it.

361
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,004
She is hard as stone, cold
and egotistical. Even now.

362
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,002
She never loved me.

363
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,724
That much is clear.

364
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,369
How are you?

365
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,762
It's Jose Manuel.
-Now?

366
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,442
They're going to  tell him.
Enrique is going to tell him.

367
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,769
I'm going.
-No, I'm going. You stay here.

368
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,683
Hide. Wait.

369
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,005
Okay.

370
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,005
Quiet .
-If you go outside, shut the door.

371
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,844
Relax a little.

372
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,168
Hello, Manuel. How are you?

373
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,402
What is it, little sister? I stop by my mother's house
for a second and I end up in the middle of a fight.

374
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,724
How long will this go on, honestly?
I mean it, this goes for both of you.

375
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,248
How long?
-Did they ask you to come?

376
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,290
No. Vale needed a book.

377
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,331
Valentina, what are you doing hiding in the corner?
-Hi, how are you?

378
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,644
Hello, everyone.

379
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,201
I'm mad at you.
-Why?

380
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,966
Why? You disappered for quite a while.

381
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,011
You didn't come to my ceramics studio,
you never returned my calls, nothing.

382
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,290
I know, but I'm so busy.
I have exams, I have so much to do.

383
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,488
I have to read a lot. Look.

384
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,440
Yes, but don't leave me
in the lurch. Are we still friends?

385
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,044
Listen, soon we must go shopping,
just us two, okay?

386
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,805
Good. You have my number, right?
-And you have, mine, huh?

387
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,329
Or have you deleted it?
-No, I still have it.

388
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,210
Honey, we gotta go.
-Yes.

389
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,048
Bye, Grandma.
- Why don't you stay for tea?

390
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,841
No, we have to arrange something
for Vale.

391
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,925
You should take a look at the document here.
-It's two pages, Jose Manuel.

392
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,369
That's enough, Mom. Don't
worry, it's not important.

393
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,646
Rosario, this is my house.
You provoked all of this.

394
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,201
Manuelito has a right to know.
-What?

395
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,648
What should he know?
-Hold the hell on with the bickering.

396
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,649
Let's see. Sit down.

397
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,165
Be careful of my soaps.
-Rosario, please.

398
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,845
Give me your hand, Mom.

399
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,322
Just one time, forgive each other for
every mistake the other has made.

400
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,007
Please, love each other a little.

401
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,527
How much time do you have left together?

402
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,250
Enjoy it.

403
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,610
It's my fault, but I go crazy
when they treat me like a child, that's all.

404
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,051
Listen.

405
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,448
Grab her hand.

406
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,571
Look at her. She's your daughter.
Look at each other.

407
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,690
Look at each other. Mama.

408
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,287
You see? You can do it.

409
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,761
God's sake. It's so easy.

410
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,409
I gotta go.

411
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,282
See, I know my women.

412
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,129
Listen, the issue of that document
is important.

413
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,090
Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.

414
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,282
Bye, Rosario.
-Bye, Valentine.

415
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,001
Take care.

416
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,644
Sorry about the elevator.
-Bye, Mom.

417
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,767
Why did you call Jose Manuel?
Why do you always think I cheat you?

418
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,486
Why did you let him see the contract?
Trust me!

419
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,803
Trust me .
-Should we start again?

420
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,201
You seem upset.
-Not true.

421
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,002
It's always the same.
I am not an impostor, a thief or a whore.

422
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,130
I just want to help my mother,
Damn.

423
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,051
We already told you, Rosario.

424
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,922
Manuelito was stopping by.
We did not know he was coming.

425
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,045
We will never understand each other.
Its ruining things between us.

426
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,210
Are you going?
-No, she's not going.

427
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,601
I'm going to put the kettle on.

428
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,720
Calm down.

429
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,321
Just calm down.

430
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,810
I'm worn out.

431
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,288
Let's clean up the soaps,
before they all melt.

432
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,202
Enrique, Beatriz...

433
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,930
Yes?
-Hugo, Mom.

434
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,370
Enrique, Hugo...

435
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,045
You should go shopping for a while
and leave us alone.

436
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,407
That's not good.

437
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,401
You know that.

438
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,129
We both need it. Now.

439
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,923
Right, Rosario?

440
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,561
Yes, Mom.

441
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,087
Isidora, what did we agree on? What did we say?

442
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,561
Now, now. It's not so bad.

443
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,331
Go buy some snacks and come back.
-Okay, I just want to grab money.

444
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,527
I already know what you're going to say,
but it's now or never.

445
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,446
Now or Never? How?
You're her mother.

446
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,481
Yes.

447
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,606
This is the worst moment of your life.

448
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,401
I have to take advantage of the few brains
I have left.

449
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,444
Please take this, it's a little reminder.

450
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,364
For if you get lost.

451
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,245
"DON'T SIGN ANYTHING."
-Don't be silly.

452
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,171
Is it silly?
-Okay, let's go.

453
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,086
Listen, don't fight too much with Rosario.

454
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,161
No, no don't worry.

455
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,523
Do you want to try a Turkish sweet? A friend of mine
sells Turkish delicacies.

456
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,446
She is also a dyke.
Do you know what that is, a dyke?

457
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,848
Maybe we should go back.
-What? No, come now.

458
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,970
Let them solve their problems.

459
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,170
Did I mention that my grandmother also made
Turkish delicacies?

460
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,403
You wanted them to leave us alone.

461
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,529
What do you want?
For us to get along?

462
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,722
Does it disgust you when I touch you?
-Rosario, Please.

463
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,009
According to my therapist
I never received affection.

464
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,685
That's not true.

465
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,761
I'm just not a person who shows affection easily.

466
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,488
No, I know.

467
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,165
But Mom...

468
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,801
...Tell me one memory you have with me.

469
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,406
This has nothing to do with that.
-But, Mom...

470
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,122
One memory that us we have together.

471
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,047
Mom, search your mind. Try to remember.
Find one thing.

472
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,490
Anything that can make us laugh.

473
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,161
Something.

474
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,363
When I had you...

475
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,642
... I was- I don't know. I was already old.

476
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,283
I was not ready to have another child.

477
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,003
This could have influenced you...

478
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,761
I recognize that it's been difficult.

479
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,044
That may have affected you.
- Yes, but let's face it

480
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,730
I love you very much, especially now
that you're so vulnerable.

481
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,608
But what I'm trying to say...

482
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,527
Damn.

483
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,247
Why don't you let me help you?

484
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,046
Look.

485
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,647
What do you see here that you don't understand?
I can explain it.

486
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,805
No.
-Mama, it's very simple.
Anyone can understand.

487
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,682
You're not interested in
resolving anything between us.

488
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,367
You only want money.
As always.

489
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,441
For God's sake, Mom.

490
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,570
It's pathetic, you're so transparent.

491
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,041
Just admit that you want money.

492
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
It all comes down to money.

493
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,281
And, why, do you think?

494
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,648
Why, do you think, witch?

495
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,047
You don't love me! You have never loved me!
It's your fault. That's why I take your money.

496
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,523
I'm returning all the love that you gave me,
and damn it, there fucking wasn't any!

497
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,804
Stupid bitch.

498
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,280
What have you done?

499
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,969
What have you done?

500
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,447
Rosario, please.

501
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,605
I couldn't resist.
-Come.

502
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,407
Want some?
-No.

503
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,329
What are you doing here?
-And your mother? Isidora!

504
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,363
What is it? Are you crying?
-She went downstairs.

505
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,807
What? That's impossible.

506
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,291
You didn't see her?
-How could you have let her down those stairs?

507
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,250
How long has she been gone?
We have to find her. Come on.

508
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,849
She can take care of himself. Better than you can.
With me she can't play the victim.

509
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,004
What victim, you idiot? She is sick.
-Sick?

510
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,242
Your mother is sick and elderly.

511
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,247
And you're a grown woman.
When will it finally get through to you?

512
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,001
Shall we go? Come on.

513
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,963
Something happened. What did she say?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

514
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,326
Enrique ...

515
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,280
Honey, your mother's not well.
Listen.

516
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:17,170
You're the only one who knows
where she might be.

517
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,848
Where do you think she went? Think.
Where did you two used to go?

518
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,361
This work is no joke.
It is important for all of us.

519
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,161
You should take it seriously.
Please, I'm serious.

520
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,325
Probably Saturday.

521
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,689
Tell him he's done.

522
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,963
I want to know if you've seen an old woman
with a blond page hairstyle.

523
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,124
Look...

524
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,250
We will find her. She must be close.

525
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,564
Did you get my mobile number?
If something happens, call me.

526
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,688
Do not give up.

527
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,007
Hello?
-Have you found her, Hugo?

528
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,047
No, there is no one here, no one.

529
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:16,364
It's so big.

530
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,365
Where are you?

531
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,770
Well, I'm near the binoculars.

532
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,771
See anything, Hugo?
-Wait, I'm looking.

533
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,531
There are bees.

534
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,849
Who?
-The bees that we saw from the balcony.

535
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,642
There she is. Damn.

536
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,527
Was it her or not?
-I'm not sure.

537
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,211
Do you have a coin?

538
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,921
Rosario?
-No, Enrique.

539
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,800
Where?

540
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,486
Here?

541
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,609
What are you doing, Mom?

542
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,491
What are you doing here? What's wrong with you?

543
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,930
Relax. I'm with you
We're leaving.

544
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,410
Relax, it'll be fine.

545
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,249
Go ahead. Thank you.
Sit.

546
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,886
We have to turn.
Thank you.

547
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,168
Can I have a towel?

548
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,680
Be calm, Mama

549
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,521
Don't worry, mama

550
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,724
Come back. Come back.

551
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,931
Rosario.
-Yes, Mommy. I'm here, Rosario.

552
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,204
Relax.

553
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,206
Calm down. It's my fault
I got you upset.

554
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,249
Forgive me, my child.
-It's okay, Mom.

555
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,368
Let me through.

556
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,888
What happened?
-Nothing, it's okay.

557
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,929
Okay?

558
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,603
I went crazy.

559
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,206
I'm going crazy.
-Nonsense.

560
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,604
That is your age. You're not crazy
- Okay, Mom.

561
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,446
I'm glad you love my daughter.
Thank you, Hugo.

562
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,844
Yes, oh,
It's a little crowded here.

563
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,765
What are you looking at? Come.

564
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,210
Careful.

565
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,285
What were you thinking?
-Will you leave us alone?

566
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,603
How did you get there? What happened?

567
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,603
Calm down, easy now

568
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,127
Very slowly. Very slowly.

569
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,041
Mom, there's nothing to worry about.

570
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,843
Relax.

571
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,451
Yes, baby steps.

572
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,600
You still have seven flights of stairs to climb.

573
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,964
Right, Mom.
-It's fine.

574
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,805
Shall we swap?

575
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,607
Why are you making such a strange noise?

576
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,971
What is going on?

577
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,771
Just pause.

578
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,085
Okay, it's okay.

579
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,322
I have a memory.

580
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,529
I have a memory.

581
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,522
You crossed a river
and the water came up to your waist.

582
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,445
The other children were
on the other side.

583
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,240
You were...

584
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,810
Very small

585
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,651
You followed them

586
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,645
... But they ignored you because you
still very small

587
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,206
And you know what I did?

588
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,842
I let you go
and let you go alone.

589
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,210
And you got to the other side.

590
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,724
You swallowed some water,
but you got to the other side.

591
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,448
I don't remember that, Mom

592
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,202
Come on Isi, you'l catch a cold.
-Give me the shoes.

593
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,486
Come on, Mom.

594
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,571
Careful.

595
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,442
Relax. Lean on us.

596
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,810
Good.

597
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,801
Yes, very.

598
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,842
Very carefully.

599
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,806
I'll sign the document.

600
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,848
Mom, don't talk silly.

601
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,049
You threw it out.
She tore it up and threw it away.

602
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,286
It's true.

603
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,963
Bring it this week.

604
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,966
Well, I have it in my e-mail.
I download it and print it.

605
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,130
Do you have internet and a printer?
-Yes

606
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,489
Now, how can I enlarge it?

607
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,531
There it is.
-What's wrong?
I press print, and hit does nothing.

608
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:30,085
Maybe you should turn it off and reboot the computer.

609
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,444
That is the disc, maybe if we reload it.

610
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,523
Wait. But why...

611
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,446
Can you close the door?
I get trouble with my allergies.

612
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,331
This is madness, lsidora.
Are you sure you want this?
-Yes

613
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,403
Then we move everything.
Imagine, all our stuff.

614
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,082
The books, the paintings...

615
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,645
The cats will find it equally difficult.

616
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,929
That memory that I told Rosario
wasn't true.

617
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,169
That happened to me when I was little.
Not her.

618
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,282
I'm not here anymore.

619
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,650
Okay, that's enough.
Come back another day.

620
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,962
Old Cats

621
