1
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,274
Please.
You don't have to do this.

2
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,110
Oh, God!

3
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,697
Not like this.
No, you can't. Please!

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,036
No.

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,206
Please.

6
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,794
<i>Por favor!</i>

7
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,963
I am so sorry.

8
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,841
Oh, God, I wanna go home!

9
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,483
You having fun?

10
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,612
- Am I the only one having a problem with this?
- I guess they're used to it.

11
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,782
<i>I just keep thinking about</i>
<i>how far we must be from a hospital.</i>

12
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,994
<i>You know, with doctors who operate</i>
<i>instead of amputate?</i>

13
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,329
So dramatic.

14
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,961
- Would you slow the fuck down!
- Jesus Christ, relax! You're such a tourist.

15
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>Por favor!</i>

16
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,426
<i>Calm down. He drives through it every day.</i>
<i>I think he knows how to drive better than you do.</i>

17
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,679
- He drives like a fucking lunatic.
- Well, we're fine, aren't we?

18
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,974
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

19
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,059
- We're flying back.
- <i>Okay, fine.</i>

20
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,062
- And I'm picking the hotels from now on.
- You were right about that.

21
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,106
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,035
Check it out.

23
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
- That looks painful.
- Stop it!

24
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,623
What do you think it says?

25
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,250
It says,
"Welcome to Brazil. Now bend over."

26
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,920
- We have to remember that.
- He likes you.

27
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,635
<i>Deus!</i>

28
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,513
<i>Jesus Christ! Stay on the road, you lunatic!</i>

29
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,815
Go out the window!
Go! Go!

30
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,402
- Get out!
- <i>Get out! Go, go, go!</i>

31
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,821
Get out right now!

32
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,116
Everybody out!

33
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,455
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Go!

34
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,875
Go! Get off!

35
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,710
<i>Jump! Get off!</i>

36
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,092
Oh, my God.
Get off! Get off, get off!

37
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>Get off!</i>

38
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
- <i>Oh, shit!</i>
- Did everyone get out of there?

39
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,663
- You still think flying
would've been a waste of money?

40
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,332
- Don't start.
- I told you this was-

41
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,083
- Don't!
- Fine.

42
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,711
Why is my luggage
always the last to come out?

43
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,426
Ale-Alex? Found it!

44
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,470
Great!

45
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,472
I'm impressed.

46
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,183
- Why?
- Bit like bringing sand to the beach though.

47
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,686
Bringing a couple of fit little birds
like that to Brazil?

48
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,940
- That's my sister.
- Splendid.

49
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,317
Just like to know me options.

50
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,569
It's not an option.

51
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,821
- Get everything?
- Yeah, I think so.

52
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,157
- Hi, I'm Finn. Nice to meet you.
- Bea. You too.

53
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,826
- Liam.
- Hi. How are you guys?

54
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,120
Good as gold.
Hi. I'm Finn.

55
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,623
- Amy. Nice to meet you.
- Liam.

56
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,085
Guess we're bonded for life now, eh?
Near-death experience.

57
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,629
- Great story to tell the grandkids.
- Yeah.

58
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,799
- You think they got a plan to get us out of here?
- I doubt it.

59
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,843
- Should find out, I suppose.
- I'll find out.

60
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,428
Oh, man.

61
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,606
"Bussie!"
You suck at driving buses!

62
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,817
You should do something else.

63
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,652
Pick bananas or something.

64
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,821
- Hey.
- Hi.

65
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,824
- I'm Alex.
- Pru.

66
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,826
Yes. Yes.

67
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,704
- You're, um, supposed to kiss back.
- Ah. Sorry.

68
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,583
Except you don't actually kiss.
You sort of kiss the air.

69
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,418
- Yeah. Start again.
- I'm Alex.

70
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,087
- Pru. Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

71
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,173
- So, do you speak Spanish?
- It's Portuguese here.

72
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,634
- Right. So, any idea what
these guys are talking about?
- Another bus is on its way.

73
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,596
- It's gonna be about 10 hours.
- Ten hours?

74
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,307
- Yeah. And then it's another 18 to Recife.
- Wait, what did you just say?

75
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,309
- <i>About what?</i>
- About where we're headed.

76
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,395
Well, the way that guy was driving,
I'm not really sure.

77
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,189
- But you said Recife, right?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,649
- Which is north of Salvador.
- On most maps.

79
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,028
- <i>Which means we've been</i>
<i>headed north this whole time.</i>
- Idiots, the pair of us.

80
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,447
We got on the wrong fucking bus!

81
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,157
- The Rastafarian.
- I knew he was dodgy.

82
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,368
- <i>Brilliant cunts we are.</i>
- Wait. Where did you guys think you were going?

83
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,038
- To Floripa.
- Oh, you took the long way.

84
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,207
- <i>Yeah. Where was this bus headed?</i>
- Belém.

85
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,211
<i>Don't suppose that Belém is famous</i>
<i>for having a 10-to-1 ratio of women to men...</i>

86
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,254
where even the ugly girls
look like Giselle.

87
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,382
<i>And they're all smart, fun,</i>
<i>alcoholic nymphomaniacs...</i>

88
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,843
with a soft spot for charming
if slightly grubby foreign tourists?

89
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,429
Uh, not that I'm aware of, no.

90
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,431
- Too bad.
- 'Cause Floripa is.

91
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,893
Six- Six <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
swimsuit models are from Floripa.

92
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,313
- <i>Do you understand how select</i>
<i>that gene pool must be?</i>
- It's a tiny town.

93
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,743
- Leave it out.
- All right.

94
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,663
- Hey, are you getting anything?
- No. Nothing.

95
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,252
Do you think they know
something we don't?

96
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,295
I'm gonna walk around.

97
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,470
<i>Bonita.</i>

98
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,765
<i>Meu nome é Bea.</i>

99
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,309
Hey!

100
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,522
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

101
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,190
Photograph.
Photograph. It's a-

102
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,445
Hey, hey.

103
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,532
- Jesus! Calm down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

104
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,285
Calm down! I'm sorry!

105
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,621
- You're not to take pictures
of kids without permission.
- How am I supposed to know?

106
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,875
Hey. "No, senhorita"
would have been fine.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,877
Or even "No, you stupid,
bloody gringo!"

108
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,296
Asshole! I can't hear ya!

109
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,966
Leave the girl alone. All right?

110
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,845
Prick.

111
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,847
Tabloids have been writing stories
about foreigners...

112
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,516
coming here to steal kids
to sell their organs for transplants.

113
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,643
It's created a lot of hostility
to tourists.

114
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,230
- Has that anything to do with
that couple that were missing?
- I don't think they're a couple.

115
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,150
- French couple, right?
- Oh, I thought you meant the kayakers.

116
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,404
Oi! We got no designs on your organs!
All right? Your kidneys are safe with us!

117
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,406
We're on holiday, for fuck's sake!

118
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,534
Hey, where'd you get those from?

119
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,835
- What did she say?
- She said there's a bar on the
beach and it's really close.

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,879
- <i>We can walk.</i>
- Is there a town?

121
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,508
- Don't you think we should wait for the next bus?
- They haven't <i>made</i> the next bus.

122
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,681
Let's go.
We'll come back later.

123
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,725
Let's do it.

124
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,022
So, how did you end up here?

125
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,566
I'm here with my little sister.

126
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,568
She's always wanted
to come to Brazil...

127
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,197
my mom didn't want her to go alone
and didn't trust her with Amy...

128
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,742
so I get to pretend to be the boyfriend
when creepy guys try to bother her.

129
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,745
What happens when
creepy girls bother you?

130
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,957
- So what about you? You traveling alone?
- Yeah.

131
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,210
- That's brave.
- Not really. I've been everywhere
they tell you not to go.

132
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,756
Colombia, Nigeria. Just spent
three months in a favela in Rocinha.

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,301
The only place I've ever had any problems
is in a small town in Australia.

134
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,971
- So, you're from Australia?
- Uh-huh.

135
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,973
Got a boyfriend in Australia?

136
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,976
No! You did not just say that!

137
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,895
- What?
- "So, you got a boyfriend in Australia?"

138
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:31,233
I just meant that if I had a girlfriend
or a little sister who was traveling alone...

139
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,235
I'd be a little worried, that's all.

140
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,280
Well, don't be.
I can take care of myself.

141
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,950
- So, did she say this was
a proper bar with real drinks?

142
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,286
I don't know.
She didn't say.

143
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,913
Christ, I'd do anything for a pint.

144
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,916
I'd lick the sweat
off a monkey's balls.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,336
"I'd lick the sweat off a monkey's balls."

146
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,131
- Christ on a cracker.
- <i>This is amazing!</i>

147
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,676
<i>Oh, yes! Check this out!</i>

148
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,350
- Baby!
- Oh, yes!

149
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,811
Whoo! Who wants to go for a swim?

150
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,814
- Yeah, sure!
- Yes! This is what I was talking about.

151
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,609
- <i>They got beer?</i>
- Get your kit off, girls!

152
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,652
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Let's swim!</i>

153
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,823
Shit.

154
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,368
I left my top in Rio.
Would you guys mind if I went topless?

155
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,039
- <i>Are you serious? No. Keep your shirt on.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Why not?</i>

156
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,125
Do you see what they're wearing, Alex?
We're not in America.

157
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,961
<i>No one's gonna care if I go topless.</i>

158
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,216
Yeah, but the idea is to tastefully reveal
as much as possible-

159
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,885
Oi, oi.
Get a load of that.

160
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,471
without actually
revealing so much...

161
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,807
that you can still get into heaven.

162
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,144
That was good.

163
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,147
Yes!

164
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:55,359
- That is a fantastic trick.
- Well, it's still a Catholic country.

165
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,819
- Well, we're Catholics.
- And we definitely don't mind.

166
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:03,116
<i>No. In fact, I think I can speak for Liam when</i>
<i>I say we wouldn't be offended in the slightest.</i>

167
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,994
<i>In fact, let's all go topless,</i>
<i>boys and girls.</i>

168
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,413
No, Amy-

169
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>Oh! Nice!</i>

170
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,418
Put your shirt on.

171
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,254
She's a naughty girl.

172
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,382
- How about that? Is this better?
- <i>Oh, no!</i>

173
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,050
Come on.
Let's go.

174
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,219
All right, let's go get it wet.

175
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,227
- <i>Come on, Alex!</i>
- <i>Whoo!</i>

176
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,420
Let's get a drink.

177
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,922
- <i>Alex, where are you going?</i>
- Over here.

178
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,800
<i>Whoo!</i>

179
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,602
- <i>Qual é seu nome?</i>
- <i>É camila.</i>

180
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,729
Pru. Alex.

181
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,356
Nice to meet you.

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,193
- What do you want?
- Uh, Coke, please.

183
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,196
A Coke? You're 7,000 miles away
from home. Try something new.

184
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,198
- Like what?
- Have you ever had assai?

185
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,908
Uh, no.

186
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,952
It's, like, this amazing drink
from the Amazon. It's-

187
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,039
Just a Coke's fine.
Thank you. No ice.

188
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,458
My God, I love this country.

189
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,544
<i>It's like we died on the bus and this is heaven.</i>

190
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,796
<i>It's heaven.</i>
<i>It's, uh,</i> paraíso<i>.</i>

191
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,257
And you? Angel.

192
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,053
Wait.

193
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,055
You too!
Come on!

194
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,432
Ah!

195
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,435
- Don't want to-
- <i>Por favor?</i>

196
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,732
- No ice.
- No, no. It's, like, a hundred fucking degrees.

197
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,443
No, it's like ordering with dysentery
or without dysentery. No ice.

198
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,736
Dysentery.

199
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,281
This is unbelievable.

200
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,451
You think you've found
your own private Shangri-la.

201
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,996
Next thing you know, the place is crawling
with backpacking tourists wearing sandals.

202
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,374
Welcome to paradise.
I'm Svend.

203
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,292
- Pru, my sister Bea, Amy.
- Hi.

204
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,837
- <i>Where are you from?</i>
- London.

205
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,339
- <i>London. We're from Sweden.</i>
- Sweden! Nice!

206
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:27,886
We rode this beauty all the way from Mexico City
and stopped to have a drink three days ago.

207
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,389
<i>Now we can't</i>
<i>find any reason to leave.</i>

208
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,058
Yeah, and Brazilians
are the warmest and friendliest...

209
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,769
and most chill people
you're ever gonna meet.

210
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:40,482
<i>The drinks are cheap, and Camila's cooking,</i>
<i>it's unbelievable.</i>

211
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:44,403
And you even have a barrack you can sleep in
on the beach- only four bucks a night.

212
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,405
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Go on!

213
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,407
About what?

214
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,326
Oh, no, no.
It's just an expression, like "no way."

215
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,372
- <i>Oh. Yeah!</i>
- I hate living up to the natives' stereotype, but-

216
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,041
and I think I speak for
my brother when I say this-

217
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,043
we're not leaving here...

218
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,547
- until either we run out of money-
- Or they run out of beer!

219
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,051
- Oh, my God.
- So, what do you think?

220
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,263
About getting on the bus?
Come on. Look where we are.

221
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,265
Well, how do we get back?

222
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,518
Hitchhike to a bigger town. We'll get on
a better bus, with air conditioning and brakes.

223
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,731
You in?

224
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,733
- Sure.
- Yeah! Let's do it!

225
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,484
All right, fuck the bus.

226
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,822
Yes!

227
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,037
Ow.

228
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,427
Camila.

229
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,731
- <i>Da. Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>

230
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,777
Whoo! Let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

231
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,071
- Amy! Amy!
- Come on! In the middle!

232
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,573
Ohh! Nice!

233
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,409
Why won't someone pass me the ball?

234
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,082
- <i>Come on, come on!</i>
- <i>Think fast!</i>

235
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,251
<i>Oh!</i>

236
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,295
<i>We know how to play this game!</i>

237
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,297
- Ohh!
- You okay?

238
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,299
- You suck, Amy.
- Let's go!

239
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,802
You're on our side, Alex!

240
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,140
<i>Come on, Alex! Pass!</i>

241
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,438
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

242
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,608
<i>Come on, Liam! Run! Run!</i>

00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,652

<i>Go on. Dance with her.</i>

292
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,596
No, no, I'm not dancing.

293
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,767
No, no, no, it's not you. It's just that I have
these very European hips.

294
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,020
- They have to stay parallel to the floor at all times.
- Huh?

295
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,606
Apart from when I'm naked.

296
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,359
I can't do that.

297
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,653
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are you?

298
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,322
Go on!
Show her how it's done!

A... ro... lea.

Yes!

312
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,547
I get a kiss just for
saying your name?

313
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,674
Arolea.

314
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,427
Arolea.
Mmm!

315
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,429
Mmm!

316
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,959
This song is so <i>nasty</i>.

317
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,961
What are they saying?

318
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,963
I'm not getting it all,
but basically...

319
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,966
it's a long list of explicit things
he likes to do in his car-

320
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,427
one being up the ass.

321
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,429
Mmm!

322
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,613
Do you wanna dance?

323
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,657
- Yes.
- Come on. Let's dance.

324
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,295
Oh, yes!

325
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,008
Oh, it's like that, is it? Oh!

326
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,845
- Yes. I want. Yeah. I like very much.
- Mmm.

327
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,973
Oh, God!

328
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,141
- Ah?
- Damn!

329
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,186
Yes. More.
All of it. All of it.

330
00:23:56,311 --> 00:24:00,357
Oh! Yeah!
Take it all off. Yeah!

331
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,193
- <i>Mais?</i>
- Oh!

332
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,195
Please.

333
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,656
<i>Mais! Mais!</i>

334
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,535
Oh, my God.

335
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,124
Oh, God bless Brazil.
Come on.

336
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,882
Yeah!

337
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,305
I love Brazil!

338
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,314
<i>God, you really are an angel.</i>
<i>Wanna come back with me to London?</i>

339
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,027
Oh, w-wait. No!
It's not like that!

340
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,113
- <i>É assim.</i>
- But I thought you liked me. No?

341
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,199
No.

342
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,221
Hey, Svend!
What a night!

343
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,723
Hey! Dude!

344
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,059
Bloody lightweight.

345
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,329
<i>Bea!</i>

346
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,331
<i>Bea, get up!</i>

347
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,584
Come on, get up. Get up.

348
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,669
Bea.
Come on, come on.

349
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,423
- You okay?
- What?

350
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,467
- You okay?
- No. I feel sick.

351
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,928
What happened?

352
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,889
They robbed us.

353
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,474
- What?
- <i>We got robbed.</i>

354
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,810
- By who?
- I don't know.

355
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,812
- What did they take?
- Everything.

356
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,856
- What do you mean, everything?
- I mean everything.

357
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,901
Our money, our credit cards,
our phones, our backpacks...

358
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,903
our passports, everything.

359
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,280
- Nana's ring.
- Yes, everything.

360
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,993
My earrings are gone.
How did they take my fucking earrings?

361
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,663
I think that they drugged us. They must have
put something in our drinks last night.

362
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,333
Mom is gonna kill me. She told me not to
bring the ring, 'cause-

363
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,502
Bea.

364
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,672
That is a very small problem right now.
We have no money. We have no way out of here.

365
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,592
We'll be fine.

366
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,511
- You think so?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

367
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,430
<i>'Cause I'm not so sure.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

368
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,757
Mm-mmm.

369
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:39,428
Hold on.

370
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,700
Hey!

371
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,744
No! No! No! No!

372
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,107
No.

373
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,581
No.

374
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,547
What?
What did she say?

375
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,633
Oh, God. She's saying it's down here to the left.

376
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,636
The other guy said it's down here
to the right. So I have no idea.

377
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,139
Are you sure it's smart
going to the police?

378
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:50,142
- Aren't they supposed to be
worse than the criminals?
- Not all of them.

379
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,562
- Come on.
- Someone in this town
must know what's going on.

380
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,527
These kids are definitely in on it.
It's freaking me out.

381
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,371
- God.
- What did he say?

382
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,917
Let's, uh- Let's just try up here-
this little house or something.

383
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,760
- Are you sure we're going the right way?
- That's what he said.

384
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,803
I don't know.

385
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,191
Alex?
Where are you going?

386
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,693
Aah! Ow.

387
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,446
- <i>What is it?</i>
- The Swede's motorcycle.

388
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,242
Hello?

389
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,120
Olá!

390
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:54,540
<i>Olá!</i>

391
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,168
Hey! Hey!
Whose motorcycle is this?

392
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,754
Ask him who got-
Where'd they get this motorcycle?

393
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,927
That's Alex's hat.
That kid has Alex's hat.

394
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,596
- Alex!
- Alex, he's got your hat.

395
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,892
Grab him! Quick!

396
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:19,022
- <i>Wait up, Liam!</i>
- <i>Just wanna talk to you!</i>

397
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,899
<i>Where'd you get that hat?</i>

398
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,319
Come back here!

399
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,780
<i>Wait! Shit!</i>

400
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,200
<i>Oww! Aah!</i>

401
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,789
- <i>Where'd he go?</i>
- Don't know.

402
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,334
Aah!

403
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,257
Come back here!
Now!

404
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,014
You wait till I fucking catch you.

405
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,439
Now I've got you, you little shit.

406
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,360
Oh, shit.

407
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,743
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

408
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,710
What happened?
What'd you do?

409
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,713
- It was an accident.
- <i>You threw a rock at him?</i>

410
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,757
Didn't mean to hit his head.

411
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,343
- It was an accident.
- We got robbed!

412
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,970
He had our friend's cap!

413
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,972
It was an accident!

414
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,517
Hey! Don't touch me!

415
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,406
- Walk away.
- Let's just go. Let's just go.

416
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,576
Hey, come on. Just relax.
Just walk away.

417
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,579
Come on, come on, come on!

418
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:06,004
- <i>Are they following us?</i>
- <i>No, I don't think so.</i>

419
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,090
W-We were robbed.
<i>R-Roubado. Roubado.</i>

420
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,092
- I know.
- You know?

421
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,094
- Everybody knows.
- Who did it?

422
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,097
<i>Who did it?</i>

423
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,351
What police?

424
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,854
You crazy.
No police here. Okay?

425
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,857
<i>What do you mean, there's no police here?</i>

426
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,943
- <i>Christ, dude, where are you going?</i>
- Stay here.

427
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,032
Nice work.

428
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,535
- <i>Leave him alone.</i>
- It was a fucking accident.

429
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,912
- You don't throw a rock at a kid!
- Let it go!

430
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,957
- <i>Let it go!</i>
- <i>I'm sorry. Okay?</i>

431
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,751
- Sorry, everybody.
- <i>It's all right.</i>

432
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,932
Let's go, guys.

433
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,685
- Damn!
- Come on!

434
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,228
Come on!
Come on!

435
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,982
- <i>Okay, man! Hold up!</i>
- <i>Where are we going?</i>

436
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,068
- Is not good for you in town.
- Yeah, no kidding.

437
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,155
They are looking for the father
of this boy that you hurt.

438
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,157
<i>Is bad man.</i>

439
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,951
<i>They find him, is very bad for you.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

440
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,953
Ask him where we're going, Pru.

441
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,668
There is-There is
a house of his uncle...

442
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,171
<i>and he says that it's very safe</i>
<i>for us there.</i>

443
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,674
No. We just want a ride.
Do you know anybody with a car?

444
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,679
No, no, no. No car.

445
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,807
There is-

446
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,685
<i>The only car is of the guy</i>
<i>that robbed us.</i>

447
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,855
- <i>You'd better wait for the bus.</i>
- <i>There's a bus? When is there a bus?</i>

448
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,149
Uh, <i>qu-quando-</i> At what time?

449
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,151
Uh... today?

450
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,362
- <i>Today there's a bus?</i>
- Yes.

451
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:57,157
- What time?
- Two day.

452
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,159
- Two days.
- Two days?

453
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,745
Why does everything take
so fucking long in this place?

454
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,790
- Two day-
- Okay, <i>vamos</i>. <i>Vamos la. Vamos.</i>

455
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:12,965
<i>Fuck! These insects are eating me alive.</i>

456
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,968
- Look at that. All over me legs.
- Leave it out.

457
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:19,388
There'd better be a big bag
of fucking weed at this house.

458
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,353
Kiko, can we just...
stop for a minute?

459
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,897
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

460
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,483
- Where are you going?
- The men's room.

461
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,644
Whose idea was it to leave the bus?

462
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,647
- Whose idea was it to come to Brazil?
- It was yours!

463
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,650
- I wanted to go to Bali.
- You're missing the point.

464
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,904
The point is, if we dig deep enough
I'm sure we'll discover this is all your fault.

465
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,906
Oh, right. Yeah.

466
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,909
- <i>Which'll make me feel a lot better.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

467
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:25,287
And you know what? I <i>did</i> want to
come to Brazil. Why? Because I like girls.

468
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,122
And I like beaches and drinking.

469
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,249
And when they say
"Come to Brazil," they say...

470
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:33,128
"Come to Brazil! We've got girls
and beaches and drinking!"

471
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,131
What they do not say,
what they completely neglect to mention...

472
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:39,635
is anything about being chased
into the jungle by an angry fuckin' mob...

473
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,638
<i>which is not my idea</i>
<i>of a fun vacation at all!</i>

474
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,140
<i>Oi, Kiko!</i>
<i>How far is this house?</i>

475
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:48,977
- Uh, uh, <i>como</i> far?
- Hey, man, not so bad.

476
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,647
What do you mean?
This is pretty fucking bad!

477
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,441
<i>What about a road?</i>
<i>Is there a road we can walk on?</i>

478
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,819
- No roads.
- What kind of house has no roads?

479
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,950
Fucking hell.

480
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,075
<i>Come on! Almost there!</i>

481
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,577
<i>Kiko! Where are we going?</i>

482
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,580
<i>There is a place where we can rest.</i>

483
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,666
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

484
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,253
Check it out!

485
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,255
<i>Come on! I show you something.</i>

486
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,341
- Wow.
- <i>This is my secret place.</i>

487
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,301
Kiko, can we swim here?

488
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,303
I show you some caves.

489
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,305
What caves? Where?

490
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,808
There are caves in the water.

491
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,810
We'll swim, then go to house.

492
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:38,146
- How close is the house?
- It's right on the river.

493
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,524
Ten minutes.

494
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,068
<i>Hey, guys, watch me!</i>

495
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:46,029
You're joking. You're never gonna jump off of this!

496
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,782
- Kiko, It's too dangerous.
- Go ahead!

497
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:51,368
- Stop encouraging him!
- I am diving all the time!

498
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,954
Less talking!
More action!

499
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,081
No, stop!
Don't do it! No!

500
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,001
Kiko! Whoa!

501
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,714
<i>Crazy son of a bitch!</i>

502
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,509
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Come on!

503
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,179
<i>Come on, come on! Come down!</i>

504
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,848
Swim!
I show you caves!

505
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:15,726
- <i>No way I'm doing that!</i>
- Come on. Let's go see 'em.

506
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,187
- I'm staying here.
- <i>You sure?</i>

507
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,189
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

508
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,900
- <i>You can do it!</i>
- Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, stay here too.

509
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,319
Right.
Behave yourself.

510
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,493
Here?

511
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,787
- The caves! Come on!
- Over there?

512
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,789
I can't.
No, no, I can't.

513
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,583
Follow me.
It's an easy swim.

514
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,585
You can do it.

515
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,671
- <i>Come on. Let's do it.</i>
- Okay.

516
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,065
- Hey, Bea, you okay?
- Yeah.

517
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:07,069
- Is this it?
- Come on. A little more far.

518
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,744
- Follow me.
- <i>Kiko, where are we?</i>

519
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,746
Where are we goin'?

520
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,790
Fuck! That was a bat!

521
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,918
Kiko.

522
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,920
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

523
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,090
- <i>Kiko, what is this?</i>
- We go under.

524
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,008
- No!
- No. No.

525
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,010
- There-There is a hole.
- No, no, no, no.

526
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,555
Hey, man, it's easy.

527
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,182
This is incredible.
Incredible!

528
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,810
- All right. Let's go. Fine. Fine.
- No. No.

529
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,646
- One, two, three.
- What?

530
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,603
Asshole!
What the fuck is this?

531
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:26,315
Oh, Jesus!

532
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,318
That was not easy.
It was scary.

533
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,320
And this is not incredible.

534
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,322
We go more.
We go more.

535
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,324
Ow! Ow!
Jesus!

536
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,743
- Kiko!
- Fucking lunatic!

537
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,954
- Kiko!
- <i>Shit! The light!</i>

538
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,617
Holy shit!

539
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,703
<i>Wow, look at this place.</i>
<i>Bea, look at this.</i>

540
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,041
Wow, this is amazing. What is this place?

541
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,043
Very nice, Kiko!

542
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:30,546
<i>This water is so beautiful!</i>

543
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,056
- <i>This is incredible.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

544
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,602
<i>Is my secret place.</i>

545
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:59,867
I-I never making friends
with the gringos before.

546
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,577
- No?
- <i>No.</i>

547
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,996
I never have, um, speak with one.

548
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,998
Really?

549
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:07,958
Well, hi there!

550
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,043
Oh, my God.

551
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,924
You okay?

552
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,593
What?

553
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,469
You-You feel okay?

554
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,264
- Yes, yes. I am okay.
- Okay.

555
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,309
Uh, maybe...

556
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,311
we go back to town.

557
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,146
- What?
- <i>Aqui.</i> Yes.

558
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,023
Is better we go back.

559
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:34,526
We just hiked 10 hours through the jungle.
How can you go back?

560
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,613
- Did you say go back?
- We're not going back. No way.

561
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:41,074
Yes.
I-I-I think is better.

562
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:44,620
- Why?
- Maybe I talk with these guys, okay?

563
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,539
Um, tell them you are okay.

564
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,791
Maybe find a ride for you.

565
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,336
But why are you saying this now?

566
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:56,173
- I don't know. It's just, um-
- It's just what?

567
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:58,175
No- No nothing.

568
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,887
<i>Look, it's simple- 10 hours hike through</i>
<i>the jungle, or 10 minutes to the house.</i>

569
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:04,765
I don't like hiking.
We go to the fucking house.

570
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,851
Is there a problem
with this house, Kiko?

571
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,478
No. No problem.

572
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:12,105
Then we go to the house.
Okay?

573
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:14,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

574
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,777
That's for almost killing us!

575
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,406
Come on, guys.
We walk back.

576
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:32,668
- Oh. Hey. What's going on?
- Oi, oi!

577
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,963
Hi. How was it?

578
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,966
- Awesome. Underwater caves. It was cool.
- There were bats.

579
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:40,968
Come on.
Let's go together.

580
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,303
Hey, Kiko, show me how you do that.

581
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:46,223
- I wanna do it. Show me. Yeah.
- Let's jump together.

582
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,767
One, two, three!

583
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:57,776
You guys should try it!

584
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,696
Dude, I wanna try.
Show me how you do it.

585
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:02,739
Okay, okay.
I go.

586
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,660
<i>Whoo! Crazy!</i>

587
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,249
<i>Whoo! Oh!</i>

588
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,212
- <i>Shit! He's bleeding!</i>
- <i>Kiko!</i>

589
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,214
- We're coming down!
- Stay up!

590
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,883
Jesus Christ!

591
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:25,846
- <i>What happened?</i>
- He must have hit his head on a rock below.

592
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,931
Keep his head above the water!

593
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,809
Is he conscious?

594
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:33,103
Oh, my God.

595
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,731
- Get him to the side.
- Come on, come on!

596
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,608
- <i>Swim! Swim!</i>
- <i>Over here!</i>

597
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,529
What are we gonna do?

598
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,531
Take him back to the village.

599
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:46,992
We'll never get back before dark.
We'll go to the house.

600
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,995
- We don't know where the house is!
- He said it was on the river.

601
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,748
Help me get him out. Grab my shirt.
We're gonna wrap his head.

602
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,628
<i>Is he gonna die?</i>

603
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,630
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>How do you know?</i>

604
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:03,634
<i>Between rugby and bar fights, I've probably</i>
<i>had a concussion a year since I was nine.</i>

605
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:06,136
- <i>When did you play rugby?</i>
- <i>I played!</i>

606
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:08,680
- We should have just gone back to the village.
- No way!

607
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,766
They'll fucking kill us!

608
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:15,812
What is this place doing here?

609
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,814
You okay?

610
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,400
He all right?

611
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,779
Hello!

612
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:26,114
Nearly there.

613
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,116
Whoa. This is crazy.

614
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,118
Almost there.

615
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:32,162
Hello?

616
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,165
This guy likes his privacy.

617
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,502
- Hey, look, there's a dip there.
- Hello!

618
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,504
Oi!

619
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:43,507
Anyone home?

620
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,717
Bea, get a chair.

621
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,973
Here we go.

622
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:03,318
<i>Fuck!</i>

623
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:08,240
- Oh, shit, that's deep.
- Jesus.

624
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,785
Keep pressure on that.
We need something to close this up.

625
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:15,247
Find, uh, superglue,
needle and thread, anything.

626
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,040
Check upstairs.

627
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,344
<i>Olá?</i>

628
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,232
<i>Olá!</i>

629
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:18,185
<i>Olá?</i>

630
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,175
- Hold his head right here.
I gotta cut some of this out.
- Okay.

631
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,177
Oh. Sorry.

632
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,013
- Hold his fucking head up!
- I got it. I got it!

633
00:50:56,765 --> 00:51:00,644
Vicodin, codeine, Demerol made out to
every imaginable name and nationality-

634
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,605
- <i>Gustav Roth, Marco Terelli-</i>
- Hold him.

635
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:06,733
What the hell is this place, some kind of
youth hostel for drug addicts?

636
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,777
- Gotta hold this shut.
- I got it!

637
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:10,779
- A stapler?
- No, no, no. You can't use that.

638
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,823
- It's fine.
- No!

639
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:15,367
It's what they used on me when I split
me head open. Hold it closed.

640
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,119
- Hold it shut.
- You got it.

641
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,745
- Oh, Jesus.
- More.

642
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,205
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

643
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,583
- Sorry, mate.
- Hold him.

644
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,963
- Okay?
- I got him. I got him.

645
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:34,678
<i>Kiko, where you going? Are you okay?</i>

646
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,431
- Kiko.
- <i>Kiko, you okay?</i>

647
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:45,063
<i>Kiko.</i>

648
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,274
Should we keep him awake?

649
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,276
I don't know.

650
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,737
He could have a concussion.

651
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,870
Clothes.

652
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:08,212
Mmm.
Smoked herring.

653
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,382
Let's see.
Mushrooms and cheese.

654
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,885
That's good.

655
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,932
Hey. Look. Look what I got.

656
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,934
Oh, you want some, don't you?

657
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,436
You want some.
Come here. Up here.

658
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,522
Yeah.

659
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,942
Nasty.
Here you go.

660
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,736
Ohh.

661
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:37,491
Yeah!

662
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,208
Hey.

663
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,713
- Anything good?
- I think our luck might be turning.

664
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,300
- Oh, yeah?
- Twenty-year-old single malt.

665
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:02,474
What the hell is this?

666
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,570
Who the hell are these people?

667
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:24,496
Hmm.

668
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,915
Thank you.

669
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,666
This house is so fucking creepy.

670
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,668
We'll just stay the night.

671
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,671
Then Kiko will show us the way out
in the morning.

672
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:59,174
- If he dies, how do we get back?
- He's not gonna die.

673
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:02,177
'Cause I don't wanna be here
if his uncle shows up and we're like...

674
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:05,180
"Hello, mate. Here's your dead nephew.
And you're out of scotch."

675
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:12,187
And why is there no road?
What kind of fucking hermit lives-

676
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:15,399
- Oi!
- Yeah, I know. Leave it out.

677
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,529
So, how does this rank
with your other trips?

678
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:23,532
After the last few days,
right at the bottom. You?

679
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:27,452
- Well, we had a pretty tough time in Cambodia.
- At least we had that hash.

680
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,538
Yeah, and those Dutch girls.

681
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,208
I just want to go home.

682
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,210
His uncle.

683
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,388
What's going on?

684
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,140
I'm not sure.

685
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:12,826
What is he saying?

686
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,841
<i>Alex.</i>

687
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:33,472
Kiko, what's-

688
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,474
<i>Olá.</i>

689
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,983
Hi.

690
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,985
Hi.

691
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,196
- You guys American?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:51,740
Cool. I've been one time
to New York.

693
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:53,867
Hmm.

694
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,081
Go. Run.

695
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:01,208
- What do you mean?
- Run right now.

696
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,628
This guy has plans for you
and your friends...

697
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,631
and his plans are pretty fucking elaborate
and pretty fucking fucked.

698
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,883
<i>So if I were you, I'd just run.</i>

699
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:25,315
Look, we didn't-
We're friends of Kiko.

700
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,734
He said- Hey! Shit!

701
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:33,615
No.

702
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:52,301
Kiko. Kiko!
Where the fuck did you take us?

703
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,179
Tell him we're your friends.
Where the fuck are you going?

704
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,681
- <i>Kiko!</i>
- <i>Tell him we're your friends!</i>

705
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,892
<i>Where are you going?</i>

706
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:02,186
- Alex, help me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

707
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:05,898
- Get your fucking hands off me!
What's the matter with you?

708
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,900
Back off!

709
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:10,402
Oh, God!

710
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:07,209
<i>Don't take this personal, okay?</i>

711
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:12,756
If it makes you feel any better...

712
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,717
please know that I'm doing this...

713
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:18,512
<i>for a good cause.</i>

714
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,765
Please, don't.

715
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,851
Did you know that in America...

716
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:27,229
there is a seven-year wait...

717
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,606
for a healthy kidney?

718
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:33,569
And in Europe...

719
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,573
it's worse.

720
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:40,534
So...

721
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:43,704
if a rich gringo needs a kidney...

722
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,747
what does he do?

723
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:49,418
Wait and get sick and die
like the rest of us?

724
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,712
- Don't. Please.
- No.

725
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:55,716
He comes here to Brazil...

726
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:58,135
to take advantage of our bounty...

727
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,472
and of our poverty.

728
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,976
<i>The whole history of our country...</i>

729
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:08,770
is you taking from us...

730
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:11,023
and our land-

731
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,984
rubber, sugar, gold.

732
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:20,616
And from our bodies-
for slaves, for sex.

733
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:25,662
And now, for- for our insides.

734
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,630
<i>But I...</i>

735
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:37,132
have had...

736
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,843
enough.

737
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,230
Bea! Bea!

738
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,192
Take the knife!
Take it!

739
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:39,653
Take the knife.
Cut this rope off.

740
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:41,697
Cut this off my hands.

741
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,793
Cut.

742
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:03,218
<i>Hurry.</i>
<i>Bea, hurry!</i>

743
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:07,055
<i>Attagirl. Attagirl.</i>

744
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,725
Cut- Cut it.

745
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:14,313
Hurry!

746
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:26,575
It sickens my heart,
this combination-

747
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:29,244
- your greed-
- Oh, God, no.

748
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,914
and our weakness.

749
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,752
And so I am thinking:

750
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:42,299
Maybe there is something
I can do to even the scales just a little-

751
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:46,512
to help you find a way...

752
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,597
to give back.

753
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:23,966
Today I am to take
the organs of all of you...

754
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,885
and give them...

755
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,304
to the People's Hospital in Rio.

756
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,142
Counting down from right now,
I have-

757
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,645
I have about 12 hours...

758
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:40,482
to get your liver
and your kidneys...

759
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:42,568
and the liver and kidneys...

760
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:44,653
of all your fucking <i>amiguinhos</i>...

761
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,657
into that helicopter
and back to the city.

762
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:53,704
I'd take your hearts too,
your corneas-

763
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:56,874
even the skin from your lily-white asses.

764
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,084
But they don't travel too well.

765
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:07,301
You can only keep a heart
outside a body for six hours.

766
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:11,221
But I want that.

767
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,516
I want a heart-

768
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:19,062
a heart of some
arrogant fucking gringo tourist...

769
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:21,148
pumping life back into the veins...

770
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:23,567
of a little <i>Brasileiro</i>.

771
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:29,948
But that's gonna take more planning.

772
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,427
Your turn.

773
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,647
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, come on!

774
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:27,733
<i>Kiko, grab the key!</i>

775
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:32,279
Go, go!

776
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:35,782
- Come on, come on!
- Oh, oh!

777
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:45,083
Hurry up!

778
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,923
Come on, come on!

779
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,845
- Come on. Go to the waterfall.
We'll meet you there.
- No!

780
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,097
- Alex!
- Take her to the waterfall! Go!

781
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,266
- Alex, no!
- Come on. Let's get him out.

782
01:09:11,693 --> 01:09:13,695
Please. Please, don't.

783
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,908
<i>Please. Please.</i>

784
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:28,126
Please don't. Please.

785
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,713
No. No.

786
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,924
No, please don't.

787
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,468
<i>No, please!</i>
<i>Please, don't!</i>

788
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:59,867
Shut up, you-

789
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:03,120
Come on!

790
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:05,497
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

791
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:10,586
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go, man! Go!

792
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:13,130
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not leaving Finn.

793
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,382
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Don't be stupid!

794
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:17,426
What the fuck is that?
Yo, go, man!

795
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:20,053
- Get the fuck away from me, Kiko!
- Ow!

796
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:26,912
Shh. Stay back.

797
01:11:56,233 --> 01:12:00,070
<i>Jesus, please!</i>
<i>Come on now. Go! Go, go!</i>

798
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,499
Oh, fuck.

799
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,002
Come on. I'm gonna get you
out of here, bro.

800
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,880
You'll be all right, okay?

801
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:20,132
Help me get him out.

802
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:53,373
Fuck! Hurry up! Hurry up!

803
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:55,709
Come on! Come on!

804
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:02,799
Quick, quick!

805
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:15,145
Shh.

806
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:10,784
<i>Shh. Keep quiet.</i>

807
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:13,203
<i>Shh!</i>

808
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,471
Let's go. All right,
go, go, go, man, go!

809
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,605
Go! Go! Run! Run!

810
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:48,405
Hey!

811
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:52,743
Oh, my God. Come on! He's dead!
Let's go! Let's go!

812
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,287
Jesus! Come on!

813
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:59,249
<i>You're crazy! You're crazy!</i>
<i>You stupid son of a bitch! What are you doin'?</i>

814
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:01,752
Fuck you!

815
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,880
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Alex! Alex!

816
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:30,340
Hi.

817
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:35,345
Hi.

818
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:41,643
- Amy-Amy's-
- No, no, she's gone.

819
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,687
I'm sorry.

820
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:46,064
Hey, man.

821
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,235
It's danger. Danger, okay?
Let's go.

822
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,487
All right.
Come on, Bea. Up, up.

823
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:56,491
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

824
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:19,056
Hurry, Bea.
Come on, come on!

825
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:30,776
Hey, guys, come on!

826
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:55,175
You okay?

827
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,594
I've been here most of the night.

828
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,680
What about the others?

829
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:04,476
They're gone.
Come on. We gotta go.

830
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,271
<i>Be quiet! Silence!</i>

831
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:13,587
- Stop it!
- You crazy, man!

832
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,840
This is all your fault! You brought us here!
You knew this was gonna happen!

833
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:19,176
- He's risking his life!
- Fuck that!

834
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,308
Go, go, go! Get down! Dive!

835
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:32,314
Come with me.

836
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:27,160
- You okay?
- What are we gonna do?

837
01:20:27,244 --> 01:20:30,289
We gotta find a way out of here.

838
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:41,758
- There's someone coming.
- What? Who?

839
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,720
<i>I'll find another way out.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

840
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,342
Turn off your light.

841
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:31,183
- He's coming! Let's go!
- No, I can't! I can't go!

842
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:33,602
Bea, you have to!
Come on!

843
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:39,501
- Where's Bea?
- I don't know.

844
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,503
Bea.

845
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:17,182
Bea!

846
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,162
Bea!

847
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:23,248
<i>Bea!</i>

848
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:28,879
You okay?

849
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:30,964
Never leave me again.

850
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:36,428
<i>Over here. Just take my hand. Come on.</i>

851
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,847
There's land.
We can get out here.

852
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:42,476
- There's an airway up here.
- That's great.

853
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:45,395
This might be the way out.

854
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:51,818
<i>Let me see it.</i>

855
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:54,238
It's fine.
Here, hold this.

856
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:01,828
It's fine. It's fine.
Let's just find our way out of here.

857
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:04,665
- We should just keep heading up.
- All right.

858
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:06,917
Let's go.

859
01:26:10,379 --> 01:26:13,549
Alex, get down.

860
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,844
Turn off your light.

861
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,410
<i>Shh, shh, shh. Don't fucking move.</i>

862
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:57,843
Hey.

863
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,087
<i>Alex! Alex, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Get off him!</i>

864
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:37,257
Stop do-Alex!
What are you doing?

865
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:41,053
Oh! Oh, God.

866
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:43,764
Oh, my God.

867
01:27:58,153 --> 01:27:59,905
What?

868
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:17,709
- <i>This is stupid.</i>
<i>Why don't we just take the bus?</i>
- <i>The bus.</i>

869
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:20,796
- We could take the bus.
Then we could see the country.
- The bus takes forever.

870
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:25,008
- I thought that's why we came
here, to experience new things.
- Yeah, I guess.

871
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:27,344
- Take the plane.
- What?

872
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:29,596
Take the plane.

873
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:32,516
- Thanks, man.
- <i>De nada.</i>
