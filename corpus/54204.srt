189
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm going in to straighten
this girl out.

190
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,000
I'll be right back.

191
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,353
Alright, man.

192
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,829
I'm gonna go to my crib,
man. My stomach hurt.

193
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,909
Ey.

194
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,399
Come back!

195
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,959
Alright.

196
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,759
Mama!

197
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,353
Shit.

198
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,029
(Grunts)

199
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,035
Shit.

200
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,909
What the hell you want,
boy? Damn!

201
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,877
Mr Jones, can I use
your bathroom, please?

202
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,033
What you gonna do,
number 1 or number 2?

203
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,548
Number 2.

204
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,675
Shit.

205
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,591
You ain't gonna drop
no stinkin' loads here.

206
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,999
If anybody drops
a stinkin' load,

207
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,308
it's gonna be me.

208
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,276
Mr...Mr Jones!

209
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,236
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

210
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,190
Man!

211
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,190
Fuck.

212
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,234
Mama!

213
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,230
Shit.

214
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,756
# La la la la la la

215
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,920
# La la la la... #

216
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,399
Smokey!

217
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,310
Smokey.

218
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,278
Smokey!

219
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,160
Smokey, what the hell
you doing back here?

220
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,071
Hey, nothin', man.
Hey, I'm fixing something.

221
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,149
Just stay over there.

222
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,958
I thought you wanted me
to wash the car.

223
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,000
Hey, man, wash it later.
Stay over there!

224
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,911
I ain't the smartest man
in the world,

225
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,230
but from here it looks
like you takin' a shit.

226
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,515
Ezel, get the hell off
my back lawn!

227
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,636
Ugh! It look like
you been eatin' corn?

228
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,472
Fool, get the hell
out of my back...

229
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,960
Get on, man!

230
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,791
Alright, but between
me and you, man,

231
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,835
when you're done,

232
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,592
I'll clean all that shit
up for you for $2.00.

233
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,555
Hey, Ezel!

234
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,800
What?
You better not tell nobody, man!

235
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,119
I'm not, man.

236
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,280
Keep it on the down low.

237
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,635
All right. I'm not like that.

238
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,233
We'll keep it down, bro.

239
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,390
Ey! Smokey back here
takin' a shit!

240
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,390
Ezel!

241
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,471
Well, I ain't gonna
tell nobody else.

242
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,760
# La la la la

243
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,398
# La la la la la... #

244
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,756
See, you need to control
that little funky ass temper.

245
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,070
I know. I be forgettin', baby.

246
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,071
You got to be reminding me.

247
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,513
I'm sorry.

248
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,953
My mama know

249
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,871
that's you calling
and hanging up.

250
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,837
What?

251
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,717
That ain't me calling
and hanging up, baby.

252
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,030
You know I love your mama.

253
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,031
Hey, you got some money?

254
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,918
What? Some, huh?

255
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,070
Nigger, how much you need?

256
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,354
About $200.

257
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,069
Well, I guess so.

258
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,037
What are you gonna to give me?

259
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,799
WOMAN: Craig!

260
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,678
Craig!

261
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,800
Craig! Craig!

262
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,155
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

263
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,080
JOl: What?

264
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,479
What?

265
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,391
Could I use y'all's
VCR right quick?

266
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,799
I want to dub a tape.

267
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,233
Hell, no!

268
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,151
It's the Mack!

269
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,880
Uh-uh, wait a minute!
Who the fuck is that bitch?

270
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,080
Fuck you, motherfucker!

271
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,640
You think you're slick,
asking me for money!

272
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,756
Well, ask that bitch
for some money!

273
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,840
Damn.

274
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,760
What's wrong with your ho?

275
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,432
Damn!

276
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,950
We had the money right there
in my motherfucking...

277
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,871
We ain't have shit.

278
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,753
So what we gonna do?

279
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,160
Man, that fool's
just playing, man.

280
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,559
I ain't sweatin' it.

281
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,312
That's your problem.

282
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,636
Ain't nobody playin' but you.

283
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,680
You walk up and down
the street all day playing.

284
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,079
He ain't playin'!

285
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,520
You think he playin'
about his money?

286
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,875
You done dragged me into this.

287
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,280
He know where my mama stay.
he know where your mama stay.

288
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,160
You say he had a gun
when you seen him, right?

289
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,559
Yeah.

290
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,471
Well, name one person
in the hood

291
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,913

292
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,717
I know, huh?

293
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,593
Look, man...

294
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,391
I'm sorry I got you
in this shit.

295
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,311
I'm going to tell him

296
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,198
you ain't had nothin'
to do with it.

297
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,078
I smoked up his weed.

298
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,469
I'm gonna face
the consequences.

299
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,229
If I get dealt with,
I get dealt with.

300
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,717
Craig, have you seen my sh...

301
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,997
What's that for?

302
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,558
Protection.

303
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,358
Protection?

304
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,793
Protection from who?

305
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,314
Me and Smokey.

306
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,391
I got to walk Smokey
down to his house.

307
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,320
Aw, man. your mother and l

308
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,675
never would have moved
into this neighborhood

309
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,591
if we had known
you'd need a gun

310
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,398
to walk down the damn street.

311
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,040
You know how it is around here.

312
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,271
Oh, no, son, that's
not the way it is.

313
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,989
Kids today are nothing
but punks, sissified,

314
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,520
so quick to pick up a gun.

315
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,960
You scared to take
an ass whippin'.

316
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,713
This is what makes you a man.

317
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,631
When I was growing up,

318
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,551
this was all the
protection we needed.

319
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,960
You win some, you lose some.

320
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,313
But you live...

321
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,231
You live to fight another day.

322
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,629
You think you're a man
with that gun in your hand,

323
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,789
don't you?

324
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,118
I'm a man without it.

325
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,872
Put the gun down.

326
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,360
(Puts gun down)

327
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,918
Put up your dukes.

328
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,280
Now you're a man.

329
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,430
Your uncle picked up a gun too.

330
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,351
He had to find out
the hard way.

331
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,238
22 years old.

332
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,151
You got a choice.

333
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,071
These are all you need.

334
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,513
Alright?

335
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,597
What's up, man?

336
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,080
What's up, Red?

337
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,957
Ah ah ah! Get your ass up.

338
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,840
They was clownin'
you at work today.

339
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,239
I saw the tape.

340
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,720
We kept rewinding it.

341
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,119
It looked like your head,

342
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,112
but you can't tell from the
back.

343
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,679
How your eye?

344
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,113
Oh, it's cool.

345
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,792
Damn! Damn!

346
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,553
Put your glasses back on.

347
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,280
What's up, Craig?
What's up, Red?

348
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,240
Hey, Smokey, sell me a dub!

349
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,080
Ain't selling you nada.

350
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,433
Come on, homes.

351
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,238
Let's let bygones be bygones.

352
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,040
Raise the fuck up before
Craig's father come out here.

353
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,519
You need to go and do that.

354
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,520
Hell, I ain't selling him shit.

355
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,476
You better get your ass
off your shoulders.

356
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,391
You ain't going
to get me shot up.

357
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,311
You better make that money.
Hurry up.

358
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,515
Hey, Eze.

359
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,238
(Mocks Spanish)

360
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,753
Man, this nigger
got us in some shit.

361
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,831
You know that shit
was fucked up, man.

362
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,831
It's alright.
You have nice legs, man.

363
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,519
Shit, here come Deebo!

364
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,000
Who?

365
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,718
Dee-bo!

366
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,269
I'm going to tuck mine in.

367
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,273
(BIKE FALLS OVER)

368
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,589
What's up, y'all?

369
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,636

01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,400
Shit! That girl wider

553
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,391
Talkin' about she looked
like Janet Jackson.

554
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,240
Oh, no, she didn't go there.

555
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,832
Bitch got out of the car

556
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,751

559
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,880
I'm not trying to laugh.

560
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,235
I just thought that
you two would like each other.

561
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,517
You knew she was baldheaded.
You knew she had no damn hair.

562
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,318
(Laughs)

563
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,594

583
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,320

585
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,429

I almost had the money.

597
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,400
What?

598
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,755
You remember that money we stole
from Stanley house?

599
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,240
Yeah.

600
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,595
Deebo was over Felisha
and Debbie house asleep.

601
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,511
I snuck through
the back window

602
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,960

I tried to beat
his ass, but he ran.

606
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,111

Oh. Now you're getting scared.

618

You want to go

(DIAL TONE)

648
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,473

Man, he just hung up.

650
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,109
I think we better stay

651
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,553
Damn!

652
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,799

01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,320
You, you keep your ass here.

663
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,719
Big Snake, Big Worm...

664
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,552
What kind of a name is that?

665
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,320
I bet y'all drinking that wine

01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,191
There ain't nobody

679
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,111
I don't even know
why I'm trippin'.

680
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,560
Nobody want to mess

682
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,400

01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,309
Quick!

686
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,953
You don't know
who you're messing with!

687
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,912
Aah!

688
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,949

Look and see if they're coming.

692
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,679
Hell, no. You look.

693
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,120
We both look on the count of 3.

694
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,430
1, 2, 3!

695
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,351
Craig, thought you said on 3.

696
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,271
You ain't bullshittin' me?

697
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,191
1, 2, 3!

698
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,680
Craig, what the fuck you...

699
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,079
You see them?

700
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,560
Yeah, they coming, man.

701
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,440
I ain't never going
to smoke weed again.

702
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,795
Craig, I love you, man.

703
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,240
Shut up. Let me go!

704
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,117
(Whimpers)

705
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,437
Shut up, man.

706
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,360
I shot one of them.
I know I shot one of them.

707
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,280
Hey, hey, look again.

708
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,191
Fuck you.

709
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,358
Stanley! Stanley!
What's going on?

710
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,193
I don't know. It sounded
like machine guns.

711
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,680
Oh, Lord.

712
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,079
Mama, where Craig at?

713
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,560
I don't know.

714
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,915
There's Joann. Go ask
her if she's seen them.

715
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Sounded like a bomb.

716
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,752
Joann, you seen Craig
and Smokey in there?

717
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,558
I thought they were over there.

718
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,040
Deebo, you seen Craig
and Smokey around here?

719
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,960
Earlier.

720
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,837
Damn.

721
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,273
What she say?

722
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,360
She ain't seen him, and Deebo
ain't seen him.

723
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,079
MRS JONES: See why you have
to tell us before you leave?

724
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,560
Look at your face!

725
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,154
It'll be OK.
No, look at your face.

726
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,832
Who do you think you are?

727
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,638
What are you talking about?

728
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,200
You know what
I'm talking about, punk.

729
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,520
You hit my sister like
she was a fucking man.

730
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,840
She had no business
going through my pants.

731
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,478
My sister don't need
to steal nothing

732
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,320
from your broke ass.

733
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,594
Take your ass home.

734
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,113
I'm not scared of you.

735
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,880
All these niggers around here

736
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,633
might be scared of you,
but I'm not.

737
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,108
You take your ass home.

738
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,599
No, fuck you.

739
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,400
You're lucky I'm not a man.

740
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,120
Otherwise l'd kick
your ass myself.

741
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,240
Shut up!

742
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,760
Deebo, man, you trippin'.

743
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,035
What you say, little nigger?

744
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,960
Man, that's a female.

745
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,916
Shut your little
punk ass up, nigger,

746
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,230
before I drop you
like I did this bitch.

747
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,072
Man, I ain't trying
to fight you, Deebo.

748
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,839
Ezel.

749
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,520
You want to fight me

750
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,351
'cause you ain't nothin'
but a bitch too.

751
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,960
What are you going
to do with that...

752
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,473
..besides make me mad?

753
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,518
Put the gun down, son.

754
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,192
DEEBO: Huh?

755
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,520
Put the gun down, son.

756
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,875
Yeah. Put that gun down, son,

757
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,236

This was all the protection
we needed.

760

You win some, you lose some.

761
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,520
But you live...

762
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,000
You live to fight another day.

763
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,069
You think you're a man

764
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,680

in your hand, don't you?

765
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,715
I'm a man without it.

767
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,916
Yeah.

768
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,230
Put that gun down, son.

769
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,231
And get knocked down
like your father used to.

770
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,555
Give me the gun, son.

771
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,040

772
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,110

8:30. Why?

842
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,308
I was just wondering

843
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,120
if maybe you were
feeling better,

844
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,236
then, um, you could come over.

845
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,993
I'm feeling better already.

846

913
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,800
# Used to be damned,
now we just crack dead

914
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,155
# He's about
as hard as Darth Vader

915
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,600
# In his sweatshirt,
khakis, and chuck taylors

916
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,955
# Just seen them
in the driveway

917
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,400
# Getting beat like a smoker,
fool, 'cause it's Friday

918
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,755
# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

919
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,671
# If you don't care

920
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,558
# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

921
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,949
# If you don't care, fool

922
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,910
# Why must I be like that
and chase the cat?

923
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,831
# Or settle for a hood rack?

924
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,320
# Do be brave

925
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,675
# No dreadlocks flying
in and out of town

926
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,591
# With half a chicken
and a cock

927
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,669
# And I love her

928
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,478
# 'Cause she dared
to fuck around

929
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,960
# With the underground

930
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,840
# Pussy hound, and her ass
is big, round, and wide

931
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,195
# Jacked up,
making niggers down the rye

932
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,078
# Smoking in dope,
playing that super Nintendo

933
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,991
# Hear a rat-a-tat
on my window

934
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,911
# There goes that
pelvic thrust

935
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,798
# Don't trust a rubber,
'cause it's bound to bust

936
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,240
# In the oven, in the nappy

937
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,160
# I had on 2, so I was happy

938
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,470
# 'Cause that HIV will
make your dick hang sideways

939
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,358
# And that ain't cool, fool,
'cause it's Friday

940
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,194
# Throw your neighbourhood
in the air, if you don't care

941
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,078
# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

942
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,151
# If you don't care. #
