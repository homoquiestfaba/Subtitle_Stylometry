I'm not.

You know, when people
suspect a conspiracy,

33
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,126
but don't have any proof,
that's paranoia.

34
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,894
Yeah, just because
you're paranoid.

Don't hold it against them,

tryin' to kiss me.

301
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:39,023

First, the security report,
and then HR.

307
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,648
Everyone was half zoned out
like they don't even care.

308
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,019
So I told 'em I was leavin'.
They can fuckin' fire me.

309
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:09,920

stay and work after that?

311
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,824
Do not... they can't know about
this.

312
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,692
The navy captain came on
the emergency broadcast.

313

- Uh, the signal cut out.

314
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,696
- People are changed.
- And people aren't themselves.

315
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:20,697
- They...
- Trust no one.

316
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,066
They're organized.

317
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:23,334
They're takin' over
the military and the government.

318
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,368
And then he's like,
"Stay back, I have a gun."

319
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,202
- It's happening.
- JANE: Are you fuckin' kiddin'?

320
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,004
It's not paranoia,
it's happening.

321
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,206
JANE:
Oh my God!

322
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:35,112
I mean, so many people like us.
Patients, their families.

323
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:37,148
Everyone's convinced
that people aren't themselves.

324
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:44,221
Whatever this is...
it's contagious.

325
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:47,858
- Something in the air?
- JANE: No.

326
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,326
No, no, I doubt.

327
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,228
I... I mean, I... seriously,
I wasn't at the hospital

328
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:53,931
for five minutes before
they called us down to the ER.

329
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:56,300
And we still couldn't keep up.

330
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,270
I mean, it was... I've never
seen anything like it.

331
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:03,841
There was car accidents,
suicide attempts, assaults,

332
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,042
- shootings.
- KIM: There were shootings?

333
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,709
- Yeah! Yeah.
- This is bad, right?

334
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,812
- Okay, d... don't panic.
- JANE: (overlapping speech)

335
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,947
Look, we... we're here,
we're okay.

336
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,849
I'll help, I'll take care of us.

337
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:15,152
Just don't drink the tap water.
I don't trust it. Okay?

338
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,123
There's bottles of water
in the fridge, Kim, okay?

339
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,793
Hey, Kim.

340
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:25,262
- You okay?
- Not really.

341
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,764
I don't know where
my Uncle Kurt is.

342
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:28,665
And my mom,
I can't call her.

343
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:30,835
I know. I'm worried
about my mom, too.

344
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:32,903
KIM: Landline's down, too.
I can't reach anybody.

345
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,105
What about your sister?

346
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:35,873
MAC: I can't worry
about her right now.

347
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,208
Oh God.

348
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,710
- I can't believe...
- MAC: Bill's coming.

349
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:41,779
- Mac, I don't want him in here.
- MAC: I know.

350
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:42,580
JANE: I mean, seriously,
don't trust anyone.

351
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,613
- MAC: I know, just...
- JANE: Mac!

352
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,950
- MAC: I will handle it!
- (overlapping speech)

353
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:48,853
Hey, Bill.

354
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:52,022
Hey, Mac. I got your power saw.

355
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:55,658
Jane, Kim, what's going on?

356
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,929
Jane had a rough day
at the hospital.

357
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,965
With everything that's goin' on,
we can't be too careful.

358
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:02,766
BILL:
What do you mean?

359
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,835
We spoke about this morning.

360
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:05,970
People aren't right.

361
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,440
She thinks it might be
contagious.

362
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,275
Hmm.

363
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,110
MAC:
You haven't turned on the radio?

364
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:14,311
No.

365
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:16,380
Apparently, if we don't
report to an emergency shelter,

366
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:17,982
we're breakin' the law.

367
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:18,883
- BILL: Oh?
- Shut the door.

368
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,217
- Shut it.
- Wait.

369
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,891
You haven't turned on
your phone, huh?

370
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:28,691
- Or the TV?
- No.

371
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,262
I think we could all use
a little less technology

372
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,197
- every now and then.
- Shut the door.

373
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,732
Have you seriously not noticed
the way people are acting?

374
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,101
No.

375
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,837
Actually, I find it to be
quite peaceful and all.

376
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,338
Peaceful? Are you kidding me?

377
00:23:41,372 --> 00:23:46,243
Jane, Mac,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

378
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:51,182
Get off him!

379
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:52,149
Kim, help me!

380
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:58,289
Oh, Jane!
Jane, where are you going?

381
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:02,893
Stop it. Stop it.

382
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:08,698
Get the fuck off of him. Now.

383
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,209
(♪♪♪)

384
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,295
MAC:
What was that, huh?

385
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:40,397
JANE:
Just tell us.

386
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:41,999
MAC:
Why did you attack me?

387
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,267
JANE:
Just give us some answers here.

388
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:46,437
MAC: He knows what's goin'
on, clearly.

389
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,737
He's part of it.

390
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,374
- Say something, Bill!
- Wait!

391
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,443
Whatever this is,
it's physical.

392
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:56,180
Some sort of infection or virus.

393
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,782
Rabies. That causes confusion
and aggression.

394
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,453
Not feeling like yourself today,
Mr. Costello?

395
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,121
I'm a changed man, Kim.

396
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:06,857
Changed?

397
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,425
That's right.

398
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,361
JANE:
But you're still Bill Costello.

399
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:12,029
Well, who else would I be?

400
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,530
Then tell me about
last Christmas.

401
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,432
BILL:
You were here with us.

402
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:19,069
Another Jane and Mac
Christmas extravaganza

403
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:22,206
that your mother skipped
to be with her latest boyfriend.

404
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,174
Tayden even let you
sip some champagne

405
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,943
when your uncle wasn't lookin'.

406
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:29,813
When Kurt found out,
he was angry at you both.

407
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,484
MAC:
Okay. You're you.

408
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:35,819
Why're you acting so weird?

409
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:39,189
I've been perfected. Changed.

410
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:40,958
MAC:
Changed, how?

411
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:46,597
I was kissed yesterday
by a wonderful red-haired woman.

412
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,968
It was perfection. Bliss.

413
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,603
MAC: Wait, so you were tryin'
to kiss me this morning?

414
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,838
- Wait, he tried to kiss you?
- I thought he was kidding.

415
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:58,042
That's it.

416
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:59,276
That's why Ethan
tried to kiss you.

417
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,943
- That...
- Yeah.

418
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:00,744
That's how they're doing it.

419
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,513
That's how they're
changing people.

420
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:05,182
JANE:
Tell us.

421
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,016
- MAC: What the fuck?
- KIM: Now what?

422
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,084
- MAC: Shut up, shut up.
- Shh, shh!

423
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:09,420
- Maybe it's Uncle Kurt.
- MAC: Shh! Kim, be quiet.

424
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:10,387
JANE:
Stay still.

425
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:13,357
- KIM: But...
- MAC: Shh. Don't... don't move.

426
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:16,093
- KIM: But what if it's him?
- JANE: Kim, quiet.

427
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,597
- That's his knock!
- MAC: Kim, stop!

428
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,271
BILL:
None of this is necessary, Jane.

429
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,008
Why don't you just
surrender to me?

430
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,242
Quiet.

431
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,311
(Banging on door)

432
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:38,415
KURT:
Kim, you here?

433
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:43,153
(Banging on door)

434
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:45,956
KURT:
Mac, Jane, you in here?

435
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,392
What? Your car's
in the driveway,

436
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:50,327
but you're not home? Come on.

437
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:51,995
KIM:
He sounds fine to me.

438
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,964
Yeah.

439
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,567
KURT: Can you tell me what is this
saw doin' out here on the ground?

440
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,402
- Right. Total asshole.
- KURT: Kim?

441
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:05,008
(♪♪♪)

442
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:09,179
KURT:
Kim?

443
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,982
MAC:
Yeah, Kurt, she's in here.

444
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,417
KURT: Well,
you're gonna open the door or what?

445
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,489
MAC:
How're you doin'?

446
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:20,157
I'm tired.
How do you think I'm doin'?

447
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,327
MAC:
Everything okay with you?

448
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,630
Mac, I'm beat. Long day.

449
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:29,233
I wanna get Kim home, eat,
and fall asleep in my chair.

450
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,567
Where is she?

451
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,608
Everything okay with you?

452
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,176
MAC: You notice anything
strange goin' on out there?

453
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,544
Like what?

454
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,413
MAC:
Like people acting different?

455
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:44,448
Yeah. You.

456
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,716
MAC: You haven't noticed
people acting different?

457
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,251
What people?

458
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:49,019
MAC:
Most people.

459
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,354
You know me.

460
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,089
I mind my own business,
get the same in return.

461
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:53,357
Look, is Kim in there or not?

462
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:59,496
(♪♪♪)

463
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:06,203
Let's go, huh?

464
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,605
I don't wanna have to
make dinner twice.

465
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,207
Did you see anyone
outside the house?

466
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:12,409
KURT:
No. What's wrong with you two?

467
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,111
You haven't turned on
your radio?

468
00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:15,979
The radio? No.

469
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,347
How about you stop
asking me questions?

470
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:19,049
Just tell me
what the problem is.

471
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,384
MAC:
We're not sure.

472
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,985
There's a situation
and it's growing.

473
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:25,022
- People are acting...
- Strange.

474
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:28,325
Different. They're changed.

475
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,993
They're themselves,
but they're not.

476
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:35,532
You're saying
you haven't noticed

477
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,201
anything about anyone out there.

478
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,102
You know I'm by myself all day
drivin' state to state

479
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,370
for the dealership.

480
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,674
MAC: You haven't heard
emergency broadcasts.

481
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:44,541
You haven't seen anything.

482
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,743
I listen to my music,
not the radio.

483
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,780
You're acting like a lunatic,
Mac.

484
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,113
Jane thinks
it's some sort of sickness

485
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,682
that's going around.

486
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:54,251
KURT: Okay, I don't care if
people are acting different

487
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:56,186
or strange
or if everybody in town

488
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,789
is infected
with the bubonic plague.

489
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,289
You know, I put in
over 600 miles

490
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,424
of 95 North today.

491
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,659
So, Kim, let's go. Now.

492
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:07,731
Something's really,
really wrong, Uncle Kurt.

493
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,666
We've got Mr. Costello
in the basement.

494
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,602
Whatever it is, he's got it.

495
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:12,503
- Bill?
- MAC: Yeah.

496
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:14,037
KIM:
Yes, Bill.

497
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:15,739
What's he got now?

498
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,441
KIM: You need to come
see for yourself.

499
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,614
Are you kidding me?
This... this is a joke, right?

500
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:25,115
MAC:
Are you not listening?

501
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:26,583
What the hell did they do
to you, Bill?

502
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:29,353
- They tied me to this chair.
- Yeah, pretty shitty job.

503
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,154
MAC:
He's not going anywhere.

504
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,589
- Look, she's 16.
- KIM: 17.

505
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:34,091
I... I'm gonna kill you, guys.

506
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:34,792
JANE: Stop bein' so
bull-headed and just listen!

507
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:36,761
No! This is a goddamn felony.

508
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:38,462
- We had no choice!
- He attacked me!

509
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:39,596
It's true, Uncle Kurt!

510
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,767
- Get off!
- KIM: Ask him a question.

511
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,468
Look, they are holding a man
prisoner, Kim.

512
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,335
I'm not gonna be a part of this.

513
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,771
You are not gonna be
a part of this!

514
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,171
Tell us how you've changed.

515
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,209
What would you like to know?

516
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,176
KIM:
What if we let you go?

517
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,779
I'd change all of you.

518
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:56,613
KURT: You'd change us. What...
what's that supposed to mean?

519
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:58,615
KIM: It means if you untie him,
he'll try to make out with you.

520
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:00,584
It's a means to an end, Kim.

521
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:02,152
To serenity.

522
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,860
Whatever this is,
my best guess is

523
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:11,128
that it's transmitted
through saliva.

524
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:12,596
Something about that compels
to change

525
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,565
- to propagate it willingly.
- KURT: Oh my God.

526
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:15,432
MAC: He attacked me,
he tried to kiss me.

527
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,533
That's why we tied him
to the chair!

528
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:19,136
Oh. Oh, he tried to kiss
you. So how does that work?

529
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,270
Like a cold
that makes you different

530
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:21,738
but not really?

531
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,506
MAC: I don't know. I don't know.
He's from outer space.

532
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:24,107
What do you want from me?
Ask him!

533
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:25,342
W... what's the deal, Bill?

534
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,177
- You into guys now?
- You wouldn't believe me.

535
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,713
- KURT: Maybe I will.
- We're trying to help you.

536
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,748
KURT: We? Who's we? What?
Like little green men?

537
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:33,417
No, not exactly.

538
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,486
- I'm gonna put a stop to this.
- (Overlapping conversation)

539
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,322
Hey! Look, obviously,
he's got a screw loose.

540
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:39,489
- This can't be helping.
- KIM: Just listen!

541
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:40,691
You have no idea
what the fuck is goin' on.

542
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:41,960
- Stop!
- JANE: Oh my God!

543
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:42,659
KURT: I know. I know that you
and your loony wife put us

544
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:43,694
into this fucked-up situation.

545
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:44,461
MAC: He attacked me,
I didn't do anything!

546
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:46,163
KURT:
No, no, you attacked him.

547
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:52,235
(♪♪♪)

548
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:00,778
- KURT: You attacked him.
- MAC: That's not what happened.

549
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:02,914
KURT: Yeah, what do you drag
a 16-year-old into this mess?

550
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:03,915
MAC:
Oh, you give a shit about her.

551
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,549
Get off him!

552
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,453
Holy fuck, Jane. What the fuck?

553
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,622
I was attacked
by my supervisor.

554
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:13,724
And I've known him
for five years!

555
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:16,193
Then Bill attacks Mac.

556
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:19,396
We have to deal with whatever's
going on here, not you!

557
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,565
So fucking listen!

558
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,675
What does it mean to be changed?

559
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:34,311
What do you wanna
change us into?

560
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:37,180
I want to perfect you.

561
00:31:37,214 --> 00:31:38,348
JANE:
How?

562
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:42,352
We have the power
to usher in the next incarnation

563
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:45,355
of your existence
on this plane.

564
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,861
JANE:
You're still not convinced?

565
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:51,294
KURT:
He's gotta be on drugs.

566
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:54,231
He's not the only person
acting that way.

567
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:54,899
That's what we're tryin'
to tell you.

568
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:55,933
All my friends, Uncle Kurt.

569
00:31:56,968 --> 00:32:00,437
What would that be like
if we let you change us?

570
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,205
Perfect order.

571
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:07,344
Perfect satisfaction predicated
by perfect productivity.

572
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,847
We're gonna penetrate
each and every one of you

573
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:14,284
to reveal the face
that you failed to recognize.

574
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:18,488
Halcyon, days and nights,
and so on forever.

575
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,793
Perfect harmony,
perfect balance.

576
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:25,763
A peaceful coexistence
with every living creature

577
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:29,934
on this incredible,
organic machine.

578
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,869
Inside of each of you,

579
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:36,573
I can unlock the true potential
of humanity.

580
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,880
JANE: Okay,
so if you're not Bill anymore...

581
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:50,320
why shouldn't I put you down
like a rabid dog?

582
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,856
I am Bill.

583
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:55,559
Changed.

584
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:57,728
KURT: Look, um,
you put that gun down, Jane,

585
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,362
- or I'm gonna take it from you.
- Oh, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

586
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,397
Come on.

587
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,833
I'm just tryin' to make a point.

588
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:03,734
Are you getting it?

589
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:08,371
MAC:
Back off. Settle down!

590
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:09,539
I'm settled.

591
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,409
(Bill clears throat)

592
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:22,319
Excuse me, but can I have
a glass of water, please?

593
00:33:22,352 --> 00:33:24,588
Huh. Yeah, sure. Why not?

594
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,690
I'll get you some water.

595
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,760
- You got this?
- I got it.

596
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:31,261
Thank you.

597
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,637
(Sara vocalizing)

598
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:55,887
Hi.

599
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,021
MAC:
What do you want?

600
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:01,725
Why don't you come outside
so you can see me better?

601
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,326
MAC:
I can see you right now.

602
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,799
Look, I just hope I didn't
make you uncomfortable before.

603
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,667
MAC:
Nope, I'm fine.

604
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:13,503
You like what you saw?

605
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,273
MAC:
I didn't say that.

606
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:18,341
You can fuck me if you want to.

607
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,912
I don't mind.

608
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:24,015
And it'll change your life.

609
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:25,883
MAC:
Please, leave. Okay?

610
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,517
Just please, leave.

611
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,453
(Siren blaring in distance)

612
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,424
I said, "Go. Leave!"

613
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:54,711
(♪♪♪)

614
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,548
Mac, come on!

615
00:34:58,582 --> 00:34:59,984
- Wait.
- They're gonna kill each other.

616
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,152
- Wait, what? What?
- Let's go!

617
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,420
(Overlapping conversation)

618
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:03,888
- Back up.
- Oh, you don't get it.

619
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:04,721
This is bullshit.

620
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:05,890
Shut the fuck up.

621
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:06,924
Really I'm warning you
I'm gonna show you how I shoot!

622
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:07,691
No, and there is no fucking
magic space virus!

623
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:08,658
JANE:
You want me to shoot you?

624
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,694
- Oh my God!
- You're a nurse, not a fucking...

625
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:11,695
You don't even know
what the fuck is going on!

626
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:12,362
- You're a nurse, not a doctor!
- Let go of me!

627
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:13,865
MAC:
Back off. Just stop!

628
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,101
There are people out there
right now,

629
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,036
definitely watching us.

630
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,370
What?

631
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:25,442
JANE:
See, something's happening.

632
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,948
MAC: It was that girl
from this morning.

633
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:32,449
Tried to get me to come outside.

634
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:33,818
JANE:
Sara.

635
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:35,820
MAC: Yeah, Kim saw her.
She tried to seduce me.

636
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,121
She's pulled the same stunt.

637
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:38,555
- JANE: Wait, just now?
- MAC: Just now.

638
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:39,991
I swear I saw people
hiding in the backyard.

639
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:41,092
Just before Jane got home.

640
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:45,930
- I'm gonna look for myself.
- MAC: Just wait!

641
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:47,098
They're gonna know
that we're onto them.

642
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,466
Uh, they're gonna see you.

643
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:50,935
Please, trust me.

644
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:52,169
They're sitting there
perfectly still

645
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:54,038
watching us for God knows what.

646
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:57,174
He knows.

647
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:04,714
(♪♪♪)

648
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,760
Tell us what's goin' on.

649
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,031
BILL: You promised
me a drink of water.

650
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,232
Who are you people?

651
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,900
We're changed.

652
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,003
And you can be, too.

653
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:29,006
Listen to me my neighbors...

654
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,777
Everything that
your friend Bill was, I am.

655
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:37,248
Only better.

656
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:40,517
Every detail,
every human experience

657
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,054
absorbed in perfect unity.

658
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,922
You have nothing to lose.

659
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,589
Everything to gain.

660
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,225
Come on! This is bullshit.

661
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:52,096
BILL: Mac,
how many times have you told me

662
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,564
that all you want
is the freedom to do

663
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,901
what you want,
when you want.

664
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:59,904
And I've watched you.
I've watched you pursue it.

665
00:36:59,937 --> 00:37:03,174
Money, status, dreams.

666
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:07,544
And deep down, you know
it's all a damn lie.

667
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:11,282
There is no happiness
or freedom to be had.

668
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:15,086
Species as selfish
and aggressive as yours

669
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,722
will never find peace.

670
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:21,892
But if you join us,
you will have the answer

671
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:26,163
to every question that
you'll never care to ask again.

672
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:29,800
No more confusion or worry.

673
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,634
Desires gone.

674
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,105
No fear or doubt!

675
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:37,775
You will know certainty.

676
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,844
Tranquility.

677
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:43,080
Bliss.

678
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:46,050
You're gonna save us, huh?

679
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,517
Save us from ourselves?

680
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,655
BILL: The world as
you know it is over.

681
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,591
Be a part of this.

682
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:57,061
Be with us.

683
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,561
Mmhmm.

684
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:02,066
See, the way I see it,

685
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,301
you murdered my best friend.

686
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:05,369
KURT:
Mac, don't. No, come on.

687
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:06,804
You don't know what's
really goin' on out there.

688
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:07,805
I got a pretty goddamn
good idea.

689
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:08,939
Yeah, well, maybe
what you think is happening,

690
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:11,042
- it's... it's... it's all a hoax.
- MAC: Come on, Kurt.

691
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:13,710
KURT: Yeah, maybe...
maybe Bill's gone crazy.

692
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:15,645
No.

693
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:19,016
Whatever this soulless
piece of shit is, he's not Bill.

694
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,951
- Not anymore.
- Yeah, but what if you're wrong?

695
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:23,686
Okay, you cannot go around
just blowin' people's heads off.

696
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,957
If he's right, it's the end
of the world, right?

697
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:29,960
The rapture? Right, Bill?

698
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,796
- Right? Right, Bill?
- KURT: Mac!

699
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,064
Stop, Mac, stop it!
It isn't right!

700
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:36,767
I know you.
I know the peace you seek.

701
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:41,072
- Please.
- BILL: Be with us.

702
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,174
- Mac.
- Be a part of this.

703
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:49,980
(♪♪♪)

704
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,952
I need time out.

705
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:56,586
JANE:
Mac!

706
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:09,732
Okay, okay look, Kim.
I'm... I'm the one in charge now.

707
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,168
Whatever.

708
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:16,673
(Inhales, exhales)

709
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:24,747
BILL:
Kurt, can you kindly untie me?

710
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:27,384
Look you just..just keep
your fucking mouth shut.

711
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:33,190
Oh my God.

712
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:38,295
(♪♪♪♪)

713
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,960
(Breathing heavily)

714
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,829
You fuckin' know me?

715
00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:13,797
Huh? You know what I want?

716
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,100
Huh? You think
you fuckin' know me, huh?

717
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,868
What are you gonna do, Mac?
What are you gonna do?

718
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:18,869
Fucking do?
What are you gonna do?

719
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:19,970
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

720
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:20,838
What are you gonna do?

721
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:22,840
I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! Fuck!

722
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:23,673
Oh my God, think, think, think,

723
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:25,142
think, think, think,
think, think.

724
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:26,743
Fuck.

725
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:29,079
Come on, Mac, figure it out.

726
00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:31,148
Jesus. Fuck!

727
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:35,152
Everything's fine up here!
Everything's fine!

728
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:39,123
Okay. You got this.

729
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,759
Come on. You got this.

730
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:48,232
All right. You got this.

731
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:50,000
You got this.

732
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:53,204
(Breathing heavily)

733
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:57,041
What am I gonna do?

734
00:40:58,842 --> 00:41:03,746
(♪♪♪)

735
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,839
There is no good reason
not to untie me.

736
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:31,809
I told you to shut up.
I'm thinking.

737
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,181
BILL: The energy in this
house has gotten still.

738
00:41:37,214 --> 00:41:38,515
Don't you think so?
I mean, we could all use some...

739
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:39,516
Look, would you just
shut your mouth

740
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,218
for five goddamn seconds,
so I can figure out

741
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:43,354
- what to do?
- Both of you, shut up.

742
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:48,058
BILL: You and I are in
similar circumstances, Kurt.

743
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:49,994
Oh, you think so?

744
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:52,796
I'm not tied to a chair,
I haven't gone schizo.

745
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,866
Mac and Jane's position of power
and authority is limited

746
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,001
to this house.

747
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:58,902
- Do you understand that?
- No.

748
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:02,206
Divide and conquer.

749
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,108
- That's your plan?
- Oh my God.

750
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:05,843
Zen masters aren't above
that sort of thing?

751
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:06,577
Okay, none of this makes sense.

752
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,945
I... I need you to explain to me.

753
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:11,482
Explain to me
what's wrong with you.

754
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:14,451
I'm a changed man.

755
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:17,221
Yup, changed. That much I got.

756
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:22,826
(♪♪♪)

757
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,001
Please!

758
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:34,104
Tell me what you want.

759
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:39,076
(♪♪♪♪)

760
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:10,240
Have you come to join us, Kim?

761
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:18,148
(♪♪♪)

762
00:43:23,587 --> 00:43:25,923
You guys are playin'
a prank on me, right?

763
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:27,424
Kim put you up to this?

764
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:31,962
Are you acting in accordance
with what you think is right?

765
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:37,267
Listen, I don't like
what's happening at all.

766
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,169
Any of it.

767
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,105
But there is definitely
something wrong with you.

768
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:42,539
Can you both stop talking?

769
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:45,109
What if your actions here
today, right now,

770
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,945
were placed under the scrutiny
of judgment?

771
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:50,481
If this isn't a prank,

772
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,216
I'm not responsible
for any of it.

773
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:54,618
I'm a victim, just like you.

774
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:57,154
Always suffering
for the deeds of others,

775
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:59,356
aren't you, Kurt?

776
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,425
Sleep is blindness.

777
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:06,163
You know the truth,
but you resent it.

778
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:10,267
You'll always be alone.

779
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,636
Loveless.

780
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,371
Loveless?

781
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:21,278
So, if I drink the Kool-Aid,

782
00:44:22,713 --> 00:44:25,616
- all that's gonna change?
- BILL: Yes.

783
00:44:27,017 --> 00:44:28,385
One kiss?

784
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:30,921
Yes.

785
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,059
Okay.

786
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:39,463
Okay.

787
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:45,002
You are batshit crazy.

788
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,139
BILL: If you think that
my mental clarity is gone,

789
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:51,575
why don't you take me
to a doctor?

790
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,310
That would be
the right thing to do.

791
00:44:53,343 --> 00:44:55,412
She won't let me.

792
00:44:55,446 --> 00:44:57,981
The other loony's got the gun,
in case you missed that.

793
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,619
BILL:
That's all right, Kurt.

794
00:45:02,653 --> 00:45:05,055
I know you're not the man
in charge here.

795
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,325
Hmm.

796
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:20,737
Are you changed?

797
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:25,542
Are you ready?

798
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:31,148
I don't know.
It feels like giving up.

799
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,550
It's not weakness.

800
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:36,320
It's strength to accept change.
Life is change.

801
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:41,325
Are you all connected?
The same mind?

802
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,195
No. We remain self-contained,

803
00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:47,765
united in the pursuit
of absolute truth.

804
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:50,234
KIM:
I don't know, Sara.

805
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:55,672
What we offer is clarity
in the deepest sense,

806
00:45:55,706 --> 00:46:00,277
unburdened by concepts
of good and evil.

807
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,513
The changed don't see
moral categories

808
00:46:02,546 --> 00:46:06,550
as a force to resist
but as opaqueness.

809
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:10,387
You remain yourself,
yet like a lens wiped clean,

810
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,190
the light can shine through.

811
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,225
So all that I am remains?

812
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:16,593
SARA:
Yes.

813
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,631
I need you to promise me
that I'll still be me.

814
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:22,065
Why would you want that?

815
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:27,070
Your desire to stay what you are
is what limits you.

816
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,207
But you are different.

817
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:32,709
You are.

818
00:46:32,743 --> 00:46:34,645
You're brave,
that's why you're here now.

819
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,548
The others?

820
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,750
What I am,
what you'll become,

821
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:43,487
would be incomprehensible
to them, except as gods.

822
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:49,293
(Breathing heavily)

823
00:46:50,327 --> 00:46:55,232
(♪♪♪)

824
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:58,735
All right.

825
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:10,347
JANE:
Mac, get the fuck down here!

826
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,682
Mac!

827
00:47:16,854 --> 00:47:19,323
You're making
the right decision, Kim.

828
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,831
(ECHOING)
Kiss me, Kim.

829
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:29,499
And it'll happen.

830
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:35,272
I can't.

831
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:45,215
(♪♪♪)

832
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:46,683
Kim.

833
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,557
Don't fight it when it comes.

834
00:47:58,729 --> 00:48:03,634
(♪♪♪)

835
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:10,407
Soon.

836
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,885
MAC:
Just listen.

837
00:48:20,918 --> 00:48:23,220
Can you fuckin' listen for once?

838
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,254
KURT:
No!

839
00:48:24,287 --> 00:48:27,157
(Indistinct conversation)

840
00:48:28,793 --> 00:48:31,628
MAC: How many times do we
need to go through this?

841
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,665
- Guys, just settle down!
- (Overlapping conversation)

842
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,200
KURT:
Who the fuck put you in charge?

843
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:38,435
Calm down, huh?

844
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:39,137
KURT: Oh, well, no,
easy for you to say.

845
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,938
You're the one with a shotgun!

846
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:42,673
Everybody gets a gun
but Kurt, right?

847
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:44,776
We shoot skeet,
we're not a gun show!

848
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:46,576
- KIM: Stop fighting!
- We have two guns!

849
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,512
KIM: Did any of you
even notice I was gone?

850
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,216
KURT:
You know what? Fuck this.

851
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,584
You're on your own.

852
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:56,553
And when you're done
torturing him,

853
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:57,521
you better find a good lawyer,

854
00:48:57,554 --> 00:48:59,322
because I'm gonna
throw the book at you two.

855
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:01,859
This one's gone wackadoo
and she's a fuckin' minor.

856
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:03,326
MAC: Are you talkin'
about lawyers right now?

857
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,328
- You can't be this dense.
- KURT: Come on, Kim.

858
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,931
This isn't our problem.
Not anymore.

859
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:08,866
KIM:
It's not safe out there.

860
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,600
KURT:
I'm goin', with or without you.

861
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:11,735
MAC: Are you serious?
JANE: Really?

862
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:12,804
You're gonna leave your
niece. That's your solution.

863
00:49:12,837 --> 00:49:15,706
KURT: If the world is
ending, and it's not,

864
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:16,640
it's gonna end for me
in the comfort

865
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:18,642
of my own home.

Are you kidding?

Listen!

All of you just shut up
and listen!

00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:28,719
I went out there.
I talked to Sara.

871
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:33,024
One of my friends from school
was there, too.

872
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:35,993
Sara asked to change me
and I thought about it.

873
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:40,330
- I really thought about it.
- MAC: Why?

874
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:43,400
Why wouldn't I?
Look at the alternative!

875
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,601
- MAC: Are you serious?
- JANE: Kim.

876
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:46,670
- Hey, I didn't, did I?
- BILL: You will.

877
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:50,574
It's only natural to fear
what you don't understand.

878
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,676
But you want to understand, Kim.

879
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:53,978
KURT:
Jesus Christ.

880
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:55,780
We do not know for sure
what is really goin' on

881
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:56,480
out there, if anything.

882
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:58,381
I just told you what's going on!

883
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,851
They know we're in here
and they're coming in after us!

884
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:00,918
I told you they were out there.

885
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:02,652
Wait, she just said
they're coming in after us?

886
00:50:02,686 --> 00:50:04,321
- Basically.
- JANE: When?

887
00:50:04,354 --> 00:50:05,522
Soon.

888
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:06,758
JANE: Are your people
going to attack?

889
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:07,859
There is a timeline.

890
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:09,761
KURT: Oh, Kim.
Kim, you need to mind me, okay?

891
00:50:09,794 --> 00:50:11,495
So let's go now.

892
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:12,964
KIM: Uncle Kurt, even if you
don't, the rest of us know

893
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:15,066
this has been building up
for at least a month.

894
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,834
For whatever reason,
you're still you

895
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,836
and I'm still me,
but we're in the minority now.

896
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,838
We need to stick together.

897
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:22,039
MAC:
Kurt.

898
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:23,673
JANE:
Come on.

899
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:25,877
KURT:
I'm done.

900
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,678
Stay here. Come with me.
I don't give a shit.

901
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:29,579
KIM:
Uncle Kurt!

902
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,481
JANE:
Go ahead, I'm right behind you.

903
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:36,353
(♪♪♪♪)

904
00:50:36,386 --> 00:50:39,723
Go ahead, Judas.
Say somethin' smart.

905
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,393
You do anything while I'm gone,

906
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:45,629
I'll be the one
to blow your head off.

907
00:50:46,831 --> 00:50:48,431
Behave.

908
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:52,569
MAC:
Don't go out there, Kurt! Stop.

909
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:53,503
They're out there, hiding.

910
00:50:53,537 --> 00:50:55,106
They're not just gonna
let you walk home.

911
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:56,774
- Don't be an idiot.
- I'm the idiot?

912
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:58,876
This is all an elaborate hoax,

913
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,677
- you'll see.
- It's not a hoax.

914
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,079
KURT: Tomorrow, you'll see!
Or else you're all prankin' me!

915
00:51:02,113 --> 00:51:03,948
Why don't you just admit
you're scared, Uncle Kurt?

916
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,817
I'm scared, too.
We all are!

917
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:08,052
MAC: Don't go out there.
Don't do this.

918
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:09,586
KIM:
What's wrong with you?

919
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:11,488
You're the only one
who doesn't get it.

920
00:51:11,521 --> 00:51:13,423
What, you wanna go home
and sit on your ass?

921
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:16,027
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?

922
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:20,664
Just like your useless
bitch of a mother slut,

923
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:23,700
gets herself knocked up
and for the rest of my life

924
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:25,502
that makes you my problem!

925
00:51:27,872 --> 00:51:31,943
I'm goin' home now
to sit on my ass!

926
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:33,376
MAC:
Hey, hey!

927
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,879
JANE:
No, Mac.

928
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,622
KURT:
Hey, what...

929
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,624
Hey, you, stop, stop,
stop right there, okay?

930
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:49,794
Just stop. Just back off!

931
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,728
All of you, just...
just back off!

932
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:53,097
What do you want?
You... you want people?

933
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,866
There's people right...
right there in that house.

934
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:57,701
Get them.
Right there, get them!

935
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:59,569
Those people in that house!
I didn't do anything.

936
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:02,039
- We need to do something.
- No. No.

937
00:52:02,073 --> 00:52:03,740
No, Mac.

938
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:06,043
- KURT: Oh, let go!
- He asked for this.

939
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,046
KURT:
Oh!

940
00:52:10,815 --> 00:52:12,083
You asked for this.

941
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:17,054
(♪♪♪)

942
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:28,632
(♪♪♪)

943
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:56,854
(♪♪♪)

944
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:26,616
- I should have helped him.
- No.

945
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:29,552
There's nothing
we could have done.

946
00:54:33,758 --> 00:54:35,259
I don't know how to feel.

947
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:38,229
He seems okay.

948
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:40,697
He's not dead.

949
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:43,600
Looks like it was painless.

950
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:48,839
Maybe I should have done it,
too.

951
00:54:48,873 --> 00:54:51,108
- Sara made it sound pretty cool.
- No.

952
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:53,244
You're better than that, Kim.

953
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:55,678
Gee, thanks dad.

954
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:00,951
I don't know why you
wanna change who you are.

955
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:04,554
We think you're pretty awesome.

956
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:09,260
Thanks, but my life sucks.

957
00:55:10,627 --> 00:55:11,728
Not like Sara.

958
00:55:13,197 --> 00:55:15,366
She graduated
when I was a freshman.

959
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:19,170
Different crowd. Popular.

960
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,338
We hardly knew each other.

961
00:55:21,372 --> 00:55:23,340
Now, she was nice to me.

962
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:29,880
Being a teenager sucks.

963
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:38,756
Yeah, Kim. You can be right.

964
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:40,825
They... they seem to have it
better than us.

965
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,761
Peaceful.

966
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:49,266
But rewinding
the last few weeks in my head,

967
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,669
knowing who's who,
who's changed,

968
00:55:52,702 --> 00:55:54,671
and pretty much when...

969
00:55:57,674 --> 00:55:59,276
it's like they have no souls.

970
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:04,949
They're missing that spark.

971
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:06,784
You know,
they're livin' life

972
00:56:06,817 --> 00:56:09,220
right alongside you.

973
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:10,955
But you're not in it alone.

974
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:16,794
Just like Bill.

975
00:56:18,028 --> 00:56:19,729
Empty.

976
00:56:25,402 --> 00:56:27,238
I'm not ready to give up.

977
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,708
Life's hard.

978
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,279
And whatever they are,

979
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:37,982
they may change
every single last one of us.

980
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:42,820
They're gonna find that out
soon enough.

981
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:52,796
Good news, Bill.
We're walkin' you out of here.

982
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,765
JANE: It'd be wise if
you keep your mouth shut.

983
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:56,767
Don't give us any trouble.

984
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,068
And tell your friends
the next one of you clones

985
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:00,804
comes to the door,
try something funny,

986
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:03,174
I'll start shooting.
Consider it self-defense.

987
00:57:03,207 --> 00:57:05,176
Nah. No,
you're not gonna shoot me.

988
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:06,944
JANE: You're not
gonna take my soul.

989
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:13,317
Fear clouds the mind
and the spirit,

990
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,188
binds the concept
of the soul to the body.

991
00:57:17,221 --> 00:57:19,256
The ego.

992
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,791
JANE:
Who says I'm afraid?

993
00:57:21,926 --> 00:57:23,194
(Sighs)

994
00:57:23,227 --> 00:57:27,064
You all are afraid.

995
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:28,766
Every one of you.

996
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,069
Every day of your life.

997
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:33,904
- MAC: Jane!
- (Gun blares)

998
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:37,041
- Jesus, Jane.
- Stay away.

999
00:57:39,043 --> 00:57:40,978
(Grunts)

1000
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,281
MAC:
Are you changed?

1001
00:57:47,484 --> 00:57:48,819
Yes.

1002
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:53,224
You, motherfucker.

1003
00:57:53,257 --> 00:57:55,859
- KIM: Mac, wait.
- (Gun blares)

1004
00:57:55,893 --> 00:58:00,798
(♪♪♪♪)

1005
00:58:08,872 --> 00:58:10,975
- Jane.
- (Takes a deep breath)

1006
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:14,178
Everything's gonna be fine, Mac.

1007
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:19,783
Are you in pain?

1008
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,155
I feel pain.

1009
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,929
But pain no longer controls me.

1010
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:35,833
I control it.

1011
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,836
Jane, what am I supposed to do?

1012
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:46,243
What I wanna
help you understand

1013
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:48,312
is pain.

1014
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:54,084
The pain I feel right now.

1015
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:58,088
Fear.

1016
00:58:58,122 --> 00:59:00,224
Confusion.

1017
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:03,794
Doubt.

1018
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,233
No longer cover my actions.

1019
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,270
Jane, what do I do?

1020
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:16,173
Join us.

1021
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:19,843
Kiss me.

1022
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,148
If I do?

1023
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:28,085
Cellular organisms...

1024
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:33,190
are passed through saliva.

1025
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,962
We inhabit our hosts...

1026
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:42,633
(Groans)

1027
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,135
...become one.

1028
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,907
(Takes a deep breath)

1029
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,842
Is this what you want?

1030
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,879
All this chaos?

1031
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,453
Bill was telling us the truth.

1032
01:00:06,056 --> 01:00:08,926
I've been given
an enlightenment.

1033
01:00:10,594 --> 01:00:12,596
An understanding.

1034
01:00:13,964 --> 01:00:15,999
Where are you things from?

1035
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:21,071
(Whimpers)

1036
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:29,446
You know I don't wanna
be changed.

1037
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,915
Change is inevitable.

1038
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:35,386
Kiss me.

1039
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,091
I can't. I won't.

1040
01:00:42,693 --> 01:00:45,295
I'm losing a lot of blood, Mac.

1041
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:51,168
(Takes a deep breath)

1042
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:54,171
I wanna live.

1043
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:59,443
That much about us
remains the same.

1044
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:05,149
No. No, we're not the same.

1045
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:12,656

Oh.

1048
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:28,038
Just realize I am dying now.

1049
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:43,053

1050
01:01:55,499 --> 01:01:58,202
You're gonna help me save Jane.
Come here.

1053
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:09,213
Break it open.
Shove a shell in.

Close it.
Pull back the trigger.

1055

Shoot.

Now fuck off!

Well, then we're dead.

1092
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:33,550
Or you lose everything

I don't know what to tell you.

1094

Nothing in life
that's worthwhile is easy.

1095
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:51,368
It is the struggle and the fight
that makes us who we are.

1096
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,975
They wanna exist through us.

1097

1098
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:02,980
So am I.

1099
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,919
And they're gonna use that,
so that we disappear into them.

1100
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:13,825
Life doesn't make any sense.

1101
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:15,592

They took Jane from us.

1105
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:31,441
Those fuckers
changed everything.

1106
01:06:31,475 --> 01:06:33,443
