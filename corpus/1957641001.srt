00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,107
[slow-paced music]
[chatter]

2
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,572
[inaudible]

3
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,640
Good.

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,408
Nobody touches him.

5
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,212
Bunch of ass-rangers tried
to take him in the shower,

6
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,381
sliced an ear off one of them.

7
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,183
Got away clean.

8
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,734
You're their queen, huh?

9
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,736
This your big black 'daddy'?

10
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,775
You're "Broole", ain't you?

11
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,743
It's French for 'burn', right?

12
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,913
[groans]
[hard thud]

13
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,853
[yelling]

14
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,192
It's pronounced "Broo-lay."
It means already burned.

15
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,361
[officer] Okay, coming through!

16
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,533
Get me his file.

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,577
[rainfall]

18
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,753
[speaking Spanish]

19
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,491
I'm sorry, Ms. C.

20
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,460
What the hell is the matter
with you?

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,761
I'm sorry, man.

22
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,296
I thought you were
my primo bonito.

23
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,564
You do that to a cousin?

24
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,299
Are you crazy?

25
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,501
Hey, go easy.
We're just kidding around.

26
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,436
If my old partner were here,
you'd be dead by now.

27
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,738
[speaking Spanish]

28
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,707
I'm just fileting the fish, eh.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,143
Ricky.

30
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,713
Are you dirty?

31
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,551
Si, so long as I've been
on the outside, man.

32
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,554
-Come on, let me see.
-No, okay. I'm dirty.

33
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,689
But I got that job, eh.

34
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,224
-The delivery job?
-Yeah.

35
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,493
Gracias for that. But I don't
start for a week.

36
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,595
That's good,
'cause you know what?

37
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,663
You're going to detox tonight.

38
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,566
You'll be out just in time
to start work.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,535
[speaking Spanish]
I ain't going to no detox.

40
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,271
A knife
is a righteous violation.

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,140
[speaking Spanish]

42
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,708
Man, you sure know how to kill
my Saturday night.

43
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,809
Shut the door.

44
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,514
[knocking]

45
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,490
I would've sold him
but he cries too much.

46
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,227
Oh, remind me to give
you a [inaudible]

47
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,195
when they give you
a good citizenship award.

48
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,264
Hey, come on, Ms. C.

49
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,268
How about giving me 90 days
off my parole?

50
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,836
In your dreams, Egan.

51
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,638
Thanks.

52
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,106
Come on. I did you a favor.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,641
[baby cries]

54
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,913
Okay, alright.

55
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
[car starts]

56
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,561
[Larry] I swear, Ms. C,
these are the wrong meds.

57
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,464
Can't sleep, can't think.

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,135
Except I want to kill somebody.

59
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,105
But you took the meds back
and you told them, right?

60
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,940
They won't believe me.

61
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,608
You've got to help me.

62
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,311
I'm afraid to stop
taking them

63
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,846
and I'm afraid to take them.

64
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,451
You know what? Let's just go
down there right now

65
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,520
and I will talk to them
for you, alright?

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,625
Can you wait outside
for a minute?

67
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,227
[Jennifer]
I'll be right there, Larry.

68
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,598
Oh, don't worry.
That's just Wilson.

69
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,906
How did Lee's sister
get a hold of the baby?

70
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,578
Look, they're giving
poor Larry Frank the wrong meds,

71
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,047
I've got [inaudible]
on parole,

72
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,415
got 20 cases pending,

73
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,716
and you want to know
how this baby gets to live

74
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,784
with its own family?

75
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,253
Can't cover for you if I don't
know what you're doing.

76
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,089
You're there for me
and that's all I need.

77
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,425
Lee's sister called.

78
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,427
The baby's fine.

79
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,365
I better get to Larry.
He's about to--

80
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,370
Damn, lost him.

81
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,639
[Wilson] You need to watch
yourself, Jenny.

82
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,008
You put too much of yourself
into it.

83
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,744
Trust my judgement. I always
know what I'm getting into.

84
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,779
[serious music]

85
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,390
You were quick out there
with those skins.

86
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,127
Almost seemed like you
were down with the brothers.

87
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,730
What's up?

88
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,834
You got 14 more years in here,
am I right?

89
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,205
Word has it
you were [inaudible]

90
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,742
My sources say that it's true.

91
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,213
How would you like
to get sprung up out of here?

92
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,381
[scoffs]

93
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,850
If you can move mountains,

94
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,218
why don't you slide on
out of here?

95
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,287
My case is different.

96
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,522
Yours is simple.

97
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,991
You're offering me
a contract?

98
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,427
It'll get you out of here
with 20 grand.

99
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,764
What makes you think
you can trust me?

100
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,500
Maybe the good people
on the outside

101
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,735
don't keep their word on deals.

102
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,104
But screw a deal
made on the inside?

103
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,109
You'll keep your word.

104
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,152
He's already done his time,

105
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,854
he doesn't belong
in a prison hospital.

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,989
You know, I couldn't get him
in there even if I wanted to.

107
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,358
-Come on, he's a vet.
-Take him to county.

108
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,026
I did. He doesn't have Medicare.

109
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,299
Oh, god. No wonder
he's flipping out.

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,235
I've been trying to tell you.

111
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,003
Alright.

112
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,507
This is the best I can do.

113
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,944
Thanks. Let's hope it's better
than the last one.

114
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,214
Hm, fresh meds.

115
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,917
He's just doing his job,
following orders.

116
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,852
You got to come here.

117
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,654
Come on, I'll take you home.

118
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,922
No, I'll walk.

119
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,324
Larry, it's three miles.

120
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,526
That's good.

121
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,128
Maybe I'll be wasted enough
to crash.

122
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,430
I'll walk with you then.

123
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,466
Why? It's three miles.

124
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,234
Well, why not?
I miss my Tai Chi and...

125
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,103
I enjoy your company.

126
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,071
[singing]

127
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,752
You care.

128
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,188
Well, it's business, Larry.
I'm accountable for you.

129
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,025
Anyway, you do what's right.
That's what my daddy taught me.

130
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,160
Was he a cop or something?

131
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,063
No, he was a colonel,
he got killed in Vietnam.

132
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,299
He was lucky.

133
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,501
He got out lucky.

134
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,570
Lucky? Are you crazy?

135
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,072
You're okay. You're fine.

136
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,541
You wouldn't have been
if you daddy had come home.

137
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,677
No. Let me tell you
how it works.

138
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,647
See, in 'Nam, nobody wins there.
You die there,

139
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,382
or you die here.

140
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,886
If you die here,
you take everybody with you.

141
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,956
You just do
what your daddy told you,

142
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,025
never mind the commands
and don't be part of the chain.

143
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,595
Well, but, there has to be
some kind of order.

144
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,129
Oh, fuck the orders.

145
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,398
Yeah, you obey orders,

146
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,434
you'd do shit you'd never
thought you'd do.

147
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,503
Hey, Larry. Slow down.

148
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,938
We'll get there, okay?

149
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,374
[sirens]

150
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,879
[officer] Move it along, ladies.
Let's go.

151
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,747
[Alfonso] Eight years
I run this business.

152
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,517
Then she comes on the scene.

153
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,952
[Henri] Wait a minute,

154
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,021
you talking about hitting
a woman?

155
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,990
[Alfonso]
Her name is Claire Carrol.

156
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,860
Because of her we got to close
the whole operation down,

157
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,929
so I start selling on my own.

158
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,531
[Henri] Yeah?

159
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,701
Yeah, and he freaks out,
but I keep selling.

160
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,906
I'm even selling
to the whacky-ass militia cats

161
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,875
and I pay everybody off
just like I always do.

162
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,410
But for some reason this time,

163
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,878
the feds don't look
the other way.

164
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,314
I see.

165
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,751
Steward crossed you
so he could keep her.

166
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:14,521
Right, now I want you to do her
and him.

167
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,024
You understand, boy?

168
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,227
[Henri] No, I don't get it.

169
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,964
Look, I'm not talking
about you wasting her,

170
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,366
I'm talking about you
screwing her.

171
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,335
See, I know she'll go for you.

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,244
Look, you get her hot for you,

173
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,013
and then you take that hoe
any way you want to.

174
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,051
But then you tell
little Stewart all about it

175
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,986
right before you bam!

176
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,388
Save her for your mount.

177
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,157
The better time you have

Why me? Why not
one of your boys?

181
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,764
No, no, see,
it's got to be you,

182
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,166
'cause you can get to her.

183
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,001
She's a snake.

184
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,071
You know how long I've waited
for a white boy to get to her?

185
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,840
That bitch was the beginning
of the end for me.

186
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,177
You got some weird ideas

because you ain't going
to get off

Mr. James asked me to get you
set up here in town.

Who's this Bobby Ryan?

That's your way to Stewart.

00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,640
Alfonso was just waiting

202

for Stewart to get his hands
dirty again, and he is.

203
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,545
He's running steroids
all over Asia.

This chick, Claire Carrol,

It's okay. Ooh,

Hi, I'm Jenny Capitanas,
your agent.

234
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,890
Capitanas, that's kind
of an awkward name.

235
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,492
So everyone just calls me
Ms. C.

236
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,231
I figured you didn't come
downtown to buy balloons.

237
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,167
So you're living at the Metro.

238
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,768
There are a lot
of parolees there.

239
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,903
You get a job?

240
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,906
I got some

Ah, clean enough to get
an early release.

245
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,588
He killed the girl I was with.

246
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,024
And you retaliated?

247
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,494
Yeah, but he was coming at us.

248
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,533
Well, it says here that you shot
him seven times.

249
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,034
Said the girl was his wife.

250
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,069

-Okay.

So I'm sure you're aware
the conditions of your parole.

with ex-cons.

up to back him,

Take the cuffs off.

You should check this dude out,
okay? 'Cause he's playing you.

Larry's autopsy showed no signs
of illegal drugs

so you're in the clear.

I'm surprised.

00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,294
Cons at the opera?

357
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,198
No, to see anybody from work.

358
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,001
I mean I won my tickets
on the Opera Buffs.

359
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,770
Congratulations.

360
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,473
Hey, Henri?

361
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,543
You check your attitude.

362
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:51,445
You give people a little room

363
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,180
if you want to make it
in the real world.

364
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:54,815
People like Wilson?

365
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,717
Give him room to screw me?

366
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,185
No, I mean you learn to tell
the difference

367
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,786
between bullshit
and the real thing.

368
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,455
Like you did with Larry.

369
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,126
Enjoy the opera.

370
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,163
[traffic]

371
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:20,207
Excuse me, can I see
these earrings?

372
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,709
[woman] I'll be with you
in a minute.

373
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,346
-The diamond studs.
-[taps]

374
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,082
[woman] Excuse me.

375
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,926
Miss?

376
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,261
Would you mind trying this on?

377
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,896
So I can see how they look?

378
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:44,264
I can do that, sir.

379
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,633
Thanks, but she looks more
like my girlfriend.

380
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,304
Of course.

381
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,707
-Nice skin.
-Thank you.

382
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,444
Oh, yeah. These are beautiful.

383
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:00,981
You smell great.

384
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,584
-Okay, that's enough.
-Let must just--Wow.

385
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,386
-I just want to--
-Okay, okay.

386
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,857
-Aright, stop! Let go of me!
-Sir, please.

387
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,462
Are you alright?

388
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,731
[door opens and closes]

389
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,001
I should be fine.

390
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,137
Hey, "Broole"!

391
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,541
Brulé.

392
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,210
You made contact?

393
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,548
Yeah, yeah,
it's going to be hot.

394
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,117
Yeah? She went for you?

395
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:39,720
Don't worry
about the chick, alright?

396
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,488
Nah, nah, you're the man.

397
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,323
Yeah, right. I'm the man.

398
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,158
Well, maybe you've been
inside too long.

399
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,327
You got that piece?

400
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,131
Alfonso's waiting.

401
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,533
You got a message for me?

402
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,935
If I do, I'll write him
a postcard.

403
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,642
Your boy is here to see you.

404
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,849
-[door closes]
-What's up?

405
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,518
I'm the one who usually pays
the surprise visits.

406
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,654
Yeah, I know.

407
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,923
Seems like every time I run
into you,

408
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,090
I blow my fuse.

409
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:18,825
That's alright.

410
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,295
You'll mellow out, you just need
a little time on the outside.

411
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,697
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

412
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,033
Save your money.
I accept your apology.

413
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,839
Look, I've got something that
I would like to ask of you.

414
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,041
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

415
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,076
And I've decided that...

416
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,178
What's on your mind, Henri?

417
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,382
Well, like you said,

418
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:43,584
we're going
to be working together.

419
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,651
Mm-hm.

420
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,753
I thought maybe I should tell
you about myself.

421
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,289
My life story.

422
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,824
Your life story?

423
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,862
Yeah, you know the best part
isn't in my file.

424
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:55,996
[chuckles]

425
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,866
Well, now, that is something
that I do need to know

426
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,803
but I have probably an hour
left on this desk

427
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,305
so next visit will work out
just fine.

428
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,774
It's kind of important.

429
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,015
Fine, okay. Junction Café,
one hour.

430
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,352
-Great.
-[sighs]

431
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,621
So what did he want?

432
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,323
Well, if you really
want to know,

433
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,259
he was about to lodge
a complaint against you

434
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:27,060
for the Larry Frank incident.

435
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,332
And I supposed you enlightened
him that he's the convict

436
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,901
and we're the guardian angels?

437
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,068
I told him to go ahead.

438
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,571
What, you want to get
accusatory here?

439
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,406
Why are you letting
this guy work you?

440
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,078
You are so into yourself.

441
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,713
He didn't even mention it.

442
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,783
You think your miss untouchable?

443
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,451
Huh? You think
you're in control?

444
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,955
You know as well as I do
the minute you trust these guys,

445
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,056
they're going to screw you.

446
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,491
And when this guy
does it to you,

447
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,426
don't be surprised there's no
backup on your side.

448
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,730
Great, I'll probably be safer
that way.

449
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,569
[Henri] I grew up on the street.

450
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,538
You know, around a lot
of hookers, dancers.

451
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,373
They liked me.

452
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:15,609
But I looked out for them.

453
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,881
You're probably the first girl
I ever had coffee with

454
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:22,082
that wasn't a dancer.

455
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:23,784
Woman. First woman.

456
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:25,052
And I don't believe you.

457
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,222
Woman. That's true.

458
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:35,929
Look, I could never really...

459
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:39,933
Let me see...

460
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:45,806
I could never really talk
to nice girls, woman.

461
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,541
Henri.

462
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,010
What is this about?

463
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,780
I want you to teach me.

464
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:56,383
Teach you what?

465
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:00,787
I want you to teach me
how to be with a nice woman.

466
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,558
Educated, classy.

467
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,862
I help out with things,
you know I do,

468
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,965
but with practical things
like how to drive.

469
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,901
You know, you were right
about the other night.

470
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:16,737
I never went
to an opera before.

471
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:20,674
Well, is there someone special
to you that like opera?

472
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,544
You don't understand.

473
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,348
I don't want to scare people.

474
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,154
I just want to be normal.

475
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,861
Okay, well, um...

476
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:43,463
How'd did you like the opera?

477
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,501
Strange.

478
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,203
[both chuckle]

479
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,505
Kind of like a weird dream.

480
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,842
All those people singing
at the same time,

481
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:58,545
you know, there voices were like
so big, it was...

482
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:00,347
Almost like they could fly.

483
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,648
[chuckles]

484
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,284
When I hear those voices,

485
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,389
makes me feel like I can fly.

486
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,694
I asked around about you.

487
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,362
Yeah?

488
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,698
The word is you're for real.

489
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,068
Are you?

490
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,440
[sighs]

491
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,778
Okay, okay.

492
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,348
But it's going to go both ways.

493
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:35,782
Alright, there's
a parolee program

494
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,850
called Advantage.

495
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:39,987
It's five hours of community
service per week,

496
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,356
it's group therapy,
it'll be a plus on your record,

497
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,458
and I'll sponsor you,
is this too difficult for you?

498
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,995
I mean, 'cause I have a lot
of other ways I can spend time.

499
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,097
I can handle it.

500
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:51,532
Good.

501
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:55,836
And in return, we can start
a little tutorial.

502
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:58,005
But it has to have
a time limit.

503
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

504
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,376
I'll see you later.

505
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,182
That's what I love
about the outside,

506
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,284
never enough time
for anything.

507
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:14,888
[relaxing music]

508
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:35,409
Morning.

509
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,313
This is called, "Embrace tiger,

510
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,248
return to mountain."

511
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:45,919
That's some beautiful shit.

512
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:47,988
It's about harmony.

513
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,358
Tai Chi is like a dance.

514
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:55,395
Like you're dancing
with patience,

515
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:59,967
and courage, right?

516
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:04,404
Brute strength, weight lifting,
not going to help you.

517
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,543
You want to get started?

518
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,180
[clears throat]

519
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,383
[chuckles]

520
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,253
We got to loosen you up,
your walk, it's so...

521
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,687
My walk?

522
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,756
Well, you walk like...

523
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,225
You know, you walk like that.

524
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,460
That's what you look like
when you walk.

525
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:27,761
[scoffs]

526
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,298
How's a guy going to change
his walk? Come on, that's shit.

527
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,733
Tai Chi is not shit.

528
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,401
The world is not shit,
life is not shit.

529
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,939
You know what? Let's just
loosen up, let's just--

530
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,641
-Just loosen up.
-Yeah, loosen up.

531
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,210
Loosen up, let it go.

532
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:50,150
Hey, boom-boom. Hey!

533
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,420
Um, that's not going
to help you, just relax.

534

They're delicious.

552
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,459
All you got to do is
you take fresh eggs

553
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,461
and you whip them real fast.

554
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:09,496
Then you add some sugar.

555
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,765

556
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,768
Mix in the flour and the eggs

557
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:16,436

Hot as you can make it.

561
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,078
And then you take the dough

562
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,181
and you slap it against
the side of the wall.

563
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:30,684
And you just keep slapping it
until it gets nice and loose.

564
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,754
And then you stick it
in the hot oil.

565
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,523
And I promise you
it is the most--

566
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,158
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

a chance.

Now, you're talking

00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,603
[Henri] I just wanted to make
sure you didn't wipe out

714
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,439
a tree or something,
the way you were flying.

715
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,045
I'm at this payphone.

716
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,081
I have nothing in this world...

717
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,684
Except this line to you.

718
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,390
And if that's what being
with a woman in the right way

719
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:37,457
is all about...

720
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:42,396
I know I'll never have
another chance

721
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,131
to be alive like this again...

722
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,271
Anyway, the opera was great.

723
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:52,973
I'll see you tomorrow,
for Tai Chi.

724
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,741
Bye.

725
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,511
[hangs up]
[beeps]

726
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:11,625
Looks great.

727
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,361
-You got it.
-Thanks to you.

728
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,233
This has to be our last lesson.

729
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,439
But I'm just getting good.

730
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,241
There are a lot of great
martial art schools

731
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:28,308
all over town.

732
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,210
Well...

733
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,014
If it's got to be,
it's got to be.

734
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:38,452
Okay, so, you want to start
where we left off?

735
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:48,695
-Ready?
-Yeah.

736
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:54,935
Okay, step back.

737
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,974
Prepare to strike tiger.

738
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,148
As if...

739
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:12,920
shutting a door...

740
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:16,023
Good.

741
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:18,458
Snake moves down...

742
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,262
-[both] Snake moves in.
-Hey!

743
00:44:23,597 --> 00:44:25,132
If you care about me,
you won't.

744
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:27,301
Don't you see?

745
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:29,002
What we have is protected.

746
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,706
It's like there's a halo
or something around us.

747
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,975
-Nobody can see us.
-It's more like a target.

748
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,111
-Alright?
-No, this is good.

749
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:48,322
Oh, god. Not here, okay?
Not here.

750
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:52,426
[slow-paced music]

751
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:57,598
[moaning]

752
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,768
This is crazy, but so great.

753
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:18,719
-Hey!
-Come on!

754
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,988
Hey, wait a minute! Wait.
Wait, no!

755
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:23,757
No! Get off of me!

756
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:26,960
[Henri]
Come on, relax!

757
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:28,929
Wait a minute!
Get off of me!

758
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,831
[screams]
Get off of me!

759
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,233
[dramatic music]

760
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:38,705
[glass shatters]

761
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:43,911
[loud banging]

762
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,688
[cries]

763
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,159
[music softens]

764
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:15,502
[Henri] Sorry for the lamp.

765
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:19,540
The lamp is replaceable.

766
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,043
Maybe.

767
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:30,450
I mean,
now I'm forever vulnerable.

768
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:36,890
You think I would use this?

769
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,194
Never.

770
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:43,163
Believe me.

771
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:45,332
Never.

772
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:03,951
[chatter]

773
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,189
-Henry.
-John.

774
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:17,064
So, I understand
we have mutual friends.

775
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:20,467
Yeah, yeah, and mutual business.

776
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:22,736
I like the way you cut out
of weapons

777
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:23,804
at just the right time.

778
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:25,973
Bobby Ryan told me
you had the same instincts.

779
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,375
So tell me, Henry...

780
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,477
Who did your flying for you?

781
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:32,613
Paul Gionitti.

782
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:34,781
I was in the plane
when he went down.

783
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,018
Really? I'm that plane.

784
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:40,521
You're kidding?

785
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,356
[scoffs]

786
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,691
You remember the way he'd
skim over the bush,

787
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:45,859
land in a field,

788
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:47,528
middle of the night,
pitch black,

789
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,596
radar, sonar,
meant nothing to him.

790
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,565
How the hell did you spot
that crash, Henry?

791
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:55,769
Paul caught a bullet
on take-off.

792
00:48:57,004 --> 00:49:00,073
He climbed high enough
to let me bail out, I jumped.

793
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:04,444
So Bobby Ryan tells me you got
some steroids to move.

794
00:49:04,845 --> 00:49:06,513
Yeah, I invest
in this hot new brand.

795
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,915
I've been looking
for distribution.

796
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:09,783
Can I check out your product?

797
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:13,253
Sure. You'll have to tell me
who your end users are.

798
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,988
-[scoffs]
-Sweetheart.

799
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,226
[Claire] Wow, my timing
is perfect.

800
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,594
Two handsome men for drinks.

801
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,863
And one gorgeous woman.

802
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:24,865
Honey, you remember Henry,
don't you?

803
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:26,667
We were just reminiscing
telling our war stories,

804
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:27,734
weren't we, Henry?

805
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:29,236
Hm.

806
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:33,207
You know, I was just thinking
we should all get together

807
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,108
and fly down to San Miguel
in my TriStar.

808
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:36,376
[phone rings]

809
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,678
Excuse me.

810
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,013
Yeah?

811
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,149
Yeah.

812
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,918
I'll be right there.

813
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,353
Sorry, sweetheart.

814
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,222
Maybe you can stay here
and amuse Henry

815
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:49,523
until I get back.

816
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,663
John tells me you do some
fascinating travel.

817
00:49:57,898 --> 00:49:58,899
Sometimes.

818
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:02,803
Now, what you do,
helping people.

819
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,572
Charity, that's doing something.

820
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:09,376
Well, I try to contribute
to various causes.

821
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:12,846
Saving rare birds,
rehabilitating people

822
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:15,449
who have made mistakes.

823
00:50:16,817 --> 00:50:19,853
What I give is exhausting
but I have to find...

824
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:21,555
I way to forgive myself

825
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,323
for having so much
when others...

826
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:28,795
It's ironic, isn't it?

827
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:31,698
In a world full of people
hurting people

828
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:33,901
the one that's hardest
to forgive is yourself.

829
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,074
[traffic]

830
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:43,810
Sorry.

831
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:45,779
Your late.

832
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:47,114
I stopped to get you these.

833
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:50,751
I've created a monster.
Look, I was, um...

834
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:54,855
I was thinking about
this morning, and, uh...

835
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:57,624
I-I was thinking that...

836
00:50:58,158 --> 00:50:59,993
I've got to transfer you
to another agent.

837
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:03,564
Why? Then there'll be someone
else checking up on us.

838
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:04,698
Us?

839
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,934
What us? There is no us.

840
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,536
That was one time, okay?
And when they talk about me,

841
00:51:09,603 --> 00:51:11,238
'cause you know
they're going to talk about me,

842
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:15,108
I want them to say at least
she had a shred

843
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,476
of professionalism left.

844
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:20,013
That she cut him loose
when she slept with him.

845
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:22,349
Okay?

846
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:27,454
We just have to be very careful.

847
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,359
These are for you.

848
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:47,574
I'll call you.

849
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,388
You make contact?

850
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,524
Yeah.

851
00:52:03,857 --> 00:52:05,993
It's time for Alfonso to call
Bobby Ryan.

852
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,561
Make sure he gets my name right.

853
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:09,329
Burns. Henry Burns.

854
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:12,165
What about the chick?

855
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,536
I'll tell you what,

856
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:17,304
I'll take pictures
when it happens.

857
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:19,239
You know, Alfonso can get off
behind them.

858
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,381
I mean the one these were for.

859
00:52:29,016 --> 00:52:30,450
That's my business.

860
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:32,152
Just tell Alfonso to make
the call.

861
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:34,855
And get your ass
off my car.

862
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,156
[suspicious music]

863
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:38,959
[engine starts]

864
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,520
[John] This is it, Henry.

865
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,455
Breakfast of champions.

866
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,124
Stronger, smaller, faster

867
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,293
and most effective steroids
ever made.

868
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,630
Yeah, but some kids
have had heart attacks

869
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:17,898
on this stuff though, right?

870
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:19,666
I guarantee there are
a million kids out there

871
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:21,201
that could care less.

872
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,506
Ten thousand cases,
one million dollars, Henry.

873
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:26,840
Can you handle it?

874
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:33,013
This is the last of
the hog team batch, my friend.

875
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,016
Okay, John.

876
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,452
I'll put my buyers together.

877
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,821
You got a deal.

878
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,458
You know, I knew when you made
that bet...

879
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:47,160
Well, let's just say I've been
waiting for a guy like you

880
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,395
to come along, Henry.

881
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,497
My old partner,
he had no style.

882
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:52,432
You and I, we can go a long
way together.

883
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,501
So tell me...

884
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:56,703
Any boyfriends?

885
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:02,409
Well, the last one got tired
of call outs at three a.m.

886
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:04,678
and I got paperwork
on the weekends.

887
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,413
You know, I won't call
twenty-four-seven.

888
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,448
Yeah, he probably wanted
you all to himself.

889
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,350
I'm not surprised.

890
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,358
Hey! What are you doing?

891
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,260
-It's a spider.
-Yeah?

892
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:23,463
So you see a spider,
you kill it, right?

893
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,998
It's not going to hurt you.

894
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:26,333
Why do you want to kill it?

895
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:29,636
I mean, don't you get
the feeling

896
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:32,673
when you kill something,
I mean, I live being.

897
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,076
I mean, anything,
even a spider.

898
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:38,312
God, I hate that feeling.

899
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:41,915
It's, like, empty and hard
and dark, you know what I mean?

900
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:45,519
That very moment
that life goes out.

901
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,126
-[laughs]
-Are you laughing at me?

902
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:55,362
Well, it's just, you know--

903
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,397
Yeah, I'm a tough
little girl, right?

904
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,567
Oh, oh!

905
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,836
-I got you so bad right then!
-She's tough!

906
00:55:04,104 --> 00:55:05,539
[screams]

907
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,607
[laughs]

908
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,841
[soft music]

909
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:44,378
Time to go away.

910
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,981
It's probably not a good idea

911
00:55:48,048 --> 00:55:49,416
for you to be here
in the morning.

912
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,252
No, I mean us.

913
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,354
Take off with me.

914
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,392
That's a little unrealistic,
don't you think?

915
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:00,761
No, it's not.

916
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:03,430
Your job's on the line
every time we meet.

917
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:06,600
I get sent back if some shit
like Wilson finds out about us.

918
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:09,503
He's out to get you too,
you know.

919
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,572
-You're serious?
-Yeah.

920
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,740
We could leave the country.

921
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:15,175
I got some money saved up.

922
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:19,713
You jump parole
with a murder rap behind you,

923
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,416
you would be hunted forever
and I would be your accomplice.

924
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,787
Is that the kind of life
you're fantasizing for us?

925
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:31,959
No.

926
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:34,928
No.

927
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,469
In six months,
I can transfer you downstate.

928
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:46,840
Forget it.

929
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,913
I just went out there,
you know?

930
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:57,084
You took me way out there.

931
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,554
And I didn't want to come back.

932
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,823
[music continues]

933
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:26,446
[Tony] Lover boy.

934
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,685
Alfonso's getting impatient.

935
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:32,953
When's it going to happen?

936
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,388
Next week.

937
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,124
Read about it in the papers,

938
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:38,926
and have the rest
of my money ready.

939
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:40,794
You're screwing the wrong bitch.

940
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,332
After the hit, she puts it
all together

941
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:46,466
right back to Alfonso.

942
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,969
How are you going to cover
your trail from screwing

943
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:50,204
your own PA?

944
00:57:52,272 --> 00:57:54,174
I'm finished with her.

945
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:55,943
I'm into my next move.

946
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:58,045
[moans]

947
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:06,153
[knocking]

948
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:12,192
Boss.

949
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,229
It's Saturday.

950
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:16,563
What's the matter with you?

951
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:20,567
Um, I think I have that flu.
I have that flu thing.

952
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:23,303
We got a softball game
in 10 minutes, remember?

953
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,538
I need you on third base.

954
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:28,876
I'll-I'll-I'll infect everybody.

955
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:30,677
Oh, you never get sick.

956
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,112
Take a vitamin C,
it's only 10 minutes away.

957
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,981
No, I don't want anybody
to get too close.

958
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,049
You know, I mean, it's really...

959
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,419
Oh, well, you better go back
to bed then.

960
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:40,954
-Yeah.
-[clears throat]

961
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,223
-You need anything?
-No.

962
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,260
Good luck.

963
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:47,928
See you.

964
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:55,702
Oh, my god!

965
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:00,007
Where are you going?

966
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,377
How are we going to keep
this act up for three years?

967
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:04,945
We'll blow it.

968
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:07,181
Well, like you said,
we've just got to be careful.

969
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:10,951
Come on, what is it?

970
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:12,386
What's getting to you?

971
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:18,692
Well, don't bale on me.

972
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,463
[door opens and closes]

973
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:26,133
[chatter]

974
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:43,250
You ready to mingle
with the straight world?

975
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:45,619
Are they ready for me?

976
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,756
I'm really proud of you.

977
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,192
Here I go.

978
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,194
I'll be nearby.

979
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:23,490
Oh, I'm sorry.

980
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:25,058
Oh, can't you relax?

981
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,128
-You having a good time?
-It's good.

982
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,598
Brulé turned out alright,
didn't he?

983
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,134
Yeah, so far.

984
01:00:41,508 --> 01:00:43,977
So are you with the program?

985
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:45,646
-Yeah.
-I haven't seen you around.

986
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:47,514
Well, I started it
last June--

987
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:49,016
Excuse me.

988
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,685
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

989
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:01,695
Why are you ignoring me?

990
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,132
What, you think because you
got me here you own me?

991
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,267
Cut the shit!

992
01:01:08,468 --> 01:01:11,004
That's not very nice language
for such a nice girl.

993
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,807
Sorry, 'woman'.

994
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,311
Is this all because I won't
run away with you?

995
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,948
You really think you're
the only chick in my life?

996
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,986
I can bring you down
anytime I want.

997
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,021
[serious music]

998
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,704
[Wilson] Listen, I think we have
a problem with Capitanas

999
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:45,239
and over familiarization.

1000
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:48,242
Come on, Wilson.
What kind of crap is that?

1001
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:51,111
His name is Brulé and I heard
them arguing yesterday

1002
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:52,513
at the Advantage program
luncheon.

1003
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:54,781
Huh, so?

1004
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:56,717
Sounded like she was jealous
about something,

1005
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:58,852
it sounded like
he was threatening her.

1006
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:01,221
You know how closely Jenny
works with these guys.

1007
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:02,489
She gets great results.

1008
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:05,058
I saw them together
at the opera, too.

1009
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,595
-The opera?
-Yeah.

1010
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:10,364
You go to the opera?

1011
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,266
No, I don't--

1012
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,135
I was walking my dog. Listen.

1013
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:16,770
This guy is sideways, okay?

1014
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:18,839
I had a run-in with him
down in Metro

1015
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,641
he decked me
and she backed him then.

1016
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:22,676
Now, do I have to lodge
a complaint?

1017
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:23,744
I'll talk to her.

1018
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:27,848
I'm talking about illegal
sexual relations with a parolee.

1019
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:29,183
[ominous music]

1020
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:48,302
Oh! Jesus Christ!

1021
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,139
Ricky? What, you think if you
scare me enough times

1022
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,041
I'll have a heart attack?
Is that it?

1023
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,442
-Sorry.
-[sighs]

1024
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:58,345
You know, you don't look
so good, Ms. C.

1025
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:01,248
You know, my mom's got some
really good [inaudible]

1026
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:02,316
for that kind of thing.

1027
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:04,351
It's just a cold.

1028
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:07,487
Check out those guys
in the caddie.

1029
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:11,024
[Ricky] That's Tony Franco.

1030
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:12,893
What does he do?

1031
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,462
I don't know
who the other guy is.

1032
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,931
But he does
whatever he wants to.

1033
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:20,267
-Bad news.
-[Jennifer sighs]

1034
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,703
You know, you should take
some drugs or something.

1035
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,272
Make you feel better!

1036
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,207
Anyway, later, Ms. C.

1037
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,510
[sleuth music]

1038
01:04:07,447 --> 01:04:08,682
[tires screech]

1039
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:39,580
Didn't the desk clerk
tell you I was here?

1040
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:41,048
I came up the side.

1041
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,852
I guess I should expect this,
but I don't like it.

1042
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:47,321
I'm sure you don't like it.

1043
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,457
What are you doing
with Tony Franco?

1044
01:04:52,092 --> 01:04:53,560
I'm your PA, remember?

1045
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:55,729
How can I forget?

1046
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:59,233
You and me, that was just
a setup, right?

1047
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:01,435
I mean, that was all just a lie?

1048
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:04,505
You wanted to play St. Jenny,
so I let you.

1049
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:07,274
And the sex was just...

1050
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:09,610
It was good, wasn't it?

1051
01:05:10,511 --> 01:05:12,880
You got to dress up your doll
and screw it, too.

1052
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,720
Why didn't you do that before?

1053
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:22,656
Could've been even better.

1054
01:05:25,993 --> 01:05:27,094
I am watching you.

1055
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:33,066
[phone rings]

1056
01:05:34,701 --> 01:05:35,836
Close the door.

1057
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:42,442
You look terrible.
What's going on, Jenny?

1058
01:05:43,677 --> 01:05:46,380
Nothing. I'm just, I'm just
feeling the stress.

1059
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:50,484
Wilson tells me
your parolee Brulé

1060
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:51,818
is crossing the line with you.

1061
01:05:52,886 --> 01:05:55,522
Come on! How the hell
did he come up with that?

1062
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:57,591
Well, he even saw you.

1063
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,227
-A date, maybe.
-A date?

1064
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:03,263
Well, that's ridiculous.

1065
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:06,667
I mean, we just, uh,
I bumped into him

1066
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:09,269
and then we started talking.

1067
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:11,371
Interesting fellow.

1068
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:14,675
Fresh out of the joint,
goes to the opera alone.

1069
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:15,876
[scoffs]

1070
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:17,644
That's not a parole violation,
you know.

1071
01:06:18,078 --> 01:06:20,314
That's just Wilson looking
for a reason to screw me.

1072
01:06:20,714 --> 01:06:22,182
Well, don't give him one, Jen.

1073
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,151
Of course not.

1074
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:30,324
Don't even come close
to that scenario.

1075
01:06:33,894 --> 01:06:34,928
I won't.

1076
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:36,129
[slow-paced music]

1077
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:41,802
[Jennifer]
Rocky Springs Prison.

1078
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:49,743
Hm.

1079
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:55,849
[typing]

1080
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:13,367
And Alfonso James, too.

1081
01:07:14,601 --> 01:07:15,769
Same place.

1082
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:23,210
But commissioner,

1083
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:25,679
he was only recently released
from Rocky Springs.

1084
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,585
I understand. Well...

1085
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:36,290
Well, if you remember anything
at all, please call me.

1086
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:38,892
Alright, thank you.

1087
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,166
[chatter]

1088
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:10,190
I know you wanted to do that
since we met.

1089
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,793
I don't want to do it.

1090
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:15,362
-I have to do it.
-[chuckles]

1091
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:17,865
That's right, no choice.

1092
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,667
No choice is better that way.

1093
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:27,374
Oh, John and his friends
are so strange.

1094
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:29,676
Tell me...

1095
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:33,747
You one of John's boys
doing good work?

1096
01:08:36,016 --> 01:08:37,451
Do you really love John?

1097
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:51,231
John chooses those every week.

1098
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:53,567
What would he do
if he found us here?

1099
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:56,003
He'd kill you.

1100
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:12,619
Oh, this is how
you like it, huh?

1101
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:13,787
Feel me?

1102
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:15,789
[slow-paced music]

1103
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:33,006
[knocking]

1104
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,843
-Who's that?
-[Tony] Let's go.

1105
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,821
Your girlfriend is springing
you, hotshot.

1106
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:50,891
-What are you talking about?
-She called the commissioner.

1107
01:09:52,826 --> 01:09:54,695
Alright, look.
I'll take care of it.

1108
01:09:54,828 --> 01:09:56,864
Don't mess up my setup now,
I'm almost there.

1109
01:09:57,664 --> 01:09:58,665
Listen, lover boy.

1110
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,701
You're not calling
the shots anymore.

1111
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,704
Alfonso says you whack her,
too, first.

1112
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:05,606
Whack my PA?

1113
01:10:05,672 --> 01:10:07,441
He's not paying me enough
for the death penalty.

1114
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,209
Death penalty?

1115
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:12,513
You do it, and don't leave
no connections for nobody.

1116
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:15,349
"Anybody!"

1117
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:16,683
[door slams]

1118
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,355
[Ricky]
He's working for Tony Franco.

1119
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:23,924
He's made some big cake already.

1120
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:25,859
Who's behind it?

1121
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,428
-It's Alfonso James, isn't it?
-Right.

1122
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:32,132
Thanks, Ricky.

1123
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:38,105
Are you going to bring him in?

1124
01:10:38,605 --> 01:10:39,873
I mean, you better move pronto

1125
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,808
'cause this Tony guy is really
pushing on him.

1126
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:45,379
Are you going to have backup?

1127
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,081
Sure, of course.

1128
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:51,285
[phone rings]

1129
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:02,763
Hello?

1130
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:05,599
[Jennifer] The sooner we get
this over with the better.

1131
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:08,468
I'll reassign you and I'll make
sure you don't get Wilson.

1132
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,103
[Henri] Good.

1133
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:12,005
No hard feelings?

1134
01:11:12,973 --> 01:11:14,308
[Jennifer] No hard feelings.

1135
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:16,243
In fact, you know, I'm pouring
some wine right now,

1136
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,312
why don't you come over
for one last drink?

1137
01:11:18,712 --> 01:11:20,914
You can sign
your transfer papers and...

1138
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:22,649
[Henri] Doesn't sound like
a good idea.

1139
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:24,785
[Jennifer] Come on, it's over.

1140
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:26,720
We can be civilized, can't we?

1141
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:34,127
[engine starts]

1142
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:35,729
[knock]

1143
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:51,078
You came.

1144
01:11:55,849 --> 01:11:57,217
I talked to Russell
about your transfer.

1145
01:11:57,284 --> 01:11:58,919
He said there's no problem.

1146
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,493
-Wine?
-Sure.

1147
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:09,463
[pouring]

1148
01:12:21,074 --> 01:12:22,242
To civilization.

1149
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:24,578
Wherever the hell that is.

1150
01:12:32,886 --> 01:12:35,088
So, you got
those transfer papers?

1151
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,391
Relax, they're right here.

1152
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,928
Wait a second.

1153
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:48,669
[suspicious music]

1154
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:53,073
Paranoia back in full swing?

1155
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:08,222
What are you doing
for Alfonso James?

1156
01:13:09,756 --> 01:13:10,757
Who?

1157
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:12,759
Are you that sleek?

1158
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:16,563
That you could be with me
the way we were together

1159
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,931
and it's just a lie?

1160
01:13:20,968 --> 01:13:23,904
I mean, maybe it's just my ego,
you know? Maybe I just--

1161
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:26,306
I just can't admit
that I made a mistake.

1162
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:30,577
What if you just bust me
and get it over with?

1163
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:32,446
I mean, if I send you back,
and Alfonso gets you.

1164
01:13:32,513 --> 01:13:33,981
If I let you go
and you break the law,

1165
01:13:34,047 --> 01:13:35,649
then we'll get you,
so obviously,

1166
01:13:36,717 --> 01:13:37,718
you're not moving.

1167
01:13:39,653 --> 01:13:41,722
You're just going to sit there
and watch me forever?

1168
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:46,326
I have been trained

1169
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:50,130
very patient...

1170
01:13:54,401 --> 01:13:55,702
[groans]

1171
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,084
I miss you.

1172
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,559
You're always good
at the bull.

1173
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:22,329
You're the only one in my life
whoever gave a shit.

1174
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:25,899
Wasn't shit
that I gave you, remember?

1175
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,072
Can I have a drink of water?

1176
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,782
[water running]

1177
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:47,788
I remember every inch of you.

1178
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:54,995
Tell me you won't do this job.

1179
01:14:57,097 --> 01:14:58,198
How you smell...

1180
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:01,001
Tell me what the job
for Alfonso is.

1181
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:02,503
I can get you out of this.

1182
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:04,671
It's not too late.

1183
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:09,877
Believe me, it was too late
when we started.

1184
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:20,187
[hard thud]
[groans]

1185
01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:22,422

[sighs]

1187
01:16:03,997 --> 01:16:05,465
-[Ricky] Hello?
-Ricky?

1188
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,367
Yeah, it's me.

1189
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:11,071
It's time to move
on Mr. Brulé.

1190
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:13,040
[sleuth music]

1191
01:16:13,106 --> 01:16:14,408
-And Ricky?
-Yeah?

1192
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:17,377
Keep your distance.

1193
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:36,897
[phone rings]

1194
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:38,498
[Jennifer] Hello?

1195
01:16:38,565 --> 01:16:40,467
[Ricky] He went into a building
on 30 McCullum.

1196
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:42,703
[Jennifer] Park the van
on the side of the street

1197
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:43,871
and stay in it.

1198
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:45,072
I'll find you.

1199
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,581
Which building is it?

1200
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:28,649
It's this one.

1201
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,417
You see that door right there?

1202
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:32,252
That's how this Henry dude
got in.

1203
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:35,956
Why are you doing this solo?

1204
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:38,325
I mean there's a lot
of badass vatos in there.

1205
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:42,396
I made a big mistake, Ricky.
I got to fix it myself.

1206
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:46,700
Stewart!

1207
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,570
I wouldn't. Drop it.

1208
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:51,939
Drop the gun!

1209
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,541
Slide it to me.

1210
01:17:56,476 --> 01:17:57,611
Get down on the floor.

1211
01:17:58,579 --> 01:17:59,847
Down on the floor!

1212
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,419
You're wasting
your talents, Henry.

1213
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:07,554
Claire doesn't think
it's wasted.

1214
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,089
[chuckles]

1215
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,158
Neither does Alfonso James.

1216
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:19,766
Who the hell are you,
Henry Burns?

1217
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:21,902
Name's Brulé.

1218
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:24,037
Henri Brulé.

1219
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:27,007
[Jennifer] I want you to bring
my car around

1220
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:28,408
to the back of the building,

1221
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:29,977
and then I want you to go home.

1222
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:33,280
Thanks, Ricky.

1223
01:18:37,518 --> 01:18:40,254
Go home? [speaking Spanish]

1224
01:18:41,822 --> 01:18:43,190
Gun on the floor, Stewart.

1225
01:18:45,592 --> 01:18:48,929
No, you'll have
to take mine yourself.

1226
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:51,865
Go ahead, take it.

1227
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:56,403
[gunshot]

1228
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:00,440
Put your gun down. Let's go!

1229
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,412
Put your hands
where I can see them.

1230
01:19:06,446 --> 01:19:07,447
Move!

1231
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,068
Now I have to kill three.

1232
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,471
You haven't got
the balls, Henry.

1233
01:19:31,538 --> 01:19:32,940
You're just a scared con.

1234

Kill them!

1238
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:13,213
Kill them!

1239
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,351

-I told you to go home!

I hope so.

1244
01:21:00,627 --> 01:21:02,396
[Ricky] Ms. C,
what's happening?

1245
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,465
Ricky, this is Henri.
Henri, this is Ricky.

1246
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:11,004
Sorry, Ricky.
I'll let you off in a minute.

1247
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:13,006
I'll give you cab money
to get to your van, okay?

1248
01:21:13,473 --> 01:21:15,042
[Ricky] What?
[speaking Spanish]

1249
01:21:15,108 --> 01:21:16,543
Where are we going, eh?

1250
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:17,778
We need a thinking place.

1251
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:20,747
Yeah, okay, Ms. C.
How about my place?

1252
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:23,116
First, I've got to get rid
of our friends.

1253
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,818
[siren]

1254
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,422
[inaudible] She's a cop!

1255
01:21:40,534 --> 01:21:41,869
[Freddy]
That punk set us up!

1256
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:43,904
[Stewart]
No, Freddy]

1257
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:45,305
He's got something
going with her

1258
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:46,373
and whatever it is,

1259
01:21:46,874 --> 01:21:48,675
they're not going to want
any cops involved.

1260
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:50,177
But we're going to go down
every street

1261
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:51,778
in this godforsaken slum.

1262
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:53,113
[Spanish music]

1263
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:24,478
Okay, Ms. C.
Here's your thinking place.

1264
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:26,446
You keep on an eye
on the street for me?

1265
01:22:57,344 --> 01:22:58,445
[hard hit]
[grunts]

1266
01:22:59,613 --> 01:23:00,781
[footsteps]

1267
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,695
Don't touch that!
Don't even move!

1268
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:22,269
[slams door]

1269
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:27,040
You really think we're going
to be that simple, Henry?

1270
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,209
Huh?

1271
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:33,647
That you can have my sweet,
sweet Claire

1272
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:35,649
and get away with it?

1273
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:39,186
[loud punch]

1274
01:23:44,157 --> 01:23:46,460
You really think you can cost
me a million dollars,

1275
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:49,530
and my reputation,
much less, my wife

1276
01:23:49,663 --> 01:23:53,467
for a pathetic punk
like Alfonso James?

1277
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:56,970
-[hard kick]
-No!

1278
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:58,405
[groans]

1279
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:07,548
Tell me, Henry.
Who's your friend?

1280
01:24:09,816 --> 01:24:13,086
Is she law or just another one
of your fancy games?

1281
01:24:15,956 --> 01:24:17,724
I'm going to show
you something.

1282
01:24:20,827 --> 01:24:21,929
[cocks gun]

1283
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,167
I'm going to show you
how I operate.

1284
01:24:29,937 --> 01:24:31,471
How I look after
my own business.

1285
01:24:32,606 --> 01:24:33,874
[music intensify]

1286
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:38,612
Kill her!

1287
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,084
[gasps]

1288
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:52,459
[gunshots]

1289
01:25:18,919 --> 01:25:20,020
He's dead.

1290
01:25:25,025 --> 01:25:26,193
Thank you.

1291
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:29,229
It's okay, mija.

1292
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:31,265
You going to call backup?

1293
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:34,368
Hey, no rush.

1294
01:25:35,002 --> 01:25:37,304
-Anytime.
-Yeah, go ahead.

1295
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:38,972
I'll just wait outside.

1296
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:40,774
Is there anybody
heading south tonight?

1297
01:25:47,447 --> 01:25:49,116
Why didn't you just arrest me
back there?

1298
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:54,755
'Cause I thought
I could save you.

1299
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:00,093
What about us?

1300
01:26:01,228 --> 01:26:02,329
There is no us.

1301
01:26:03,597 --> 01:26:04,798
There was an us.

1302
01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:06,867
Now, you got to get out
of the country.

1303
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:11,839
-I didn't mean to--
-I know.

1304
01:26:13,106 --> 01:26:14,341
I know.

1305
01:26:15,075 --> 01:26:16,310
You were protecting me.

1306
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:20,881
I didn't mean
to fall for you.

1307
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:26,119
Well, welcome to the human race.

1308
01:26:27,554 --> 01:26:28,755
[soft music]

1309
01:26:31,992 --> 01:26:33,827
Why do people fall in love?

1310
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:38,665
Love, huh?

1311
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:41,635
No shit.

1312
01:26:43,237 --> 01:26:44,304
Yeah, Ricky will get you
a ride,

1313
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,706
you just got to get out
of here.

1314
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,141
I'm not running.

1315
01:26:50,244 --> 01:26:51,879
They'll go after you
one way or another.

1316
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:54,047
I can't let you take
the rap for me.

1317
01:26:54,581 --> 01:26:55,749
I'm okay!

1318
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,885
They won't put me away.

1319
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:01,622
[car horn]

1320
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:17,504
[officer] Copy that. Let's go.

1321
01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:31,351
[officer]
Out of the way, please.

1322
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,655
Thank you.

1323
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,001
[Russell]
Damn it, Jenny.

1324
01:27:48,535 --> 01:27:49,736
Are you okay?

1325
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:52,039
Yeah.

1326
01:27:54,074 --> 01:27:55,075
Who were these guys?

1327
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:59,880
A drug dealer, a gun runner,

1328
01:28:00,714 --> 01:28:02,082
his bodyguard.

1329
01:28:04,184 --> 01:28:05,552
Where's your parolee?

1330
01:28:10,224 --> 01:28:12,192
Look, I told you everything
that I know.

1331
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:15,162
He saved my life.

1332
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,599
I got knocked out
in the madness,

1333
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:21,001
and when I came to,
he was gone.

1334
01:28:31,278 --> 01:28:32,713
He tried to get out
of the action

1335
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:33,881
and they went after them.

1336
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:47,694
Well, you haven't given up
after all.

1337
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:49,563
Oh.

1338
01:28:57,938 --> 01:28:59,339
Come on, let's go.

1339
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:03,510
[Spanish music]

1340
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:39,880
[birds singing]

1341
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,005
[Henri] Embrace the tiger.

1342
01:30:07,808 --> 01:30:09,343
Return to the mountain.

1343
01:30:11,945 --> 01:30:12,946
Henri?

1344
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:19,453
What the hell
are you doing here?

1345
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:22,956
I decided to stop running.

1346
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:27,361
Only way to get past it
is to pay up.

1347
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:30,497
Only way to see you again.

1348
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:33,433
Well, they gave you a break.

1349
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:36,336
A break?

1350
01:30:36,904 --> 01:30:39,473
Well, you led me to Stewart
and you saved my life

1351
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:42,242
so they're going to give
you a year for the gun

1352
01:30:43,076 --> 01:30:44,278
and breaking parole.

1353
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:47,014
-A year?
-Mm-hm.

1354
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,451
That's great!

1355
01:30:53,687 --> 01:30:54,688
Thanks.

1356
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:56,290
Sure.

1357
01:30:57,658 --> 01:30:59,860
Hm, well...

1358
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:02,963
Do we have to do it right now?

1359
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:05,098
Can we spend a little time?

1360
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:07,968
[chuckles]
The sooner you're in,

1361
01:31:08,035 --> 01:31:09,269
the sooner you're out.

1362
01:31:10,604 --> 01:31:12,272
That's what I love
about the outside.

1363
01:31:12,673 --> 01:31:14,408
Never enough time
for anything.

1364
01:31:14,474 --> 01:31:15,776
