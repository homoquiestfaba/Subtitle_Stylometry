1
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,482
Yes, I know, baby bear.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,584
Come on, we're gonna
get in the car

3
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,119
And get in our
princess seat.

4
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,725
But he might be
coming back.

5
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,227
He's not coming back,
Miles.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,528
You read the note.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,563
And even if he did,
we're not gonna be here.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,134
Where are we going?

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,336
As far as Jack'll
take us.

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,206
Why do you call
the car "Jack"?

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,575
'Cause it rhymes
with Cadillac.

12
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,611
Come on, get in the car,
put on your seat belts.

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,313
Let's go.

14
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,549
(Girl)
You ready to go
on a trip, Lilee?

15
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,070
(Horn honking)

16
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,311
(Miles)
Which way are we going?

17
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,512
(Woman)
North.

18
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,780
How far north?

19
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,682
(Girl)
The North Pole?

20
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,751
No, not that far north.

21
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,129
(Birds chirping)

22
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,630
(Bells jingling)

23
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,133
(Girl)
It looks like
no job here, either.

24
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,207
Hello!

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,808
All right,
put your seat belts on.

26
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,612
And then Santa came

27
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,847
And the family had
the best Christmas ever.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,349
(Girl)
Tell us another one.

29
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,450
Oh, tomorrow, honey,

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,353
I don't want to
use 'em all up today.

31
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,654
I miss home.

32
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,356
Well, we'll find
a better one.

33
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,291
(Miles)
We never should have left.

34
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,160
No, we shouldn't have
stayed as long as we did.

35
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,508
Mama, I gotta go.

36
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,434
It'll be okay, Mama.

37
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,869
How do you know?

38
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,237
I said a prayer.

39
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,606
A... a lot of good
that'll do.

40
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,376
Hey, Miles,
it couldn't hurt.

41
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,344
Mama, you're strong.

42
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,945
Thank you, sweetheart.

43
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,516
Remember what Pastor Woolery
used to say.

44
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,717
What?

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,319
"Women are like tea bags.

46
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,620
"You never know
how strong they are

47
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,922
Until you put 'em in
hot water."

48
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,791
Or how dumb.

49
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,036
(Bell dinging)

50
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,324
(Woman sighing)

51
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,759
We gotta find a motel.

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,562
Mama, I gotta go.

53
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,898
Oh-oh... why-why didn't you go
when we stopped last time?

54
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,067
'Cause I didn't
have to go then!

55
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,502
Okay.

56
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,340
You do?

57
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,378
Okay, thanks.

58
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,392
Okay.

59
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,361
Okay.

60
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,096
The motel has a vacancy.

61
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,031
I thought Dad
took all the money.

62
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,933
Well, I had some
he didn't know about.

63
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,967
Why'd he take it?

64
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,604
'Cause that's
what lowlifes do.

65
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,573
I mean, maybe he needed some
for himself, right?

66
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,976
Yeah, probably needed it
for his lady friend.

67
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,445
(Giggling)

68
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah.

69
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:50,017
Well, the motel's not far,
so... buckle up.

70
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,389
(Man)
No pets neither.

71
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,824
(Woman)
We don't have any pets.

72
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,991
I could give you
a better rate

73
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,127
If you stayed
the whole week.

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,463
With Christmas and all,
we don't get much traffic.

75
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,864
Do you need any
help around here?

76
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,599
Nah, wife does it.

77
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,100
Mama, I gotta go!

78
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,902
I'm coming.

79
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,170
Trudy may be looking
for a waitress

80
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,672
To handle
the graveyard.

81
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,040
That's what I hear.
Who?

82
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,442
Trudy Willis.

83
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:18,446
She owns the Model A Cafe,
south end of town.

84
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,414
Okay.

85
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,849
Thank you.

86
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,120
But, Mama, I gotta go!

87
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,656
Well, you're just
gonna have to hold it.

88
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,058
That's what I've been doing
and I can't anymore!

89
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,827
Does she have to
be by us?

90
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,496
A diaper!

91
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,797
(Giggling)

92
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,739
I can't afford to hire
anyone right now.

93
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:46,940
Please, I've tried
every town

94
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,175
Between here
and the state line.

95
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,977
I've got to find something.
I understand that.

96
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,845
No, I'll work for
half the wages.

97
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,447
You don't understand.

98
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,149
I can't afford to
hire anyone.

99
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,954
She's re-really gotta go.

100
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,956
Okay, do you have
a restroom she can use?

101
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,525
Sure, come here.

102
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,495
What are you drawing,
Lilee?

103
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,429
Oh, what color is it?

104
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,835
How about I work for whatever
you can afford and tips?

105
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,604
How about that?

106
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,840
I can only afford
minimum wage

107
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,876
And we'll see how
it goes 'til Christmas.

108
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,745
Thank you, thank you!

109
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,147
Oh, you won't
regret it.

110
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,049
I already do.
Oh, thank you!

111
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,919
Hi, Lilee.

112
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,623
Well, this probably
won't last long anyway.

113
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,824
What's that?

114
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,092
Oh, I said
I can't wait that long.

115
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,695
I need you to start
tonight.

116
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,631
Tonight, tonight?

117
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,733
Oh, um, all right,
let me get the kids

118
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,934
Squared away then.

119
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,103
Mac and cheese leftover
from lunch.

120
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,705
For the children.

121
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,007
Really?
Thank you.

122
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,275
You'll need to wear this.

123
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,511
It's not chic,
but it's clean.

124
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,747
Great, thank you.

125
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,715
You're a good person,
Mrs. Willis.

126
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,851
Yeah, well, don't let
that get around, okay?

127
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,019
I'll see you soon.

128
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,721
I thought you
weren't hiring.

129
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,189
I'm not.

130
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,591
Now.

131
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,264
Do I smell smoke?

132
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, where there's smoke,
there's dinner.

133
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,308
Who's gonna
stay with us?

134
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,810
Well, I think Miles is

135
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,812
Responsible enough
for that now.

136
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,681
Do I get paid, too?

137
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,515
One thing at a time.

138
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,285
And, Miles, I'm really
counting on you.

139
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,654
You are in the fifth grade
and you're old enough.

140
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,723
Should be in sixth.

141
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,224
We've been
through all that.

142
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,159
I held you back so you could
take better care of yourself.

143
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,295
And not get beat up
by bullies.

144
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,198
Mel, less talk,
more eat, please.

145
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,834
Okay, I'm gonna give you
the number of the cafe.

146
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,669
If you need me,
you go to the office

147
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,037
And you use the pay phone,
okay?

148
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,572
Okay.
Here you go.

149
00:08:58,606 --> 00:08:59,840
I love you.

150
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,675
You got change?
Yeah.

151
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,143
No story tonight?

152
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,579
I'll tell you
two tomorrow.

153
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,880
Come here, sweetie.

154
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,682
Say bye-byes.
Bye-bye!

155
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,284
I love you, oh.

156
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,886
She might need to
go to bed early.

157
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,054
Okay, bye.

158
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,191
(Mel)
Love you.
Call me if you
need anything.

159
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,295
Mama trusts you.

160
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,231
She's not my mom.

161
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,666
She is now.

162
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,236
No, she just married my dad,
that's all.

163
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,038
(Lilee)
She's my mommy, too.

164
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,912
(Bells jingling)

165
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,952
Hey, take a picture,
it'll last longer!

166
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,823
Martha, right?
Uh, yeah.

167
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:50,924
Lola.
Hi.

168
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,325
Welcome.
Thank you.

169
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,761
Oh, and don't mind them.

170
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,328
The only thing
they like looking at better

171
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,699
Than a new woman in town
is a new tractor.

172
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,100
Oh.

173
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,169
Trudy likes all of us
to wear those.

174
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,737
Oh, yeah, all of us.

175
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,739
Yeah, you, me,
and me and you.

176
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,240
Yeah, right.

177
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,176
You catch on quick.

178
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,646
That's a first around here,
an actual IQ.

179
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,881
Thank you.

180
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,215
Where can
I put my stuff?

181
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,250
Just in back.
All right, thank you.

182
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,854
You know what we need?

183
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,923
No, and I don't
want to.

184
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,024
A tree.

185
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,993
It's almost Christmas.
Why?

186
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,829
There won't be any
Ch-Ch-Christmas for us.

187
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,330
Yes, there will.

188
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,965
Have it by
the door.

189
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,001
How would we open it?

190
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,869
Oh, yeah.

191
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,104
By the bed?

192
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,440
F-f-forget the stupid tree
and go to sleep.

193
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,910
It's not stupid,
and you go to sleep.

194
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,345
You're not the boss of me.
I am tonight.

195
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,947
Then you have to
tell a story.

196
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,448
I don't know any.

197
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,851
You must know one.

198
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,421
Oh!

199
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,693
Here you go.

200
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,797
Trudy finally broke down
and hired a regular, huh?

201
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,966
Jim, you no talk
like that.

202
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,234
I didn't mean
nothing by it.

203
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,302
Well, that's me, just
a broken-down regular.

204
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,470
Don't listen to him.

205
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,039
He's loco.

206
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,807
Yeah, well, I've never seen
anybody order enchiladas

207
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,108
Smothered in gravy.

208
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,745
You ain't lived, darlin'.

209
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,314
I don't know
any stories, Mel.

210
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,751
Go to sleep.

211
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,285
Not even
a Christmas story?

212
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,920
No.

213
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,757
All right,
then I'll tell you one.

214
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,096
It was Christmas Eve
a really long time ago,

215
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,065
So long ago

216
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,501
That it wasn't even
called Christmas yet.

217
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,371
It's always been called
Chr-Christmas.

218
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,874
Not the first one.

219
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,441
His name was Joe.

220
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,477
That's what
people called him.

221
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,479
It was short for Joseph.

222
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,347
Aye!

223
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,150
And she was Mary

224
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,753
And she was
going to have a baby

225
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:03,123
And all the animals they
passed knew who she was.

226
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,826
Give me a break.

227
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,829
And when Mary
and Joe passed by them,

228
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,497
The sheep would go "baaa"

229
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,833
And the donkey went
"hee-haw,"

230
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,835
And the dog, "woof."

231
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,137
I know how animals sound.

232
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,339
That was because
the animals knew

233
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,342
Her baby was
going to be very special.

234
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,313
He was going to be the most
special baby ever born.

235
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,215
He was going to be a king,

236
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,350
But nobody
knew it yet

237
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,954
And he was going to
save people.

238
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,189
Good people, bad people,

239
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,426
Kids, grownups...
Everybody.

240
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,872
(Martha)
I thought my marriage
was made in heaven.

241
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,540
Well, marriages
are made in heaven,

242
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,209
But so is thunder
and lightning.

243
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,410
(Laughing)

244
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,446
True.

245
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,148
Martha.

246
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,883
I haven't heard
an old-fashioned name

247
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,084
Like that in a while.

248
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,219
It was my
grandmother's name.

249
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,522
It's a derivation of Mary,
you know.

250
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,492
Mother Mary
at Christmastime.

251
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,929
Maybe the mother part.

252
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,899
So is Trudy having a hard time
keeping this place open?

253
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,969
Well, when the economy tanks,
people don't eat out as much.

254
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,037
Yeah, it's
a small town, huh?

255
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,173
Phone book has one page.

256
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,341
Wow, what about
the regulars?

257
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,011
They keep the place
going.

258
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,612
I met the Carnes.
Mm-hmm.

259
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,181
They seem like
really nice people.

260
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,384
Oh, all our regulars are,
if you don't count Les.

261
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,920
Les?

262
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,222
McCallum, local cattleman.

263
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,024
Cranky?

264
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,425
Babies are cranky,

265
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,929
Les is miserable,
like an old hamburger patty

266
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,164
Fizzing and sputtering
in his own grease.

267
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,200
Ew.
Ugh.

268
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,302
Who else should
I look out for?

269
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,070
Joe Hopkins.

270
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,973
Oh, yeah,
he's miserable, too?

271
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,441
No, just the opposite.

272
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,218
Hey.

273
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,387
Okay.

274
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,392
You probably want coffee.

275
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,228
Hot chocolate, actually.

276
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,595
Okay.

277
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,167
(Machine whirring)

278
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,175
Here you go.
Thank you.

279
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,482
Oh, can I get you
anything else?

280
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,451
(Lola)
Piece of lemon meringue pie.

281
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,420
And a piece of
lemon meringue pie.

282
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,989
Coming right up.

283
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,663
How is it?

284
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,631
I have no idea.

285
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,967
Can I get a fork?

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,434
Oh, yeah.

287
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,604
Fork?

288
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,312
(Woman)
Mrs. Evans?

289
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,347
Carol Ann Bullington from
over at the motel.

290
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,615
Owen's wife.

291
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,284
Yeah, what can
I do for you?

292
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,119
There's been
a little problem,

293
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,653
Kind of an accident
in your room.

294
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,089
Are the kids okay?

295
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,123
Kids are fine.

296
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,625
Best you come see
for yourself.

297
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,228
Um, Lola, I gotta go,
something's come up.

298
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,470
Who's gonna pay
for this?

299
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,738
What is it?

300
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,672
What happened?

301
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,074
What happened?

302
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,609
I'll tell you
what happened.

303
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,345
The toilet overflowed
and you ruined my carpet.

304
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,580
Oh.

305
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,250
It's worth probably...
100.

306
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,551
No, it ain't.

307
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,021
You told me you was gonna
rip it out next week.

308
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,223
Not now, Carol Ann.

309
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,658
Are you trying to take
advantage of this nice lady?

310
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,328
Ain't happening, Owen.

311
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,729
That boy...

312
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,198
Is not old enough to
take care of 'em.

313
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,567
Now you find
someone who can,

314
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,271
Or I will throw out
the lot of you!

315
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,673
The only thing you're gonna
throw out is your belly.

316
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,279
It's like being married to
a cement mixer.

317
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,648
Good night, Owen.

318
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,021
Good night, Carol Ann.

319
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,361
His bark is worse
than his bite.

320
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,695
Where am I gonna
find a sitter

321
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,665
That will work
late and for cheap?

322
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,533
I got a stepdaughter,
Jeanie.

323
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,235
She's about 16.

324
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,137
I'll... I'll see
if she can do it.

325
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,273
Really?
Don't worry.

326
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,675
It'll be all right.

327
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,643
Good night, honey.
Thank you.

328
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,145
Sleep tight.

329
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,662
How... how does
a three-year-old

330
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,232
Get all that in there?

331
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,068
She's stronger
than she looks.

332
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,403
Didn't you put her
to sleep?

333
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,140
Yeah, she just
didn't... stay there.

334
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,474
In my office now.

335
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,344
You, out.

336
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,780
Miles...

337
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,749
She was your
responsibility.

338
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,386
She's l-l-like
a ninja baby.

339
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,822
She was asleep when I...

340
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,291
Fell asleep?
Yeah.

341
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,527
Look, I know
you were tired,

342
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,562
But babies, they get up in
the middle of the night

343
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,431
And it's my fault
for not having a crib,

344
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,867
But...

345
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,569
You really need to be
more cautious

346
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,703
With your little sister.

347
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,439
She's not my sister!

348
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,107
Half-sister, then.

349
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,475
If we would have
stayed home

350
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,145
And wa-wa-wa...
And waited for Dad,

351
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,546
This would not have
happened!

352
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,715
No, if we had stayed home,
we would still be waiting.

353
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,685
He's not coming back, Miles...
I'm sorry... ever.

354
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,686
I hate this!

355
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,222
I hate you
for doing this!

356
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,523
(Mel coughing)

357
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,691
You were listening?

358
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:12,692
Hearing.

359
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,627
There's a difference.

360
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,229
(Miles)
None of your business.

361
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,298
You aren't even my sisters!
Fine.

362
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,632
Be that way.

363
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,835
(Owl hooting)

364
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,921
It'll be okay, Mama.

365
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,856
Oh.

366
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,359
You should be in bed,
sweetie.

367
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,662
God won't forget us at
Christmas.

368
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,533
No, no.

369
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,801
Not you.

370
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,270
But I think he wrote me off
a long time ago.

371
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,439
No, he doesn't
work like that.

372
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,441
God kinda makes you
worry a while,

373
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,410
Until you get some faith,

374
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,379
And then later,
you believe in Him.

375
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,350
See?

376
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,818
Only you gotta
pray, though.

377
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,456
Oh.

378
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,359
I don't think I'm very good
at that, either.

379
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,893
That's the easy part.

380
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,331
You don't have to be,
you just have to do it.

381
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,403
How did you
get so smart?

382
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,771
Always have been.

383
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,839
You'll see.

384
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,608
This will be
the best Christmas ever.

385
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,244
I love you.

386
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,748
I love you, too,
baby girl.

387
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,333
Can't we w-wait
'til after Christmas?

388
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,469
No, because I want you
to get to know your teachers

389
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,870
Before the term starts.

390
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,872
And the kids.
Yeah.

391
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,474
That's what worries me.

392
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,944
Look, Miles.

393
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,314
This is a chance
for you to start over.

394
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,317
It doesn't have to be like
it was before, okay?

395
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,951
They'll make
fun of me.

396
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,721
The way I look,
the way I talk.

397
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,626
Look.

398
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,429
You need to stand up
for yourself.

399
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,765
You need to be
proud of who you are.

400
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,735
When you show
them that...

401
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,704
They'll respect you.

402
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,841
They'd respect me more
if I was a karate master.

403
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,976
But you're not.

404
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,012
You are you.

405
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,048
And you are someone
worth knowing.

406
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,051
Just show them that.

407
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,322
Whatever.

408
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,789
Promise?

409
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,959
It won't do any good.

410
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,728
Then again, it might.

411
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,496
Let's go.

412
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,634
(School bell ringing)

413
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,070
First and last?

414
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,639
How much is that?

415
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,374
Is it furnished,
by any chance?

416
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,975
Would you consider
any less?

417
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,311
Okay.

418
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,446
That's out.

419
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,649
Would you consider
any less?

420
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,551
That's okay, all right.

421
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,852
That's out.

422
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,987
Yes, I'm calling about
the house

423
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,489
That you have for rent.

424
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,691
Three children
and one adult.

425
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,825
No, no pets.

426
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,394
That's out.

427
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,530
Well, we just moved here
and we're not settled, so...

428
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,765
Okay.

429
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,335
Oh, man.

430
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,704
Okay.

431
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,005
Do you want something
to eat, baby?

432
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,574
Here, come here.

433
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,944
Let's hug.

434
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,315
You go to sleep.

435
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,902
(Giggling)

436
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,690
Oh, my gosh, Lilee.

437
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,495
Oh, my gosh!

438
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,597
You are a ninja baby.

439
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:45,798
Oh, what a mess.

440
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,103
Heard you had some
trouble last night.

441
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,939
Oh, hi.

442
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:57,043
I did, but, um,
everything's okay.

443
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,012
Glad... glad to hear it.

444
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,549
Are you always on duty?

445
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,116
No, I just
started a shift.

446
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,985
It's the afternoon.

447
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,988
I'm sorry, it sounds like
I was grilling you.

448
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,858
Were you?

449
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,628
No, I mean, I just...

450
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,129
Just met you
at 3:00 a.m.

451
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:21,534
And now I'm seeing you again,
and so it just seems like...

452
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,537
I don't know,
like you're always working.

453
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,938
Not always.

454
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,207
I'm sure your wife
wouldn't like that anyway.

455
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,109
Yeah, no,
she wouldn't.

456
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,111
If I had one.
Oh.

457
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,881
That's life.

458
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,487
I guess it's not always
like the brochure, right?

459
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,954
No, no.

460
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,458
(Sighing)

461
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:48,861
Um, are you
gonna stay here?

462
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,129
At the motel?

463
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,931
I hope not.

464
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,668
I'm sort of hoping to find
a house that I could afford,

465
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:59,939
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

466
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,608
There's not
a lot out there.

467
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,175
Did you talk to
Don Meyer?

468
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,477
Who?

469
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,145
Oh, he's the local property
manager.

470
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,649
I'm sure he can find
something in your price range.

471
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,151
You mean
no price range?

472
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,986
I'm sure he can
find something.

473
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,856
He's got
special help, you know?

474
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,627
No.

475
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,694
Right.

476
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,963
He's... he's the local pastor
as well.

477
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,799
Oh, well.

478
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,568
Doubt he'd like to help
a heathen like me.

479
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,004
I haven't been to
church since I was ten.

480
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,139
Gotta help heathens
once in a while

481
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,941
Or he wouldn't
have a congregation.

482
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,176
Yeah.

483
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:42,882
I can ask him to drop by
the cafe if you want.

484
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,685
I would
appreciate that, yeah.

485
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,988
Thank you.
You're welcome.

486
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,791
Um, it's...
Martha.

487
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,727
Right.
Evans.

488
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,063
Now we're formally
introduced.

489
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,698
Yes, we are.

490
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,903
I guess today's
my lucky day.

491
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,806
Thanks to you, everything's
coming my way.

492
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,575
You know,
in my line of work,

493
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,210
If it's going your
direction,

494
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,112
You're in the wrong lane.

495
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,647
That's true.

496
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,282
Yeah, that's
a really bad cop joke.

497
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,185
Um, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

498
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,553
Thanks.

499
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,154
Same here.

500
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,198
Wouldn't mind
getting a ticket from him.

501
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,102
Hey!

502
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,671
See you tomorrow.
Bye!

503
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,039
Oh!

504
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,107
How was your first day?

505
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,274
Good!

506
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,876
I did the best
in spelling today.

507
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,713
Teacher said I was a good
condition to the class.

508
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,882
"Addition," you're a good
addition to the class.

509
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:50,883
That's great.

510
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,284
All right, how about you,
Miles?

511
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,285
How were you today?

512
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,721
It's school.

513
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,755
Right, of course.

514
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,289
What was I thinking?

515
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,891
Listen, I owe you
a big apology.

516
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,326
For what?

517
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,696
For coming down so hard on you
when you were watching Lilee.

518
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,932
See, today she managed to
spread peanut butter and jelly

519
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,934
All over the room while
I was sleeping.

520
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,101
(Giggling)

521
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,369
Forgiven?

522
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,271
How about even?

523
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,607
That works for me.

524
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,975
Thank you.

525
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:20,046
(Video game noises)

526
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,852
Oh...

527
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,656
Oh.

528
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,924
Oh, why'd you let me
sleep so long?

529
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,192
You were tired.

530
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,794
Oh, that's no excuse.

531
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,362
I've used it before.

532
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,097
Oh, I gotta get some
dinner going.

533
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,298
Pizza?

534
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,268
No, I can't afford
that right now, honey.

535
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,670
Ta-da, ramen.

536
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,738
Again?

537
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,875
Well, as soon
as I get paid,

538
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,777
I promise, I'll get us
some real groceries?

539
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,044
Why?

540
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,246
We don't even
have a fridge.

541
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,115
Well, I'm working on that.

542
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,250
How about... tree?

543
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,252
Mama, we do
need a tree.

544
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,789
Yeah, well, I'm sure
wherever we're going,

545
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,256
There'll be lots of trees
in the yard.

546
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,794
No, a Christmas tree.

547
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,962
Here?
Yeah.

548
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,800
No, I...

549
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,735
I can't afford
a Christmas tree

550
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,437
And we don't even have anything
to put on it anyway,

551
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,439
And I'm sure
Bullington would have a cow

552
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,174
If we brought a tree
in here.

553
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,677
A cow would take more
room than a tree.

554
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,878
You do need a cow.

555
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,113
(Knocking)

556
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,948
Uh, no on the tree.

557
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,050
How about...
How about the star?

558
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,386
Hi.
(girl)
Hi, I'm Jeanie.

559
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,122
Yes, Jeanie,
come on in.

560
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,258
(Martha)
Mel, come here, Jeanie's here.

561
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,027
I want you to meet her.

562
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,429
Hi, I'm Mary Ellen,
but you can call me Mel.

563
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,865
Okay.

564
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,434
Mrs. Evans?
Mm-hmm.

565
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,936
Oh, it's Martha,
actually.

566
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,971
Oh, um, Martha.

567
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,941
My dad wanted me to ask you
about the money.

568
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,108
Right.

569
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,744
Of course, the money.

570
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,781
Um, right, straight to
business, that's smart.

571
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:06,485
See, I've only just started
at the cafe, so...

572
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,387
Heard you're working
at the Root Beer.

573
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,891
The... Trudy's Model A,
right?

574
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,125
Same thing.

575
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,894
Used to be called
The Root Beer Drive-In.

576
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,896
Had the best homemade
root beer anywhere.

577
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,297
Oh.

578
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,000
Well...

579
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,302
I can only pay you
$2 an hour

580
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,238
And I know that's
under minimum wage

581
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,174
Um...

582
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,776
And they don't pay me
for another week,

583
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,412
So I can give you
half of it in advance

584
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,015
And then the other half
when they pay me.

585
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,049
Is that okay?

586
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,785
Just one week?

587
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,087
Well, then I gotta
pay your dad the rent

588
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,891
And then I gotta get
the groceries.

589
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,393
I didn't have too much
money when we got here.

590
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,529
$207, 'cause Daddy
took the rest.

591
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,298
Zip it, Mel.

592
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,203
$8 is just fine, Mrs...

593
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,171
Martha.
Really?

594
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,973
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

595
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,876
I really appreciate that,
thank you.

596
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,311
So what grade
are you in?

597
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,312
A sophomore.

598
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,980
Getting my license
in a month.

599
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:08,915
Oh.

600
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,783
Can you drive a stick?

601
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,218
I can.

602
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,420
Not quite yet.

603
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,155
My dad taught me.

604
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,356
Well, maybe
you can teach me.

605
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,891
Seriously?

606
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,326
Yeah, out in
the parking lot.

607
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,261
Well, if my dad says
it's okay.

608
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,296
Sure.

609
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,200
Uh, I'll have to take
that under advisement.

610
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,402
Now here's someone
you haven't met.

611
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,004
This is Lilee.

612
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,240
Come on, sweetheart.

613
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,575
This is our Lilee.

614
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,045
She's three
and she's full of it.

615
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,546
Full of what?

616
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,481
It's just an expression,
sweetheart.

617
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,351
I know what
she's full of.

618
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,219
So why don't I get
my dos and don'ts

619
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,288
For this crew together

620
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,224
And you can come back
maybe around 10:30.

621
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,961
Mom says it'll be a good time
for me to do my homework.

622
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,263
Oh, yeah, well,
good luck with that.

623
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,866
It can get a little crazy
around here.

624
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,301
Well, better go,
but see you later.

625
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,270
All right,
thank you so much.

626
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,175
Woo, okay.

627
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,342
She's nice, huh?

628
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,111
She's a lifesaver.

629
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,236
(Lola)
Side of gravy's coming up.

630
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,071
Need more butter.

631
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:41,507
You want some heart medicine
to go with that cholesterol?

632
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,275
Got plenty on the truck.

633
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,278
You ought to take better
care of yourself, Frank.

634
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,581
I figured maybe I could find
somebody to do it for me.

635
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,483
Got somebody in mind?

636
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,452
Might be.

637
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,321
Someone as pretty as you.

638
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,856
There's always one more
imbecile than you counted on.

639
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:00,859
(Whispering)
Sorry.

640
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,495
You're late.

641
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,931
I know, I'm sorry.

642
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,399
I had to get
my sitter squared away.

643
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,603
So... here we go.

644
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,906
Mm-hmm.
Here's the deal.

645
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,475
This guy behind me,
that's Les McCallum,

646
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,178
He's a regular and he's having
what he always has,

647
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,613
A third of a pound
of ground round,

648
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:25,217
French fries,
onions and gravy.

649
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,385
Fries and gravy?

650
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,519
Heart attack special.

651
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,355
Listen, we just give 'em
what they want.

652
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,422
Okay.

653
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,958
The guy over
in the corner,

654
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,592
That's Don Meyer

655
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,495
And you'll be seeing him
a lot around here.

656
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,098
Slow night, huh?
Dead night.

657
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,067
I got this.

658
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,969
Well, it looks like
you've done this before.

659
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,703
A time or two.

660
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,939
How are the kids?
They're managing.

661
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:47,606
Good.

662
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,408
And Christmas?

663
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,709
I'm working on that.

664
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,213
Well, I put a tip jar out here
on the counter.

665
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,481
Everyone'll see it.

666
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:56,682
I don't know if they'll do
anything about it,

667
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,384
But they'll see it.
Okay.

668
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,553
Let's see.
All right.

669
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:04,991
Hi.

670
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,326
Most of the zoo
will be in tonight.

671
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,329
Oh, well, that should be
interesting.

672
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,565
So... tell me
about yourself.

673
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,101
None of my business,

674
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,569
But if you wanted to share,
we've got all night.

675
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,371
Oh, well.

676
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,273
I've been married twice.

677
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,375
First one lasted long enough
for me to have a daughter

678
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,978
And then for my 30th birthday,

679
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:30,149
I got a new husband
and a year later, a baby.

680
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,484
You don't waste
any time, do you?

681
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,586
I wish I had.

682
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,388
He's the original bad boy

683
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,190
With a truckload
of friends to match.

684
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:39,591
Handsome?

685
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,628
As sin.

686
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,630
Cowboy Cal Evans.

687
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,067
(Sighing)

688
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,203
Didn't know much about
the sin part then, though.

689
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:55,207
He could take over a room just
by walking into it, you know?

690
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,475
And then last week,

691
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,710
He took almost everything
that wasn't nailed down

692
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,246
And emptied the bank accounts

693
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,682
And ran off with the local
beauty school graduate.

694
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,152
So when did
things go bad?

695
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,653
(Laughing)

696
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,221
You're funny.

697
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,622
You're so funny.

698
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,792
You have homework?

699
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,227
Did... did it.

700
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,362
You did not.

701
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,130
Mind your own business!

702
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,465
Bed in 20 minutes.

703
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,300
You, go brush
your teeth.

704
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,169
I knew this
would happen.
What?

705
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,403
You figured no rules?

706
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,704
Wrong.

707
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,174
Why are you doing this?

708
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:31,177
You ain't
making squat.

709
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,444
I like your mom.

710
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,046
She's not my mom.

711
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,215
Well, Carol Ann's not my
biological mom either,

712
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,283
But she loves me.

713
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,517
Lucky you.

714
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,219
What have you got
to complain about?

715
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,088
She's taking care of you,
isn't she?

716
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,355
'Cause she has to.

717
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:45,091
No, she doesn't.

718
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,659
She could have dumped you off
at the state.

719
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,395
Where's your dad?

720
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,697
He left last week.

721
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,133
Two weeks
before Christmas?

722
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,567
So?

723
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,370
Seems pretty cold to leave
your family at Christmastime.

724
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,239
He'll find me.

725
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,175
Martha didn't leave you,
though, did she?

726
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,410
Might wanna
think about that.

727
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,348
Will you tell us
a Christmas story?

728
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,217
Yeah.

729
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,618
Did you brush
your teeth?
Yes.

730
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,220
Yeah, last Tuesday.

731
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,421
Okay, all right.

732
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,489
You two in bed.

733
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,258
So can I get you
anything else?

734
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,293
Coffee, tea, pie?

735
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,162
The cherries are fresh,
cherry pie?

736
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,431
No, I'm trying to
cut back.

737
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,166
Oh.

738
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,567
It's Martha, right?

739
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,202
Uh, yeah.

740
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,205
Joe Hopkins told you?
Yeah, this afternoon.

741
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,507
He says you're
looking for a rental.

742
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,643
Yes.

743
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,711
Do you have
anything that you think

744
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,713
Someone like me
can afford?

745
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,682
Yeah, I think I might have
one possibility.

746
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,252
I won't know until
I talk to the owner,

747
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,421
So why don't you give me
a call and we'll see.

748
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,689
Thanks, Pastor.

749
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,158
Now, listen,
you and the children

750
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,892
Are more than welcome
to join us at church.

751
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,295
Oh, I don't know.

752
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,429
I don't know if
your church would

753
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,565
Still be standing
if I stepped in.

754
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,233
A real sinner, huh?

755
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,770
Just a slow learner.

756
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,838
Well, listen, we're all
a little slow around here,

757
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,374
So you'll fit right in.

758
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:14,180
But it was a very special
Christmas tree.

759
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,448
"A magical tree," some said.

760
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,684
The only one
of its kind.

761
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,587
A special tree that bloomed
for the first time

762
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,322
When Mary's
child was born.

763
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,324
That's the kind of tree
we need.

764
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,893
But it wasn't
like any other tree.

765
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,597
This tree only bloomed on
Christmas Day

766
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,466
And the second
Christmas Day was over,

767
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,369
It disappeared for a whole
other year.

768
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:40,272
It doesn't sound like any
Chr-Chr-Christmas tree

769
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,540
I've ever seen.

770
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,309
That's because
it's in Bethlehem.

771
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,810
They have different
trees there.

772
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,713
A Christmas tree
is a Christmas tree.

773
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,615
I liked your story,
Jeanie.

774
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,183
Thank you, Mel.

775
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,751
Now you little ones
go to sleep.

776
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,860
A-a-another day at school.

777
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,462
Yep.

778
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,297
(Sighing)

779
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,670
Not again!

780
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,342
Go in.

781
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,815
All right.

782
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,289
Hi.
Hi.

783
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,490
Got a minute?

784
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,991
Actually,
I was gonna call you.

785
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,726
Oh, it's no problem,
it was on my way.

786
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,862
Listen, I talked
to Clarice Miller.

787
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,598
She said that she'd consider
renting it out for six months.

788
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,867
Really?

789
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,369
How much?

790
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,903
500.

791
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,773
I can't afford that.

792
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:48,874
I figured that.

793
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,742
So, if you're interested,

794
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,579
She'll let you clean her house
once a week

795
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,782
And take off 150 a month.

796
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,784
350?

797
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,852
I know it's difficult for you
living by yourself

798
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,821
And having three kids.

799
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,023
No, what's difficult
is living on my own

800
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,359
With three kids
in a motel room.

801
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,663
Tell her I can't pay her
'til after Christmas.

802
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,332
I told her.

803
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,601
She'll hold it for you through
the first week of January.

804
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,035
Oh, you thought of
everything.

805
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,637
I'll let her know.
Thank you.

806
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,805
You're welcome.

807
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:26,978
* Hark the herald
angels sing *

808
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:33,519
* Glory to
the newborn king *

809
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:40,626
* Peace on earth
and mercy mild *

810
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:46,765
* God and sinners
reconciled *

811
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,402
I want my burgers
medium-well.

812
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,804
I hate soggy burgers.

813
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,673
Okay, how do you
want your eggs?

814
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,041
From a chicken.

815
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,577
Right.

816
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,646
No fish eggs.

817
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,448
How do you want 'em?

818
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:03,715
On a plate.

819
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:04,783
Raw?

820
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,986
Over... easy.

821
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,955
Okay.

822
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,724
Uh, toast?
White.

823
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,092
Not whole wheat

824
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,762
Or all that multigrain crap
that I feed the hogs.

825
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,630
How about to drink?

826
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:19,965
Oh, I don't know.

827
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,033
Coffee, black.

828
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,370
I do my own sugar.

829
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,937
If I had a spoon.

830
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,411
And some ketchup.

831
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:42,754
Hmm.

832
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,624
(Dog barking)

833
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,069
* Stay, stay

834
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,739
* Stay

835
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:07,045
* 'Tis the eve
of souls pray *

836
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:12,718
Hi.

837
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:13,985
Come in.

838
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,426
So how are you
holding up?

839
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,594
Oh.

840
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,931
On No-Doz and Scotch tape.

841
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,667
Sometimes I get tension
headaches.

842
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,968
Oh.

843
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,405
You should do what it says on
the aspirin bottle.

844
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,940
What's that?

845
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:35,974
Take two aspirin,

846
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,909
Keep out of
the reach of children.

847
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,745
(Laughing)

848
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,647
Yeah.

849
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,949
You do really need to
get some rest, though.

850
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,117
Yeah, I will.

851
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,554
As soon as I get the kids fed
and then to school.

852
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,122
And... then

853
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,024
The baby's up, so...

854
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,728
Hmm, Lola told me
all about it.

855
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,664
He left you nothing?

856
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,166
Just the kids.

857
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,068
But the girls, you know,
they're doing great.

858
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,703
They're okay.

859
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,072
It's...

860
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,840
Miles is struggling a bit.

861
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,678
His only biological
parent left him.

862
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,113
Oh, he's not yours?

863
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,915
He is now.

864
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,150
Well, there's
only one thing you can do.

865
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,852
What's that?

866
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,020
Love him.

867
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,756
Even when he
doesn't want you to.

868
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,793
Which is most of the time.

869
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,828
Yeah, he has no problem
reminding me

870
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,531
That I am not his mother.

871
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:35,433
He was really hurt
when his dad left him.

872
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,571
He's better off.

873
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,107
Amen.

874
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,842
Amen.

875
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,212
Now I sound like Mel.

876
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:50,148
She's our little
believer.

877
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,018
She's absolutely
convinced that...

878
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,753
Jesus is gonna make
everything okay

879
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,655
Because Christmas is here.

880
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,957
Ah, the faith of a child.

881
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,597
I don't really have much
Christmas spirit myself.

882
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,266
Why's that?

883
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,269
My husband
died at Christmas.

884
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,804
Oh.

885
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,007
I'm sorry.

886
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:19,678
He was
the love of my life.

887
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,913
We were married 43 years

888
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,182
And we hardly
spent a day apart.

889
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,519
He was always underfoot,
you know, like a kid

890
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,054
And then one day,

891
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,124
He just up and dies on me
at Christmas Eve.

892
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,861
I'm sure
he didn't want to.

893
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:39,064
Well, I mean to ask him
about that...

894
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,667
When I see him up there.

895
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,605
Do you believe in
up there?

896
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,176
I suppose.

897
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,112
I'm still pretty upset
with God

898
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,981
For taking him from me.

899
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,051
Maybe you can tell him
that when you see him.

900
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,059
I should have sold this place
a long time ago,

901
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:12,297
But it's the only
thing I have left of Sam.

902
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,833
We did really well
for a while.

903
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,336
Sam made
the best root beer.

904
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,038
I wanna show you
something.

905
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,808
Come on.

906
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,281
It's been ten years.

907
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,150
Since you've
been in here?

908
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,284
No.

909
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,921
Since Sam's
last batch of root beer.

910
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:39,625
I really don't know why
I've kept it all so long.

911
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:43,294
Maybe you're keeping it to
possibly make another batch.

912
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,897
No, Sam
made the root beer.

913
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,199
Well, with Sam gone,

914
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,835
There just doesn't seem
much of a point,

915
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:53,104
No matter what
Reverend Meyer says.

916
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:54,673
Oh, you know what?

917
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,108
He... he said he might have
a place for us to rent.

918
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,644
Where?

919
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,612
Um, the Miller house?

920
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:03,081
Clarice Miller?

921
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,751
The Brazilian buzz saw?

922
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,986
I haven't met her.

923
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,789
She is like
one of those fish

924
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:11,957
That live in the Amazon River,

925
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,925
You know, the one
with teeth and they...

926
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,226
Oh, a piranha?

927
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,128
That's her.

928
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:19,197
All teeth and all mouth

929
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,365
And the only
thing she cares about

930
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,233
Is herself and money.

931
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,935
Oh.

932
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,070
How much?

933
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,006
350, but I have to
clean for it.

934
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,142
Get it in writing.

935
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,011
What are those there?

936
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,650
Oh, well, that's some junk
I was gonna get rid of.

937
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:39,985
Can I have it?

938
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,854
It's junk.

939
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,290
How about these?

940
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,793
Go ahead.

941
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,360
Thank you.

942
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,334
Hey, how'd it go?

943
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,969
Well, we're getting
used to each other.

944
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,270
Okay, good.

945
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,307
Here, I made a few extra tips
than usual last night

946
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,209
And here you go.

947
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,343
What's this?

948
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,679
My I.O.U.,
signed and dated.

949
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:09,347
You didn't
need to do that.

950
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,849
I trust you.

951
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:11,950
Well, it's not
a matter of trust,

952
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,985
It's a matter of
integrity.

953
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,220
I'm just so grateful

954
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,788
That you're helping me out
on your nights off.

955
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,189
Well, it's helping
me too, you know?

956
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,758
I'm getting homework done,

957
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,392
Not spending
as much money as I used to.

958
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:22,293
Great.

959
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,361
Okay, good.

960
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,063
I just wanted
to let you know,

961
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,198
I didn't know about it until
it was too late.

962
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,135
What?

963
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,037
Well, I fell asleep
around midnight,

964
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,205
And when I woke up this
morning to feed the baby,

965
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,941
It was already there.

966
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:36,875
But I gotta go!

967
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,244
Bye!

968
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,112
It was there?

969
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,187
(Sighing)

970
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,890
It kinda
grows on you, huh?

971
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:55,193
I still need
some more colors.

972
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,262
Why, Mel?

973
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,765
Isn't Christmas
without a tree.

974
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,833
But we don't own this room.

975
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,501
We're gonna be here
for Christmas.

976
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,837
Isn't it wonderful?

977
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,205
(Sighing)

978
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,374
You have to erase it.

979
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,976
A permanent marker.

980
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,080
Where did you get
colored markers?

981
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:16,347
School.

982
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,783
I just borrowed 'em.

983
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,450
You said we can't
afford a real one.

984
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,153
Besides, I think
this is better.

985
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,321
Don't you?

986
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:25,924
Permanent markers.

987
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,759
Are you gonna
take us to school?

988
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,796
(Sighing)

989
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,497
We're gonna have to
talk about this later, Mel.

990
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,365
You can help,
if you want.

991
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:37,535
Get in the car.

992
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,005
I... I'm not
going anywhere.

993
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:42,407
Did you see his lip?

994
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,475
He uses your
makeup to cover it.

995
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,912
Shut up, Mel.

996
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,915
Oh, Miles, we're going to
the principal.

997
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,917
I'm... I'm not ratting.

998
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,219
It's not ratting when
somebody beats you up.

999
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,955
One punch isn't
getting beat up.

1000
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,489
Why didn't you tell me?

1001
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:00,491
They called me
a stuttering four-eyes

1002
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,260
And that isn't
gonna change.

1003
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,795
We'll talk about this
on the way.

1004
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,230
Come on.
No.

1005
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,399
Miles, get in
the car now!

1006
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,501
We-we're not
going anywhere.

1007
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,070
Why is that?

1008
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:20,979
Oh, no.

1009
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,513
Mama, what is it?

1010
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,150
(Groaning)

1011
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,885
Oil pan, looks like.

1012
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,486
Is that expensive?

1013
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,088
Could be
a couple hundred.

1014
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,157
Dollars?

1015
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,860
I don't have
a couple hundred dollars.

1016
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,294
I could have it towed.

1017
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,562
Where?

1018
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:39,530
I can't
afford that either.

1019
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:42,133
Well, you can't
leave it here.

1020
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,135
There's something else
that we should talk about.

1021
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:45,270
What?

1022
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,571
I got a call
from the state today.

1023
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,606
There's a construction crew
coming in.

1024
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,242
I'm gonna
need all my rooms.

1025
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:52,844
All of them?

1026
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:55,847
Yeah, the state pays full rate
a month in advance.

1027
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:58,383
I can't pass that up.

1028
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,218
Sorry.

1029
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,888
You're kicking us out
the day after Christmas?

1030
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,389
Ehh...

1031
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:06,958
Relocating.

1032
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,259
Get the car moved.

1033
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,042
(Tires screeching)

1034
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,855
(Sighing)

1035
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,639
(Bells jingling)

1036
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:55,673
Watch stop?

1037
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,276
I'm sorry,
I had car trouble.

1038
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,978
Here you go.

1039
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,479
Thanks.

1040
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:05,683
Oh.

1041
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,452
I know, I'm sorry,
but I gotta pay taxes.

1042
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,187
What can you do?

1043
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,388
Thank you, I'm grateful.

1044
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,223
I do want you to
stay after your shift today

1045
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:13,424
And help Lola.

1046
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,993
We're gonna do a deep clean
of the kitchen,

1047
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,461
Countertops, everything.

1048
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,963
Sure.

1049
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,264
But it's overtime.

1050
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,132
Oh, great, okay.

1051
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,567
(Lola)
Did she tell you?

1052
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,103
Yeah.

1053
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:26,171
Ooh, you look a little rough

1054
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:27,705
And we haven't
even started yet.

1055
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,007
Car trouble.

1056
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,608
Tried to overhaul it
yourself?

1057
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,143
I wish.

1058
00:48:32,177 --> 00:48:34,445
Ready for
the annual cleanup?

1059
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:35,947
I guess.

1060
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:36,514
Order's up.

1061
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,316
Les' hamburger.

1062
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,151
He really likes his burger,
doesn't he?

1063
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:41,686
He is a hamburger.

1064
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,088
Like meat loaf.

1065
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:44,990
With hair.
Ew.

1066
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,558
That's pretty nasty.
Uh-huh.

1067
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,932
There you go.

1068
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,338
Is it cooked okay?

1069
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,607
That's not medium-well.

1070
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,708
Well, I can
take it back.

1071
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,376
No...

1072
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,315
So how you liking it
around here?

1073
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,083
Um...

1074
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,051
Fine.

1075
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,152
Oh.

1076
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,087
Is that all?

1077
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,023
Well, I haven't had
time to explore.

1078
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,557
Kids liking it?

1079
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,127
Well, my daughter does,

1080
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,762
But my... my boy,
he's having some trouble.

1081
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,597
Pushing him around
a little?

1082
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,069
Yeah, something like that.

1083
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,104
How come?

1084
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:36,507
Well, he's a little small
for his age

1085
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,476
And he wears
glasses and...

1086
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:41,012
Stutters, huh?

1087
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,780
Yeah, how did you know?

1088
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,650
Probably that Park kid.

1089
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,186
My grandson had
the same problem.

1090
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:51,289
But I straightened him out.

1091
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,325
Bring your boy around
here sometime.

1092
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,526
I'll help him.

1093
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,630
Well, I don't
want him fighting.

1094
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,133
Oh, he won't be.

1095
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:04,635
I think I saw
your car parked up

1096
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,805
The interstate turnoff there.

1097
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,508
Um, are you
sure it was mine?

1098
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:15,113
Well, there are not too many
old blue caddies around here.

1099
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,748
I had some car trouble.

1100
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:19,750
You ought to move it.

1101
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:22,053
I... I can't right now.

1102
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,688
I can't afford to.

1103
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,789
Ahh.

1104
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:27,625
Well, that's your choice.

1105
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:30,695
Get back to my...
burger.

1106
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,412
Hey, guys, that's looking
pretty good.

1107
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,380
It's from your story.

1108
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,085
No.

1109
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,087
This one's better
than my tree.

1110
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:57,622
How do you know?

1111
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,158
Because it was my story.

1112
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,792
What happened
to your eye?

1113
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,528
I ran into something.

1114
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,132
Yeah, Danny Park's fist.

1115
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,399
Is he bothering you?

1116
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,302
No, but I seem
to be bothering him.

1117
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:12,803
You should
tell your mom.

1118
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,539
At least someone cares.

1119
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:17,608
What are you drawing?

1120
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,210
The couch.

1121
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,419
(Bells jingling)

1122
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:30,121
Oh, hi.

1123
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,727
What can I get you?

1124
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,896
Does Lola have
any of that chili?

1125
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,231
I'll see.

1126
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:42,867
(Lola)
Have it up in a jiffy!

1127
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,303
She is better than
my dashboard radar.

1128
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,804
And louder.

1129
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,175
You know, when I was a kid,

1130
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,243
The Root Beer was
the place to hang out.

1131
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:53,411
Yeah, Friday, Saturday night,

1132
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,679
You couldn't even find
a parking spot.

1133
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:55,580
Really?
Yeah.

1134
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,781
Really great carhop stand.

1135
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,250
Oh, I always
wanted to do that.

1136
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,552
Carhops?
Yeah.

1137
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:03,488
I'm too old now, though.

1138
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,490
Not from where
I'm sitting.

1139
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,496
It was...
It was a magical place.

1140
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,364
Yeah, how so?

1141
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:16,501
Well, if... if you needed
help in something

1142
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,504
Or you wanted to meet
that special somebody,

1143
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,872
You just came to The Root Beer

1144
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:24,542
And made a wish
and it would come true.

1145
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:25,710
Oh.

1146
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,712
Mel would
love that story.

1147
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:30,581
Mel?
My daughter.

1148
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,884
Mary Ellen,
short for Mary Ellen.

1149
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:37,688
But she loves stories with
magical stuff in it.

1150
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:42,260
Um, so did you
ever make a wish?

1151
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,262
Yeah, yeah, once.

1152
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,797
Well, and...

1153
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:49,567
She didn't work out.

1154
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,935
Oh.

1155
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,340
Well, being
single's not so bad.

1156
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,775
I'm not single,
I'm romantically challenged.

1157
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,310
That's funny.

1158
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:00,911
(Laughing)

1159
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,580
You have a great laugh.

1160
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,582
Thank you.

1161
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:07,518
Just my laugh?

1162
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:09,754
The rest isn't bad either.

1163
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,956
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean...
No, no, no, no.

1164
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,625
I mean, we both have
baggage, right?

1165
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,427
Yeah, I guess so.

1166
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,430
Here you go,
tall, dark and available.

1167
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:21,399
(Chuckling)

1168
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:22,900
Thank you, Lola.

1169
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,740
Oh, are you okay?

1170
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:31,242
It's hot.

1171
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:32,510
Oh, I'm sorry,
have some of that.

1172
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,645
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.

1173
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,448
It's good, it's...
It's good.

1174
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,820
Hey, do you wanna go see
a movie sometime

1175
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,356
Or get some dinner?

1176
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,692
With you?

1177
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:51,696
Yeah, yeah,
that's the general idea.

1178
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,731
I don't... no, that was...
That was dumb.

1179
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,566
I don't know
why I was...

1180
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,702
Yeah, no, thank you.

1181
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,537
Have a good night.

1182
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,409
Oh, Martha.

1183
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:05,976
Oh, you are so stupid.

1184
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,314
"With you?"

1185
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:11,516
Oh, you're so stupid.

1186
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:12,917
Uh-huh.

1187
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,819
I don't need your help.

1188
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,587
He's a stud!

1189
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,955
I couldn't!

1190
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,924
I thought you said he
ran off with a beautician!

1191
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,793
He did,
but I'm not divorced.

1192
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,462
Uh, no, you're divorced,

1193
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,597
You just haven't
gone to court yet.

1194
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,867
Which means
I'm still married.

1195
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,569
Do you know why most women

1196
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,338
Would rather have
beauty than brains?

1197
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,739
Why?

1198
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,342
Because most men can see
better than they can think.

1199
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,910
But Joe Hopkins is
the whole package.

1200
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:42,447
Wall-to-wall handsome,
soft-spoken...

1201
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,651
Very important...
Honest to a fault and single!

1202
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:49,053
And you said no.

1203
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:50,755
'Cause I made a vow,
Lola.

1204
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,490
So did he.

1205
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:55,493
Well, I'm keeping mine.

1206
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,861
Besides, I know
what people think.

1207
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,363
Oh, don't worry about
what people think.

1208
00:54:58,396 --> 00:54:59,964
They don't do it very often.

1209
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,803
Hey, how come
he never got married?

1210
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,973
Almost did, she left him
the day before the wedding.

1211
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,742
That's awful.

1212
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:14,044
I don't think he's ever
really gotten over it.

1213
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,513
I can imagine.

1214
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,015
He's never forgiven women
or himself since.

1215
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,085
In fact,
you are the first person

1216
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,888
I've seen him even take
an interest in.

1217
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,391
The destitute
mother of three?

1218
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:27,525
Yeah, go figure.

1219
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,626
Hmm.

1220
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,133
(Mel)
Mom, we're ready.

1221
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,135
Okay, good, I've got
your lunch right here.

1222
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,770
That one's for you,
that's for you.

1223
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:15,806
Wait, what is this?

1224
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,174
I didn't say nothing.

1225
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,809
Don't make a big deal.

1226
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,812
Oh, my gosh, how can
I not make a big deal?

1227
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,882
I'll handle this.

1228
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,651
Please.

1229
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,674
I have a possible 10-87.

1230
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:10,728
I'm gonna need a tow
on the corner of State Street

1231
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,096
And Mapleton Boulevard.

1232
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,869
Hey, Miles.

1233
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,138
What are you
doing home so early?

1234
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,140
I didn't... I didn't
think it would matter

1235
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,876
This close to Christmas.

1236
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,881
Whoa, hey,
that's pretty good.

1237
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,249
It's not as bad as I thought
it'd be.

1238
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,984
Yeah, I know.

1239
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,054
You wanna help her?

1240
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:38,989
Finish the tree?

1241
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:40,791
It'll be our surprise.

1242
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,564
Needs something
for the flowers.

1243
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:48,799
You know what?

1244
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,601
I think I have
the right thing.

1245
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,773
How about that?

1246
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:58,909
Cool.

1247
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,815
Very cool.

1248
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,216
Yeah.

1249
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,018
It does feel you...
Make you feel like Christmas,

1250
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:10,187
Doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.

1251
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,090
It's beautiful!

1252
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,559
You helped?

1253
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,862
I did the crib
and the baby stuff.

1254
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:19,129
Really?
Yeah.

1255
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,265
Lilee was my model.

1256
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,635
This will be the best
Christmas ever.

1257
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:26,070
(Jeanie)
Knock-knock.

1258
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,272
Hey, my mom sent me.

1259
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:29,740
Lola's sick and can't
make it in

1260
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:32,810
And Trudy's visiting
her sister in Blanding.

1261
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,044
Okay.

1262
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:37,047
Um, well, could you
watch Mel and Lilee?

1263
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:38,048
Miles can help.

1264
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:39,216
I can?

1265
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,018
Well, can't you?
Sure.

1266
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,820
Yeah, okay, come on.

1267
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,923
Look what he did.

1268
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,628
Okay.

1269
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,096
All right, come with me.

1270
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:00,337
Who started the coffee?

1271
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,840
I needed
something to drink.

1272
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,041
Oh, thanks, Les.

1273
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,943
Listen,
we need a cook.

1274
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,845
Do you know anyone?

1275
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,246
I might.

1276
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,881
As long
as it's hamburgers.

1277
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:12,917
So you like
hamburgers, huh?

1278
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,685
You got a problem
with that?

1279
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,286
No.

1280
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,655
Is this the one?

1281
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,789
The one what?

1282
00:59:18,823 --> 00:59:20,090
Uh, never mind.

1283
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:23,794
Les, the grill, please?

1284
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:25,195
Thank you.

1285
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,065
Okay, give me your coat.

1286
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,968
All right, I want you to meet
'em and greet 'em,

1287
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,003
Smile and say,
"Thanks for coming."

1288
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,271
Okay, where?

1289
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:35,940
Just wherever it's empty.
Okay.

1290
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:37,708
Thanks, buddy.

1291
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:38,976
How're you guys
doing tonight?

1292
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,718
(Laughing)

1293
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,386
You want me to
come over there and flip your

1294
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,658
Flapjacks for you, Frank,
huh, huh?

1295
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:58,729
Les, I got eggs over easy,
chili dog and hash browns.

1296
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:01,065
Hamburger,
eggs, hash brown.

1297
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,233
No, no, no, I said eggs
and chili dogs.

1298
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,002
I don't do chili dogs.

1299
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:07,037
I do hamburgers.

1300
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,839
Just because
you like hamburger

1301
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:11,008
Doesn't mean everybody
likes it.

1302
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,910
They do tonight!

1303
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,344
Don't they?!

1304
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,684
Would you like me to put it
on the specials board?

1305
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,852
Well, if you want.

1306
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:23,721
People want their food.

1307
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,656
Boy, they can have it good

1308
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,992
Or they can have it fast,
not both!

1309
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,730
His bark's
worse than his bite.

1310
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,799
I'll take your
word for it.

1311
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:36,000
Let's go.

1312
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:41,205
(Sizzling)

1313
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,819
I want a steak.

1314
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,186
Thick and rare.

1315
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,389
Well, the cook said to tell
you that this was better,

1316
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,126
So I wouldn't complain
if I were you.

1317
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,360
But this ain't a steak.

1318
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,996
Jim, not so loud,
everyone will hear you.

1319
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,164
I don't care.

1320
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,099
What about steak
don't Lola understand?

1321
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,101
Well, it's not Lola.

1322
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,837
Really?
You got a problem?

1323
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,840
I ordered a steak.

1324
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,141
Well, that's what you got,
hammerhead.

1325
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,475
That's hamburger steak.

1326
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,310
That's the best
grub on the planet.

1327
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,346
It is?
If I say it is!

1328
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:30,454
I, um...
tried to warn you.

1329
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,723
Not hard enough.

1330
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,894
No way.

1331
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,262
I ain't eating that.

1332
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,832
Who don't like
their food?!

1333
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,909
What's good?

1334
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,410
Hamburger.

1335
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,212
Then I will have the pie.

1336
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,982
Well, I really recommend
the ground round.

1337
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,751
Pie is fine.

1338
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:02,152
I call it
shepherd's pie.

1339
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,290
Nice apron.

1340
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,793
Brings out the color
of my eyes, don't you think?

1341
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,494
You don't want to
know what I think.

1342
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:11,996
Keep it that way.

1343
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,268
What gives?

1344
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:21,839
Well, Lola's sick
so I had to improvise.

1345
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,540
So you brought in
Stalin as the chef.

1346
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,142
Nice.

1347
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,811
Well, we're selling
a lot of hamburger.

1348
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:29,346
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

1349
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:33,951
Um, listen, I want to...

1350
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:35,485
Apologize
for the other night.

1351
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,387
No, you don't...
You don't need to.

1352
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,356
Well, I feel like there's
something I need to explain.

1353
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:43,093
You don't have to
owe me anything.

1354
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:46,130
Technically,
I'm still married, so...

1355
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,134
Oh.

1356
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:54,238
I thought... I thought
when you said that...

1357
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,073
I guess it doesn't...
It doesn't really matter

1358
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,276
What I thought, does it?

1359
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,445
No, it does, just...

1360
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,180
There's something
you don't understand.

1361
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,115
You don't need to
explain anything.

1362
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:06,550
I promise.

1363
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,162
Any more orders?

1364
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,130
I'll ask Martha.

1365
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1366
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,167
You call your
mom Martha?

1367
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,468
She's not my mom!

1368
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:26,470
She looks after you,
don't she?

1369
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,005
Yeah.

1370
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,473
Well, then she's your mom,
treat her accordingly.

1371
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,209
Why do you care?
I don't.

1372
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,278
At least about
a spoiled kid like you.

1373
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,280
I'm not spoiled.
Oh, yes, you are.

1374
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,282
That's why those
punks pick on you.

1375
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,617
You-you don't know
not-nothing about me!

1376
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,320
I know that you have
a hard time talking

1377
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,889
And you wear glasses

1378
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,190
So you think
you have a tough time.

1379
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,424
Well, you don't.

1380
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,926
How do you know?

1381
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,194
'Cause I was
your age once.

1382
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:54,231
Yeah, wh-when there
were dinosaurs.

1383
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:57,001
You wanna know
a simple way to stop 'em?

1384
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:01,171
I'll take that
as a yes.

1385
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,940
Come here.

1386
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,411
Now, I once knew a man,

1387
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,980
Little fella,
worked in a bank,

1388
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:11,548
And he got into some
kind of trouble

1389
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,617
And they sent him to jail.

1390
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,919
Well, the minute
he got there,

1391
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,520
It was just awful,

1392
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:19,489
'Cause the worst bully
in the joint

1393
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,525
Harassed this guy

1394
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:24,962
And he stole his food,
he opened his mail.

1395
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,997
He never gave
that little guy a break.

1396
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,598
What did he do?

1397
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,434
He went crazy.

1398
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,069
What do you mean?

1399
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:35,539
Well, that little
fella got one of the guards

1400
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:39,109
To warn the bully and his
buddies all about him.

1401
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:43,313
He said that little banker
was a... a psycho.

1402
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:46,183
He said he... he did
terrible things to people.

1403
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,252
That's why he was in jail.

1404
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:49,386
He said that
little banker's

1405
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:52,022
The most dangerous man
he ever saw.

1406
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:54,458
He said if anybody
pushes him over the edge,

1407
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:56,160
He's gonna pay for it
big time.

1408
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:01,531
It was...
It was just a story?

1409
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,067
Yep.

1410
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,636
Because, most of the time,
what people seem like

1411
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,673
Is a lot more important
than what they are like.

1412
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,308
You understand?

1413
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,576
Maybe.

1414
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,945
That little man put
a piece of Alka-Seltzer

1415
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,146
Under his tongue,

1416
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:20,084
Foamed up like
he was foaming like a dog.

1417
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,952
And if a bully thinks that

1418
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,520
He's got a real
fight on his hands,

1419
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:27,557
Well, he's not gonna want it
to continue.

1420
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,960
No, the biggest troublemaker

1421
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:32,396
You're ever gonna have to deal
with in life

1422
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:38,068
Is watching you from
that mirror every morning.

1423
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,237
Do you understand?

1424
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,505
Yeah.

1425
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:42,672
Good boy.

1426
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,589
Hey, Miles?

1427
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,091
You need to get some sleep.

1428
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,327
We're not gonna have
any more customers tonight.

1429
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,229
Okay.

1430
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:15,672
What's all this for?

1431
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,374
It's for
making root beer.

1432
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:23,080
What's th-this for?

1433
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,182
Looks like a recipe.

1434
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:28,652
Maybe w-we could
try it sometime.

1435
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,720
Listen,
you need to get to bed.

1436
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:32,422
You can sleep on the couch,
okay?
Okay.

1437
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,791
And I want to say thank you,
you were great today.

1438
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,260
Sure.

1439
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,196
All right.

1440
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,672
Any more?

1441
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,240
Oh, I think we're done.

1442
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,744
What's that boy of yours
want for Christmas?

1443
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,780
He hasn't said much.

1444
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:59,449
I didn't ask that.

1445
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,819
I don't know, he probably
wants some homemade root beer.

1446
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,021
He's a man
after my own heart.

1447
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:09,793
Oh, Les, I...
I couldn't, no.

1448
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:11,061
Is your arm broke?

1449
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:12,796
Those kids
deserve a Christmas.

1450
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,333
Les, I can't.

1451
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,801
No, no.

1452
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:21,305
You are the most arduous woman
I've ever met in my life.

1453
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,739
Les, really...

1454
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:30,314
Thank you.

1455
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:31,748
Now go home.

1456
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,118
Go on,
I'll clean up.

1457
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:39,556
Oh, Trudy has a little
get-together Christmas Eve.

1458
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,258
Shuts down early.

1459
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,059
Bring the kids.

1460
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,230
Thanks, I will.

1461
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,503
Oh, thanks.

1462
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,243
We did good.

1463
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,279
(Chuckling)

1464
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,783
(Bells jingling)

1465
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,363
(Joe)
Hey.

1466
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,231
Thought you
might want a ride.

1467
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:22,799
You were waiting for us?

1468
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,207
I had to
impound your car.

1469
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,741
Oh.

1470
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,778
Why didn't you tell me?

1471
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:36,880
Would it have made
a difference?

1472
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,483
I might have been able to
save you a $200 impound fee.

1473
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:44,321
Thanks for towing me.

1474
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:46,856
You want a ride?

1475
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,193
No, walking's
good for the soul.

1476
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:52,696
Ri-riding's good, too.

1477
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,130
Hop in.

1478
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:15,952
Just need to
fill in behind it.

1479
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,754
With what?

1480
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,689
You know,
Christmas stuff.

1481
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:21,225
We're gonna be late.

1482
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:22,326
Oh, hey,
it's a half-day.

1483
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:23,527
I told you you could
miss if you wanted.

1484
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,529
I changed my mind.
Oh.

1485
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:26,896
We can finish it tonight.

1486
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,698
Okay.

1487
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,567
Well, bye.
Bye.

1488
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,936
Love you, bye.
Bye.

1489
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,510
Miss Lilee, what are we
gonna do today?

1490
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,424
D-did you pick up
what I told you?

1491
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,560
Sure did.
Okay.

1492
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:58,362
Let's do this.
Okay.

1493
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:06,370
(Knocking)

1494
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,938
Hi, I wasn't
expecting you.

1495
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:11,408
Need to talk to you.

1496
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,310
She wants
more money for the house.

1497
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:16,646
No, but she has decided she
doesn't want to rent it now,

1498
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,583
But I'll keep looking.

1499
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,552
It's probably just
a waste of your time.

1500
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:25,789
No, helping folks
is never a waste of time.

1501
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,797
Danny, you'd better not
bother him today.

1502
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,599
Is wimp boy afraid?

1503
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:37,301
No, psycho.

1504
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:38,602
Huh?

1505
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,604
I tried to talk to him
but he wouldn't listen.

1506
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,473
I'll make him listen.
No, you don't understand.

1507
01:10:43,507 --> 01:10:45,575
He's dangerous.

1508
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:47,010
Real dangerous.

1509
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:50,447
I'm afraid he'll
hurt someone... again.

1510
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,581
Again?

1511
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,583
Last time this happened,
we had to move.

1512
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:54,951
Do you think
we like it here?

1513
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,687
We have to be here.

1514
01:10:57,721 --> 01:10:59,823
What... what
do you mean?

1515
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:15,939
Too late.

1516
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:17,441
I tried to warn you.

1517
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,751
(Growling)

1518
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,694
(Growling)

1519
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,672
Yes!

1520
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,010
Holy crap!

1521
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,612
I can't believe
that worked!

1522
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,581
God helped
you do that, you know.

1523
01:11:57,614 --> 01:11:58,848
Where has he been before?

1524
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,117
Probably waiting for you
to make the first move.

1525
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,119
Now come on.

1526
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,721
Oh.

1527
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:05,822
(Knocking)

1528
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,058
Mr. Bullington.

1529
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,960
May I come in?

1530
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,497
I'll come out,
the baby's sleeping.

1531
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,833
Something's come up.

1532
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:19,736
The state workers,
they're coming in tomorrow

1533
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:23,106
And I need your room.

1534
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,542
It's Christmas Eve.

1535
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,811
I already took an advance.

1536
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,946
Where are we gonna go?

1537
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,148
You might try over
at the Sleepy Inn,

1538
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,617
Over at the Mayfield.

1539
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,952
I don't have a car.

1540
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,754
I got no choice.

1541
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,656
I'm sorry.

1542
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,905
Is that what
you want, Joe?

1543
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,641
What you really want?

1544
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:01,711
I think it's what
you should want, too.

1545
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:06,850
Let's go to my place.

1546
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:12,822
I still have a few things we
need to consider, okay?

1547
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:14,424
Yeah.

1548
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,759
Yeah, okay.

1549
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,445
It is beautiful.

1550
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:41,451
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

1551
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:44,554
Actually, this is
our last night here.

1552
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:45,489
(Miles)
What?

1553
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,691
Where are we
going to go?

1554
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,493
I haven't figured
that out yet.

1555
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,960
I was hoping that
we could get that house

1556
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:54,097
That Mr. Meyer
told us about.

1557
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,666
But we can't?

1558
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:00,103
It's okay.

1559
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:07,143
I don't even have Christmas
presents for you guys.

1560
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,012
What about these?

1561
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,014
That's not much.

1562
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:13,483
We weren't
expecting anything.

1563
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,685
Oh, honey,
that's so sweet.

1564
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:23,660
We're gonna have to
paint over the tree.

1565
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,128
Why?

1566
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:28,231
Because it wouldn't be right
to leave it here like this.

1567
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:32,869
But h-he's the one
making us get out.

1568
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:35,605
Whether Mr. Bullington is right
or wrong, it doesn't matter.

1569
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,907
It's what we do,
that's what's important.

1570
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:43,079
Mel... it's your tree.

1571
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:48,117
We'll paint over it
when you get home.

1572
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,691
The cafe closes
early tonight.

1573
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:55,859
Do you guys
wanna come with me?

1574
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:57,561
Yeah!
Yeah.

1575
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,602
(Bells jingling)

1576
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,109
Okay guys,
come sit over here.

1577
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:17,947
Santa Claus.
Yeah.

1578
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:19,248
Here, Lilee.

1579
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:21,017
I got you some
coloring.

1580
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,752
Thank you.
Here you go.

1581
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:24,621
Pink.

1582
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,258
You okay?
I'm fine.

1583
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:31,060
You don't look fine.

1584
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,630
I'm just trying to
iron out some of the bugs.

1585
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,565
Ah... got it.

1586
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:39,769
Mmm, I love this place.

1587
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,805
Yeah, it does kind of
grow on you, doesn't it?

1588
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:43,072
I'm saving up
to buy it.

1589
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:44,240
Seriously?

1590
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,809
I'm still
a couple of grand short.

1591
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,844
Oh, well,
you'll find it.
I doubt that.

1592
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,580
I can't find my head
with both hands.

1593
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:51,915
You have family here?

1594
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,117
Not here, mm-mm.

1595
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,885
So you're spending
Christmas alone?

1596
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:58,254
Not alone.

1597
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,856
What does that mean?

1598
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,826
Well, that just means that
her and Frank are an item.

1599
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,060
Rasmuss...

1600
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:07,063
Rasmussen, and, yes,
he has hidden qualities.

1601
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,766
Oh, he has very
hidden qualities.

1602
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,101
(Laughing)

1603
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:13,703
How are you?

1604
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:15,004
Um, I'm fine.

1605
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:16,740
There's something
she's not telling us.

1606
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:18,341
What?

1607
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:20,710
Nothing, it's just
that Miller lady,

1608
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,679
She's not gonna
rent us the house.

1609
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,814
Why am I not
surprised?

1610
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:27,050
You're not?
She was here.

1611
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,384
She was?
Yeah.

1612
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,386
And she was
with somebody.
Who?

1613
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,387
Joe.

1614
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,222
Ugh!

1615
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,959
That poor boy can't think for
himself when she's around.

1616
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:37,126
Joe knows her?

1617
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,062
Oh, she's
a horse's patoot.

1618
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,397
They were engaged and she
broke it off.

1619
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,366
She's the one that
left him at the altar?

1620
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,269
Every silicone square inch.

1621
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:48,738
And now they're...
Looks like it.

1622
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,874
Oh.

1623
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,308
Well, maybe
they'll work it out.

1624
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,910
I doubt that.

1625
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,145
He's normal and she's
a South American Looney Tune.

1626
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:57,981
(Laughing)

1627
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:01,985
Well, I do have to say,

1628
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,020
This has been more like
old times around here

1629
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,956
Than in a very long time.

1630
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:09,058
I think you have a lot to
do with that, Martha.

1631
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:10,093
Me?

1632
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,695
Oh, I don't think so.

1633
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:14,030
No, she's right,
you have made a difference.

1634
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:15,431
I've been here,
what, ten days?

1635
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,234
Well, sometimes
that's all it takes.

1636
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:22,772
Well, ladies,
these are bonus checks.

1637
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,909
It's not much, but it's
all I could afford.

1638
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:34,217
I don't know
how to tell you this,

1639
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,252
But I can't make a go
of this place.

1640
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:37,987
I'm gonna close it down.

1641
01:17:56,973 --> 01:17:58,341
(Coughing)

1642
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,909
Um, Mama?

1643
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:05,248
Hi.

1644
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:06,482
What's going on?

1645
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,286
Well, it isn't much,
but everybody pitched in.

1646
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:12,121
Merry Christmas.

1647
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:14,090
Thank you.

1648
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,458
Merry Christmas!

1649
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:19,228
I...

1650
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,329
I don't know
what to say.

1651
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,731
Well, don't say nothing.

1652
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:23,466
I brought
the boy something.

1653
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:27,837
Thought you might like these,
just like Sam used to make.

1654
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:30,439
You made it for me?

1655
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:31,775
Mmm...

1656
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:32,842
(Martha)
Say thank you!

1657
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,310
He... he...
The boy can talk.

1658
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,045
Thanks.

1659
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,981
I'll teach you
how to make it.
Yeah!

1660
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:39,215
Thank you, Les.

1661
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,283
Thank you, thank you!

1662
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:42,451
Cut that out,
cut that out.

1663
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:45,254
Don't get sloppy on me.

1664
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:46,990
(Woman)
Merry Christmas, Martha.

1665
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:48,324
We love you.

1666
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,362
Sounds like old times,
doesn't it, Sam?

1667
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,936
Merry Christmas, darling.

1668
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:01,237
Merry Christmas.

1669
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,941
And remember,
everybody is welcome

1670
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:07,944
At the church annual Christmas
breakfast in the morning.

1671
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:10,046
We are so glad that
you came to this town!

1672
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,447
(Bells jingling)

1673
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,385
This is incredible.

1674
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,454
(Man)
Well!

1675
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,489
Well now,
isn't this nice?

1676
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,330
What you think, Bob?

1677
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,532
Yeah, real nice.

1678
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:30,800
Yeah.

1679
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:33,402
Stand back.

1680
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:38,141
What are you doing here?

1681
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:41,210
Well now, I didn't want to
miss the little gathering,

1682
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:42,145
Or my boy.

1683
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:43,512
Right there, Miles?

1684
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:47,383
I told everybody...
you would come back.

1685
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:52,121
You, you are a hard one
to track down, baby.

1686
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,557
Still look good,
though.

1687
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,225
You're not.

1688
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:57,961
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable,

1689
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:59,162
Like unconsciousness?

1690
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:04,267
Hey now, baby,
no reason to get angry.

1691
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,837
I was expecting you to still
be at our place.

1692
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:10,206
How come you left, huh?

1693
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,009
I'm not the one who left.

1694
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:14,377
Well, it don't matter none,

1695
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,079
'Cause I just came here to
get you some stuff.

1696
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,047
Bob.

1697
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:19,482
Here you go.

1698
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:30,526
Is that all?

1699
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:33,329
Then you'll go?

1700
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,563
Yeah.

1701
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:35,899
Yeah, all of us.

1702
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,633
Here you go.

1703
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,068
How did you...

1704
01:20:39,102 --> 01:20:40,569
I stopped by
the hotel, buddy.

1705
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:41,971
Picked up your stuff.

1706
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,240
You broke in?

1707
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:47,476
Well, the door
was open, sort of.

1708
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,413
Hotel manager's right
obliging, though.

1709
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:53,549
Ten bucks
didn't hurt, neither.

1710
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,384
Let's go, buddy,
come on.

1711
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:57,921
Don't go, Miles.

1712
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:58,922
I'm sorry.

1713
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:01,590
But we're a family!

1714
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:06,429
Cal, don't do this.

1715
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,498
He needs
a stable home.

1716
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,401
What are you saying,
I ain't a good daddy?

1717
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:14,103
I'm still your daddy,
right, buddy?

1718
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:17,606
I... I told everybody that
you... you would come back.

1719
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,542
Let me do
the talking, buddy.

1720
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:21,210
Let's go.

1721
01:21:23,146 --> 01:21:25,314
Send it to the address
on the paper.

1722
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,450
Let's go, Bob.

1723
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:28,985
(Bob)
Merry Christmas.

1724
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,623
I'm so sorry.

1725
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:36,993
Is there anything
I can do?

1726
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:37,961
Don't worry, honey.

1727
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:39,528
I'll... I'll
take the girls.

1728
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,330
Come here, sweetie.

1729
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:44,000
Come on, Aunt Carol's gonna
take you for a walk.

1730
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:45,134
(Martha)
Thank you.

1731
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,036
Come on, come on.

1732
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,105
What about you, Mama?

1733
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,342
Just go with them,
okay?

1734
01:21:58,181 --> 01:21:59,348
I need to be alone.

1735
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:01,517
Bye, Mama.

1736
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,186
Come on, honey.

1737
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:17,967
(Martha)
You really need
to be more cautious

1738
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:19,068
With your little sister.

1739
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:20,469
She's not my sister!

1740
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:22,205
Half-sister, then.

1741
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,074
If we would have stayed home
and w-w-waited...

1742
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:27,376
And waited for Dad,
this would not have happened!

1743
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,248
Why didn't you tell me?

1744
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,749
Don't make a big deal.

1745
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,685
Oh, my gosh, how could
I not make a big deal?

1746
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,056
I'll handle this.

1747
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,357
Please.

1748
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:46,029
(Miles)
She's not my mom.

1749
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:47,296
She is now.

1750
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:50,033
No, she just married my dad,
that's all.

1751
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,304
You wanna help her?

1752
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:57,340
Finish the tree?

1753
01:22:57,373 --> 01:22:59,075
It'll be our surprise.

1754
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:00,376
We did good.

1755
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:08,451
(Mel)
No, he doesn't
work like that.

1756
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,386
God kinda makes you
worry a while

1757
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,355
Until you get something,

1758
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:15,791
Then later, you believe
in Him.

1759
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,261
Only you gotta pray, though.

1760
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,629
(Martha)
I don't think I'm very good
at that, either.

1761
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,298
That's the easy part.

1762
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,632
You don't have to be.

1763
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,268
You just
have to do it.

1764
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:32,641
(Crying)

1765
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:42,251
God...

1766
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,624
I know I haven't
prayed before.

1767
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:57,266
There isn't
anything else I can do.

1768
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,535
I've done everything I can.

1769
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:03,339
I can't lose Miles
and I'm out of options.

1770
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:23,426
I never asked
for any handouts...

1771
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:26,095
And I never broke down.

1772
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:32,835
I did everything
that I thought was right.

1773
01:24:38,341 --> 01:24:40,176
I don't care about me.

1774
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:43,546
I care about Miles.

1775
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:45,381
I love him so much.

1776
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:49,552
And he doesn't
deserve any of this.

1777
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,155
None of this is his fault.

1778
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,123
I...

1779
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:02,131
If you're gonna punish
somebody, punish me.

1780
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:14,810
Just... please
don't let him go with Cal.

1781
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,384
I'm begging you.

1782
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,220
God, if you're up there,
please...

1783
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:30,125
Please help me.

1784
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,713
* Mary's child

1785
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:54,483
* To us he
has been sent *

1786
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,555
* Mary's child

1787
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:04,827
* His heart and soul
are spent *

1788
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:08,797
* Child of glory

1789
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:13,269
* Around
Him angels sing *

1790
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:17,840
* Mary's child

1791
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:21,910
* God's greatest
gift he brings *

1792
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:27,416
* Mary's child

1793
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:32,655
* God's greatest gift

1794
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:36,325
* He brings

1795
01:26:55,678 --> 01:26:59,782
The... the door
was locked.

1796
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:02,318
Did you forget
something?

1797
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:03,252
Yeah.

1798
01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:05,688
Okay, um...

1799
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,555
What is it?

1800
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:08,591
I'll get it for you.
You.

1801
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,631
What?

1802
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:21,470
We were h-heading back
and...

1803
01:27:23,472 --> 01:27:26,642
And he
told me not to do that.

1804
01:27:26,675 --> 01:27:28,544
Do what?

1805
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,446
This.

1806
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:38,387
H-he called me
a stuttering f-four-eyes.

1807
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:40,656
Oh, Miles.

1808
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:45,027
He said I always could be
one if I didn't quit.

1809
01:27:46,862 --> 01:27:49,365
Miles, I am so sorry.

1810
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,037
And then
I f-figured it out.

1811
01:27:56,839 --> 01:28:00,743
He was the one that made me
feel like nothing.

1812
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:03,379
He called me
that... always has.

1813
01:28:05,414 --> 01:28:09,652
And then... and then I
remembered something you said.

1814
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,554
What's that?

1815
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:13,356
To stand up for myself

1816
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:17,560
And be proud
of who I am

1817
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:21,397
And others would be.

1818
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:26,435
I told him t-t-to t-t-take me
back to th-the cafe.

1819
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:30,539
But you weren't there.

1820
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:32,741
How did you get here?

1821
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:34,443
He brought me.

1822
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:35,644
Cal?

1823
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,312
No, him.

1824
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:50,993
Thank you.

1825
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:53,562
I wanted to
show you something.

1826
01:28:53,596 --> 01:28:57,433
I came by the cafe,
I found Miles instead.

1827
01:28:57,466 --> 01:28:58,634
He filled me in.

1828
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,404
Sort of.

1829
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:05,107
What is it?

1830
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,743
Why don't
you come see?

1831
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:08,777
We should hurry, though.

1832
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:10,679
It's supposed to snow.

1833
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:50,185
That.

1834
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,120
What's all this?

1835
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:53,589
It's for you.

1836
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:54,857
Come on.

1837
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:03,766
Hi!

1838
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:06,969
Hi!
Hi!

1839
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:11,807
Everybody pitched in.

1840
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,008
Pitched in?

1841
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,743
Yeah, this is
Clarice Miller's house.

1842
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:18,914
Joe talked her into
renting it to you.

1843
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:21,717
The Pastor and the congregation
did most of it.

1844
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:24,219
That ain't all!

1845
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,054
Frank...

1846
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:28,156
It wasn't as bad
as it first looked.

1847
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,826
What wasn't?

1848
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:33,962
Jack?

1849
01:30:33,996 --> 01:30:35,664
It's all fixed.

1850
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:39,034
And Leroy, over to the garage,
he found out another thing.

1851
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:42,838
What, that Jack's
a worthless piece of junk?

1852
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,040
Nope.

1853
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:48,577
It's a special model,
only 600 of 'em ever made.

1854
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:52,014
Car's worth maybe 5,000.

1855
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:54,983
$5,000?

1856
01:30:55,017 --> 01:30:57,686
Jack's worth $5,000?

1857
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,556
Oh, my gosh!

1858
01:31:00,589 --> 01:31:01,957
There's one other thing.

1859
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:06,562
It looks like
The Root Beer Drive-In

1860
01:31:06,595 --> 01:31:07,963
Is gonna open again.

1861
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:09,231
Who's doing that?

1862
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:10,866
Me and Frank are buying it,

1863
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:12,568
But we're really
gonna need some help.

1864
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,069
Are you interested?

1865
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:16,204
Are you kidding me?

1866
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:18,273
(Carol)
And something else.

1867
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,275
Go on, tell her.

1868
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,211
Sorry about earlier,
you know, kicking you out

1869
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:26,081
And that mix-up
with that fella

1870
01:31:26,114 --> 01:31:28,784
That said
he was your husband.

1871
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,218
And the rest of it.

1872
01:31:30,252 --> 01:31:35,090
Well, I was talking to
the foreman from the state

1873
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:38,827
And I told 'em what you
were up against.

1874
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:40,663
And all of 'em donated!

1875
01:31:40,696 --> 01:31:43,532
Your first month's rent,
all taken care of.

1876
01:31:43,566 --> 01:31:45,033
Yeah.

1877
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:46,969
And?

1878
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,671
You're very sorry.

1879
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:51,640
Aren't you, Owen?

1880
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:53,742
You don't know
how sorry I am.

1881
01:31:57,112 --> 01:31:59,181
I thought
God abandoned me.

1882
01:31:59,214 --> 01:32:02,084
No, He sends His angels,

1883
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,219
But they don't always
come from the sky,

1884
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,854
Some are already here.

1885
01:32:05,888 --> 01:32:07,289
Yes, like the one
who came up with this

1886
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:09,725
Whole idea in the
first place.

1887
01:32:09,758 --> 01:32:12,160
You did all this?

1888
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,563
Not just me.

1889
01:32:14,597 --> 01:32:16,298
No, it was all of us.

1890
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,300
And all of us...

1891
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:20,803
We're very happy you're
here with us in Mapleton.

1892
01:32:22,137 --> 01:32:24,206
We love you, Mama.

1893
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,008
Oh, I love you, too.

1894
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:30,278
I-I-I love you,
too, Mom.

1895
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,214
Oh...

1896
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:33,849
I love you, too.

1897
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,685
That's what I call
a merry Christmas.

1898
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:37,986
No.

1899
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,755
A root beer Christmas.

1900
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:40,856
(Laughing)

1901
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,290
(Bell tolling)

1902
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:45,794
Where's the church?

1903
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:47,562
Right down the road.

1904
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:51,967
Does the church have
a bathroom?

1905
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,902
Not again!

1906
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:55,570
(Laughing)

1907
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:52,094
* I heard the bells
on Christmas Day *

1908
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:55,664
* Their old
familiar carols play *

1909
01:33:55,698 --> 01:33:59,001
* And wild and sweet
the words repeat *

1910
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:02,404
* Of peace on earth
good will to men *

1911
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:06,341
(Scatting)

1912
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,814
* I thought
how as the day had come *

1913
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:15,150
* The belfries of all
Christendom *

1914
01:34:15,183 --> 01:34:18,854
* Had rolled along
the unbroken song *

1915
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:21,857
* Of peace on earth

1916
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,727
* Good will

1917
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,864
* To men

1918
01:34:28,897 --> 01:34:33,168
* Peace on earth

1919
01:34:35,237 --> 01:34:39,307
* Peace on earth

1920
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:49,484
* And in despair
I bowed my head *

1921
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:53,055
* There is no peace on earth
I said *

1922
01:34:53,088 --> 01:34:56,424
* For hate is strong
and mocks the song *

1923
01:34:56,458 --> 01:35:01,229
* Of peace on earth
good will to men *

1924
01:35:01,263 --> 01:35:04,699
(Scatting)

1925
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:09,371
* Then pealed
the bells more loud and deep *

1926
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:12,808
* God is not dead nor
doth he sleep *

1927
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:16,144
* The wrong shall
fail the right prevail *

1928
01:35:16,178 --> 01:35:19,214
* With peace on earth

1929
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:22,084
* Good will

1930
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:26,121
* To men

1931
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:29,324
* Peace on earth

1932
01:35:29,357 --> 01:35:32,527
* And good will

1933
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,899
* And peace on earth

1934
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:47,075
* 'Til ringing
singing on its way *

1935
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:50,412
* The world revolved from
night to day *

1936
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:54,016
* A voice
a chime a chant sublime *

1937
01:35:54,049 --> 01:35:57,085
* Of peace on earth

1938
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:59,988
* Good will

1939
01:36:00,022 --> 01:36:03,458
* To men

1940
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:07,029
* Peace on earth

1941
01:36:07,062 --> 01:36:10,298
* And good will

1942
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:17,539
* And peace on earth
