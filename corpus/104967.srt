L... That's all I want.

176
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,995
<i>And then?</i>

177
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,592
And then... And then nothing else,
because I'm done ordering. Okay?

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,233
<i>And then?</i>

179
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,189
See, all I want is the three orders
of the garlic chicken...

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,475
...and the white rice.

181
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,789
<i>And then?</i>

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,798
- And the soup, dude.
- Oh, and the won ton soup.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,275
<i>- And then?
- And the cookies, fortune.</i>

184
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,833
And the fortune cookies.

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,237
So it's just the chicken, the rice...

186
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,153
...the soup and the fortune cookies,
and that's it.

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,398
<i>And then?</i>

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,195
And then you can put it
in a brown paper bag...

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,153
...and put it in my hand,
because I'm ready to eat.

190
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,193
<i>And then?</i>

191
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,478
I refuse to play
your Chinese food mind games.

192
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
<i>- And then?
- No! No "and then"!</i>

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,675
<i>- And then?
- No "and then"!</i>

194
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,757
<i>- And then?
- No "and then"!</i>

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,473
<i>- And then?
- No! No "and then"!</i>

196
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,070
<i>- And then?
- You're starting to piss me off, lady.</i>

197
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,475
<i>- And then?
- And then...</i>

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,309
...I'm gonna come in there
and put my foot in your ass...

199
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,074
...if you say "and then" again!

200
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,039
<i>And then and then
and then and then and then...</i>

201
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,675
<i>And then?</i>

202
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,599
Come on, Nelson,
just help us find my car.

203
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,917
You didn't have to go all "egg roll"
on that speaker box.

204
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,634
I'm not the one that called
the Dalai Lama a fag.

205
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,833
- I was just kidding around.
- Well, Nelson didn't appreciate it.

206
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,277
Look, it's Christie Boner.

207
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,917
Wow! The hottest of the hot.

208
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,590
<i>El fuego of all that is el fuego.</i>

209
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,950
- Did she just wave at us?
- No way. She would never wave at us.

210
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,957
Then why did she just wave at us?

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,799
I don't know. Maybe she thinks
we're other people.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,115
People she waves to.

213
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,873
Hi, Chester.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,589
Hi.

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,430
Hi, Jesse. I had a really
good time with you last night.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,590
- Me too.
- That was some crazy party.

217
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,198
- Hey, have you seen my car?
- Well, I saw it last night.

218
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,512
I mean, I saw the back seat.

219
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,556
- I mean the whole thing.
- Get another one with all the money...

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,876
...you were throwing around.
- Money?

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,231
Yeah. You had that really nice
suitcase full of money.

222
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,474
- A suitcase full of money?
- Don't you remember giving me $500...

223
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,716
...to show you my hoo-hoos?

224
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,068
- $500?
- Hoo-hoos?

225
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,919
You mean, you don't remember anything?

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,429
How about now?

227
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,755
No.

228
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,311
How about now?

229
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,879
I'm a little bit fuzzy too.

230
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,072
Maybe if I could get
a little refresher course.

231
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,999
- All right.
- Go.

232
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,235
- Are these losers bothering you?
- No, Tommy.

233
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,278
Guys like you could never score
with a chick like this.

234
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,074
- Stick to your own kind.
- Don't be such a jerk.

235
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,475
Next time you guys
bother my girlfriend...

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,672
...stoner-bashing time.
- Oh, yeah?

237
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,995
Yeah.

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,039
- Okay.
- Consider this your warning.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,433
Later, dudes!

240
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,189
CHESTER: Dude, you touched
Christie Boner's hoo-hoo.

241
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,555
Shibby!

242
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,034
Low-five.

243
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,156
CHESTER: Yeah.
JESSE: Let's get out of here.

244
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,035
Chester!

245
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,993
Dude, that Christie Boner
is super hot.

246
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,430
Where did we get a suitcase
full of money?

247
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,914
Why don't we have it now?

248
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,873
Maybe we deposited it
in a Swiss bank account.

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,791
Now, if we had a ridiculous
sum of money, where would we go?

250
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,715
Dude.

251
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,748
Sweet!

252
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,830
No way we were here last night.

253
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,795
We'd never fit in
at a place like this.

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,390
Look everyone!
It's Mr. Jesse and Mr. Chester!

255
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,752
Look at the toggles on that kitten.

256
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,671
Good afternoon, Jesse, Chester.
How are we feeling today?

257
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,959
A little fuzzy.

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,515
Hi, Chester. Hi, Jesse.

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,915
Did you guys enjoy
yourselves last night?

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,191
- Have we met?
- It's me, Tania.

261
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,192
Remember last night
when I gave you...

262
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,989
...that super-special,
slippery-wet lapdance?

263
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,188
Of course. How can I forget?

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,836
You want to do it again?

265
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,112
This time, it's on me.

266
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,996
If you say so.

267
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,151
Didn't I get a special lapdance?

268
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,152
Did you ever.

269
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,039
Sweet!

270
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,879
Sweet!

271
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,873
So...

272
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,959
...just how super-special
can a slippery lapdance be?

273
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,513
What the hell were you thinking,
throwing around my money like that?

274
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,076
- You're a...
- I'm a gender-challenged male.

275
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,993
What does that mean?

276
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,836
Oh, dude, you're a dude! That's...

277
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,235
You...

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,316
Last night, I had you sneak a suitcase
of stolen money out of here.

279
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,074
- Stolen money?
- $200,000.

280
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,594
$200,000!

281
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,837
I gave you the case and left.
We were supposed to meet.

282
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,998
But you never showed up!
Where's that suitcase?

283
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,912
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

284
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
- Where's that suitcase?
- It's in my car.

285
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,590
Then get it. Fast.
Or else you'll be singing soprano.

286
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,952
Dude. Dude, dude!

287
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,793
- We gotta go.
- Are you crazy?

288
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,837
I'm with breakdancing strippers.

289
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,190
Seriously, dude, this is an emergency.

290
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,555
So is this, dude.

291
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
It's a breakdancing
stripper emergency.

292
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,549
- Goodbye!
WOMEN: Bye, Chester!

293
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,239
I love you!

294
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,189
We were supposed to meet her with
the suitcase, but we didn't show up.

295
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,473
Sounds like us.
How wasted were we last night?

296
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,797
I touched Christie's hoo-hoo,
we're on the hook for $200,000...

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,037
...that belongs to a transsexual
stripper, and my car's gone.

298
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,268
- I'd say we were pretty wasted.
- We really need to find your car.

299
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,229
Okay, let's see. The last place
we remember being last night was...

300
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,359
The twins'. But we can't show up
without the anniversary gifts.

301
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,438
I got it! We'll get them
a little something for now.

302
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,758
When we find the car, we'll give them
the real gifts. That's a dollar...

303
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,348
...thirty-nine.

304
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,949
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

305
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,549
- It'll be totally cool. Let's go.
- Okay.

306
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,717
We are so dead.

307
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,872
I roger that.

<i>WANDA: We've been cleaning all day.
WILMA: What do you guys have to say?</i>

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,070
Happy anniversary.

311
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,797
We ate the dark ones.
We know you guys don't like those.

312
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,310
Dark ones are the only ones
we do like.

Oh, yeah.

314
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,479
But you could use the box to keep...

315
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,232
You keep...

316

JESSE: No, of course not.

318
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,030
No, we got you guys great gifts.
We just had some car trouble.

319
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,196
We came over here
as soon as we could...

320
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,237

Oh, no.

All we have to do is
take out the trash.

324
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,596
Guess they haven't been outside yet.

325
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,956
You know what?
We'll take out the trash.

326
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,111
You guys go and take a nice hot bath.

Yeah. You deserve it

332
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,919
- You're tilting.
- Sorry.

333
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,759
- Why are you tilting?
- You gave me the heavy end.

- Let it go, man.
- No, we can get it.

No. Let it go.

Okay.

- Okay.

340
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,070
Watch it! Careful. Careful.

- Are we cool? Are we cool?
- We're still cool.

342
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,268
Now, take your shoe off,
and you get it.

343
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,671
- Okay.

You can't be the guys
we're looking for. Sorry.

516
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,549
Hang in there, bro.

517
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,995
- Come on, Kojak.
- All right.

518
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,511
I'm really sorry about all this.

519
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,234
Looks like it was a case
of mistaken identity.

520
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,278
Actually, those are
the real criminals over there.

521
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,875
One of our officers...

522
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,755
...made a wrong identification.
- Yeah, that was me.

523
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,518
I'm sorry about that, fellas.

524
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,029
Rick will tell you exactly
where your car is.

525
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,911
- We found the car.
- We found the car.

526
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,758
We found the car!

527
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,951
<i>- Yeah, we found the car.
- Found my car.</i>

528
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,273
Now we get the gifts, go to the twins'
house, and get our special treats.

529
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,839
Sweet!

530
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,640
Give us the keys
and we're out of here.

531
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,239
You got it.

532
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,075
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

533
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,633
What's the problem, Rick?

534
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,558
Nothing, I just... Boy.

535
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,398
Okay. Jeez.

536
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,549
Did you say you wanted your car back,
or you wanted it impounded?

537
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,753
We want the car back, please.

538
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,350
Oh, I see. That's kind of funny,
because what happened was...

539
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,269
...I accidentally sent your car
to the impound.

540
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,839
- Rick.
RICK: I know.

541
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,270
I can definitely tell you this.
You guys...

542
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,590
...can get the car back in a few days.

543
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,031
We don't have a few days, Rick.
We need the car back now.

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,312
Say, how about a treat?
There's Bavarian cream.

545
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,876
- Yeah.
- That's a good one there.

546
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,753
- It's good.
- It's great. I have a lot of them.

547
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,837
- You know what? Forget about it.
- Okay.

548
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,395
- Psych!
- Oh, jeez. You got me.

549
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,795
Hey, fellows, who's the goose? Me.

550
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,554
You're such a joker.

551
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,035
PIZZACOLl:
One.

552
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,319
- Damn!
CHICK 1: Where are Jesse and Chester?

553
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,279
- What?
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.

554
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,398
I don't know where they are...

555
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,670
...but I bet those punks
over there do.

556
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,995
So then, remember?
I said, "Later, dudes."

557
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,076
- Why were you with those jerks anyway?
- They were just being nice...

558
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,713
...unlike someone I know.

559
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,798
Maybe it's time I find someone
with a sensitive side.

560
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,190
Someone who respects me as a person.

561
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,715
Maybe somebody like Jesse or Chester.

562
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,238
Okay, listen up.
We're gonna find Jesse and Chester.

563
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,358
And when we do, stoner-bashing time!

564
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,279
CHICK 1: Do you know Jesse and Chester?
- Who are you?

565
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,557
- We are hot chicks.
- Yes, you are.

566
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,593
We believe they have
the continuum transfunctioner.

567
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,555
However, if you recover the continuum
transfunctioner from them...

568
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,638
...and bring it to us,
we will give you erotic pleasure.

569
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,558
You've got yourselves a deal.

570
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,956
Okay, guys. Okay, guys, new plan.

571
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,835
First, we find those stoners,
get the continuum transfunctioner...

572
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,998
...then, it's jerk-bashing time.
- Yeah!

573
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,839
Oh, yeah.

574
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,156
I just remembered where
you might be able to find them.

575
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,036

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,872
All right, give it a shot.

580
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,113
Okay, you almost got it.

581
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,949
Now just concentrate on the beep,
swing as hard as you can...

582
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,071
...and keep your ear on the ball.
Okay?

583
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,475
All right, little buddy,
you can do it!

CHICK 1: Do you know Jesse and Chester?
- Pardon me?

587
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,037
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
- Who are you?

588
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,630
We're extremely hot chicks
with big breasts.

589
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,314
Really?

590
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,068
Can I touch your face?
It's the only way I can see...

591
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,748
...who I'm talking to.
- Okay.

592
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,591
Wow! You are hot.

593
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,756
Is this normal?

594
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,112
Oh, yeah. This is how
blind people shake hands.

595
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,398
- Sammy, you're up next.
- Okay...

596
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,795
- Come on.
- What the...? Sis!

597
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,477
Excuse me, a little help.
Wanda. Wilma.

598
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,319
- Anthony?
- Anthony, what is going on?

599
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,074
Nothing. I was just reading.

600
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,791
Bye, ladies, I need to be alone now.

601
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,117
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
- Who are you guys?

602
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,515
We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

603
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,873
We're supposed to meet them later,
but we can't wait.

604
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,671
- We don't know where they are.
- And frankly, we don't care.

JESSE: Dude, let's call Nelson.
CHESTER: Yeah. See if he's home.

- Hey, Nelson, it's Chester.

Hey, Chester! No, it's me, Tommy.

609
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,476

at the moment.

610

about the continuum transfunctioner.

Those double-crossing
sexy, sexy sluts!

618
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,877
I am so sick of hearing about
this continuum transfunctioner thing.

- You got the continuum transfunctioner?

Who are you guys?

621
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,877
We are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

622
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,751
It is all that stands between
the universe and destruction.

623
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,996
It is a mysterious
and powerful device.

624
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,953
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

625
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,593
- We know.
- We don't have it.

626

- Yeah.

We suck.

Wait, I just got a really bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

Yeah. I'll tell you what we'll do.

We'll go to the impound lot, get
the car, which has the gifts in it...

But the bad news is...

674
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,552
...not only did Officer Boyer
send your car to the impound...

675
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,911
...he tagged it for auction
and it was sold this afternoon.

- I have the address right here.

All right.

679
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,435
But it'd be against Regulation...

681
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,639

682
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,879
Reaching onto this side
of the counter isn't allowed.

683
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,590
The last guy who tried it ended up
with three broken fingers.

684
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,428
- Reach it.
- You can reach it!

685
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,915
No, I got...
One of these has carpal tunnel.

686
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,634
What if I further injure myself?

687
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,428
I have to do everything.

688
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,950
I'm a better lookout.
My vision's better. You know that.

689
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,754
That's it, that's it.

690
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,679
- Got it!
- We're good, we're good.

691
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,831
- What are you doing?
- Dude, I'm stuck!

692
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,759
- Come on. I'm stuck.
- You seriously stuck?

693
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,989
Don't!

694
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,799
Dude, here she comes! Help!

695
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,073
Get it!

696
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,196
Hold on, hold on. I gotta get...

697
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,919
Okay, okay.

698
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,833
- I got it, I got it.
- Help me!

699
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,395
We'll spit on it.
You know, lubrication.

700
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,318
- That's gross, dude!
- Okay, fine.
