00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,771
# I like it filthy and raw #

2
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:30,476
# I like it filthy and raw #

3
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,077
# I like it filthy and raw #

4
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,987
# I like it filthy and raw #

5
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,153
# Is it sex or is it love #

6
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,025
# I don't care what it is #

7
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:45,121
# I just do what you want #

8
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:46,961
# The way that you want it #

9
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:50,367
# And when you turn around
And you tell me to hit it #

10
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:52,166
# If you're shaking that ass #

11
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,298
# Who am I to forbid it #

12
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:55,807
# Tell me what you want #

13
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:58,242
# Tell me what you want
I will do it #

14
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:01,713
# Tell me what you want
I will do it yeah #

15
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:03,249
# Tell me what you want #

16
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,512
# Tell me what you want
I will do it #

17
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,883
# Tell me what you want
I will do it #

18
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,649
# Do it
Do it
Do it #

19
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:14,383
# I like it filthy and raw #

20
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:18,022
# I like it filthy and raw #

21
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,727
# I like it filthy and raw #

22
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:25,431
# I like it filthy and raw #

23
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,770
All over the world
kids are getting down.

24
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,037
They're getting down at the club.

25
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,738
At work.

26
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,247
In the car.

27
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:40,852
At the party.

28
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,417
At the bar.

29
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,360
And at your front door.

30
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:49,895
This guide will help
you to get down, too.

31
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,022
We will introduce you
to some of the tools

32
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,966
you can use to help you get
down, like vodka and drugs.

33
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,162
It will show you how
to avoid the pitfalls

34
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,000
associated with this lifestyle.

35
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:00,334
My shoes!

36
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:03,865
Like getting sick, and the police.

37
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:06,913
Guide scientists have spent
years gathering empirical data

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,278
of all facets of nightlife.

39
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,442
This film is divided into chapters,

40
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:15,079
each offering insights into
different aspects of getting down.

41
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,454
And when better to get down
than after a stressful day.

42
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,160
Hey, girl.

43
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,531
Hey, what's up?

44
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,263
Come get me. Let's go and get drunk.

45
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:31,463
Okay.

46
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,096
Take your shit with you.

47
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,403
Bitch.

48
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,238
Fuck you!

49
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,834
Are you okay?

50
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:40,106
Douchebag!

51
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:48,520
Okay. Just, just, walk down to
the front and I'll be right there.

52
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:51,352
Fuck! Fucking cunt!

53
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:55,723
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

54
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,787
That's my other line. Okay.

55
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:58,990
Whassup, Bernie?

56
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:01,033
Hey, girl. What are you doing?

57
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,432
Nothing. Just closing up.

58
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,163
You wanna hang out tonight?

59
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:07,604
Ooh, girlfriend, I can't,
'cause I got a date tonight.

60
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,164
With who?

61
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,904
Remember the guy we met
at Cinespace last week?

62
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,104
The drunk guy?

63
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,704
Yeah, whatever.

64
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,409
He's taking me out to some
new shi-shi bar in Hollywood.

65
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:18,883
Okay.

66
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,317
But we can hook up later.

67
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:21,718
Yeah, I'll call you later.

68
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:50,573
Yo. Yo, what's the deal, yo?

69
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,047
What's going on?

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,384
Yo, man, you ready for a party tonight?

71
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,617
Yeah. Um, yeah.

72
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,319
Yeah.

73
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:03,521
You remember, right? Yeah,
man, that shit is gonna be dope.

74
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,224
Whassup with that phone, homie?

75
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,357
Yeah, this phone is fly, right?

76
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,129
I got this shit at the pawn shop.

77
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:11,693
They said Deon Wargees
used to owned this shit.

78
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,966
She came in one day sweating in shit.

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,500
Let me trade this phone.
She went got some crack.

80
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,443
Crack must be the shit.

81
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,812
Everybody's gonna be on
because I got this phone.

82
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:26,375
When I go come here,
and they'll think it's funny.

83
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,944
Look at his phone.
Looks like a lunch box.

84
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:32,253
You got any baloney sandwich in
there? No, I got no sandwich here.

85
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:35,055
This is a phone. And then at night
they'll all be up on me.

86
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,858
They gonna come up to me.
You know what I will do?

87
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,900
I'll put this shit on the wall. Bang!

88
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,730
You wanna use the phone?

89
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,667
Yeah, c'mon. $1, motherfucker.

90
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:47,298
Yeah, that's right. It's
not so funny no more, huh?

91
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,239
I don't care if you got a tube top on.

92
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,777
Get out of here.
It cost $1 to use my phone.

93
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:54,814
I need some money. I can't get
no money with the way you look.

94
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,714
Unless I'm pimpin'.

95
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:00,218
What? What? I wanna call my granny.

96
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,811
Damn, you won't call your granny.

97
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,880
You didn't want me. Now I
got a phone. Y'all owe me.

98
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,585
$1, motherfucker. $1.

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,756
$1, motherfucker. We some
old school fools. Yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,302
Okay. So, the best part is...

101
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,600
What?

102
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:22,608
He can't even think of his fucking bike.

103
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:23,870
No!

104
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:25,275
What a fucking loser.

105
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:28,075
A total pussy. What do
you wanna do tonight?

106
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:31,083
I don't know. Fucking Cahuenga
is gonna be a madhouse.

107
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,550
Let's go to JJ's party.

108
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:35,281
JJ. JJ as in date rape JJ?

109
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:38,222
Dude! That chick is a slut.
Don't listen to her.

110
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,020
Okay. Whatever you say.

111
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,424
Let's go to the party.

112
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,387
Getting down seems so random.

113
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:48,434
But as you'll see, there
is a definite science to it.

114
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,731
Formulas and paradigms
that can be followed

115
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,637
to achieve the maximum
fun with the least stress.

116
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:57,006
This guide is for boys and girls,
but boys and girls are different.

117
00:05:57,077 --> 00:06:01,912
We often hear boys being referred
to as slamhounds or horndogs.

118
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,973
But this isn't entirely fair.

119
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,645
Ever since Charies Darwin came up
with his theories on natural selection,

120
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,121
we've known that the
propagation of the specles

121
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,055
is dependant on genetic mutation,

122
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,390
and that occurs only through
fertilization of multiple partners.

123
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,590
In other words, both boys and
girls are hard-wired to get down.

124
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,930
That's why sex is fun. But there
are physiological differences.

125
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,765
The man is fertile 24/7.

126
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:26,601
But a woman can only be
pollinated for a few days a month.

127
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:29,335
About a week before the end
of their menstrual cycle,

128
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,242
most girls experience
a period of a few days

129
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,679
technically known as their horny week

130
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:39,651
when they are good to go and feel
particularly ready to get down.

131
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,382
Now, imagine girls, if you were
cursed to feel like that all the time.

132
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,152
That's what it's like to be
a boy every day of your life.

133
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:49,992
Dude, it's a party
for a modeling agency.

134
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,758
There's gonna be mad pussy there.

135
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,265
We are gonna get some. For sure.

136
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:59,665
Game on.

137
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:02,105
One for you. You might need that.

138
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,006
Dude, what is that?

139
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,237
What?

140
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,108
Looks like you got cum on your face.

141
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,274
What, bro? It's fucking moisturizer.
What the fuck?

142
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,578
Shacka.

143
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:13,346
Boys and girls love to get down,

144
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,820
but there are differences
in the way they go about it.

145
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,791
Hooking up by the end of the night is
often the ultimate goal for boys and girls.

146
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:24,091
The difference here is that boys will
acknowledge this as their sole purpose.

147
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:26,428
Whereas girls are a
little more reluctant.

148
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,898
Does this jersey look okay?

149
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,559
Fuck yeah, dude! That shit's the bomb.

150
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,399
You look good in that green.

151
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:33,735
Green? See the eyes?
I'm working that shit.

152
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,866
How's the mother fucker paying you? Wee!

153
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:38,843
While the boys are quite
clear on their purpose,

154
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:42,143
the girls tend to be a
little cloudy on their goals.

155
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:43,341
Stings!

156
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,474
It's supposed to.

157
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,748
Is it really? Ow! Bitch!

158
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,449
We're gonna have so much fun tonight.

159
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:52,684
I mean, is the skirt too much?

160
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,818
Are you kidding?
It's freaking awesome.

161
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:58,193
The boys are gonna die when they
see you on that. Turn around.

162
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,323
Pull it down a little. Right there.

163
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,426
Just don't bend over. It is hot. Hello?

164
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:06,961
Anyways, I had such a horrible
day today. I just wanna dance.

165
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,806
Dancing is girl ease for
get hammered and talked into bed.

166
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,505
Common in girls is the
lack of a cognizant need,

167
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,481
or a simple refusal to
acknowledge desire for sex.

168
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:17,811
All dancing.

169
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,478
We are having girls' night out tonight.

170
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:21,679
Are you excited?

171
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:26,387
The boys and the girls are
looking forward to going out.

172
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,087
But what's going out all about?

173
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:31,924
Before you go out, you have to get in.

174
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:36,162
There are three basic types of events that
require some thought, or an invitation.

175
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:40,104
The club, the shi-shi bar,
and the private party.

176
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,437
It could be a CD or film release.

177
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,977
A new hair salon, or an
after-fashion show event.

178
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:48,536
The bouncers for each event can be
distinguished by the folds of flesh

179
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,049
known as hot dogs on
the back of their neck.

180
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,813
The private party bouncer,
a one hot dog doorman.

181
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,048
The shi-shi bar bouncer.

182
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:59,023
Notice the two hot dogs
folding up on each other.

183
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,083
And finally, the club bouncer.

184
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:04,961
A mature bouncer in his prime can
maintain up to as many as eight hot dogs.

185
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:07,727
It's the sign of status
amongst fully grown bouncers.

186
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:11,032
And it takes years of high-caloric
eating to achieve this majesty.

187
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:15,598
Contrary to popular belief, bouncers are
highly-trained professionals

188
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:19,805
who study their vocation for years
at specialized training facilities,

189
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,278
like this one in Long Beach.

190
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,440
You show me how you
would greet a patron.

191
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:27,782
Um, sorry. Not tonight.
We got a private party.

192
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,378
That's it?

193
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,820
Yeah, she wanted to come in.

194
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,085
What the shit was that, man?

195
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,560
This is not customer service.

196
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,927
This is bouncer school, okay?

197
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:42,092
You gotta look like it. You gotta
act like it. You gotta feel it.

198
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:44,398
Bouncing is a business
fraught with contradictions.

199
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,938
The velvet rope,
once the epitome of glamour,

200
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,099
is now found at the bank
and the post office.

201
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,302
Folding your arms are good.

202
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:53,174
Right? Some posture.

203
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,180
Get some bass in your voice.

204
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,216
You look the person right in the eye,

205
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:59,717
and you squeeze those
eyebrows together, okay?

206
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:03,779
Like that. Let them know
you mean business.

207
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:05,188
Right?

208
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:07,692
Here they try to make sense of it all.

209
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
Maximum capacity.

210
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:11,988
Louder. I can't hear you.

211
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,397
At bouncer school, the
principles are complex.

212
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,868
So, if there's nobody in there,
why do we make them wait outside?

213
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:20,599
Because we need to
make the club look busy.

214
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:24,666
So, we, we're just saying
it's a private party.

215
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,446
Oh!

216
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:28,946
The lessons are difficult.

217
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,949
One patron in, one click.

218
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:33,042
Two patrons, double click.

219
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,984
Three. One, two, three.

220
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:39,013
Studies vary, ranging from bracelet
application to hand-stamping.

221
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,117
One stamp on the top. Real simple.

222
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,560
Right in the center of
the fist. Stamp. See?

223
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,791
So, what if I do him
up here just like that?

224
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,231
Wrong. There, there, it's all wrong.

225
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,531
It's all wrong. See?
Don't make no sense.

226
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:54,039
Now, we don't want lawsuits,
so I don't want him all marked up.

227
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,041
So let's walk him out.

228
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,976
We're walking him out.
Just show him a bit of love.

229
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,706
Like that. Nobody saw it, okay?

230
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,442
Maybe a little slap on the face.
Nobody saw anything.

231
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,416
Maybe a head butt. Got that?

232
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:06,850
I got that. Okay.

233
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,114
Good.

234
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:10,348
You fellas follow me there?

235
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:15,224
But for those who stay the course,
the rewards are certainly there.

236
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,853
Yeah!

237
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,659
Nice going. Did you guys see that?

238
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,426
That's what's supposed to be done.

239
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,331
Unless you are a regular,

240
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:26,498
the entry process at the club
is random and frustrating,

241
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:30,201
and unless you personally know
the bouncer, then ignore him.

242
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:32,073
Don't try and be friends.

243
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,010
He doesn't wanna talk to you.

244
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,572
The person you need to work on
is the guy or girl with the list.

245
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,811
Let me do the talking.

246
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,615
Hi. Can we come in?

247
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,212
Are you on the list?

248
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:46,122
Maybe. I don't know if they
put me on. Bryce Vandermass.

249
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:47,716
Yeah. I'm sorry, no Bryce.

250
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,285
What about me? Andy Harper.

251
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:52,228
Sorry, no.

252
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,323
Come on! Please.

253
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,994
Maybe later. You guys get in line.

254
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,470
What the fuck?
There's not even anyone in there.

255
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:00,904
There's no need to swear.

256
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,236
Sorry, guys. Not tonight.

257
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,935
There's no one in there!

258
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,240
It's not gonna happen.
It's a private party.

259
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,678
Nice going.

260
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,978
They have painted
themselves into a corner,

261
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,144
and must endure the humiliation
of walking back through the people

262
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,687
they just pushed in front of.

263
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:17,450
Now, let's try it again.

264
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,957
But this time Bryce will
provide a distraction

265
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:23,223
while his friend Andy scopes
the list as it is being checked.

266
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,924
Hey, what's up? I should be on the list.

267
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,557
Bryce Vandermass.

268
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,464
Note the confidence in his voice.

269
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:32,163
And see how Andy positions himself.

270
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,332
Andy studies the list while
the door girl checks it.

271
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:38,172
Note how he looks for a name
that has not been crossed off

272
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,735
with a plus one.

273
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:44,806
Maybe it's under my name. Oliver
Quinn. We're bookers at Sunset Town.

274
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:48,877
Andy drops the name of an agency,
because this is a talent agency party.

275
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,686
But it could easily have been a
magazine or record release party.

276
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,523
The point is, it worked.
So savor the moment.

277
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,062
Hey, can you get us in?

278
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,290
What's your name?

279
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:00,127
I'm Carly.

280
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,100
Guys, in or out.

281
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,761
My friend's the promoter here.

282
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,498
I'll go find him. Come back.

283
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:07,698
We'll get you guys in.

284
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,140
I just told you, go inside.

285
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,178
Dude, just cheer up.
She's my girlfriend.

286
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:16,977
Dude, you just met her. Go inside!

287
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,245
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

288
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:22,344
Just don't get too cocky.

289
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,322
Hey, how is it going, Rick?

290
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,221
What's going on, Ol? Hey,

291
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,692
this my boy Oliver and his girl.

292
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:29,921
Oliver Quinn?

293
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,122
That's right.

294
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,892
Get those two.

295
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:37,864
Easy.

296
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:44,505
Well, it sucked in there anyway.

297
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:46,306
Fuck!

298
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:47,710
What are we gonna do now?

299
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,510
Let's go back to the Mayan
and call Hector.

300
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,246
Hector? Nice!

301
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,380
Finally, it's important
to remember that sometimes

302
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,755
things just aren't going to go your way.

303
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,021
We should be on the list.

304
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,859
I've told you, we're at our capacity.
I can't let you in.

305
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,159
Capacity?

306
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:07,859
If we wait for a little bit?

307
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,926
I'm not promising anything,
but we'll see what I can do.

308
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,937
How are you?

309
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:15,200
Hi, Brittany.

310
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,909
You just let those two transvestites in.

311
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:22,106
Our friends are inside already.

312
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,808
Everybody's friends are inside.

313
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,647
Like I told you, it's capacity.
There's nothing I can do.

314
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,210
Step out of the way. Just five?

315
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,983
Yeah.

316
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:40,063
Come on, dude. Don't be
a dick. There's two of us.

317
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,294
I already told you guys three times.

318
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:45,394
We're out of capacity. There's
nothing I can do about it.

319
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:48,167
Do me favor. Take a step back,
get out of my face.

320
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:52,610
I'm gonna ban you from here
for life. How does that sound?

321
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:58,947
All right, you're banned. Have a
nice evening. Just goodnight, guys.

322
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,510
You know what? We don't wanna
come to this shitty ass bar anyway.

323
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,556
It's a gay bar, anyway.

324
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,519
Goodnight!

325
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:09,527
Calum, who are you calling?

326
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:14,096
Hello. Is this the Fire Department?

327
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,533
Me and my girlfriend,
we've just had intimacy now

328
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,194
on Wilcox at Hollywood

329
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,967
and there's this cabaret
performer blowin' fire

330
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,530
and it got smokey in there.

331
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:26,806
There's a lot of people and
the fire door was blocked.

332
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,110
Seem kinda unsafe.
Just thought you should know.

333
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,913
That's right, ma'am. Wilcox.

334
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,816
Thank you.

335
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,014
What the fuck are you doing?

336
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,647
You like that?

337
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,817
Stupid.

338
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:43,726
As you can see, just
getting in can be quite taxing.

339
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,458
You're up early.

340
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:50,593
Yeah, I needed my beauty sleep.

341
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,069
Botox's not working?

342
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,607
What's going on for tonight?

343
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,768
I don't know. Daniel over here
knows about somethin'.

344
00:15:57,843 --> 00:16:00,471
Oh, yes, some modeling agency thing.

345
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,537
Should be some hot chicks there.

346
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,173
Man, there's no models there.

347
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,514
They just say that to get dudes there.

348
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:07,951
Where's that, anyway?

349
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,885
At System.

350
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,082
System?

351
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,217
Forty-five.

352
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,488
Forty-five what?

353
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:18,587
Oh, man, fuck that!

354
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,066
It's important to find a place you like

355
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:23,692
where you can become a regular.

356
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,999
Becoming a regular
has certain advantages.

357
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,905
Not the least of which is that
you don't ever have to worry

358
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,738
about getting in.

359
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,041
This graph quantifies the
main reasons why a certain bar

360
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,308
will be patronized.

361
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:40,375
But the best thing about being
a regular is the free drink.

362
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,146
How do we know what's working tonight?

363
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,415
Ryan's at Beauty Bar.

364
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,786
Dan's at Star Shoes.

365
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,984
Right on, Cahuenga it is.

366
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,924
Again.

367
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:53,056
The free drink is not a bottomless cup.

368
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:56,192
Your relationship with your
bartender needs to be nurtured.

369
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,466
If you are a girl, the bartender
may be flirting with you,

370
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:02,769
so the tipping formula
is not so hard and fast.

371
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:07,541
But if you are a guy and the
bartender is not gay, you must tip.

372
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,673
There's a very specific rule
that governs tipping for free drinks

373
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,775
known as as the Cahuenga Principle.

374
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:14,843
It states that the value
of the tip given

375
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,321
should be no less than half the
combined value of the drinks.

376
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,723
The tipping in itself is an art form.

377
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:25,890
Watch what happens when Peter wants
to tip for a round of free drinks.

378
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,661
The bar back cannot be
faulted for picking up the bill

379
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:32,101
since there is a real danger of it
being picked up by another customer.

380
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:36,005
But now Peter's tip goes unnoticed
and he won't get another free round.

381
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:37,975
What should Peter have done?

382
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:41,309
See how Peter is careful to avoid
eye contact with the bartender

383
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,314
that won't give him free drinks.

384
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:46,943
Peter gets the drinks and palms
a ten into the bartender's hand.

385
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,579
In the hand. No confusion.

386
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:52,488
Tipping greases the wheels.
Free drinks are good for you

387
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:54,719
'cause you save money
and you get to look cool.

388
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:57,354
It's good for the bartender
'cause he makes better tips.

389
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:03,630
I love your bar, man. Hot chicks and the
bartender always gives me free drinks.

390
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:05,068
This guy?

391
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,968
Yeah.

392
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,836
But it's not so good for the bar owner.

393
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:11,069
What don't you understand?

394
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,805
So if you get free drinks,
keep it to yourself.

395
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:18,782
Daniel won't be getting anymore
free drinks from Tad... ever.

396
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,580
Since the dawn of time,

397
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:23,554
man has been trying to
perfect ways to get his buzz on.

398
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:28,082
All cultures have certain methods that
are accepted, and some that are not.

399
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,288
In the US and Europe
alcohol is the drug of choice.

400
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:33,855
And make no mistake. It is a drug.

401
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,993
Alcohol's effects on full-grown
humans are many and varied.

402
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:40,470
Ranging from clumsiness...

403
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,871
I fucking love you, guys.

404
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:46,105
...to euphoria, to aggression...

405
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,646
What you wanna do? Fuck you!

406
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,705
...to romance,

407
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,820
to just playing the top.

408
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:59,915
One of the most profound
effects of alcohol

409
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:02,051
is its ability to cloud judgement,

410
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,528
especially as it relates
to human attraction.

411
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:07,157
Simply put, the more you drink,
the less you care.

412
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,758
Take a look at this acceptability graph.

413
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:12,167
Note the spike in the
graph at last call.

414
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,604
We'll take a closer
look at last call later.

415
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:17,335
But to make the "inhibriation"
process work to our advantage,

416
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,968
first we have to understand it.

417
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:21,012
Scientists at the Guide's Lab in Nevada

418
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,015
have been running tests
with fascinating results.

419
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,349
In this experiment, a group of mice
are observed in a club environment.

420
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:32,118
The mice in the control group
are content and productive.

421
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:35,786
The mice in the club environment
begin to drink the vodka and beer.

422
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:39,388
After one hour, two of the mice
have to be removed for fighting.

423
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,859
After two hours,

424
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:46,734
many of the mice have coupled up

425
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,967
and have begun the mating ritual.

426
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,838
Fantastic.

427
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,003
After three hours,

428
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,638
many of the mice exhibit signs of stress

429
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,773
and/or incapacitation.

430
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,377
Most of them seem to be intoxicated.

431
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,615
Exactly.

432
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,884
Oscar seems particularly wasted.

433
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,552
We'll come back to him.

434
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,857
But how does alcohol
affect the human brain?

435
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,761
Here at the Boys and Girls Guide

436
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,699
we pride ourselves on being
relevant to both boys and girls.

437
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:17,463
But boys and girls are different,

438
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:20,130
and this is evident when
it comes to drinking.

439
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:23,369
Hey, Rebecca, what
are you doing tonight?

440
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:26,843
I'm gonna stay home. I've got
that pet adoption in the morning.

441
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,437
We're going out tonight.
You should come.

442
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:30,607
Maybe.

443
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:32,844
Oh, come on.

444
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,783
A woman's brain,

445
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:38,255
one of the most complex and
mysterious things known to humanity.

446
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:41,657
It has the capability to hold
huge amounts of information.

447
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,422
It is both caring and logical,

448
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:45,088
and it can multitask.

449
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:47,860
But add white wine or
martinis to the equation

450
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:51,334
and the synapses in the
woman's brain begin to misfire.

451
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,337
Yes, baby!

452
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,506
What are you doing, mama?

453
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:59,407
Some girls will repeat this process

454
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,708
three or four times a week.

455
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:06,446
The male brain is slightly
smaller than the female's,

456
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,352
with less emphasis on high functions.

457
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,412
With the addition of alcohol,

458
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,254
the male brain also changes.

459
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:19,229
My biceps, muscle cars,
TV, hot chicks and money

460
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:24,292
become hot chicks, ass,
bacon, titties, and pussy.

461
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,830
But curiously, the changes are
nowhere near as categorical.

462
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,775
Alcohol or booze is
perhaps the key element

463
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:34,278
in getting down with the opposite sex.

464
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:41,109
And where better to find
booze than a house party.

465
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:44,519
There are certain
telltale signs of a party.

466
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,751
This must be it.

467
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,087
It's disgusting!

468
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,027
Boys urinating is a good sign.

469
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:55,362
As is a drunken girl crying out front.

470
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,231
I'll give you something to cry about.

471
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:02,663
The most important element
at any party is of course booze.

472
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,837
When planning your party, collect as many
empty premium vodka bottles as you can.

473
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:09,346
Then buy the cheapest
vodka you can find...

474
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:13,010
two-liter plastic bottles...
and pour it into the other bottles.

475
00:22:13,085 --> 00:22:15,383
No one will know, and no one will care.

476
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:19,515
But you might be able to buy enough
booze to keep the party going all night.

477
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:27,532
The party you attend
may be under alcohol.

478
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,967
If so, you may only
get one trip to the bar.

479
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,697
Make it count.

480
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:40,703
Food is nice, but if it's after
10:30, then don't touch it.

481
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:44,510
Be sure to dance around and
have some fun at the party.

482
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,278
If there's a theme, then dress up.

483
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:49,253
Don't worry about looking stupid.

484
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,152
Clean up any mess you make.

485
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,918
It doesn't have to be spotless,

486
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:55,187
but be seen to make an attempt.

487
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,559
The truth is, the place will
probably be trash by tomorrow morning.

488
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:01,156
Which brings us to Guide tip number one.

489
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,793
Have your party at someone else's place.

490
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:06,599
I got a speaker phone on this shit.

491
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:09,004
I could send pictures
but it come out digital.

492
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,803
Look like pacman and shit.

493
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,434
Hey, where...

494
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,775
Whassup, hammer time?
How you doing?

495
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,007
Who is this?

496
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,072
This is my friend.

497
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,587
Oh, man, she invited me to oil her
down at her photo shoot on Saturday.

498
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,088
Maxim, huh?

499
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,681
I'm getting the maximum
boner sitting right here.

500
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:29,756
Also I got like a little switch blade.

501
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:31,693
There's a compartment in here somewhere.

502
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:34,824
When I figure it out, I'm gonna
take it out and I'll show you.

503
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,425
Maybe I'll cut up something with it.

504
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,441
Oh, God!

505
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,843
Look at those two.

506
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,444
Oh, my God.

507
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,509
Kid and Play.

508
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:57,945
Mine's cute.

509
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:00,753
Dude, they look like
actors from Beat Street.

510
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:05,788
Yeah, but, I mean,
at least they are having fun.

511
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:08,958
Look at our friends.

512
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:13,300
Yeah, that's true. The one with
the phone does have a nice ass.

513
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:15,499
That would be Play.

514
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:25,181
Can we have some of that?

515
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,810
You want a very special yak?

516
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:29,353
The yak?

517
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:32,151
Yeah, it's motherfuckin'
on the yak, man!

518
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:34,419
Or on the cognac?

519
00:24:38,063 --> 00:24:39,724
Ah-ah!

520
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:41,789
Don't I know you?

521
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:45,325
No. You can get to
know me if you want to.

522
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:47,531
I got some gin.

523
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,733
Gin's for drunken old ladies.

524
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:52,299
Hey, Bernice, what are we gonna say

525
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:54,402
if they wanna dig a tagging later on?

526
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,142
Oh, y'all tag?

527
00:24:57,216 --> 00:25:00,549
We got some rustles in the car.
We got some purple.

528
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:02,416
Turtle green.

529
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,946
We were about to hit the Scientology
building like at 12:00 after this.

530
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:11,288
You got...

531
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:13,991
When there's only coffee,
liqueur and gin left,

532
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,593
it's time to play a game,
kind of like an adult easter egg hunt

533
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,194
called the booze hunt.

534
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:24,231
Good places to look are the freezer,

535
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,209
but it's a little obvious.

536
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:29,443
Other cupboards in the kitchen.

537
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:32,780
Look amongst the pasta and
vinegar, always towards the back.

538
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:34,910
Leave no stone unturned.

539
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,285
There's booze stashed somewhere.

540
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:42,252
Oh, shit. How you go about it?

541
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:43,555
Oh, shit!

542
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:49,232
It's hammer time.

543
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,099
While both boys and
girls enjoy getting down,

544
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,401
boys, being more goal-oriented,

545
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:57,670
tend to take a more militaristic
approach to nightlife.

546
00:25:57,743 --> 00:26:01,235
Once situated, boys
will go into recon mode.

547
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,513
Oh, my God.

548
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:43,146
Subdued by a fire marshal.
It got really crazy.

549
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:45,349
But it's way better. Okay.

550
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:52,957
Check it out, man.

551
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:54,555
I see them.

552
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:56,567
Earlier on, Brittany and Tiffany

553
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,035
said they wanted to hang
out with their friends.

554
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:02,835
But look. These clothes are
not comfortable or practical.

555
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:05,741
If they met a guy they
liked, it would be on.

556
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,711
But what do girls like?

557
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:10,339
Girls like tall, handsome guys.

558
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:14,909
And girls like rich guys
who buy them things.

559
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:17,080
And guys who can dance.

560
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:19,646
Sadly, rich handsome
model types who can dance

561
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,626
make up only 3% of the male population.

562
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,754
So girls are forced to learn
to appreciate other qualities,

563
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:27,162
like humor.

564
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:29,598
What's got two thumbs
and loves blowjobs?

565
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:36,899
Excuse me, but you're
standing on my cock.

566
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,771
But even if you're not funny,
handsome or rich, don't panic.

567
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,341
Dancing is easier than it's ever been.

568
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:55,626
And drinks are cheaper than ever.

569
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:03,392
And right now, Guide scientists
are testing a technique

570
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:07,404
called the "shoe gazer
make-over system."

571
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,633
So, anyway, what you got here?

572
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,200
Let's figure with the shoes.

573
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:14,939
Now we go something with...

574
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,072
You can wear anything with the checkers.

575
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:18,776
Something cute like this.

576
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,614
It's even a little more hip
if you can add something like this

577
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,621
'cause it doesn't match and that's cool.

578
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:25,623
Let's see what it's all about.

579
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:27,283
How is it going?

580
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:31,991
Okay.

581
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,329
And Daniel needs all
the help he can get.

582
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:49,910
What we're wanting to
do today with Daniel,

583
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:53,076
is to give him some of
that Hollywood pizzazz.

584
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:56,611
Hurry up, you faggots.

585
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,884
First. Hair.

586
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:04,354
Wrist bands.

587
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:07,455
And finally, tattoos.

588
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:13,603
Pants, very tight.

589
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:15,503
The pants are squishing my balls.

590
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:17,041
That's good. Good.

591
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,704
And the T-shirt.
Something old, punk metal.

592
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,509
That's cool.

593
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:28,076
Obscure brand names also work
as well as do the plain odd shirts.

594
00:29:28,153 --> 00:29:30,678
And for your tattoo we're
going with "Fuck my bush",

595
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,690
the title of the book you're writing.

596
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:33,918
I'm not writing a book.

597
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:36,187
You are now. Does it hurt enough?

598
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,456
And some nautical stars for punk rock.

599
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,395
Nautical stars.

600
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,659
That's punk rock.

601
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,428
One more thing.

602
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:48,863
He looks hot.

603
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,066
Dope.

604
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:55,205
Ooh, hey! Is that a bass?

605
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,840
Yeah, we just finished the show
at the Viper room.

606
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,440
What band?

607
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:00,849
The Bleeding Chest Wounds.

608
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,353
You can watch us practice some time.

609
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:05,322
I'll bring some beers.

610
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,996
Unlike boys, when a
girl is out to get down,

611
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:15,431
often all she needs to do is show up.

612
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,936
This is because girls possess
what is known as "pussy power."

613
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:21,370
And all she has to do
is give the signal.

614
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,305
The signal is given very quickly.

615
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,277
Too long, and it smacks of
desperation and loses its potency.

616
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:31,577
But beware. Boys will sometimes
see the signal when none was given.

617
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,777
I love your shoes.
Where did you get them?

618
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:35,114
Gucci.

619
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:37,052
I love Gucci.

620
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:40,091
Have you been to the
Gucci store in Vegas?

621
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:46,127
So, a good defensive game is
imperative for a fun night out.

622
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:48,029
She does?

623
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,035
I love strip, Charlie.

624
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,196
I wanted to be a stripper at one time.

625
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:57,105
They wouldn't take me.
I needed new boobs or something.

626
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:59,109
He was just being friendly.

627
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:01,873
In fact, friendship was
the last thing on his mind.

628
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,916
But it doesn't stop here.
Some boys will offer drinks.

629
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:07,076
Others will clown around.

630
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:10,246
Those with less imagination
will simply stand nearby

631
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:12,017
and try to catch her eye.

632
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,991
Rings are good for warding
off unwanted advances.

633
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,119
Can you see I'm engaged?

634
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:18,457
All right.

635
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,361
As are girlfriends.

636
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:22,662
How is it going? Can I buy you a drink?

637
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:24,725
No. I'm hanging out with my girlfriends.

638
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:29,331
And girlfriends work
even if they're not there.

639
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:31,034
Hey.

640
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:33,407
I'm hanging out with
my girlfriends tonight.

641
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:34,945
And if you don't have a ring,

642
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:37,106
you can always invent a fake boyfriend.

643
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:41,278
An excellent way to meet the guy
you are actually interested in.

644
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:43,753
Hola, belleza. You are so fine.

645
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:46,086
Honey, what's taking
these drinks so long?

646
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:49,924
I mean, we've been waiting
here forever. I'm so thirsty.

647
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,360
I just can't...

648
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:53,829
Honey, hi. You forget
you have a girlfriend?

649
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:57,426
You can't keep it in your pants
for two minutes while I take a piss?

650
00:31:57,502 --> 00:32:00,096
You can have her. Puta.

651
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,871
After getting to know each other
a little, comes the crucial moment

652
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:05,671
where the differences between
boys and girls are evident.

653
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:08,975
Bro, check out Greg.

654
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:10,912
The boys are pleased for their comrade.

655
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:12,381
That's cool.

656
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,577
But he was driving.
How am I supposed to get home?

657
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:16,621
You'll have to walk.

658
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:18,053
Fuck. My heart pills.

659
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,488
Your what?

660
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:21,287
My medicine. I left it in the car.

661
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,385
Suck it up, bro. She's going with him.

662
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:28,899
Greg doesn't want to risk leaving Rebecca
alone in case she changes her mind.

663
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:32,733
He guides her to the car without
saying goodbye to his friends.

664
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,936
The girls however have a
completely different ethos.

665
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:08,666
Like the marines, no one is left behind.

666
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,006
This is your car?

667
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,274
Yeah. Be careful.

668
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,120
Mmm! Get in, baby.

669
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:29,357
I bumped my head.

670
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,088
Where are you going?

671
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:35,030
Rebecca? You're drunk.

672
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,465
We'll take you home.

673
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:38,866
Actually, I was gonna drive her home.

674
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:42,703
That's nice, but we don't even know you.
We can't let her leave with you.

675
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:45,167
- But I want to.
- No, you don't.

676
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:46,403
Yes, she does.

677
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:48,912
Leave me alone, you jealous bitches.

678
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,416
Shut up! Rebecca, bring your ass.
Get out of the car.

679
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,281
Baby!

680
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:56,377
Ow!

681
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,089
You're an asshole.

682
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,025
You are lucky we didn't call the cops.

683
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,960
I'm on Myspace!

684
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,589
Fuck.

685
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:12,068
We talked earlier about
how girls have control,

686
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,367
and touched on
the subject of pussy power.

687
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,236
But what exactly is it?

688
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:19,573
Pussy power is a natural force
that, when wielded skillfully,

689
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:22,078
can turn any situation
to a girl's advantage.

690
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:25,116
Women have relied upon it
since the dawn of time.

691
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:29,085
For thousands of years employment
options for women have been limited.

692
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,816
Even today it's not
an even playing field.

693
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,758
So women have had to figure out other
methods of getting the things they want.

694
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:38,694
Young girls learn how to
use it from an early age.

695
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:43,029
An experienced woman can gain the
upper hand in almost any situation

696
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,535
involving heterosexual men.

697
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,037
She is coming along nicely.

698
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:54,009
You don't have to be
ridiculously hot, but it helps.

699
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:57,774
Ma'am, do you know
why I pulled you over?

700
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,443
You made an illegal left turn
from the right hand lane

701
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:02,986
back at Third and Alameda.

702
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:04,715
It was a safe turn.

703
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:06,586
Actually, it was a really safe turn.

704
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,956
I have to say I don't
see those every day.

705
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,689
I'll give this to you.
If you ever have any problem,

706
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:14,027
just give me a call.
My number's on the back.

707
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,760
Thank you, Officer.

708
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:20,867
I know. You want a drink?

709
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:22,167
Yeah.

710
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:25,799
Champagne. Now.

711
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:28,175
I will get you champagne now.

712
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,250
And the genius of it is...

713
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,843
Good. You can go now.

714
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,514
...she never actually has
to give out the pussy.

715
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:44,020
This is now the ladies' bathroom.

716
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,063
Ladies' bathroom.

717
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,830
Dude, ladies' bathroom.

718
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:53,337
But if she should decide
she wants to go home with someone...

719
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,038
None of you.

720
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,010
One more thing about pussy power:

721
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,742
It only works in certain situations.

722
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:08,377
Excuse me. We're dancing at Bazonga's
in ten minutes. Do you mind if we...

723
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:11,013
We have all got places to be, okay?

724
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,954
You gonna have to wait your turn.

725
00:36:17,128 --> 00:36:18,595
Can you believe her?

726
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:21,325
That bitch thought she
was hot, but she was not.

727
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,765
I don't know who's
gonna pay her to dance.

728
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:26,367
Let's go.

729
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:28,429
And while we are on the subject:

730
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:31,304
Girls, if you ever want
to simply go out and dance,

731
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:33,742
then a gay club is
definitely the way to go.

732
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,905
Lots of hot, well-dressed guys

733
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,574
who know how to have fun
and won't hassle you.

734
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,278
But be warned. There's
a certain breed of guy

735
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:44,617
who's not gay, but will
pretend to be just to get laid.

736
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,685
The logic is sound. Meet John.

737
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:53,128
By day he's a hetero
construction worker.

738
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:57,965
By night he goes by Mario and
he's a fake homosexual or fauxmo.

739
00:36:58,036 --> 00:36:59,663
Where'd you get that rack?

740
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:02,535
I just got 'em done! Aren't they great?

741
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:03,767
Yeah!

742
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:05,537
I had big boobs to begin with.

743
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,104
That's why they feel so soft,
because my natural boobs are on top.

744
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:12,081
You can touch 'em if you want.

745
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,486
They're kinda hard.

746
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,783
Here. Let me feel.

747
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,021
Hm.

748
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:29,764
Mm-hm.

749
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,837
Yeah. They feel pretty real.

750
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,963
Under the muscle?

751
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,234
Yeah! How did you know?

752
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:40,277
I'm a designer. I deal
with models all the time.

753
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,575
You're a designer?

754
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:44,672
You should come to my studio some time.

755
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:46,717
I would love to make you a dress.

756
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:48,615
So you're a designer, huh?

757
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:49,846
Yeah, whatever.

758
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,253
To what school did you go?

759
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:54,951
What boutiques do you sell to?

760
00:37:55,026 --> 00:37:57,620
Listen, you little faggot.
You better back the fuck off

761
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,890
or I'm gonna whoop your ass.

762
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:05,795
My God, I love this song!

763
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,064
Come dance with me.

764
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,537
Okay.

765
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:17,210
Oh, my God, you're so cute!

766
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:20,308
I can't believe that you're gay.

767
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:24,378
I hate L.A.
All the cute guys are gay.

768
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,557
So, you've never been
with a girl before?

769
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:30,719
No way, man.

770
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:32,820
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love girls, but...

771
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,422
they just don't do it for me.

772
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,491
How do you know until you try?

773
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:40,970
Look, dude, I like balls.

774
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,438
What can I say?

775
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:47,740
Are you trying to tell me that this body

776
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,507
does not make you hot?

777
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,119
Honey, I could give you a blowjob
better than any other guy in this bar.

778
00:38:57,188 --> 00:39:00,351
Look, Angie,

779
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:04,794
you're a beautiful,
sweet, intelligent girl.

780
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:08,263
But I'm a guy. I like guys.

781
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,598
Listen, why don't we
just go to my house

782
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:15,969
and if you feel uncomfortable
at all, I'll stop.

783
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,201
Promise.

784
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,276
Okay.

785
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:25,748
I'll just go close out my tab.
I'll be right back.

786
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:28,718
Mario seems to be getting
somewhere with this technique.

787
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:30,617
But it can prove problematic.

788
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:34,419
Whoa, whoa! Dude, what are
you doing? This taxi is taken!

789
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,619
Oh, no. Mario, this is a friend of mine.

790
00:39:36,694 --> 00:39:38,821
This is Brutus. He's coming with us.

791
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:42,889
That's right, Mario.
Ooh, we're gonna eat you up.

792
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,333
Don't worry. It'll be fun!

793
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:49,529
Drugs are an important
part of getting down.

794
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:52,269
Drugs can be divided
into two main groups.

795
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,867
Sketchy and fun.

796
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,243
Sketchy drugs are the ones
that will dominate

797
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,874
and mess up your life
and your complexion.

798
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,909
Fun drugs are those that are used
recreationally to have a bit of fun.

799
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:08,619
Sketchy drugs include speed, heroin,
crack, and cocaine when it's smoked.

800
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:11,890
Sketchy drugs should be avoided
at all cost by any boy or girl

801
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:14,193
who wants to get down.

802
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:17,393
Fun drugs include weed,
ecstasy, and cocaine.

803
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:19,402
These drugs are basically harmless,

804
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,335
and some will argue good for you.

805
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:23,374
Moderation being the key.

806
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:25,272
But where do drugs come from?

807
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,868
Buying drugs off the street
is asking for trouble.

808
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:31,039
In this experiment, the Guide
sent four lab assistants downtown

809
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:32,707
to purchase some drugs.

810
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:34,775
Do you know where I could buy some weed?

811
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,376
No, man, I don't fucking know.

812
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,081
Fuck out of my face, man.

813
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:42,593
Okay. All right. Thank you.

814
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,458
Excuse me. You guys know
where I could buy some weed?

815
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,895
You know, the chronic.

816
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:48,431
Yeah, what you want?

817
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:50,660
I actually, I have 50.
Is that enough?

818
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:53,568
Oh, hey, I got some good shit.

819
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,128
My name's Dillon by the way.

820
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:57,037
Jason bought some weed.

821
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:58,939
All right. Thank you.

822
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,308
Whenever you see drugs
heavily wrapped in saran,

823
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:04,542
it's because the people selling it
to you don't want to be around

824
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:06,378
when you finally manage to open it.

825
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:09,511
Marijuana?
No, marinada.

826
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:12,181
Rajeev tried to buy some coke.

827
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:14,986
I'm looking for some cocaine.

828
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,754
I got you, man. You got some money?

829
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:19,729
Yeah, I've got $50.

830
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:22,095
Gimme the money. I'll be right back.

831
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,656
All right. I got you.

832
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:26,465
Thank you so much.

833
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,868
Most troubling was Alex's adventure.

834
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:39,940
He was arrested and is now in a
holding cell at the Rampart's Division.

835
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:42,247
The details are still a little unclear.

836
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,981
Rajeev's persistence paid off.

837
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:46,353
And he was finally able
to purchase some cocaine.

838
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:49,291
I will be inhaling the narcotic now.

839
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:53,328
Our scientists here at
the Boys and Girls Guide

840
00:41:53,397 --> 00:41:55,627
did some tests on this coke.

841
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,262
And it turned out to be 60%
foot powder, 40% baking soda.

842
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,499
For the same $40, Rajeev could've bought

843
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:04,666
this much foot powder and baking soda.

844
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:06,039
Nicely done.

845
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,305
The baggie was not a good value.

846
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:10,745
The point is that in order to get down,

847
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,251
you will need to find your own drug
dealer who will come to your home.

848
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:16,684
But drug dealers are
not like regular people.

849
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:19,279
The first thing you will
notice about a drug dealer

850
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:23,691
is that he always has the best shit
that hasn't been stepped on.

851
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:25,023
A1 butter.

852
00:42:25,096 --> 00:42:27,223
Just the real motherfuckin' deal.

853
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:29,596
It's the shit that makes
the president go "hm".

854
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,965
It's what you better can fuck with.

855
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:36,598
You won't wanna fuck with nobody
else. Don't fuck with my car.

856
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:39,438
Come check me, you're gonna
get that O.G. Kush.

857
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,035
It's the one hit wonder all the way
from my hippies in Arcadia.

858
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:44,013
I'm telling you, it's
the only way to go.

859
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:46,709
You could smoke that stress
and give you a headache.

860
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:49,981
You won't be able to kick the girls
off in the club smoking that shit.

861
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:52,579
That's what I call a tupperware party.

862
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:55,785
These shrooms are great,
and they will get you fucked up.

863
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,351
It's pure MDMA from Amsterdam.

864
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:00,727
You know, you may be
able to get it cheaper,

865
00:43:00,798 --> 00:43:02,732
but you won't be able to get it better.

866
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,597
This one comes straight from Peru.

867
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:06,398
Doesn't have any withdrawal.

868
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,802
You will enjoy the sex.
You will be sleeping.

869
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,670
At the end of the day you wanna sleep.

870
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:13,938
You have a good time and you
wanna sleep. How much you wanted?

871
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:18,675
It's pointless to ask the drug dealer
about the quality of the merchandise,

872
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:20,910
because until the FDA gets involved

873
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:23,613
you are just going to have
to take his word for it.

874
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:27,681
And finally, drug dealers
have their own way of talking.

875
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:31,751
A kind of code. Drugs are
referred to as T-shirts

876
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:34,798
or CDs, things.

877
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:36,458
How many T-shirts?

878
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:39,526
An eight ball. Uh,
three and a half T-shirts.

879
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:42,129
Yeah, all right.

880
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,605
You remember where it is?

881
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:45,335
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

882
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,105
The second thing that you
notice about drug dealers

883
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,376
is that their concept of time
is different from regular people.

884
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:54,509
Note the correlation between
drug dealer time and human time.

885
00:43:54,585 --> 00:43:58,612
If he says he'll be there in half an hour,
it really means an hour and a half.

886
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:02,989
Where he is?
Still wait. I'm not calling.

887
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:08,599
This is fuckin' bullshit, bro.

888
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:15,368
Dude, you know, when he gets here,
you have to wait in the bathroom.

889
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:18,237
What? That's fuckin' bullshit, bro.

890
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:20,038
It's how it's done.

891
00:44:21,646 --> 00:44:23,341
I don't have any money.

892
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,972
That explains the outfit.

893
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:26,846
I'll make it up to you.

894
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,884
Hey, hey! Just checking up.

895
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,753
Just wanted to make sure, you know...

896
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:35,621
I told ya I'll be there in 10 minutes.

897
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:38,184
This is bullshit!
I'm gonna call my other guy.

898
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:40,594
You got another guy?

899
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:41,927
No.

900
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:43,626
You should call him.

901
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,721
Dude, we're not calling him again.

902
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:49,962
Maybe he forgot.

903
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:52,095
Dude, I know him. He's a professional.

904
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:53,332
He's late.

905
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:55,340
We're not calling.

906
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:58,343
I'm gonna call him.

907
00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:03,549
All has been forwarded to
an automatic voice message.

908
00:45:03,616 --> 00:45:05,208
Voice mail.

909
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,348
It's Hector.

910
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:15,823
Thank you, Hector.

911
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,355
All right. I appreciate it.

912
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:25,705
Dude, it's so fucking humiliating.

913
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:29,003
Oh, shit. What a nice score!

914
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:31,270
With enough time for a last call.

915
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:32,936
Let's make it happen.

916
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,081
Once you have a dealer
who you are comfortable with,

917
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,175
the more you buy,
the better price you get.

918
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:42,779
So pretty soon you can hook up your
friends and get your drugs for free.

919
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:45,984
But at this point you're in danger
of turning into a mini drug dealer,

920
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:49,187
so be careful. If travelling,
keep your stash in the glove box.

921
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:51,890
The police need a warrant to
search it. If you are pulled over,

922
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,593
and they ask to look around the vehicle...

923
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,192
Do you mind if we take a
look around the vehicle?

924
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:07,078
Knock yourselves out.

925
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:09,047
...it's right off to the cops
at your own risk.

926
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:10,844
Is that weed I smell?

927
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:13,715
Smells like probable cause to me.

928
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:14,879
Put your hands on the back.

929
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:17,718
Come on, man. This is bullshit.

930
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,816
You guys got nothing better
to do, man?

931
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:21,383
Come on, let's go.

932
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,157
At the end of the day,
they make all the rules.

933
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:33,932
Yo, smoke some weed.

934
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:36,805
I got some Hungarian
made chronic.

935
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:39,276
Dude, they all smoke break.

936
00:46:39,345 --> 00:46:41,176
Oh, shit.

937
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:44,273
Hey, let's go smoke some herb.

938
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,178
Weed is an important
part of getting down

939
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:50,313
and retaining your sanity in big cities.

940
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,826
Not quite as much fun as alcohol,
but it doesn't give you a hangover.

941
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:56,919
It's such a benign substance
that doctors prescribe it,

942
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:58,827
and yet curiously it's illegal.

943
00:46:58,898 --> 00:47:02,334
Right now, weed is cheap,
good, and easy to get.

944
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,029
So let's hope it stays illegal.

945
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:06,664
There are really only two types of weed.

946
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:09,902
Dirt weed or shake. And skunk weed,

947
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:14,777
also known as kind bud, chronic,
and the good shit among other things.

948
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:17,976
Dirt weed is cheaper and
full of twigs and seeds,

949
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:20,281
lacking in potent hairy buds.

950
00:47:20,353 --> 00:47:22,116
Just because it's not as strong,

951
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:24,554
it doesn't mean it's without merit.

952
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:27,354
Dirt weed is great for in the mornings.

953
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:33,096
Or at work.

954
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:36,863
Skunk weed is the pungent, sticky
buds that get you super high.

955
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:39,963
Good for traffic jams,

956
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:43,099
and it can make any food
taste like a gourmet feast.

957
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:49,247
The government will tell you
that years of smoking weed

958
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:51,681
will make you stupid. This is incorrect.

959
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:55,050
Every time you smoke weed,
you will become more stupid

960
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:57,351
if only temporarily.

961
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:02,518
Don't think for a second that
if you get stoned at the party

962
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:03,994
you will be witty and clever.

963
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:05,860
I love getting iry.

964
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,331
What?

965
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,198
I used to smoke weed
with L. Ron Hubbard.

966
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,465
And remember Guide tip number two:

967
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:17,203
Don't smoke weed
if you are already drunk.

968
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,371
She's a happy drunk,
and she loves getting stoned.

969
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:24,212
But mixed together she gets the spins.

970
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:28,482
Weed is superb for hangovers,
stress, or any kind of nausea.

971
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:32,457
It's also very effective against
feminine abdominal issues.

972
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:34,686
Weed can be ingested
in a number of ways.

973
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:36,388
Most common is the joint.

974
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:38,657
Joints are constructed thus.

975
00:48:38,731 --> 00:48:44,067
First, you sprinkle the weed
throughout the length, like so.

976
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:47,629
And if you don't want
a pregnant one, you use your finger.

977
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:52,701
Then, you gently pinch
the tips with your fingers.

978
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,805
And roll the shaft with your thumbs.

979
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,647
Not too tight,

980
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:02,051
or it'll be hard to suck.

981
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:03,918
You lick it...

982
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,784
you stick it, and that's how I roll.

983
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:12,024
Look at it. Magnificent.

984
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:14,032
Fantastic.

985
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,034
And now you smoke.

986
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,415
This bikini is too tight.

987
00:49:31,484 --> 00:49:34,749
Mine, too. It's so scratchy.

988
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:36,584
Let's switch.

989
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:40,755
Joints turn weed into a social drug

990
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:43,125
because they are often passed around.

991
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:47,064
But there are strict rules
about passing joints.

992
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:50,728
Whoever's weed it is, can
smoke as much as he or she likes

993
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:52,862
before passing.

994
00:49:52,939 --> 00:49:54,702
We'll know about
puff-puff-give.

995
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:57,368
It's not puff-chat,
chat-puff-give.

996
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:59,968
Tell your story when you're
not holding the joint.

997
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:01,343
What the fuck?

998
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:03,939
Look, man, don't
baby-sit the shit, okay?

999
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:05,951
I wasn't done with that.

1000
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,247
You're done now.

1001
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,185
And it's bad manners to kill it

1002
00:50:09,255 --> 00:50:11,951
if there are still people
waiting for their first hit.

1003
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:15,256
I suppose you smoke this, Tinkerbell.

1004
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:27,566
You're a cool ass, chick.

1005
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,040
Advanced stoners employ a technique

1006
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:32,509
known as "the go between."

1007
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:38,510
Without question, the most effective
way to smoke your weed is with a bong.

1008
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:42,452
The water filters out most of the
tar and it cools the smoke down.

1009
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:46,925
The brochure that came with this bong
says it removes 80% of the tar.

1010
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:48,585
That sounded high,

1011
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:51,027
so we ran our own tests.

1012
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:53,930
Go ahead. What's gonna happen?
Is it gonna be soft?

1013
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,695
This is good. You ready?

1014
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:59,499
Give me a break. God, Jesus! Bro!

1015
00:50:59,572 --> 00:51:01,597
I have a hole in my hand!

1016
00:51:01,674 --> 00:51:03,938
But the results were inconclusive.

1017
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,069
Now you're ready to face the day,

1018
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:08,773
no matter how stressful your job.

1019
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:21,216
After a few drinks,
the boys are getting antsy

1020
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:23,319
and want to purchase some cocaine.

1021
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:28,095
It's always advisable to figure out
your drug requirements ahead of time.

1022
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:31,762
You get a better deal, it's safer,
and you can prep your poison properly.

1023
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,965
But sometimes it's not possible.

1024
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,031
When buying drugs at a bar or a club,

1025
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,577
it's important to remember
certain guidelines.

1026
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:42,375
You see the mistake here.
Too conspicuous.

1027
00:51:42,448 --> 00:51:47,385
Now, let's try it again, but this time
Tony already has the money together.

1028
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:49,921
Once you've acquired your cocaine,

1029
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:52,719
the next thing to remember
is to have some fun.

1030
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,783
Chop it up as fine as you can,

1031
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,389
because to get the desired effect,
it has to get into the blood stream.

1032
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:04,266
Larger lumps simply dissolve in
mucus and drip down your throat.

1033
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:07,704
Finer powder is absorbed
through the nasal membranes.

1034
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:09,401
It's all about the surface area.

1035
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,943
The finer powder has more surface area.

1036
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:13,911
Let's go back to the lab.

1037
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,813
In one tank the mice are
offered food and alcohol.

1038
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,714
The other tank is identical,

1039
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:21,686
except our scientists add a
solution of cocaine hydrochloride.

1040
00:52:21,754 --> 00:52:23,813
Look at the behavior of the coke mice.

1041
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,825
Alternating between the stash,
the vodka, and the wheel

1042
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,293
they have no interest
in the nearby food.

1043
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:33,162
Watch what happens when we introduce
a mouse on cocaine into the other tank.

1044
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:36,724
Some of the mice are crashed out, but
note how the mice that are still up

1045
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:39,966
can sense that he has
been taking cocaine.

1046
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,135
See how they gather around him, as if
they are trying to get something from him.

1047
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,235
Two valuable lessons are learned here.

1048
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:49,839
If you're going to drink all night,
cocaine will balance out the alcohol.

1049
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,181
You won't get so drunk, and you
will be able to party till dawn.

1050
00:52:53,252 --> 00:52:57,120
Secondly, others can sense when you
have cocaine, and will pester you for it.

1051
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,626
Watch what happens here.
Tony has just hooked up a 40 bag.

1052
00:53:00,693 --> 00:53:04,151
And now he's talking to Brittany,
a girl he has just met.

1053
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,061
Why? You got some?

1054
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:10,229
He hesitates, but
he's already committed.

1055
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:11,736
Here you go.

1056
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:13,294
Thanks!

1057
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:25,775
I need to tell you about Jennifer.

1058
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:27,820
She fucked last night.

1059
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:31,152
Are you serious? You're kidding me!

1060
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:32,555
Hey, you want some?

1061
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,024
Sure.

1062
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:35,458
How funny was that?

1063
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:37,120
Hush.

1064
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:38,959
She's such a whore.

1065
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,589
I know.

1066
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,759
Bryan wasn't in. I heard it first hand.

1067
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:45,395
You really should.
You really, really should.

1068
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:48,099
What do you want?
Another one? Come, girl.

1069
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:50,668
Here you go.

1070
00:53:50,743 --> 00:53:52,836
I'm pretty good. My face is numb.

1071
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:53,970
Okay.

1072
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:58,444
Hey.

1073
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:00,418
You got the rest of my shit?

1074
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:03,751
Yeah. There was, like,
hardly anything in there.

1075
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,848
Or she might say something like...

1076
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:08,621
Hey.

1077
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:10,457
You got the rest of my shit?

1078
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,522
There must've been a hole
or something in the bag.

1079
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,126
Sometimes it's an honest mistake.

1080
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:20,195
Sometimes it's just inexperience.

1081
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,865
I don't really feel so good.

1082
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:24,466
Sometimes it's malicious.

1083
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:26,978
And sometimes it's just playing stupid.

1084
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:28,104
Oh!

1085
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,772
Did I get any?

1086
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,874
Blow in. Not out, bitch.

1087
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:37,048
But a point to remember is that a fool
and his baggie are soon separated.

1088
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:39,614
Let's start over again.

1089
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:43,219
Yeah, I love it. Why? You got some?

1090
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:47,994
Yeah. Just follow me.

1091
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:52,265
It's fun ducking into a bathroom
or a storeroom for a toot,

1092
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:54,829
but it's not always practical.

1093
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:58,866
The advanced partier will often use
a technique known as "the guest bindle"

1094
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:01,277
to defend against moochers.

1095
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:04,040
Hey, hey, you got a bump?

1096
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:07,313
The guest bindle is a
paper fold constructed thus.

1097
00:55:07,386 --> 00:55:09,354
Once constructed, a good rule of thumb

1098
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:12,550
is to put a fifth of the amount
you have in the guest bindle.

1099
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,855
You must choose glossy magazine paper.

1100
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:17,020
Not too flimsy or it will tear.

1101
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:20,998
Other types of paper like photocopy
or newspaper are unsuitable

1102
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,001
because they are too porous.

1103
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,664
On one side we use a bindle
made from glossy magazine paper...

1104
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:30,539
and on the other side a bindle
made from regular photocopy paper.

1105
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,436
Moisture is cocaine's mortal enemy.

1106
00:55:34,513 --> 00:55:38,210
As you can see, the coke in
the photocopy paper is ruined.

1107
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:41,185
The wet cocaine is
not completely useless.

1108
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:45,121
It can be dried by microwaving it
in ten-second increments.

1109
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:48,592
But use this technique only
if absolutely necessary.

1110
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:51,323
Any time cocaine gets near a microwave,

1111
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:55,595
you're just a dab of baking soda
away from becoming a crackhead.

1112
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,064
The coke in the glossy bindle
is safe and dry.

1113
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:05,236
But we digress. Let's watch
the guest bindle in action.

1114
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,405
Peter hands off the guest
bindle without trepidation.

1115
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:11,780
He gets to look like
a generous rock star...

1116
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:13,910
and he knows he has
plenty left for later.

1117
00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:18,855
Meanwhile, back at the house party
things are coming to a close.

1118
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:23,520
You know you've done something right
when the cops break up the party.

1119
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:26,497
Oh, man, who the fuck
invited the cops, man?

1120
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:29,966
That's bullshit. Hey, man,
the fucking cops is here!

1121
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:33,836
They will show up, so be ready for them.

1122
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,373
Is this supposed to be funny?

1123
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:37,671
Yes.

1124
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:41,110
Man, I don't give a fuck about
these cops. They can suck my dick.

1125
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,810
That's some gay shit.
I'm trying to get that gay shit.

1126
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:48,752
Are you sure you don't wanna
come to this other party with me?

1127
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,550
No, I'm just gonna go with him.

1128
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:52,454
I don't wanna be left alone.

1129
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,686
Just go with the other one. He's cute.

1130
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,924
I'm so fucked up. I just wanna
go home and get some dick.

1131
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,593
Hey, Officer. If I fall down, will you
draw a chalk outline around me?

1132
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:04,363
Walk on.

1133
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:07,497
Hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh.

1134
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,608
See ya. She's gonna
be all right with him?

1135
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:14,737
Yeah. He's Christian. He, like,
goes to a synagogue and shit.

1136
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,748
She could kick his ass anyway.

1137
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:20,217
Do we go to this other party?

1138
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:23,312
Here at the Guide we do not
condone drinking and driving.

1139
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,516
It should be avoided at all costs.

1140
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:27,024
Remember Oscar?

1141
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:33,888
At first he seems fine, but
notice the lack of coordination

1142
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:36,264
as he tries to round obstacles.

1143
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:40,738
His spatial awareness is diminished,
and reaction times are greatly reduced,

1144
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:44,572
leading to an accident and
possibly injuring the mouse.

1145
00:57:52,351 --> 00:57:54,546
Okay, guys, they're on their way down.

1146
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,951
10-4. We're all set.

1147
00:57:58,023 --> 00:58:00,856
DUI, you motherfuckers.
They're coming down.

1148
00:58:00,926 --> 00:58:03,121
Drinking and driving is no joke,

1149
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:05,390
but sometimes it's unavoidable.

1150
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:07,159
So, here are some tips.

1151
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,666
Plan your route.

1152
00:58:08,734 --> 00:58:10,827
Always check your lights twice.

1153
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:15,169
No lights at night is the number one
reason that cops pull drunk drivers over.

1154
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,972
Take side streets, and drive carefully.

1155
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:23,037
If you can, do your drinking
and driving during office hours.

1156
00:58:23,115 --> 00:58:26,050
Much less chance of being pulled over.

1157
00:58:27,787 --> 00:58:30,984
Certain behaviors are
sure to get you arrested.

1158
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:35,083
It's like a fuckin' video game, huh?

1159
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:37,561
Dude, what, are you fucked
up or something, man?

1160
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,621
Check that you are
wearing your seat belt.

1161
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:41,393
It's cool.

1162
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,368
Shut the fuck up, bro.
I need to concentrate.

1163
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:48,497
And that your passengers.

1164
00:58:48,574 --> 00:58:52,305
But if you are really too drunk,
then get someone else to drive.

1165
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:53,777
Because if you don't...

1166
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:56,974
Hide the fuckin' beer, dude.
Put the fucking beer...

1167
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:07,953
Come on, bro, let's go!

1168
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:10,052
Hang on.

1169
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,824
Oh, yeah.

1170
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:20,665
Dude, we can't both be to the side.

1171
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:26,273
Bars are fun, but eventually they close.

1172
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:29,576
Last call is a rallying cry
for kids who like to get down.

1173
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:32,640
There are decisions to be made
and strategies to formulate.

1174
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:36,176
And not much time. But
before you jump into anything,

1175
00:59:36,255 --> 00:59:39,088
remember the acceptability graph.

1176
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,559
This graph is based on a
phenomenon called "beer goggles"

1177
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:45,597
or "sider vicer" for the younger lush.

1178
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:47,723
The effects are startling.

1179
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,392
Marty?

1180
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:52,028
I gotta go. I'm house-sitting
at this kick-ass house.

1181
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:53,867
Whose place is it?

1182
00:59:53,939 --> 00:59:57,397
It's Mr. Belding's house.
"Saved by the Bell". He was the principal.

1183
00:59:57,476 --> 00:59:59,068
Let's go!

1184
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:01,738
Um, okay.

1185
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:04,647
Yeah, but just keep it
to the two of you guys.

1186
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,150
Maybe a couple of girls.

1187
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:10,484
But that is it.
It's gotta be small. Very small.

1188
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:16,520
You, uh, ladies interested in
going to a party up in the hills?

1189
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:17,755
Where?

1190
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,764
Mr. Belding's house.

1191
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:21,891
From "Saved by the Bell".

1192
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:24,197
Whatever. Are there gonna be drugs?

1193
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,794
Heaps of it.

1194
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:28,271
Who says it never snows in L.A.?

1195
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,604
There are always parties.

1196
01:00:30,676 --> 01:00:33,839
But sometimes, if you've met someone,
the smart play is ditching out.

1197
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:36,404
Yeah, let's go.

1198
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:38,074
How about your friend?

1199
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,983
Forget about her.
I don't really like the bitch.

1200
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:44,352
Let's go.

1201
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:48,291
Outside the bar is an excellent place
to figure out where the after party is.

1202
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,759
But it's not even 1:30.

1203
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:51,659
Have a good night.

1204
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:52,788
Fuck!

1205
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:54,059
What are we gonna do?

1206
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:55,828
Do you wanna come to the party tonight?

1207
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:56,993
Yeah, where is it?

1208
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,730
Hey, Eugene, where's that party?

1209
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:00,738
At 1548 Harcony.

1210
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,774
Let's go!

1211
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:06,877
Make sure you know where it is.

1212
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:09,880
It's important to remember
that when you get to the party,

1213
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:15,319
introduce yourself to the host.
And if you can, bring something.

1214
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:17,855
Booze, drugs, or at the very least

1215
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:21,450
make sure you show up
in a group with both boys and girls.

1216
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,495
Fuck! It's all dudes.

1217
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:26,998
Editing a party is a tough job,
but sometimes it just has to be done.

1218
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:31,002
Otherwise you are in danger
of having a "sausage party."

1219
01:01:44,616 --> 01:01:46,083
I'll take care of this.

1220
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,746
Go hide in the back
bedroom for one second.

1221
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:56,986
Uh, hey, everybody. I hate to
do this. I really hate to do this,

1222
01:01:57,062 --> 01:01:59,360
but I gotta get up, like,
super early in the morning.

1223
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:02,832
So I gotta start, like,
asking you guys to leave, okay?

1224
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:04,960
I hate to break it up. Sorry about that.

1225
01:02:05,037 --> 01:02:07,938
You guys have been cool.
Thanks a lot, man. Good to see you.

1226
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:11,738
I'm sorry. Terrible about it.
The neighbors and stuff.

1227
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,778
Uh, Marty, is it?

1228
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:16,212
Yeah. Sorry, guys.
It's just getting really late.

1229
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:17,771
I just wanted to say hi,

1230
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:21,581
and my friend Charlie wanted to say hi.

1231
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:24,883
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

1232
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:26,652
This is my friend Andy.

1233
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:32,493
But with all that said and done,

1234
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:34,896
it's time to get down and have some fun.

1235
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:37,162
The brutal truth about
coked up after parties

1236
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:39,136
is that they can be a little dull.

1237
01:02:39,204 --> 01:02:42,367
A bunch of kids sitting around
the mirror waiting for someone else

1238
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:43,840
to put out the next line.

1239
01:02:43,909 --> 01:02:46,070
Dude, I don't know what
the dizzle is here, man.

1240
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:48,010
We're getting freakin' shut out.

1241
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,275
I know, man. Dismissed.

1242
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,250
Fucking Stonewall Jackson.
What is this bullshit?

1243
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:56,810
Hey. That Asian keeps looking over here.

1244
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:58,880
- For real?
- She's into me.

1245
01:02:58,957 --> 01:03:02,017
Dude, check up that
fucking blondie right there.

1246
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:06,030
I'm part Asian, Cock-Asian. Aha.

1247
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:09,534
Look at that skirt. Look at that
fucking skirt. Bring that over.

1248
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:10,898
Bring that shit to me.

1249
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:12,766
Let's start our party here.

1250
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:16,137
It's fucking like an iceberg
up in this fucking mug here.

1251
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:26,882
How are you doing?

1252
01:03:26,952 --> 01:03:29,682
Hi.

1253
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,921
I'm Andy.

1254
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,423
Bryce.

1255
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:42,632
Just a few years ago
getting down after a night of partying

1256
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:44,498
would have been an extreme endeavour

1257
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,539
fraught with doubts about
the upcoming performance.

1258
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:49,267
You know I never do this, right?

1259
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:52,834
It's a hard fact that coke and ecstasy

1260
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:56,506
can not only affect the boy's ability
to achieve and maintain an erection,

1261
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,574
it can also shrink his manhood
to the slze of a tater top.

1262
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:01,619
It's okay, baby.

1263
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:03,382
We can do other things.

1264
01:04:03,455 --> 01:04:05,616
Give me a second.
I think it's getting hard.

1265
01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:10,591
Come on, little fella.

1266
01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:12,755
I'm bored.

1267
01:04:17,836 --> 01:04:19,895
I'm gonna watch some TV.

1268
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,436
Pushing rope is no fun for anyone.

1269
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:28,446
But nowadays we have a little blue pill

1270
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:32,848
that helps us through the flaccid
marshland and onto hard ground.

1271
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:36,149
See how Brittany breaks off
just a quarter of the pill.

1272
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,212
And while Tony is not looking,

1273
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:41,157
she crushes it into the
cocaine on the mirror.

1274
01:04:44,396 --> 01:04:46,296
Don't worry, big boy.

1275
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:49,163
Let's just shoot the rest
of these lines and hang out.

1276
01:04:50,302 --> 01:04:51,894
Here.

1277
01:04:56,775 --> 01:04:58,436
Don't be afraid, guys.

1278
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:01,138
Viagra is not just for
impotent men and geriatrics.

1279
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:03,044
Don't take the whole thing.

1280
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,640
They're not cheap, and you'll
be hard for the next two days.

1281
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:09,983
Just bite the nick off the corner half an hour
before you're ready to rock and roll.

1282
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:13,957
And once one figures out how to combine
ecstasy and Viagra in the same pill...

1283
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,328
If God took drugs,
this would be his favorite.

1284
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:23,459
You came already?

1285
01:05:23,535 --> 01:05:27,835
The only thing you need to worry about
are the warnings on the pill box.

1286
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:30,401
Oh, my chest.

1287
01:05:30,475 --> 01:05:33,239
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1288
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:34,677
Oh, shit.

1289
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:36,805
Brittany's heart was in the right place,

1290
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:40,511
but giving drugs to anyone without
their knowledge is definitely not cool.

1291
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:44,215
Tony is taking medication for
a hereditary cardiac condition.

1292
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:46,018
Fuck, my heart pills, man.

1293
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:47,422
Your what?

1294
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:49,221
My nitroglycerine. I left it in the car.

1295
01:05:49,294 --> 01:05:50,591
Suck it up, bro.

1296
01:05:50,662 --> 01:05:52,323
Oh, my God.

1297
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:55,525
Don't you worry, Miss.
Your boyfriend is gonna be just fine.

1298
01:05:55,601 --> 01:06:00,698
He's not my boyfriend. I just met
him tonight. I don't have a boyfriend.

1299
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:02,239
Oh, what a shame.

1300
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:04,605
You're so funny.
We should hang out some time.

1301
01:06:04,676 --> 01:06:06,007
Sure!

1302
01:06:06,078 --> 01:06:08,410
Take my number.

1303
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,108
5552...

1304
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:13,913
Poor Tony. But knowing
he has a heart condition,

1305
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:17,922
playing around with cocaine wasn't the
smartest thing to do in the first place.

1306
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,391
There are certain people you
want to avoid at after parties.

1307
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,451
The most common is the talker.

1308
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:26,861
Some people go to church, like, four
days a week or like scientologists.

1309
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:30,163
They're like totally crazy, like.

1310
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:31,896
Who really cares about oil?

1311
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:35,963
I mean, you just need it
for cars and stuff.

1312
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,704
We've all heard of coke whores.
These are coke bores.

1313
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,269
Like I like kittens and puppies and...

1314
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:44,076
Oh, my God!

1315
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:48,985
Dude, that's enough.

1316
01:06:50,355 --> 01:06:52,152
Oh, my... What the fuck?

1317
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:55,352
And, musicians, this is
not the time or the place

1318
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,895
to jam or debut your band's new CD.

1319
01:06:57,963 --> 01:07:00,056
Wait. Listen to this bit.

1320
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:04,761
And finally, the "is it any good" guy.

1321
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:06,167
What's up?

1322
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:08,604
How you doing? You want a bump?

1323
01:07:08,674 --> 01:07:10,665
Is it any good?

1324
01:07:10,742 --> 01:07:12,767
You'd fucking hate it, man.

1325
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:16,940
If someone is nice enough to offer
their drugs to you, don't be a dick.

1326
01:07:17,015 --> 01:07:19,006
I might not hate it.

1327
01:07:19,084 --> 01:07:23,020
To keep your after party fun,
have some activities arranged.

1328
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:24,783
Charades can be fun.

1329
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:27,916
But guys, especially macho guys,
are often reluctant.

1330
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:31,429
They will tattoo their knuckles,
and mouth off to the cops,

1331
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:34,431
but the sound... chills their spine.

1332
01:07:34,499 --> 01:07:36,126
God's spell.

1333
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:38,669
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

1334
01:07:38,737 --> 01:07:40,602
God, you're so good.

1335
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,936
Well done. You're up.

1336
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:48,308
I ain't doing it.

1337
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,848
Too gay.

1338
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,350
So have something a little
more manly available.

1339
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,883
Let's see.

1340
01:07:57,956 --> 01:07:59,287
All right. Here you go.

1341
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:00,916
Thank you.

1342
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:10,659
But do beware of the drunk guy.

1343
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:12,294
What is that, lipstick?

1344
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:14,498
No, lip gloss.

1345
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:16,302
Oh, my God.

1346
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,106
He's got to go.

1347
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:23,204
I do not know him.

1348
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:27,215
I really like your necklace.

1349
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:32,519
Dude, don't put it all out.
Save some for later.

1350
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:36,027
I don't give a fuck. It's just how I do.

1351
01:08:36,094 --> 01:08:39,552
Hey. Right, fellas? I'm good.

1352
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:41,826
Oh!

1353
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,839
You can microwave that.

1354
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,417
Board games rule,

1355
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:03,113
and it's easy to turn pretty much
any board game into an adult version.

1356
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:08,958
Take it off.

1357
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:10,426
That's right.

1358
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:13,830
Your pants.

1359
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,026
Oh. It's fucked up.

1360
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:20,594
Earlier on we talked about the difference
between fun drugs and sketchy drugs.

1361
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:23,904
Cocaine is a sketchy
drug when it is smoked...

1362
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:28,844
but also has the potential to affect a
small percentage of people in a sketchy way

1363
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,575
by turning them into fiends.

1364
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:32,514
You can always recognize a fiend.

1365
01:09:32,584 --> 01:09:35,553
They do not have their own drugs
because they've done them all.

1366
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,555
They cannot help but glance at
the mirror every 30 seconds.

1367
01:09:38,623 --> 01:09:42,115
They will scrape and scrape in between
lines to get a few extra crumbs.

1368
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:45,527
They will be calling drug dealers
at 10:30 the next morning.

1369
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,622
It's no fun being a fiend.

1370
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:51,396
But unlike the talker,
the fiend can be amusing.

1371
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,438
Are you from L.A.?

1372
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:54,733
Um...

1373
01:09:54,806 --> 01:09:57,331
Um, I grew up in New York.

1374
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:59,707
You doing the acting thing?

1375
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,246
Yeah. I've got, like,
all these offers and stuff.

1376
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:06,011
That's good.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1377
01:10:06,084 --> 01:10:10,111
Sometimes if the fiend is a girl, she'll
pretend to be into a boy just for the drugs.

1378
01:10:10,188 --> 01:10:12,588
I did a Fruit of the Loom commercial.

1379
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,022
Were you the grapes?

1380
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:17,619
I was the banana.
'Cause I'm yellow, you know.

1381
01:10:19,364 --> 01:10:22,094
This girl is known as a coke tease.

1382
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,158
Can I...?

1383
01:10:24,236 --> 01:10:27,501
If her boy feels that this is the case,
there's a simple test he can use

1384
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:30,234
known as the titty bump test.

1385
01:10:30,308 --> 01:10:32,503
Let me do it off your nipple.

1386
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:38,307
Implants are particularly
good for the titty bump test

1387
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:41,113
because of the angle of the dangle.

1388
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:43,017
Look at this graph.

1389
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:45,818
Notice how the drugs fall to
the floor on the natural breast.

1390
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,792
In this case, the girl should
lean back to avoid waste.

1391
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,328
The augmented breast is more pronounced,

1392
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:54,331
so the cocaine is able to get
good purchase on the nipple.

1393
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,130
The fake breast also lends a free
song of Vegas to the whole situation

1394
01:10:58,203 --> 01:11:01,969
which most kids agree is kind of fun.

1395
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,009
And the experienced titty bumper
can easily parley

1396
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:07,306
the titty bump test into a suckle.

1397
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:22,221
Even if the girl refuses,
the titty bump test rarely backfires.

1398
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:28,858
That guy just asked me to
do a line off my breast.

1399
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:31,061
What an asshole!

1400
01:11:31,136 --> 01:11:33,161
I'll go talk to him.
Let me talk to him.

1401
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:36,639
Can you believe that? It's so wrong.

1402
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,199
Yeah. Just do it.

1403
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:45,312
Did you just ask to do
a bump off of June's titty?

1404
01:11:45,383 --> 01:11:47,681
Yeah.

1405
01:11:47,752 --> 01:11:50,016
That takes a lot of
balls, man. Way to go.

1406
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:52,613
Between you and me,
that chick is a complete fiend.

1407
01:11:52,691 --> 01:11:54,955
She's always mooching coke.
Never buying it.

1408
01:11:55,026 --> 01:11:57,324
Tell me about it.
She left me, like, two lines, man.

1409
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:58,623
Do you wanna do one?

1410
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:01,029
Yeah. Can I do it off your titty?

1411
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,566
No, I'm fucking with you.

1412
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,496
But it's not all laughs and tomfoolery.

1413
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:11,239
Would you have unprotected
sex with this person?

1414
01:12:11,309 --> 01:12:14,073
Bad example. Uh, what about this person?

1415
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:18,411
For sharing a straw is
just like doing this.

1416
01:12:18,483 --> 01:12:20,417
A sobering thought.

1417
01:12:20,485 --> 01:12:24,080
And sobriety has its place in the
life of kids who want to get down.

1418
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:28,524
Mostly in the mornings
and some afternoons, too.

1419
01:12:28,593 --> 01:12:31,756
But it's almost impossible
to get down and be sober.

1420
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,196
So beware.

1421
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:35,493
You want a bump?

1422
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:37,899
No, I'm straight-edged. That's shit.

1423
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:41,132
What we need here is a bit of fun.

1424
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:45,165
Oh, it's a cop out. What are
you trying to escape from?

1425
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:47,370
Mostly you.

1426
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:50,141
What are you even doing here anyway?

1427
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,979
You know, I don't do coke, either.

1428
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:01,021
With all the fun you've been having,

1429
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:04,391
the time flies and it's soon 5:30 a.m.

1430
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:06,726
At about this time, some bright spark

1431
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:10,859
will start making plans for tomorrow
with their new best friends.

1432
01:13:10,935 --> 01:13:12,266
Let's go to Vegas.

1433
01:13:12,337 --> 01:13:13,429
Yeah.

1434
01:13:13,505 --> 01:13:14,836
For real, dudes.

1435
01:13:14,906 --> 01:13:16,430
Let's go get a pint.

1436
01:13:16,508 --> 01:13:18,601
You can agree to do any of these things

1437
01:13:18,677 --> 01:13:22,169
because everybody knows that there's
no way it will actually happen.

1438
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:25,614
It's more of a ritual
during which boys and girls

1439
01:13:25,684 --> 01:13:29,051
can pretend that the following day
is not a complete write off.

1440
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,487
We should all go play paint ball.

1441
01:13:32,557 --> 01:13:34,991
With morning approaching,
it's nearly time to go home

1442
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,393
with that special boy or girl
you've been flirting with all night.

1443
01:13:38,463 --> 01:13:43,162
They all left. And now
I don't have a ride home.

1444
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:45,464
I can probably give you a ride.

1445
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:49,997
Or they've already gone,
then with the best of whoever's left.

1446
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:53,476
First, why don't we,
uh, stop in my place?

1447
01:13:53,545 --> 01:13:55,706
Okay.

1448
01:13:57,482 --> 01:14:01,316
Guide tip number four:
Remember your sunglasses.

1449
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:15,990
Try not to hate the rest of the world
as it goes about its business.

1450
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:20,197
Remember, it's you who is the freak.

1451
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:28,707
# Sirens sounding out
Are we going to war #

1452
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:34,912
# A film of yesterday
On a broken down door #

1453
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:39,616
# Send me something real
To ignore or explore #

1454
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:44,060
# And I'll show you all
The things that I saw #

1455
01:14:46,197 --> 01:14:47,562
# Today #

1456
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:53,059
# The words don't mean
Enough for us to say #

1457
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:56,630
# For us to say #

1458
01:14:57,575 --> 01:14:58,974
# Today #

1459
01:15:00,411 --> 01:15:04,711
# To steal the moment
That we gave away #

1460
01:15:04,783 --> 01:15:07,343
# We gave away #

1461
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:10,277
# Gave it away #

1462
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,705
So, like, I'm a real
romantic kind of girl.

1463
01:15:37,782 --> 01:15:41,445
I love relationships. I love
when guys bring me roses.

1464
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:43,749
And candle-lit dinners.

1465
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:46,313
And also I love long walks.

1466
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:49,849
And I think the best part of our
relationship is good communication.

1467
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:52,260
Like, when you finish
to say your sentences.

1468
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,628
I mean, it's so cool,
'cause it's like two minds

1469
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:58,328
but you really are thinking
with one. What are you doing?

1470
01:15:58,403 --> 01:16:01,099
I guess there's only one way
to shut you up, isn't there?

1471
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:03,231
No, I mean...

1472
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:06,243
Anyways, I love when a guy picks me up

1473
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,144
and, like, he opens the door for me.

1474
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:15,016
I like showing. It just makes
you feel like such a classy lady.

1475
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:20,683
In an ideal world, you'll have a great
time getting down with your friend

1476
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:24,854
and will wake up the following morning
and swear undying love for each other.

1477
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:27,454
But sometimes it wasn't meant to be.

1478
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:29,159
I just woke up.

1479
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:32,203
I've got Run DMC in my bed.
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

1480
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,898
Oh, just... I don't know.

1481
01:16:34,973 --> 01:16:37,737
Tell him your mom's
coming over or something.

1482
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:39,299
I'll call you later. Bye-bye.

1483
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,208
Okay, bye.

1484
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:46,742
Hey.

1485
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:48,877
Watch out, L.L.

1486
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:50,887
Was gonna get the gold chain.

1487
01:16:50,955 --> 01:16:53,583
Uh, Joey, hey.

1488
01:16:53,658 --> 01:16:55,592
Hey, I just talked to my mom.

1489
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:59,255
She just called, and she's coming
to take me to breakfast in 10 minutes.

1490
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:01,696
I wanna sleep for like ten more minutes.

1491
01:17:01,766 --> 01:17:03,597
You go, eat a biscuit or somethin'.

1492
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:05,329
Oh, my God.

1493
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:07,871
Seriously, you gotta get up.

1494
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:10,703
Please. Please. Come on!

1495
01:17:10,775 --> 01:17:14,472
Look, c'mon, man! I'm trying
to sleep! Goddamn, I'm tired!

1496
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:17,810
I'm tired! Look at my face. I'm tired.

1497
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:20,350
Get the fuck out of my room.

1498
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:22,079
Goddamn!

1499
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:24,144
I asked you nicely to get out of my bed.

1500
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,747
Now, put your Santa suit on
and get the fuck out.

1501
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:29,884
What happened to morning
manners? That's bullshit.

1502
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:32,191
It's not bullshit.
That outfit's bullshit.

1503
01:17:32,263 --> 01:17:34,458
It's not, man. I'm getting out of here.

1504
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:37,763
You know what?
All you bitches are the same.

1505
01:17:37,835 --> 01:17:39,962
All act the same.
And you know what?

1506
01:17:40,038 --> 01:17:43,474
I didn't wanna say nothing,
but your house smells like cat shit.

1507
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:46,533
Smells like Garfield has
walked up in here and took a shit.

1508
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:48,943
My goddamn glasses.

1509
01:17:49,013 --> 01:17:51,743
You know what? One day
you'll be all by yourself.

1510
01:17:51,816 --> 01:17:53,613
Oh, God. Are you still talking?

1511
01:17:53,685 --> 01:17:57,519
You'll be sitting here and with all
the cats playing poker or whatever,

1512
01:17:57,588 --> 01:18:00,887
'cause you ain't got no goddamn
friends. And they'll be shitting,

1513
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:04,451
and you won't be seeing any 'cause
you're crazy and you'll have a great moha.

1514
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:06,292
Shut the fuck up!

1515
01:18:06,364 --> 01:18:08,958
Will you just shut the fuck up
and get out of my house?

1516
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:11,228
I'm out. I'm out of here.

1517
01:18:11,302 --> 01:18:14,738
Good. Get, go, scram, get out.
Get the fuck out!

1518
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:16,933
This is nasty. It is shit over here!

1519
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:20,102
You never shut up. You talk
and talk and talk and talk.

1520
01:18:20,178 --> 01:18:23,705
This is not sexy. You keep human
shit on the side of your bed?

1521
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:25,578
That's what it smells like.

1522
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:29,142
Did your cat used to be a man?
'Cause it smells like man shit in here.

1523
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,018
Just get out. Put your
fucking sneakers on and run.

1524
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,785
Get the fuck out!

1525
01:18:33,858 --> 01:18:36,258
You know what?
I'm gonna tell all my boys

1526
01:18:36,327 --> 01:18:40,457
that you have a Mohawk on
your pussy. You pussy Mohawk.

1527
01:18:40,531 --> 01:18:44,160
Bad planning on Kate's part has led
to a tense situation in the morning.

1528
01:18:44,669 --> 01:18:48,662
But look what happens if she had
laid the groundwork the night before.

1529
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,813
Uh. You can come in for a little bit.

1530
01:18:58,883 --> 01:19:01,351
Hang out, whatever.
But you can't stay the night,

1531
01:19:01,419 --> 01:19:04,047
because my mom's coming in the morning.

1532
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:06,352
If she sees you here, she'll freak out.

1533
01:19:06,424 --> 01:19:08,449
It's cool. That's all right.

1534
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:13,496
Oh, um, I'm not gonna fuck you.

1535
01:19:13,564 --> 01:19:15,429
I know.

1536
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:20,293
Oh, shit.

1537
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,409
Nobody likes a stranger in
their bed after a hard night out.

1538
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:29,071
So not staying over is definitely
the way to go. But beware.

1539
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:32,981
Anyone under the age of 23 will need cab
money in order to get themselves home.

1540
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:35,178
You need some cab money?

1541
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:37,118
Yeah, 20 would be great.

1542
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:38,849
You live around the block.

1543
01:19:38,923 --> 01:19:41,790
Be a stand-up guy. Don't make her ask.

1544
01:19:41,859 --> 01:19:43,622
It's five.

1545
01:19:43,694 --> 01:19:46,891
So, keep some small bills
around for just such an occasion.

1546
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:50,661
Hey, uh, can I borrow these?

1547
01:19:50,735 --> 01:19:52,327
Thanks.

1548
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:54,200
I just paid eight bucks for those!

1549
01:19:54,272 --> 01:20:00,074
Remember, anything she borrows,
you will never see again.

1550
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:03,045
Drugs and alcohol, while a lot of fun,

1551
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:06,880
are not known for the wisdom they
lend to the decision making process.

1552
01:20:06,951 --> 01:20:11,047
If you are thinking about going home
with someone but you are not sure

1553
01:20:11,122 --> 01:20:14,114
or you know you're wasted, then don't.

1554
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:18,184
That's my house.

1555
01:20:18,262 --> 01:20:21,026
Trees and stuff and...

1556
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:29,438
You know, um, I can't do this.

1557
01:20:31,676 --> 01:20:33,371
What do you mean, you can't do this?

1558
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:36,277
I can't do this.
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1559
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:38,577
You want to have this?

1560
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:41,015
No, it's not about that.

1561
01:20:41,085 --> 01:20:43,883
I'm a second date kind of girl.

1562
01:20:43,955 --> 01:20:46,116
All right. We'll just go inside.

1563
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,919
But I'll call you.

1564
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:50,984
You're a really great guy, Orlando.

1565
01:20:51,062 --> 01:20:54,361
And I'll call you.
I promise. I'll call you.

1566
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,797
You don't have my number.

1567
01:20:57,268 --> 01:20:59,668
Oh. Uh...

1568
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,971
Uh, what is it?

1569
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,841
In cases like these, your hand is your
friend. So show it some appreciation.

1570
01:21:13,718 --> 01:21:15,276
Of all the advice in this Guide,

1571
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:17,844
this is the truest for
both boys and girls.

1572
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:20,618
Go home alone. Pull your pod.

1573
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:23,159
Choke your chicken. Beat your meat.

1574
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:25,024
You wanna make party with me?

1575
01:21:25,096 --> 01:21:28,554
Girls, rub one out,
diddle the skittle, check your oil.

1576
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,193
Hey, this soap scum comes right off.

1577
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:34,466
Spare a thought for all those
who have made your night fun.

1578
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:37,372
You explain to me what the
heck vicious masturbation is.

1579
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:40,467
And for those who have to
clear up your mess this morning.

1580
01:21:40,545 --> 01:21:44,106
You fucking cock suckers.

1581
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:58,860
Felix? Call me back. It's important.

1582
01:22:01,299 --> 01:22:05,736
My God. What the hell is going on here?

1583
01:22:05,803 --> 01:22:07,464
Did Felix send you?

1584
01:22:07,538 --> 01:22:11,201
No. Marty? Oh, my God, my house.

1585
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:12,537
Marty?

1586
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:15,670
Fuck!

1587
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:17,543
Marty!

1588
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,744
What is going on here?

1589
01:22:20,818 --> 01:22:22,843
I had a couple of people over.

1590
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,650
They all gotta go, Marty.
She's gotta go.

1591
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:27,554
He's gotta go. Don't drop the...

1592
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,559
I know, I know. Everybody, we gotta go.

1593
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:31,026
I'm waiting for someone.

1594
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:34,189
No, sweetheart, you're leaving.
Everybody, Marty.

1595
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:37,757
Everybody. Guys, you gotta
get out of here. They're gone.

1596
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:40,269
Everybody! You know who everybody means?

1597
01:22:40,338 --> 01:22:43,432
You. Okay? Anything else?

1598
01:22:43,507 --> 01:22:47,409
Uh, I wouldn't look in
your bathroom for a while.

1599
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:50,447
And don't look in the pool.
The pool's kinda...

1600
01:22:50,514 --> 01:22:51,913
Don't look at the pool.

1601
01:22:51,983 --> 01:22:55,214
If you have to be
at work in a few hours,

1602
01:22:55,286 --> 01:22:56,981
have your excuse ready.

1603
01:22:57,054 --> 01:22:59,716
I'm totally bloated. I'm just a monster.

1604
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:01,417
Or better...

1605
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:03,016
I'm really sick.

1606
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:04,584
Because this isn't even a lie.

1607
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:06,425
I think I ate bad shrimp.

1608
01:23:06,497 --> 01:23:09,933
And as for those boys and
girls who did struggle in...

1609
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:12,964
cut them a little slack.

1610
01:23:14,605 --> 01:23:15,765
Don't talk too loud.

1611
01:23:24,682 --> 01:23:27,742
But most of all, don't beat yourself up.

1612
01:23:27,818 --> 01:23:30,719
You had more fun in the last ten hours

1613
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:32,756
than most people do in a month.

1614
01:23:32,823 --> 01:23:34,347
Don't be ashamed.

1615
01:23:39,463 --> 01:23:43,024
Eugene! My butt hurts.

1616
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:46,228
No, it doesn't. Don't be such a baby.

1617
01:23:47,538 --> 01:23:49,403
Don't give up.

1618
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,737
And try not to freak out.

1619
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:55,210
Peter. Hey, Peter. Peter!

1620
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:56,371
What?

1621
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:57,971
Greg just called.

1622
01:23:58,049 --> 01:24:00,677
He said something about
finding Tony's pills in his car.

1623
01:24:00,751 --> 01:24:02,582
He wants to know if he still needs them.

1624
01:24:02,653 --> 01:24:04,518
Why are you asking me?

1625
01:24:04,588 --> 01:24:06,112
'Cause he's not here.

1626
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,321
Woo! Aha!

1627
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:12,123
You like that, eh?

1628
01:24:12,196 --> 01:24:13,754
Woo!

1629
01:24:15,132 --> 01:24:18,158
Trust me. He's having
the time of his life.

1630
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:29,140
What's up?
Hello. Let's have a little look.

1631
01:24:30,548 --> 01:24:32,482
Oh, yes.

1632
01:24:33,484 --> 01:24:34,883
Uhh!

1633
01:24:35,953 --> 01:24:38,012
Redness and swelling.

1634
01:24:38,089 --> 01:24:43,186
Smoke this twice a day before meals.

1635
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:47,597
And complete the full
course of treatment.

1636
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,593
Are you a real doctor?

1637
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:54,467
Of course I'm a real doctor.

1638
01:24:54,538 --> 01:24:56,028
Thanks.

1639
01:24:57,975 --> 01:25:01,376
Jesus Christ! Loud as hell.

1640
01:25:01,445 --> 01:25:03,413
Just chill.

1641
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:06,575
Phoenix like, you'll rise again.

1642
01:25:07,952 --> 01:25:10,147
Jesus Christ.
People are trying to sleep.

1643
01:25:10,221 --> 01:25:12,052
It's 4:00, asshole.

1644
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:18,157
Dude, I scored with the
hottest chick last night.

1645
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:20,424
I know. I was there!

1646
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:22,159
I just sent you some pictures.

1647
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:27,897
Dude, she's a freaking porno.
Did you tag her?

1648
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:31,066
Dude, it was insane.
We got it on like Donkey Kong.

1649
01:25:31,142 --> 01:25:33,508
Dude, is she asleep?

1650
01:25:33,577 --> 01:25:36,842
Well, she wouldn't, you know,
let me take any while...

1651
01:25:36,914 --> 01:25:40,748
- She was hot, man. I needed proof.
- I don't blame you, bro.

1652
01:25:40,818 --> 01:25:43,309
Nice one. This one's going right
to the front of the spank-o-dex.

1653
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:45,184
Dude!

1654
01:25:48,225 --> 01:25:49,783
She left her scrunchy.

1655
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,986
Ooh.

1656
01:25:53,197 --> 01:25:55,927
You gotta smell this, bro.

1657
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,865
Yeah.

1658
01:26:01,972 --> 01:26:03,599
Peaches.

1659
01:26:03,674 --> 01:26:06,768
Oh. The sweet smell of success.

1660
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:08,072
Like a bouquet.

1661
01:26:08,145 --> 01:26:09,305
Nice doing, bro.

1662
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:18,319
Oh!

1663
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:20,351
Never again.

1664
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:22,289
Guide tip number six:

1665
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:25,624
Never again.
Well, not for a few days anyway.

1666
01:26:25,696 --> 01:26:28,722
Peter! Bring your skinny ass up here.

1667
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:31,324
Give me some more loving.

1668
01:26:31,402 --> 01:26:34,030
Come home to mama, baby.

1669
01:26:34,104 --> 01:26:36,971
Here I come! Are you ready?

1670
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:44,811
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1671
01:26:44,882 --> 01:26:46,679
Fuck that, man.

1672
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:50,208
# All I do all day is max
and relax and smoke pot #

1673
01:26:50,287 --> 01:26:53,848
# You ask me how much
Dude a whole lot #

1674
01:26:53,924 --> 01:26:57,917
# Got so many fucking lines
in my rhymes it needs botox #

1675
01:26:57,995 --> 01:27:01,089
# Last night I banged
a chick with a Mohawk #

1676
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:04,430
# I beat it up
She was Rodney King
I was four cops #

1677
01:27:04,502 --> 01:27:06,902
# I think I forgot to use a rubber
I hope not #

1678
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:09,940
# 'Cause I don't know what the
fuck that punk rock ho got #

1679
01:27:10,007 --> 01:27:13,704
# Tic-toc and you don't stop
Unless you're a crazy motherfucker #

1680
01:27:13,777 --> 01:27:15,745
# And you're rocking
My broke watch #

1681
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:18,373
# Oh fuck that
'Cause I don't need no clock #

1682
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:22,215
# Tell me, Johnny,
that it's time to do the robot #

1683
01:27:28,092 --> 01:27:30,356
That shit was hard, right?

1684
