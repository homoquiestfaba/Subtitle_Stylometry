00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,654
You know what I love
about this job?

175
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:54,615
What's that?

176
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,777
I get to go
to exotic places.

177
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:59,941
Like 942 West
142nd Street,

178
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,124
an address, I might add,
that no longer exists.

179
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,787
The exercise is great.

180
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,790
I climbed 23 flights
of condemned steps today.

181
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,793
You know what I'm saving
on a health club?

182
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:15,377
John, you are
an inspiration to us all.

183
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:18,981
You also got
an appointment waiting.

184
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,683
Oh, shit.

185
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:21,764
WOMAN: Mr. Petrovich?

186
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,807
PETROVICH:
Yes, yes, here, here.

187
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,410
Hey, Mr. Romero.
How you doin'?

188
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,731
You tell me.

189
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,213
How's that kitchen job
holding up?

190
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,096
It's bullshit.
They put me on
part-time.

191
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,658
They're screwing around
with my hours

192
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,781
so I can't watch the kids
when my wife works.

193
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,984
I'll call the manager again.
I'll talk to him personally.

194
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:44,788
Look, I need a real job.
Something with a future.

195
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,191
Stock options
and profit sharing.

196
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,273
I can't raise my kids
in an apartment.

197
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,716
We need a house
with a yard.

198
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,397
It doesn't
have to be fancy

199
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,399
as long as
the schools are decent
and the air is clean,

200
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,682
we'll pack up
and leave tomorrow.

201
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,644
Do you have
any jobs like that?

202
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,906
If I had one,
I'd take it myself.

203
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,913
Thank you, Joy.

204
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,018
I can't believe
I killed myself

205
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:14,660
to get back
from Washington

206
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,862
so we could watch
dirty movies,
and now you're telling me...

207
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:18,344
Honey, I told you about this
a million times.

208
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,146
It's very important
to Lucy.

209
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,548
Is Mad Dog gonna be there?

210
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,230
No, she's not.
She's working nights
this week.

211
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,311
If she was
gonna be there,

212
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,472
I wouldn't have
asked you to go.

213
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:28,835
Barbara, I need
some heads now.

214
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,477
And her name
is Madeleine.

215
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,238
A rose is a rose.

216
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:35,722
Listen, I am up to my ass
in alligators here.

217
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,045
You mean
I have to go alone?

00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,493
IRIS: Hi.

220
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:49,697
I'm Iris Morden.
I'm president of
the Parents' Association.

221
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:51,058
Hi. I'm Nina Bishop.

222
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:52,700
I'm the new
school psychologist.

223
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,103
Oh, I thought
you looked a little young
to be a parent.

224
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,265
You look like
one of the kids.

225
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,107
I sort of feel like one.

226
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,069
Not that I don't think
I'm qualified or anything.

227
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,470
Oh, I didn't mean that.

228
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,593
I have two boys here.
Marty and Kenny.

229
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:05,914
Seventh, eighth grades.

230
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:07,356
Those are
very interesting ages.

231
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:09,117
Yes, interesting
is the right
choice of words.

232
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:11,360
Excuse me.
Is there a pay phone
around here?

233
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,122
The one in the lobby
is out of order.

234
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:16,285
Yeah, by the nurse's office,
third floor,
right through those doors.

235
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,007
Third floor?
Forget it.

236
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,289
Took me half an hour
to find a place to pee.

237
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,931
I ended up in
the little boys' room.
Oh.

238
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,494
I could've traumatized
some eight-year-old,
but I figured, fuck it.

239
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,496
You gotta go,
you gotta go. Right?

240
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,219
Absolutely.
Hi. I'm Iris Morden.

241
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:30,940
I'm president of

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,983
This is Nina Bishop,
our school psychologist.

243
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,064
Hi.

244
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:35,545
Bet you're busy
in a place like this.

245
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:36,586
Oh.

246
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,108
I'm Claire Laurent.

247
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,670
Oh, I've been
looking for you.

248
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,952
Your daughter
put you down for
the refreshment committee.

249
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,875
Daughter? Good God!
Do I look
like a mother?

250
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,717
I don't know.
What do mothers
look like?

251
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:49,400
What I mean to say is
my husband's daughter
is a student here.

252
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,641
What grade is she in?

253
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:51,762
I don't know.

254
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:53,404
Oh. How old is she?

255
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,967
Twelve or thirteen.
She's a walking mass
of raging hormones.

256
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,809
But then,
aren't we all?

257
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,411
Well, I have
just the spot

258
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,013
to put those
raging hormones
to good use.

259
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,975
We need all the help
we can get.

260
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,417
CLAIRE: Help with what?
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,219
I don't quite understand.
I'm kind of filling in here.

262
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,941
Oh, I'm talking about
the Rainbow Festival.

263
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,464
The school pageant.
This year we're doing
a kind of '60s theme.

264
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:13,946
Okay, committees. Now...

265
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:15,628
Refreshment committee,
poster committee,

266
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,149
program committee,
decorations committee.

267
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,352
I'll do decorations.

268
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,354
Oh, great.
That's my committee.

269
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:22,995
School committees
are not my thing.

270
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,998
I do my best work
in the board room.

271
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,100
And the bedroom.

272
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,963
Well, it is
a school tradition.

273
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:31,284
Fine.
My husband will do it.

274
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,806
Husbands and wives,
it's a rule.

275
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,608
You don't understand.
I'm only the stepmother.

276
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,730
Oh, stepparents count.

277
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,051
If we didn't count
stepparents,

278
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,374
we'd have like, maybe,
four people show up.

279
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:42,776
I'll put you down
on the decorations committee
with us.

280
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:44,018
Don't worry about it,
really. It's fun.

281
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:45,900
Besides,
it's months away.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,743
Months away? I haven't
the faintest fucking idea
what I'll be doing then.

283
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:49,984
I'm sure
you can fit it in.

284
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:52,306
And we should meet
maybe next Tuesday?

285
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,508
Here maybe?

286
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,790
Well, no.
Why don't you come
to my house?

287
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,952
And I'll cook supper
and we'll have
a meeting there.

288
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,074
Husbands, too.

289
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,195
Don't put yourself out.

290
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,317
That sounds great.
See you then.

291
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,960
It'll be great.

than a duck's ass.

00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,006

Hi, Sharon.

295
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,450
This is major, Bishop.
Don't fuck it up.

296
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,055
Hey, George, I am so glad
that you could make it.

297
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,217
I told you about
Chuck Bishop,
our new V.P.

298
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,319
It's good
to meet you,
Mr. Mullaney.

with the Japs. Bam!

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,152
They went for it.

305
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,994
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't believe
we've met.

306
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,877
I'm Jeremy Brimfield,

I will never be
as smooth as Jeremy.

310
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,251
He always says
the right thing.

311
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,813
He always
dresses perfectly.

312
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,094
Who cares?

313
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,617
He's just a lot
of hot air.

314
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,799
You're too hard
on yourself.

315
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,981
You need a diversion.

316
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,943
I don't have time
for a diversion.

317
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,466
You do
on Tuesday at 7:30.

318
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:09,708
We're having
a dinner party.

319
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,150
For who?

320
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,511
I met some people
at the meeting tonight.

321
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,113
We're doing
a school pageant
together.

322
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,475
Honey!
Honey, I can't.

323
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:19,318
I just can't. I have
too much work to do.

324
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,520
Well, I already
invited them.

325
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,402
Well...

326
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,204
Besides, I came here.

327
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,187
It's only fair
that we entertain
for my job.

328
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,170
You're right.

329
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,371
It'll be fun.

330
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:34,294
Oh, yeah,
it'll be a blast.

331
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,097
An evening
with a bunch of people
I don't even know.

332
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,539
We don't even know
these people.

333
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,542
I told you, she's the new
school psychologist

334
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,205
and the other couple
are parents.
Well, at least he is.

335
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,948
Do I have to
wear a tie?

336
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:49,190
You can go stark naked
for all I care.

337
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,752
Why are you being
so difficult?

338
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,754
Because I hate
small talk.

339
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,196
I'd rather stay home
and read a good book.

340
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:56,678
We never go anywhere.

341
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:58,240
All our friends
have left the city.
It's so boring.

342
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,342

687
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,195
That is not
negotiable.

688
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,437
Well, lots of kids
go to public school.

689
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,960
Yeah, well, lots of kids
have hand guns, too.

690
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,602
(EXHALES)

691
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:54,804
You're sounding
very elitist.

692
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:56,966
Whatever happened
to changing the system
from within?

693
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,849
That was for us.
We're talking about
our children here.

694
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:02,492
Well, maybe our children
should have
a more realistic view

695
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,594
of life in the big city.

696
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,502
<i>I'm innocent!
Do you hear?</i>

697
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,783
<i>I'm old Pop Corn!</i>

698
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:15,005
<i>I... I'm a Colonel.
You can't do this to me!</i>

699
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:17,908
IRIS: John, even
you have to admit

700
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,870
that Brampton has
the best science department
in the city.

701
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,272
(BOTH LAUGHING)

702
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:22,293
Hear they got the best
athletic fields, too.
Yeah.

703
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:24,475
So, boys,
how's school today?

704
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,476
BOTH: Okay.

705
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,979
Yeah? Well, what are
you studying now?

706
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,881
Mot much.

707
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:33,325
(SIGHS) Could you be
a little more specific?

708
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:35,887
I think if you really think
hard enough...

709
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,989
Well, in history class,
we're studying the '60s.

710
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,493
You're studying the '60s
in history?

711
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:43,595
You mean I'm that old?

712
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,839
Well, I told my teacher
that you were at Woodstock.
She freaked out.

713
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,303
You were like
a total hippie,
right, Dad?

714
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:52,064
Oh, total.

715
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:54,467
George Washington and I
used to hang around
the village together.

716
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,549
God, you remember
the Fillmore?
I wish they'd reopen it.

717
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,631
Hey, your mother
was a hippie, too.

718
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,734
Did you guys
ever drop acid?

719
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,959
Never.

720
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,462
We never took drugs
in our lives.

721
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,143
What a pretty
neighborhood.

722
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,224
CHUCK: Claire can
afford the best.

723
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:30,946
NINA: Hmm.

724
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:33,048
There's John and Iris.

725
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:40,956
(RINGS DOORBELL)

726
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,157
Hey!

727
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:43,559
You beat us.

728
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:44,960
We already tried
downstairs.

729
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,362
So, now we're gonna
try upstairs.

730
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:47,763
Hello.

731
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:50,206
You must be
Leo's daughter.

732
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:53,109
CLAIRE: Lucy dear,
bring our guests inside.

733
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,673
Hi.
Hi.

734
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:02,058
This is lovely.

735
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,980
JOHN: Sure isn't
rent-controlled.

736
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,182
LEO: Hello.

737
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,343
Hi.
Hi.

738
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:08,065
Hello. How are you?
Hi.

739
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:09,987
Welcome, welcome.
Hi.

740
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,108
Ah-ha,
the guest of honor.

741
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,349
It's rhubarb custard.
I hope it goes.

742
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:13,631
CLAIRE: Come in, everybody.

743
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,112
It goes with everything.
Don't worry about it.

744
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:16,554
Lucy, you wanna
lead the way?

745
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,396
Did everybody
meet Lucy,
my daughter?

746
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,037
This is John and Iris Morden.
JOHN: Hi, Lucy.

747
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,160
And that's Chuck
and Nina Bishop.

748
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,922
You know Nina works
at your school?

749
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,123
Um, no.

750
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:27,846
There you are. Welcome.
Welcome, everyone.

751
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,948
Lucy love, take the pie
to the kitchen.

752
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,170
Come in, come in.

753
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,532
Oh.

754
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,614
I didn't know
they had fireplaces
in New York.

755
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,576
This barn has seven.
That's why I bought it.

756
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:39,098
I was going
for chateau.

757
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,980
But next time.

758
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,982
I think I'll have to have
a penthouse on the river,
all black and white.

759
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:45,865
You know, Fred Astaire
meets Aubrey Beardsley.

760
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,466
How could you ever
leave this place?
Really.

761
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,908
I'm not
married to it.

762
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,630
It's just a place
to hang your hat.

763
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,672
I hope everybody
is hungry.

764
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:54,714
The round ones
are lobster

765
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:56,596
and the triangles
are crabmeat.

766
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,078
Oh, I haven't had
lobster in ages.
Thank you.

767
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,880
Leo, you're brilliant.
This is great.

768
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,361
Mmm. You've got
real talent, Leo.

769
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:02,402
Oh. Sorry.

770
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,404
Oh, I helped, too,
didn't I, honey?

771
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,406
I minced, I chopped.

772
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,928
And you whisked.

773
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,210
You're a wizard
with a whisk.

774
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,853
Yes, well,
it is all in the wrist.

775
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:14,055

776
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,157
(MEN LAUGHING)

777
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,562
Um, what is this?

778
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,526
Oh, that's potato koogla.

779
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,108
Kugel.

780
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,350
Kugel.

781
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,832
Leo's mother's
giving me
cooking lessons.

782
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:33,275
But, everyone, please,
let's sit down.

783
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,077
We have two
Italian wines.

784
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:37,319
I like the white,
but Leo thinks
it tastes like piss,

785
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:38,440
so there's red, too.

786
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,863
Lucy darling,
come sit by me.

787
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,326
I'm not hungry.

788
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,087
LEO: You're not hungry?
I made all your favorites.

789
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,689
You're not getting
sick, are you?

790
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:49,212
Um, yeah, I am.

791
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,333
My stomach hurts and...

792
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:51,895
Maybe you should
go lay down.
Okay!

793
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,256
Wanna go upstairs?
Lucy.

794
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,457
I'll be up in a minute
to tuck you in.

795
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:57,140
Lucy. Say good night
to everybody.

796
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,502
Good night, everybody.

797
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,143
Good night.
ALL: Good night.

798
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:01,385
JOHN: Good night.

799
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,487
She's adorable, Leo.
She looks just like you.

800
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,189
Thank you.

801
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:07,571
She's his pride and joy.
She's a delight.

802
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:11,235
It's nice
you get along so well.

803
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,837
This is a great
fabric, Claire.
Yeah.

804
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:14,038
How did you ever
decide?

805
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:16,481
Diego sends Nina
20 swatches a day.

806
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,003
None of them look like this.
No.

807
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:21,105
Just don't get
anything nubby.

808
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,488
Nubby.

809
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:25,770
CLAIRE: Nothing nubby.

810
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,092
(ALL LAUGHING)

811
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,735
No, seriously,
I met Claire
crossing the street.

812
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:33,058
Seriously. He was
crossing the street.
I was in my car.

813
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,780
And I almost
ran over him.

814
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,983
My divorce papers
came through that day,
you know.

815
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,385
Not that
I wasn't happy.

816
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:42,068
It's just...
It was kind of,
you know...

817
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,190
An emotional day
for me.

818
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,993
So, here's this
very attractive man
in a well-cut suit,

819
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,515
crossing the street crying.
He didn't see the light.

820
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:52,158
I slammed
my brakes on so hard,
my airbag went off.

821
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,360
Yeah.

822
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,841
(LAUGHING)

823
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:57,644
So, I hear
these brakes squeal,
I look up.

824
00:34:57,744 --> 00:35:01,328
For a split second,
I see this Shiksa goddess
in the car.

825
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:03,951
The next thing I know,
there's a big balloon
in front of her.

826
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:05,853
You pulled
the car over.

827
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:07,414
I was shaking, he was crying.
You know...

828
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:09,737
But here's the most
amazing thing.

829
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:12,340
There was a parking meter
right there.

830
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,021
Do you believe that?

831
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:16,123
In New York.
Oh.

832
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:19,067
LEO: A sign from God.

833
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,668
So, we went,
we had a drink
to settle our nerves.

834
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:21,910
So, we got married.

835
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,311
And then we got married.
What else do you do?

836
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:24,753
Well, sort of, you know.

837
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:26,014
Well, we found
a parking spot together.
First, yeah.

838
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:27,436
First, we got
the parking spot.
So, yeah.

839
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,718
So, I marry anybody
that, you know,
had a parking spot.

840
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:31,820
Yeah.

841
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,323
We met in a barn.
No.

842
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,565
Call of the wild?
(HOWLS)

843
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:38,607
It was in 4-H camp.
Yeah.

844
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:40,329
Well, they start
early in Iowa.

845
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,491
Well, yeah.
Technically, we did have
our first date

846
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,414
when we were eight years old.
Eight years old.

847
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:45,575
I assume you didn't
go all the way.

848
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,337
(LAUGHING) Hardly.

849
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,018
I didn't even like him then.
Mmm-hmm.

850
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,780
He thought
he was so cool.

851
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,662
I had
a crush on her.

852
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:53,984
I called you
Stuck-up Chuck.

853
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,625
Oh, you didn't pull
any punches, did you?

854
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,989
The kids used to
hang around this barn
at 4-H camp.

855
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,350
And we'd walk
down there and...

856
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,752
(WHISPERING)
You're not gonna
tell them. Don't.

857
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:04,475
We'd watch and we'd wait
for the animals to do it.

858
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,477
Don't! Oh, God!
Isn't it true?

859
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:07,838
Amazing.

860
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:10,041
And then
we started dating.

861
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,243
That's a great story.

862
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:13,524
Gross.

863
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,286
How'd you guys meet?
BOTH: Yeah, how'd you meet?

864
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,608
No.
No.

865
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,209
Come on, come on.
Yeah.

866
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:22,053
Well... Hey...
John and I
met in jail.

867
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:23,255

End of story.

870
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,100
No, come on,
we have to tell 'em.

871
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,501
After all,
they told us.

872
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,543
Well, see, there was
this student protest
going on.

873
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:33,345
Hey.

874
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,707
Skip the gory details,
will you?

875
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,390
Well, I mean,
it's the truth.
It's the truth.

876
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,832
So, anyway,
I go down there
and it's a great place.

877
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,275
You can meet other people
and end the war
at the same time.

878
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,357
And I happened to be
in the right place
at the right time.

It was.

I tell this story.

LEO: Tell her
I'll call her back.

CLAIRE: No.

890
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,482
Excuse me.

891
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:10,545
Ease up, Claire.

892
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,906
I won't ease up.

893
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:14,749
She has the telephone
etiquette of a mad dog.

894
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,871
Lucy's wonderful,
but her mother's impossible.

She calls,
I say "hello."

896

She says, "Is he there?"

897
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:22,557
Like I don't exist
or like I'm a servant
or something.

to get a B-12 shot.

We haven't even
talked about the festival.

907

Don't you think we should
talk about the festival?
Oh, honey.

908
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,349
Absolutely right.
No, just relax.

Will you relax?
No, we have to get
some work done.

get together next week?

one bathroom.

915
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:08,045
And our furniture,
it's so nubby.

916
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:09,527

you really
should redecorate.

did chateau.

Very, very funny.

920

We'll bring in
artificial snow.
It'll be fabulous.

Oh, God,
that couch of ours
is 15 years old!

922
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,501
It keeps my butt
off the floor when
I watch the news, Iris.

923
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,062
You can't ask
for more than that.

You know,
sometimes I just think
you enjoy torturing me!

You're torturing
yourself!

to feed.

Will you stop playing
devil's advocate?

For once just
be my advocate.

930
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,434
I just want them
to like us.

931

Who cares if they like us?
You're being neurotic.

932

Oh, well,
if I'm neurotic,
you're antisocial.

933
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,240
I'd say that
describes us
perfectly.

Oh, please,
I don't want to
hear anymore.

talk to you anymore.

always react the way
you want them to

of desserts

to have it?

Look, the point is,
I haven't broken any laws.

1255
00:52:17,483 --> 00:52:21,307
There's a difference
between the law and justice.

1256
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:23,470
A guy doesn't
pay his rent.

1257
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,791
He gets evicted.

1258
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,893
That's the law.

1259
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:29,236
But if he didn't
pay his rent

1260
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:32,759
because he doesn't have
the education
to get a decent job

1261
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:34,201
so that
he could earn the money,

1262
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:37,444
or didn't have
a family where
there was a role model

1263
00:52:37,544 --> 00:52:42,870
to give him that self-esteem
that he needs to just function
in this society.

1264
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,913
Is that justice?

1265
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:49,157
Look, are you gonna
represent me or not?

1266
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:51,579

your taxes.

They're gonna go over
your credit cards.

1268
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:56,505
They're gonna examine
your phone bill.

1269

They're gonna subpoena
your high school yearbook

subversive autographs.

I'm not guilty.

smart enough to be guilty,

wouldn't hire me.

Mr. Chamberlain's nice.

are too expensive.

have the wrong idea
about Woodstock.

Or at least you have
just a partial idea
of the whole thing.

See, Woodstock wasn't
just a big, giant party.

1410
00:59:32,143 --> 00:59:35,606
I mean, you have to remember
that this country
was at war then.

1411
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:39,611
An unjust war
that was being run
by a psychopathic maniac

1412

who was manipulating
the Vietnamese people

1413
00:59:41,593 --> 00:59:46,218
because of his own
twisted macho idea
of what America should be.

1414
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:48,340
On the weekend
of the Woodstock festival,

1415
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,423
there was
over 500,000 troops
in Vietnam.

1416
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:53,265
And most of these
were poor minorities

1417
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:56,829
because they didn't have
rich fathers to buy
their way out of the draft.

We were hoping that
you would emphasize,
shall we say,

1420
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:04,717
the more
sociological aspects
of Woodstock.

1421
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:08,361
You know, the music,
the idea of tie-dye
as folk art.

1422
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:11,564
Oh, oh, all that was
just a reaction
to the political climate.

1430

about watching body bags
lined up on the 6:00 news.

of role models

is between Richard Nixon
and Jimi Hendrix,

you expect me to do?
Drop everything?

1524
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:17,248
A limousine
is no place for a kid.

1525
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,090
Caroline Kennedy
grew up in a limousine,

1526
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,371
and she turned out
perfectly fine.

1527
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:21,532
This is serious, Claire.

1528
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:23,014
She's probably
with Madeleine.

1529
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:24,736
You're not mad
about the limo,

1530
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:27,418
you're just mad
because you have to call
that bitch and explain.

1531
01:05:27,518 --> 01:05:30,381
No. What I'm mad about
is that I asked you
to do me a favor...

1532
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:32,484
Hello? Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.

1533
01:05:33,324 --> 01:05:35,327
Is Lucy there?

1534
01:05:35,927 --> 01:05:37,589
Oh...

1535
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:40,312
No, look.
There was a little mix-up.

1536
01:05:40,412 --> 01:05:42,795
It... Calm...
Madeleine, calm down.

1537
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:44,877
Look, Madeleine,
I am upset, too!

1538
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:47,319
Hang up.
I'll call the limo service.

1539
01:05:47,419 --> 01:05:51,223
We'll straighten this out.
I'll... I'll call you back.
Okay? Yeah.

1540
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:55,308
Thanks.

1541
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,242
Hi.

1542
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:13,087
You okay?

1543
01:06:14,248 --> 01:06:16,250
(WHIMPERING)
I didn't know
where to go.

1544
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:19,353
You wanna come
upstairs and talk?

1545
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:21,035
(SIGHS)

1546
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:23,317
I don't need
to talk anymore.

1547
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:25,420
I just need you.

1548
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,943
Oh...

1549
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:32,848
(SOBBING)

1550
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,950
Come here.

1551
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:38,353
(CLICKING TONGUE)

1552
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:42,317
I can be your friend.

1553
01:06:43,198 --> 01:06:45,200
I can listen.

1554
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:48,084
But I can't fix it.

1555
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:54,390
Okay.
Where's my baby?

1556
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,552
LUCY: Daddy.
Come here.

1557
01:06:55,652 --> 01:06:57,273
She's been drinking.

1558
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,675
Daddy, help me.

1559
01:06:58,775 --> 01:06:59,856
It's okay, sweetheart.
I tried to give
her some milk.

1560
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:02,038
You're with daddy now.
Thank you, Nina.

1561
01:07:02,138 --> 01:07:04,141
Okay.

1562
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,783
It's okay, honey,
you're home.

1563
01:07:09,386 --> 01:07:11,408
If you need
anything else,

1564
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,510
just give me a call.

1565
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,576
So I guess you think
I'm a real witch, right?

1566
01:07:18,676 --> 01:07:20,618
Driving that poor child
to the bottle?

1567
01:07:20,718 --> 01:07:23,621
No. I know how
difficult it is

1568
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:25,463
to deal with a child
that's so hard to reach.

1569
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:29,107
No, you don't know
how difficult it is, Nina!

1570
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:31,349
I've really tried
to win her over.

1571
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:34,313
But she's so sullen
and arrogant
and manipulative.

1572
01:07:34,413 --> 01:07:37,336
She's a little girl,
not a grown-up woman.

1573
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:42,001
(CHUCKLES)
When I was her age,

1574
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,203
I never heard
the word "divorce."

1575
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:46,285
I didn't know
the world could blow up
at any minute.

1576
01:07:46,385 --> 01:07:49,649
My biggest problem was
cheerleading try-outs.

1577
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:53,192
Every night I went to sleep
feeling safe and secure.

1578
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:55,975
Lucy's never had that.

1579
01:07:56,075 --> 01:07:57,497
But it wasn't my fault.

1580
01:07:57,597 --> 01:07:59,599
It's nobody's fault.

1581
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:03,203
It's just the way it is.

1582
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,481
I've got a cleaver
in my hand.

1583
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:22,043
Are you sure
you want to have
this discussion now?

1584
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,966
There is no discussion.
This isn't working.

1585
01:08:25,066 --> 01:08:26,408
Throw in
another egg yolk.

1586
01:08:26,508 --> 01:08:29,851
I'm talking about
our marriage.
It isn't working.

1587
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,733
Of course it's working.
We're having an argument,
that's all.

1588
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,455
It's called a fight.

1589
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:36,058
I want out, Leo.

1590
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,182
You want out? You want out?
Huh, just like that
you want out?

1591
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,704
I'm sorry, Leo.

1592
01:08:41,804 --> 01:08:43,345
You gotta be more
willing to bend, Claire.
That's all.

1593
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:44,747
This is not fun.

1594
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:46,869
Yeah? Well, marriage
isn't all fun.
You know that?

1595
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,352
Remember, for better
or worse,
in sickness and in health.

1596
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:52,876
You know, once, just once
I'd like to have a plain,
old weekend with you

1597
01:08:52,976 --> 01:08:54,998
where we didn't go
to some glamorous resort,

1598
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,400
didn't hang out
with the right people,
drink champagne,

1599
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,242
and desperately try
to fuck our brains out
on satin sheets.

1600
01:08:59,342 --> 01:09:01,384
There was no gun
at your head.

1601
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:07,491
You know, I would like
to spend 48 miserable hours
with you one weekend.

1602
01:09:07,591 --> 01:09:10,534
That's all.
Then get into bed,
have lousy sex,

1603
01:09:10,634 --> 01:09:13,097
wake up in the morning,
and then get on with my day

1604
01:09:13,197 --> 01:09:15,499
without having to worry
whether or not
I impressed you,

1605
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:17,181
whether or not
you had a good time,

1606
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:19,424
whether or not
I was good enough for you!

1607
01:09:19,524 --> 01:09:21,546
Marriage isn't just fun!

1608
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:23,308
Well, this one
sure isn't!

1609
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:26,391
I'm sick of suffering
because you
and Mad Dog fucked up.

1610
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:28,353
How about
a little respect
for my feelings

1611
01:09:28,453 --> 01:09:31,156
instead of jumping
through hoops for
the other women in your life?

1612
01:09:31,256 --> 01:09:33,418
I married you,
not your excess baggage.

1613
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,522
Excess baggage?

1614
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:38,924
Lucy, my daughter...

1615
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:41,127
My daughter, excess baggage?
I'm not talking about Lucy,

1616
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:42,528
I'm talking about
the situation!

1617
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:44,931
Who the hell
do you think you are?
Queen Claire?

1618
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:47,373
Your Highness?
Who the fuck are you?

1619
01:09:47,473 --> 01:09:48,534
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1620
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:49,976
My daughter
comes with me!

1621
01:09:50,076 --> 01:09:51,217
I didn't mean
your daughter, okay?

1622
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,420
Don't touch me.

1623
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,061
Don't touch me.
Okay.

1624
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:58,105
My daughter
comes with me, okay?
That's part of the bargain.

1625
01:09:58,205 --> 01:10:00,207
I know that, Leo.

1626
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,732
It's no bargain.

1627
01:10:06,693 --> 01:10:08,596
Oh, my God,
Claire and Leo...

1628
01:10:08,696 --> 01:10:10,698
Are getting a divorce.

1629
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:13,561
But why?
They seemed so happy!

1630
01:10:13,661 --> 01:10:14,762
Yeah, I can't
figure it either.

1631
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:17,205
(SIGHING) I'm sure
they had hot sex.

1632
01:10:17,305 --> 01:10:18,766
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1633
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:20,568
Hot sex! What's that
supposed to mean?

1634
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:23,972
You know what it means, Iris.
It hasn't been that long.

1635
01:10:24,072 --> 01:10:25,614
(GASPS)
You really think sex

1636
01:10:25,714 --> 01:10:27,976
is the most important thing
to keep a marriage together?

1637
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:30,459
Of course not!
People split up
for a lot of reasons.

1638
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,980
Lousy sex
is just one of them.

1639
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,862
Oh, I hadn't realized
you were such an expert!

1640
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:36,705
Huh, you don't have to be
an expert to make
a simple observation.

1641
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,909
It just appeared to me
that Claire and Leo had...

1642
01:10:40,009 --> 01:10:42,351
Satisfying physical relationship.

1643
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:43,673
Right.

1644
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:46,476
Claire is a very
vivacious woman.

1645
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,578
And...

1646
01:10:49,018 --> 01:10:51,020
She's got great tits!

1647
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:55,365
Great tits?
What a thing to say.

1648
01:10:55,465 --> 01:10:57,207
A simple observation.

1649
01:10:57,307 --> 01:11:00,330
It is a rude and
inappropriate comment to make
about a friend in pain.

1650

Do I say,
"Gee, Chuck's a bright,
interesting guy,

I'm sure
they'll work it out.

1655

People say things in anger
they don't really mean,

1656
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:15,586
and you just have
to remain calm,

1657
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:18,590
and talk things over
sensibly.

1658
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:20,692
Anything can be worked out.

you can't turn your back

1699

that we were meant
to live our life
in pairs.

1700
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:12,630
Yeah, sure.

You know,
my parents are alive,

1721
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:51,231
but if they were dead,
they would be
turning over in their grave.

1722
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,633
They've been married
45 years, they still
sleep in the same bed.

1723

What's this, lavender?

1724
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:57,938
Yeah, that's Lucy's
favorite color.

1725
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:00,921
I'll be happy
if one of my kids

1726
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:03,684
develops a decent jump shot
from the corner.

(LAUGHS) Pretty

1728

So we could
grow up together.

Maybe I did,

1733
01:14:21,603 --> 01:14:24,546
but I'm just starting
to ask questions

1734
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:27,329
about things I thought
I had answers to.

1735
01:14:28,971 --> 01:14:30,973
Does that make sense?

Sure.

1737
01:14:33,856 --> 01:14:35,037
You know, even though
I'm innocent,

1738
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,879
there's one thing
that still bothers me.

1739
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,121
What's that?

1740
01:14:38,221 --> 01:14:40,083
Well, I have to ask myself
when I think about

1741
01:14:40,183 --> 01:14:42,525
where I was headed,
theoretically.

1742
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,128
If I could've gotten away
with a few million,

1743
01:14:45,228 --> 01:14:47,991
never gotten caught,
would I have done it?

1744
01:14:48,992 --> 01:14:50,534
Oh, geez! Oh, shit.

1745
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:51,895
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

I don't want to
answer to anybody!

1751

set a good example.

the way I choose
to live my life,

in Macy's window!

1754

I let Claire
keep the silver.

1755
01:15:16,821 --> 01:15:17,923
It was the least
I could do.

1756

for over 200 years.

to get in a rut.

John and I had this,
like, you know,
open relationship

1762
01:15:29,995 --> 01:15:32,578
which basically meant
that he slept
with other women

1763
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:35,301
while I pretended
to sleep with other men.

1764
01:15:35,401 --> 01:15:38,044
Then, his roommate
moved to Oregon.

1765
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:41,307
Then I moved in
with the understanding

1766
01:15:41,407 --> 01:15:43,670
that we wouldn't sleep
with other people,

1767
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,552
but we'd keep
our money separate.

1768
01:15:45,652 --> 01:15:47,554
Then what happened?

1769
01:15:47,654 --> 01:15:49,656
We got pregnant.

you want."

put it on plastic.

Please, just tell me
what it is.
Tell me what you want.

2019
01:27:50,058 --> 01:27:52,060
(CRYING)

2020
01:27:53,021 --> 01:27:54,362
I just...

2021
01:27:54,462 --> 01:27:56,705
I just want us
to be able to talk.

2022
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,508
Okay.

2023
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:02,150
Like this.
Okay.

2024
01:28:08,357 --> 01:28:10,359
Oh, boy.

2025
01:28:12,922 --> 01:28:16,005
You are everything
to me. Okay?

2026
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:19,008
Do you know that?

2027
01:28:22,692 --> 01:28:25,735
I just felt so lonely
the past couple of months,

2028
01:28:26,776 --> 01:28:28,839
and shut out.

2029
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:30,801
And I just wanna feel
like I matter to you.

2030
01:28:30,901 --> 01:28:32,903
Oh, God, you matter.

2031
01:28:33,463 --> 01:28:34,565
You matter.

2032
01:28:34,665 --> 01:28:35,766
You don't have
to protect me.

2033
01:28:35,866 --> 01:28:37,868
Okay. Okay.

2034
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,752
I'm sorry.

2035
01:28:44,956 --> 01:28:46,617
I love you so much.

2036
01:28:46,717 --> 01:28:48,720
I love you, too.

2037
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:51,883
Will you marry me?
(CHUCKLES)

2038
01:28:52,884 --> 01:28:55,667
I already did,
remember?

2039
01:28:55,767 --> 01:28:56,828
Oh, yeah.

2040
01:28:56,928 --> 01:28:58,930
(CHUCKLES)

2041
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:01,493
Marry me again.

2042
01:29:03,976 --> 01:29:05,978
I do.

2043
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,643
How many
thousands of these
do you need, Iris?

2044
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:12,164
There's no such thing
as too many.

2045
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,287
The children's public theater
always gets a huge turnout.

2046
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:17,530
Chuck and I can't wait.
You know, he wants
to volunteer, too.

2047
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:19,632
He's so helpful.

2048
01:29:21,114 --> 01:29:26,299
If you two get any happier,
I'm gonna have to get
a glucose tolerance test.

2049
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:27,901
Don't you recycle
these things?

2050
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:29,823
I have a feeling
I'm going to.

2051
01:29:29,923 --> 01:29:31,705
Well, come on,
it only takes a minute
to make a difference.

2052
01:29:31,805 --> 01:29:33,807
It's all
in the wrist.

2053
01:29:34,528 --> 01:29:35,669
How do you
do it, Iris?

2054
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:38,352
How do you have time
to care about everything?

2055
01:29:38,452 --> 01:29:39,553
You sound like John.

2056
01:29:39,653 --> 01:29:40,715
I mean it
as a compliment.

2057
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:42,276
He sure doesn't.

2058
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:44,759
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't
get like that.

2059
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:46,401
He's been under
a lot of pressure lately.

2060
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:48,363
They're having
more cutbacks
in his department.

2061
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:50,004
Oh, really?
Yeah.

2062
01:29:50,104 --> 01:29:51,766
I feel so bad
for him.

2063
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:53,809
(MIMICKING)
I feel so bad
for him.

2064
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:55,971
Ha, ha, ha!

2065
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:59,775
Anyway, there's this
big dance for the mayor
and I'm really excited,

2066
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:01,216
'cause I thought
it might
cheer John up.

2067
01:30:01,316 --> 01:30:03,539
It's this black tie,
he's never worn
a tux before.

2068
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:06,262
he's all upset
'cause they cost
too much to rent.

2069
01:30:06,362 --> 01:30:08,544
What are you
gonna wear?

2070
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:12,228
Well, I have this
sort of long navy blue skirt
and white blouse.

2071
01:30:12,328 --> 01:30:13,870
And I thought that,
you know, I'd...
Yeah.

2072
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,972
Look like
Mary Poppins?

2073
01:30:16,973 --> 01:30:18,194
Well, with
the right jewelry...

2074
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:21,478
The right jewelry
is in the
Tower of London.

2075
01:30:21,578 --> 01:30:22,759
John needs to be
cheered up.

2076
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:25,902
What do we have
that's real cheerful?

2077
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:27,885
Do you know CPR?

2078
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:29,326
Oh, God, I could
never wear that.

2079
01:30:29,426 --> 01:30:30,928
We won't tell God.

2080
01:30:31,028 --> 01:30:32,569
Come on.
That'll never fit me.

2081
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:34,692
Of course it will.
This part stretches
all out this way,

2082
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:37,455
and this part
pushes everything up
and out the top.

2083
01:30:37,555 --> 01:30:41,559
Yeah, well, I don't know
if I want everything
up and out the top.

2084
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,903
This is endless.

Everson made

when we go to trial

at the White House?

I can't wait
till it's over,

Am I so desperate

I dress myself up
in this outfit

convinced you think
I'm dumpy and boring?

any such thing.

Yes, you do!

and you won't kiss me.

to be cheerful.

a good life,

2139

and not be consumed
with anger

2140
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,842
and jealousy
and rage and...

2141
01:34:34,645 --> 01:34:37,949
And the feeling that
I've missed the boat.

2142
01:34:38,049 --> 01:34:39,390
I thought we were
in this together.

2143
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:42,213
I thought this was
supposed to be
a marriage, right?

2144
01:34:44,135 --> 01:34:46,998

maybe I didn't turn out

to be the Barbie doll
of your dreams,

2146
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:54,186
but let me remind you,
when we met,
you had a 32-inch waist.

2147

And a sense of humor.

is sadness and gloom

01:35:02,355 --> 01:35:05,117

about Claire's tits?

tell you something.

I think she has great tits.

I think she has great legs
and great clothes
to show them off.

2153
01:35:14,567 --> 01:35:18,151
But she gave up on Leo,
and I have never
given up on you.

2154
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,354
So how dare
you give up on me?

won't even talk to me.

I'd turn it over
to Jeremy Brimfield.

2164
01:36:30,808 --> 01:36:32,910
He made a killing
on this Hutchco deal.

2165
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:36,194
Yeah, I never liked Jeremy.
He was always bragging.

2166
01:36:36,294 --> 01:36:39,357
He had a lot to brag about.
He made a bundle for Mullaney.

2167

No, no, no.
Jeremy didn't do shit
for Mullaney.

Mullaney was mine.
Jeremy didn't even
know him.

What are you talking about?
The whole Hutchco deal...

2170

No, Jeremy handled
the Hutchco deal,

2171
01:36:48,827 --> 01:36:50,769
but Mullaney had
nothing to do with it.

2172
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:53,652
Mullaney's brother-in-law
owned the corporation,

2173
01:36:53,752 --> 01:36:55,855
but Mullaney
had control.

2174
01:36:55,955 --> 01:36:59,298
No, if that was true,
then Jeremy and Mullaney
would have known each other

2175
01:36:59,398 --> 01:37:00,740
and they hadn't met.

2176
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,021
What makes you so sure?

2177
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:04,304
