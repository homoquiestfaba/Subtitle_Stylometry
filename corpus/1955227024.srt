LETTER WRITER (VOICEOVER):
Professor Erickson,

3
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,099
After considerable
discussion with my colleagues

4
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,736
At the Vatican, we have a
reluctantly decided to comply

5
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,105
With your request for
a copy of the Banda

6
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,008
Manuscript of the
Necrophilia Department

7
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,644
From the Vatican's
occult archives.

8
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,946
Now this is perhaps
the most obscure work

9
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,049
Found on the subject of
demonic conjurations.

10
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,587
However, treated with
considerable caution,

11
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,356
You are dealing with
the occult. Please

12
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,792
Keep in mind that this
material is authorized

13
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,361
Or serious study only.

14
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,796
MISS SULLIVAN: Professor?

15
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,730
Hm?

16
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,198
I thought you needed to see me.

17
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,165
I do.

18
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,768
Just a moment.

19
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,137
LETTER WRITER (VOICEOVER):
Remember that you were dealing

20
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,241
With the demon of sex and
lust, and with the powers

21
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,910
Of darkness.

22
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,712
So, I must warn you...

23
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,351
Professor, it's getting late.

24
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,320
What did you need
to see me about.

25
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,523
It's about your
grades, my dear.

26
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,959
[Music playing]

27
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,304
GRENGOL: Mistress!

28
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,305
Mistress!

29
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,072
Mistress!

30
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,178
Oh, what is it, Grengol?

31
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,282
Mistress, they released the
manuscript from the Vatican.

32
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,317
What?

33
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,284
Yes!

34
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,353
It's true.

35
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,188
You're going to be
conjured at any moment.

36
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,090
I don't believe it.

37
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,058
Well, it's true.

38
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:57,097
It's been five centuries since
I was conjured by the Medici

39
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:00,368
To destroy that... that priest.

40
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,602
What's his name?

41
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,371
Saavan Arolla.

42
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,606
ISHA: Yes.

43
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,141
It was delicious, Grengol.

44
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,311
Oh, I miss the touch
of mortal flesh.

45
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,881
Oh, we have to get you ready.

46
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,682
Ready?

47
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,216
Yes.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,686
But Grengol, how do I look?

49
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,032
I'm ready.

50
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,033
What will we wear?

51
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,272
Hey, Dave, wait up.

52
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,108
I don't see why you can't
wait till tomorrow to get

53
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,443
Him those computer printouts.

54
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,377
I told you.

55
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,379
Erickson said he
needed them today.

56
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,448
Besides, he says
you have something

57
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,449
Really important for me.

58
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,250
Yeah, but talk
about lousy timing.

59
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,453
I mean, tonight is
the night, remember?

60
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,320
The girls?

61
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,121
The concert?

62
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,123
The girls?

63
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,325
We may never get this
opportunity again.

64
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,493
Who would've ever
thought we could

65
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,829
Get the Alphas into
our frat house,

66
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,932
And maybe, into our beds?

67
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,034
Seth, believe me, I know.

68
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,337
But I could care less
about our sex lives.

69
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:13,741
Besides, if I don't show up,
he will screw up my grades.

70
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,543
And you know what that means?

71
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:16,844
BOTH: No Corvette.

72
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,045
Right.

73
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,379
You'd think your parents
wouldn't mind getting one

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,814
B at this stage of the game.

75
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,115
Yeah, you'd think.

76
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,118
But you know my parents.

77
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,156
Still, it has been
worth every sacrifice.

78
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,458
When I picture myself
behind the wheels

79
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,461
Of that precision machine...

80
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,428
[Imitates sizzling]

81
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,496
[Chuckling]

82
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,067
Ah, just one more
semester, and she's mine.

83
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,335
As long as Erickson
doesn't stand in my way.

84
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,771
Yeah, well be careful.

85
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,806
I've heard he really loves
to screw with students.

86
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,274
Yeah.

87
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,942
Wait here.

88
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:49,910
I shouldn't be gone too long.

89
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,160
You're not performing as well
as you could, Miss Sullivan.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,062
What does that mean?

91
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,332
It means that you'll
get an F in my course

92
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,968
Unless you do something... quick.

93
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,036
Something quick?

94
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,812
Miss Sullivan, why do you
think I had you come up here?

95
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,481
I don't know.

96
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,919
I was hoping that you might
be the one student who could

97
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,656
Demonstrate to me that
beauty and intelligence can

98
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,591
Exist in the same person.

99
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,761
I must say, I now
have my doubts.

100
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,996
I don't understand what
you mean, professor.

101
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,899
I'm talking about expectations.

102
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,535
In order to succeed
in this world,

103
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:51,404
One must live up to the
expectations of those in power.

104
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,907
You do want to get
through psychology,

105
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,609
Don't you, Miss Sullivan?

106
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,310
Please don't do this.

107
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,847
Please, don't be a child.

108
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,615
I don't want to
do it for a grade.

109
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,552
Then you do it for the hell
of it, because I'm easy.

110
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,553
[Loud smack]

111
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,222
That was a stupid move.

112
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,292
If I was going to
stay in your class.

113
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,195
[Indistinct talking]

114
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,132
Then I'll transfer
to another school.

115
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,669
And give up everything
you've worked for?

116
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,203
You're a real jerk.

117
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,305
Well, it's better than
being the campus slut.

118
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,774
Now run along.

119
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:27,741
Fuck you, asshole.

120
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,012
I'm going to report you.

121
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,480
Well, you go right ahead.

122
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,015
It's your word against mine.

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,654
[Groans]

124
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,957
Some students...
They'll try anything

125
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:44,925
To get out of an assignment.

126
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,997
But I know you won't fail me.

127
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,932
Now, get up off
the floor, please.

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,650
Did you finish, uh,
compiling the statistics?

129
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,417
Yeah, here.

130
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,591
That's good work, Kaufman.

131
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,759
That's real good work.

132
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,363
Well, here.

133
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,233
Now, um, this is
your next assignment.

134
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,873
What's this?

135
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,643
These are the questionnaire
answers from my latest survey.

136
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,313
Now I need the results
compiled immediately.

137
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,216
Well, I think I can
do that for you, sir.

138
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,517
Well, good.

139
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:48,021
I'll be by later tonight to
pick them up around eight.

140
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,022
Tonight?

141
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:49,857
Yes, Kaufman.

142
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:50,758
Tonight.

143
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:51,925
I'm leaving.

144
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,161
I'm flying for the
parapsychological conference

145
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,196
Tomorrow, remember?

146
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,098
And I need time to analyze it.

147
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,233
That... that data
could be critical

148
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,736
And I need time to
type up the paper.

149
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,271
So tonight is it.

150
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,605
But tonight I have a...

151
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,774
No "buts," Kaufman.

152
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:07,908
That is your assignment.

153
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,979
Now you either do it or
you... flunk the course.

154
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,247
You'd fail me over a bar chart?

155
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,615
Of course.

156
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,250
What else would you
expect if you didn't

157
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,952
Complete your assignment?

158
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,821
Now get going.

159
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,357
I'll be by later to
pick up the results.

160
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,959
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,028
Oh, and Kaufman?

162
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,429
What?

163
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,332
If I ever catch you trying to
listen outside my door again,

164
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,233
I'll have you expelled.

165
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,207
[Door shuts]

166
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,150
Heh, gee, you look real happy.

167
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,184
[Scoffs]

168
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,419
Great.

169
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,654
Numbnuts wants me to compile
a bunch of statistics

170
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,889
Off all this crap.

171
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:56,656
So?

172
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,991
Big deal.

173
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,861
You don't understand.

174
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,495
He's flying out
of town tomorrow.

175
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:07,200
He needs it before then, so the
only chance I've got to do it

176
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,568
Is tonight.

177
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,569
Tonight?

178
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,171
Are you crazy?

179
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,072
What about the concert?

180
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,273
The girls?

181
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,209
Especially the girls.

182
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,079
I gotta do it tonight
or he flunks me.

183
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,213
Which means...

184
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,448

Well, look.

187
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,854
If anybody can do
it quick, it's you.

188
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,621
All we got to do is
get this stuff back

189
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,993
To the frat house real quick and
enter the data in the computer.

190
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,127
Yeah.

191
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,062
Yeah.

192
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:35,863

Jeff, are you OK?

196
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,550
Hello?

197
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,286
She smiled at me.

198
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,989

Forget it.

201
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,960
She's with Mark, the dork.

202
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,529
Haven't you ever seen
her at the house before?

203
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,865
I don't care.

204
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,133
I think I'm in love.

205
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,070
Oh, come on, stud.

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,871
Come on.

Coming to the concert
at the house tonight?

210
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,056
Why should it matter
to you if I am?

211
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,292
Well, I thought maybe
you and I could hang out.

212
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,194
I told you it's over.

213
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,562
What do you mean it's over?

Nobody walks out on me.

with him anyway?

Uh, what's with your
outfit anyway, Tony?

258
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,388
The theme for the
party is "heavy metal"

And not "The Playboy Channel."

we'd escort them over here.

dressed like that.

going to kill Theodore.

us with the books.

to relax or guests?

this afternoon

297
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,863
And set up their equipment
so they can get right into it

When they get here.

299
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,798

down in the basement, OK?

do you prefer, Mistress?

I'll take the blood.

316

Grengol, what about
this for Prince Medici?

321
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,268
He always loves me in black.

00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,937
Oh, that was 500
years ago, Mistress.

323
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,705
Um, styles have changed.

324
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:01,748
Look at this!

325
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,522
Rock-and-roll... does this work?

326
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,191
Trust me, Mistress.

327
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,592
It'll work!

328
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:18,298
Good, because I must be ready
for the prince when he calls.

329
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,867
Well, Mistress, he's dead.

330
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,174
Pity.

331
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,908
Who's conjuring me then?

GRENGOL: Perhaps a descendent.

333
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,015
Then I must be ready
when the new prince calls.

334
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,816
How do I look, Grengol.

335
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,326

00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,729
I know you're down here.

you're going to die.

No, it's that twit, Theodore.

342
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,504
He swiped one of my magazines.

343
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,909
Ha, I'm sure he'll return it.

344
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,411
It's not the magazine
I'm worried about.

345
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,112
It's what I stuffed
inside of it that matters.

346
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,214
I'm going to need
it for tonight.

347
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,823
Hey, you better get
ready for the exchange.

348
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,625
What about you?

00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,761
I gotta... I gotta
sort out this mess.

I gotta transfer all
the data to a disk.

351
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,703
If it works out, I'll
be up in a few minutes.

352
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,207
Well, what happens
if it doesn't?

353
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,043
Then I'm screwed.

354
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,011
Well, think positive.

355
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,282
And I'll keep my
fingers crossed.

356
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,082

It's Kelly.

367
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,003
Hi, Kelly.

368
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,510
Hi, Dave.

369
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,844
Kelly?

370
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,613
What's up?

371
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,248
I... I just bought this over.

372
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,150
I double checked your
professor's data to make

373
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,885
Sure there weren't any errors.

374
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,686
Oh, Kelly.

375
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,787
You didn't have to do that.

376
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,588
Oh, it's OK.

377
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,257
I like helping you.

378
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,860
It's, um, it matches
the first printout,

379
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,631
And now everything's
OK for sure.

380
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,199
Great.

381
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,636
But, I had to hand it
in earlier tonight.

382
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,105
Oh.

383
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,510
What's this?

384
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,415
It's some new
data for Erickson.

385
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:23,783
I almost got it all input.

386
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,752
He says he needs it tonight.

387
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,320
Oh, that shouldn't
be any problem.

388
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah.

389
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,662
You want to see
something strange?

390
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,463
Yeah.

391
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,500
It's something
from the Vatican.

392
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,202
I mean, it has the
Vatican stamp on it.

393
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,003
Wow.

394

"Is thine." [non-english speech]

396
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,149
I told you it was strange.

397
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,219
"Voices of a thousand."

398
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,489
You suppose that means
a thousand voices have

399
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,857
To say this for some reason?

400
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,092
Yeah, it could be.

401
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,130
You know, you could
fake a thousand voices

402
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,499
On your high speed
dialing system

403
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,233
And it'll only
take a few minutes.

404
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,938
I wonder what would
happen if I did?

405
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,473
Well, let's find out.

JASON: Dammit!

407
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,277
Those moron jocks
drank half the beer.

408
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,846
I told you.

409
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,214
Jeff, you got your
Jeep out front?

410
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,015
Yeah, what's up?

411
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,216
Can you drive?

412
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,518
We got to get to more beer
before the party starts.

413
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:32,852
Yeah.

414
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,154
OK, but I don't want to be
late for picking up the Alphas.

415
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,389
Is Dave still in the basement?

416
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,757
Him and Kelly.

417
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,091
- Kelly's here?
- Yeah.

418
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,027
She brought him some computer
printouts or something.

419
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,361
Just what he needs.

420
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,496
I'll be right back.
Good.

421
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,296
Thanks, man.

[Chanting in different language]

423
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,481
That should do it.

424
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:02,281
What?

425
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,551
What was that noise?

426
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,052
Wow, Jeff.

427
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,187
Hey, Kel.

428
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,290
That was some spell that I
found with Erickson's papers.

429
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,226
You have to say it a thousand
times to make it work.

430
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,429
So, uh, we faked
it with overdose.

431
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,467
What are you doing
messing around with spells?

432
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,503
What kind of spell?

433
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:24,303
Well, listen to this.

What is it, Mistress?

442
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,132
It's a conjuration, Grengol.

443
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,602
It's coming.

444
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,572
It's coming.

445
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,575
I'll be coming.

Mistress, take me with you.

the mortals with sex and lust.

Either you can
stay here all night

or you can come with me to get

01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:50,026
The price for conjuring
a demon is a soul,

1293
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:53,963
And I claim this one.

1294
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:55,164
You can't do that!

1295
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,099
I can do anything I want.

1296
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,867
I'm the demon.

1297
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:04,508
And besides, with his disregard
for authority and morality,

1298
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,343
We would have had him
eventually anyway.

1299
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,745
Well, wait.

1300
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:13,349
Are you trying to tell me that
you'd try to save one who would

1301
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,952
Send you to hell in his place?

1302
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,086
Yeah.

1303
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:17,887
Yeah, I am.

1304
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,760
Well, I'm glad you
brought me here.

1305
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,262
I had fun.

1306
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:33,336
And to show my
appreciation, there.

1307
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:38,141
Now the school records show that
you get an A in parapsychology.

1308
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,910
And you get the Corvette.

1309
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:45,248
And all memory of him is gone
forever, except for the people

1310
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:46,716
In this room.

1311
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,553
How can you do that?

1312
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,487
I'm a demon, silly.

1313
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:52,321
It's easy.

1314
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,431
No, thanks.

1315
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:03,232
Think I'll pass.

1316
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,471
Have it your way, mortal.

1317
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:09,939
[Whip sound]

1318
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:13,442
[Rumbling, banging]

1319
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:25,589
Thank God it's over.

1320
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,024
No, it's only just beginning.

1321
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,831
Hey, look what I found.

1322
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,299
Heh.

1323
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,304
Thanks, but no thanks.

1324
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:42,706
Geez, it suits me.

1325
01:15:42,806 --> 01:15:43,640
Hey, Dave.

1326
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,909
Want to get a brewski?

1327
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:46,910
[Chuckling]

1328
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,077
Yeah, let's get out of here.

1329
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:48,878
Come on.

1330
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,847
[Inaudible].

1331
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:51,848
Hey, yo.

1332
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:52,816
Bitch!

1333
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:54,317
Oh, right on cue.

1334
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,785
[Crashing]

1335
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,286
The concert's over.

1336
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,761
Enjoying yourself, Grengol?

1337
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:09,599
Mm, I haven't had a break
in centuries, Mistress.

1338
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:11,968
I thought you'd enjoy it.

1339
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,571
Mistress, now that the mortals
have the stuff for conjuration,

1340
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:19,375
Does that mean you'll
be leaving again soon?

1341
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:20,877
I doubt it.

1342
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:24,580
They didn't seem
eager to have me back.

1343
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,049
I wonder why.

1344
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:28,017
Beats me.

1345
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:30,053
More champagne.

1346
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:30,987
No, thank you, Mistress.

1347
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,022
I think I've had enough.

1348
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:33,890
[Giggles]

1349
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,691
Me too.

1350
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:39,228
Time for more entertainment.

1351
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,798
Again?

1352
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:42,999
Uh, of course.
Again.

1353
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:43,867
Again.

1354
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,935
Silly me.

1355
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:46,736
Slave!

1356
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:52,876
(WEAKLY) Yes.

1357
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,945
Yeah, you rang, Mistress?

1358
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:56,880
Yes.

1359
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,314
I need more servicing.

1360
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:04,587
And get rid of that.

1361
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:14,898
But... but Mistress, we've
already done it 20 times today.

1362
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:17,701
It's never enough.

1363
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:20,469
You always wanted more sex.

1364
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,471
Get it up, mortal.

1365
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,941
It's time to use it or lose it.

1366
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,817
[Grunting]

1367
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:11,988
[Music playing]

1368
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:02,498
MAN: Damn!

1369
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,500
What the hell was that?
