back in two weeks

7
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,837
- for a teeth cleaning, okay?
- Okay.

8
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,341
Thank you so much
and Merry Christmas.

9
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,603
Thank you, you too.

10
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,128
Scarlet, Scarlet!

11
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,280
Mrs. Hoffman had to leave
for a very important meeting,

12
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:44,696
but she asked me to tell you

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,326
that Hamlet's cough
hasn't gotten any better.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,831
She'd like to refer him
for a CT scan.

15
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,704
Do you need a CT scan, Hamlet?
I don't think so either.

16
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,445
Has she been giving him
his antibiotic?

17
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,857
The night nurse decided it
wasn't working.

18
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,187
The night nurse?

19
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,145
Mrs. Hoffman's job is very
demanding.

20
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,016
She needs her sleep.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,646
Did she mentioned if she was
giving him anything else?

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,106
He's looking very colorful.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,152
Uh, yeah, that's from
the turmeric.

24
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,157
Okay, we need to remind
Mrs. Hoffman

25
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,917
that if Hamlet doesn't
get over his kennel cough

26
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,181
he's not gonna be able to go to

27
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,354
Switzerland with her
for Christmas.

28
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,337
I'll let Fabiana know right now.

29
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,164
Oh, Mrs. Hoffman
also wanted to know

30
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:19,818
if she could do something,
anything

31
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,361
that could get his muzzle
back to normal.

32
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,257
Give her a bottle of that
oatmeal shampoo.

33
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,694
If it doesn't work,
just tell her to lean into it.

34
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,392
Buy Hamlet a turmeric
yellow jacket and booties.

35
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,196
Everyone in St. Moritz
will be dying to know

36
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,308
who does his highlights.

37
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,049
You, my dear, are a genius.

38
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,965
A genius whose train
leaves in 90 minutes.

39
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,419
Justin, can you take over
please?

40
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:40,360
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,977
Uptown Animal Clinic,
David speaking.

42
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,193
Oui? Oui!

43
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,933
Oui. Doc!

44
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,413
Mr. Lefarge is on the phone.

45
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:50,762
Can you take a message?

46
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,329
It's an emergency,

47
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,023
but from what I can
understand, they're

48
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,750
about to take off
for Paris and Mr. Lefarge

49
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,726
forgot to bring Bardot's
health certificate.

50
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,033
I failed ninth grade French,
so we're at kind of an impasse.

51
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:21,663
I'll take that.

52
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,274
Uptown Animal Clinic.
Oh, hi Virginia.

53
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:27,930
Doc, Milo's angel of an after
school teacher is on the line.

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,953
Virginia, I'm so sorry.
I'm on my way, okay?

55
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,457
- Bye!
- She's on her way.

56
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,937
Merry Christmas.

57
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,333
Hi, Riley.

58
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,641
Hi pretty girl.
Merry Christmas.

59
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,427
And that's your gift,
a week of vacation.

60
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,950
I didn't think you had it
in you.

61
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,710
I feel like since you've
opened the practice

62
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,408
you've taken off, what,
four days in a row?

63
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,912
Three. But the vet that worked
with my dad just retired

64
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,392
and she always covered
Christmas,

65
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,086
so we're doing it in Vermont
this year.

66
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,458
I thought Christmas
in New York was kind of

67
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,354
your family's thing.
Well, who knows?

68
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:03,139
Maybe you'll find your dream
guy nestled in a snow drift.

69
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,793
Well, the whole point
of this trip is

70
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,807
to spend time with my dad,
not troll for babes.

71
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,753
You've always been good
at multitasking,

72
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,494
but maybe not at that
particular task.

73
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,149
The only man in my life
is 10 years old,

74
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:15,003
and I don't see that
changing anytime soon.

75
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:18,589
So call me if you need
me literally any time.

76
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:21,462
Hang on. I forgot the most
important thing,

77
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:22,636
a Christmas hug.

78
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,381
- Be good, stay safe.
- Okay, take care.

79
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,555
Bye.

80
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,038
Okay, let's get back
to business.

81
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,876
- Oh...
- Hello.

82
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,052
It's really coming down
out there.

83
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,881
Hi, my name is Scarlet Miller.
I'm here to pick up an order.

84
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,455
Sure,
let me get that right for you.

85
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,928
Oh, my goodness,
I cannot believe

86
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,973
you have manchego back in stock.

87
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,864
- Yeah, just got them back.
- Can I get a quarter pound?

88
00:03:56,888 --> 00:04:00,414
And one of these Brie,
this goat cheese.

89
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,329
We have a very long
train ride ahead of us.

90
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,503
No judgment.

91
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:09,292
- These are so beautiful.
- Yay, I'm glad you like them.

92
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:12,164
Thank you so much.

93
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,123
Nothing like a New York
Christmas, right?

94
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:15,448
Thanks for coming.
Merry Christmas.

95
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,995
Thank you, Merry Christmas.

96
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,569
Down the road ran
the gingerbread man

97
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,093
with the horse and the cow.

98
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,139
- Ran and ran until he came to...
- I'm here.

99
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,097
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- No, it's okay.

100
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,162
Milo was telling me you
have big Christmas plans.

101
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,492
Do we have to go to Vermont?

102
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,826
Can't grandpa just come here?

103
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,713
Yes, we do.
And no, he can't.

104
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,845
But all my friends
are in New York.

105
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,819
It's gonna be great,
unless we miss our train,

106
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,546
which leaves in a few minutes,
so we gotta go, buddy. Oh.

107
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,549
This is for you.

108
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,135
Thank you so much
for putting up with

109
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,204
Milo's punctuality
challenged mother.

110
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,119
Oh, it's fine.
Have a great Christmas.

111
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,054
Thank you. We don't deserve you.
Merry Christmas.

112
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,819
- Merry Christmas.
- Come on, buddy.

113
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,473
Let's see how fast
those shoes can go.

114
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,823
- Okay.
- No, no, this way!

115
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,660
You excited, buddy?

116
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,879
- Yes.
- There he is.

117
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,925
Hey.
My two favorite people.

118
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,709
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, grandpa.

119
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,581
- How you doing?
- Hi, dad.

120
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,366
- Hi sweetheart.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

121
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,909
I was afraid you weren't gonna
make it.

122
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,543
Finally caught the last train
out, so.

123
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:29,546
- Big case?
- A very difficult cat client.

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,548
They were shocked and appalled

125
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,376
that their sphynx kitten
had wrinkles.

126
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,813
They wanted to take him
for anti-aging treatment.

127
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,425
Oh, boy. I wouldn't last a week
with an owner like that.

128
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,688
Oh, yeah, your clients just
treat their dog's fleas

129
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,517
with sheep dip and think
that corralling barn cats

130
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,693
for their vaccines is part
of your job description.

131
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:51,002
Try to remember, you loved
being my barn cat whisperer.

132
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,049
- But I'm glad you're here.
- Me too. Oh.

133
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,616
All right, who's hungry?

134
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,270
Starving.
Could we get sushi delivered?

135
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,534
Well, there's really no
delivery around here,

136
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:05,365
and no sushi, but there is
spaghetti and meatballs at home.

137
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,192
Mom tried to make
meatballs once.

138
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,630
They came out burnt
and raw at the same time.

139
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,241
Yeah, pretty much sums it up.

140
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,506
I cannot believe you made
meatballs.

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,334
I am so happy right now.

142
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, I still know the way
to my little girl's heart.

143
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,355
Why don't we stop at
the store on the way home

144
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,993
and get some decorations?

145
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,429
And that way after dinner,

146
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,388
you guys can help me
deck the halls.

147
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,191
What happened to all your
Christmas stuff?

148
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,295
This is the first time we've
had Christmas in Vermont

149
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,742
in a while, so I thought
maybe we should get

150
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,789
some new bobbles and bangles,
and a tree.

151
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,028
Well, you know we're here
till the day after Christmas,

152
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,099
so that leaves us plenty
of time for celebrating.

153
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,493
I wanna get the biggest
tree there is!

154
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,542
Grandpa, they ran out of
Christmas decorations.

155
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,415
We sold out of Christmas
decorations weeks ago.

156
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,939
I'm sorry, buddy. I should've
been more on top of this.

157
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,178
Dad, don't worry about it,
we're just happy to be here.

158
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:03,727
Okay? Milo, did I tell you
about grandpa's meatballs?

159
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,425
They're legendary.

160
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,557
People actually tell tales
about them?

161
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,211
Well, if they don't,
they should.

162
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,561
I bet I can eat six.

163
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,303
Probably.
Mom is always hungry.

164
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,870
Don't I know it.

165
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,654
I was the one responsible
for feeding her

166
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,351
for the first 18 years.

167
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,180
So, let's get you home to dinner

168
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,009
and me home to dinner before
I take a bite out of your arm.

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,055
Come on, let's go.

170
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,361
- Thanks, see you.
- Bye.

171
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,069
Don't get it on your school
uniform,

172
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,803
'cause it'll be hard to get out.

173
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,631
Oh, scientists make
potions? Okay.

174
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,242
Are you on Christmas
vacation too, grandpa?

175
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,723
Well, since Dr. Ross retired,

176
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,116
I'm really the only vet
for around 50 miles,

177
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,467
so I don't really get
to take a vacation.

178
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,990
But at least we're lucky tonight

179
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,764
we haven't had any emergency
phone calls.

180
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,384
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

181
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,433
Ah.
Well, I guess I spoke too soon.

182
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,092
Dr. Miller.

183
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,486
Yeah. Okay, uh...

184
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,899
Yeah, don't worry, I'll be there
in about a half an hour.

185
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,620
- This is my favorite meal.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:14,842
All right, I gotta run.

187
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,931
Why don't you guys get
unpacked, get settled,

188
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,672
I'll be back before you know it.

189
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:19,847
Where are you going?

190
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,544
Well, the Jacksons have a heifer

191
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,958
that's in labor up at the farm,

192
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,242
so I've gotta go help out.

193
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,114
Are you going too, mom?

194
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,005
Your mom could have done this
when she was 12 years old,

195
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,727
but she's probably a little
out of practice by now.

196
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,226
Probably doesn't even
know which end of the cow

197
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,250
the calf comes out of.

198
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,036
I wouldn't go that far.

199
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,212
Oh, when was the last
time you touched a cow?

200
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,169
It might've been vet school,

201
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,384
but I was great with them.

202
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,539
It's like I'm part Holstein.

203
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,843
Oh, well then, you're telling me

204
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,046
you could get this calf
delivered?

205
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,613
- Sure.
- Good.

206
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,329
That'll give me time
with the big guy here

207
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,853
and we can break out
some Christmas cookies.

208
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,922
And mom can have
some when she comes back.

209
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,271
Right.

210
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,360
Wait, what?

211
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,797
Right behind you is the mudroom

212
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,078
and there's a pair of coveralls
in there.

213
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,321
You should go try them on.

214
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,806
Okay.

215
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:11,463
Good. This is gonna be really
good for your mom.

216
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,553
She'll get back
in the swing of things.

217
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,605
- They're a little roomy.
- It's okays, sweetheart.

218
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,930
We can take you to the store
tomorrow

219
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,434
and get you suited up.

220
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,218
Meantime, I'll go
take care of this.

221
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,830
- It's probably for the best.
- No, no, no. I'm gonna go.

222
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,963
I'm sure I brought something
with me that'll make do.

223
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,490
Okay, I can do this.

224
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,537
I can do this.
Right?

225
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,279
Nope, I haven't done
this since vet school.

226
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,889
Nope.

227
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,675
I should Google this.
Uh...

228
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,502
Okay.
No, I remember it.

229
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,287
This is easy. This is easy.

230
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,376
Okay, okay.

231
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,726
Ropes.

232
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,861
You have faith in me, right?

233
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,427
I can do this.

234
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,951
I can do this.

235
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,561
There, oh, yeah.

236
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,171
Can I do this?

237
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,218
All right, here we go.

238
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,550
Hey, dad.

239
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,466
Oh, he was the cutest little
bull calf.

240
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,164
I wish you could have seen him.

241
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,471
Of course I tried the ropes.

242
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,779
I was so nervous at first,
but it was so much fun.

243
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,479
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
stop at the store

244
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,177
and then I'll be home, okay?

245
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,049
All right, bye.

246
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,451
I know, I know, you close
in 10 minutes,

247
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,148
but I really have to find
something

248
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,126
to make my dad's house
a little bit more festive.

249
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,326
Just don't spread that mess
around my nice clean shop.

250
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Never.

251
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,038
- Oh! Sorry.
- Whoa there, cowgirl.

252
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,406
I'm just trying to make it home

253
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,954
without a side trip to the ER.

254
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,738
It's just been one of those
days.

255
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,566
I actually kind of
want these too

256
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,544
because does it look like
I've had an easy day?

257
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,570
I guess it's relative.
I started mine at 6:30.

258
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,137
- Six o'clock.
- Yeah.

259
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,991
But I've been going
nonstop ever since then

260
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,695
dealing with every single sore
throat and

261
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,273
sprained ankle you can
imagine in a 20 mile radius.

262
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,087
I've been daydreaming about
these bad boys

263
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,862
ever since my lunch break,
which I worked through.

264
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,733
Probably only something a
doctor would understand.

265
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,932
Well, what do I look like?

266
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,717
I give up.

267
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,457
A doctor.
I'm a doctor too.

268
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,068
I'm an actual doctor.

269
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,939
Like, medical school graduate
type doctor.

270
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,028
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,900
- Where'd you go?
- Cornell.

272
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,728
Well, I went to Cornell
Vet School,

273
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,208
which is actually harder
to get into

274
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:12,601
than Cornell Med School.

275
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,429
And it's in Ithaca,
where it snows

276
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:17,388
eight months out of the year
and only the strong survive.

277
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,434
Oh, you're Dr. Miller's
daughter?

278
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,438
I am, but you can just call me
Dr. Miller.

279
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,788
Oh, um...
This is a little awkward.

280
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,618
Yeah, you know us vets,
we have a saying.

281
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:30,924
Real doctors treat more than

282
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,752
- one species.
- Huh.

283
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,276
Just this morning
I was performing surgery

284
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,844
to remove a peach pit from
a Yorkie's small intestine.

285
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,497
Where do you get peaches
in December?

286
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,891
And a newborn Holstein
calf is alive tonight

287
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,851
because of my real doctor
skills with a calf jack.

288
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,288
Okay.
I'll let you win.

289
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,203
You know what, never mind.

290
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,833
You don't need to be a doctor
to know that

291
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,336
that stuff will kill you.

292
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,951
Nice to meet you.

293
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:10,398
Five days until Christmas!

294
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,140
- Six days until we go home.
- Oh.

295
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,533
- Oh, hey, dad.
- Hi, grandpa.

296
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,275
Wow, I can't get over how
great the place looks.

297
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,626
Yeah, Santa must've sent
over a few elves last night

298
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
with a flare for interior
design.

299
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,630
Yeah, I'd say so.

300
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,851
Oh, so I met a friend of yours.
I didn't catch his name,

301
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,114
but he made sure I knew
it started with doctor.

302
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:37,599
Don't tell me, tall,
dark hair, nice smile,

303
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,993
- kind of a good looking guy?
- He's fine, I guess.

304
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,647
That's Josh Foster.
He's a good egg.

305
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,694
- I'll take your word for it.
- What are we doing today?

306
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,392
Well, the shelter is putting
on an adoption event.

307
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,394
They need some folks to
check out the animals

308
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,353
before they go
to their new homes.

309
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,920
- Hm.
- You up for it, doc?

310
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:56,966
Oh, sure, as long
as I'm not needed elsewhere,

311
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,490
because you know,
after last night

312
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,580
I am very much in demand
as a cow obstetrician.

313
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,366
Oh, of course, yes.

314
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,065
And Duane Wright just
got a new Clydesdale mare

315
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,676
and they need to have
a wellness check,

316
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,113
so I will go take care of that.

317
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,592
I've never seen a Clydesdale

318
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,551
except for once in a commercial.

319
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,640
Well, go get dressed

320
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,555
and you're gonna be
my assistant today.

321
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,601
Ooh, that sounds fun, buddy.

322
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,430
- What a great kid.
- He's the sweetest.

323
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,004
I guess I'll have to
break in my new

324
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,781
coveralls some other time.

325
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,847
Well, you could stay in
town a little longer, do some

326
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,569
more farm calls, and you'll get
those duds broken in.

327
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,485
I wish I could, but you know
I have to be back by the 26th,

328
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,966
and even then I'm gonna have
to pull a few overnights

329
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,358
just to get caught up.

330
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,901
Oh, that's a pretty
challenging life

331
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,274
you've set up for yourself.

332
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,537
You know, you might
think about moving back.

333
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,104
- To Vermont?
- Yeah.

334
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,237
There's plenty of room
for you and Milo, and...

335
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,586
Dad, we're doing fine.

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,196
Nobody's denying that.

337
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:57,070
I'm thinking about retiring,

338
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,507
and this job was tough
when I was your age,

339
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,813
but I ain't getting any younger.

340
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,294
Well, you definitely need
to hire a new associate vet.

341
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:08,211
Or you could stay on and help

342
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,300
and eventually take over
the practice.

343
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,346
I don't know, dad.

344
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,436
You know there's no one
I'd rather work with,

345
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,569
but Milo and I are New
Yorkers now, it's our home.

346
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:26,447
Yeah, I just...

347
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,164
You know, I've always had it
in my head that

348
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,320
you and I would work
side by side one day.

349
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,670
I just think it's wrong

350
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,934
that there are so many miles
between us.

351
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:39,199
Why don't you move in with us
in New York?

352
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,897
You could work in my practice
part time if you want.

353
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,639
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.

354
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,053
I'm probably getting
to be a little too old

355
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,209
to pull up my roots.

356
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,002
Hey, guys.

357
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,005
How are you?

358
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,053
Oh, you found a new friend.

359
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:10,273
Oh, look at this baby.

360
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:11,579
So cute.

361
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,019
Daddy, I want this one.

362
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,152
Good treat there.

363
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,852
Hi.
Hi, what's your name?

364
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,334
Oh, hi Banjo.
How's it going?

365
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,119
How's it going?

366
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,125
Don't let them get you down,
Banjo.

367
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,606
You're a VIP too.

368
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,391
See?
Camera loves you.

369
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,393
- Yeah.
- Hi.

370
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,309
- You're looking much cleaner.
- Hi.

371
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:49,095
Uh, thanks.

372
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,184
I'm Josh Foster, by the way.

373
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,576
Scarlet Miller.

374
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,577
Who's this big guy?

375
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,710
This is Banjo.

376
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,886
Hey, Banjo.

377
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,062
I can't believe he
hasn't been adopted yet.

378
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,022
I guess no one thought he'd
be as much fun as a puppy.

379
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:07,200
Yeah, don't you hate it when
people make snap judgements?

380
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:09,680
Well, it was a pleasure to
see you again, Dr. Miller.

381
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,334
You too, Dr. Foster.

382
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,602
- Hi, Dr. Foster.
- Hey.

383
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,430
- How are you?
- Good.

384
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,954
- Who is this?
- This is Tots the corgi.

385
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,608
Oh, Tot.

386
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:26,581
Well, it was good to see you
again. Stay well.

387
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,915
You too.

388
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,919
Do you want
to see one of the dogs

389
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,356
- I saw at the adoption event?
- Yes!

390
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,752
His name is Banjo and no one
was paying attention to him

391
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,015
even though he's like the
sweetest boy.

392
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,451
Can we adopt him?

393
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,063
Honey, you know we can't.

394
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,716
But what if nobody else does
either?

395
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,547
Oh, don't worry, Ace,
he'll find his person.

396
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:54,551
Christmas makes things
like that happen.

397
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,833
Yeah, thanks for making dinner,
dad.

398
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,206
I could get used to this.

399
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,904
I wish you would.

400
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,561
- Mm.
- Dr. Miller. Yeah.

401
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,520
How long?

402
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,043
Is it getting worse or better?

403
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,655
My daughter?
Yes, she is visiting.

404
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:15,833
Yeah, Cornell Vet
School, top of her class.

405
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,359
Oh, I don't know if I should
send her over on a house call.

406
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,231
She may be a little out of
her depth.

407
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,713
- What?
- Yeah, I know, city vets,

408
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,280
they all need a staff of 10

409
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,974
and a surgical suite to clip
a toenail.

410
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,283
That's not true.

411
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,634
Well, now she's being stubborn.

412
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,984
I think she's insisting.

413
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,769
Okay.
Well, yeah.

414
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,728
I'll send her right over.

415
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:45,254
All right, I guess
I'll go get my coveralls.

416
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,995
Oh no, you won't need those.

417
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,953
This is a dog that was adopted

418
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,520
from the shelter event today.

419
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,914
As of a couple hours
ago all of those animals

420
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,742
were as healthy as
little horses.

421
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,963
Yeah. Just run down to Josh
Foster's and check it out.

422
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,314
- Josh Foster's?
- Yeah.

423
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,316
I didn't know he was in
the market for a dog,

424
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,361
but apparently he
picked one out.

425
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,929
Well, there was a litter
of golden retriever pups.

426
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,236
I guess he snagged one of those.

427
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,865
Well, couldn't you just
take him up to

428
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,456
the 24 hour clinic in
Burlington?

429
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,329
Oh, I wouldn't wish that on
my worst enemy

430
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:20,159
on a night like this on a
highway in freezing rain.

431
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:23,074
Oh, but your daughter,
that's another story?

432
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,642
Come on, Josh is just down
the hill,

433
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,601
and the van has nice new tires,

434
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,169
and you're a Vermont girl.

435
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,261
Okay, fine.
I'll go.

436
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,414
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

437
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,004
I won't do anything crazy
with him.

438
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,920
We won't stick marshmallows
on a candy cane

439
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,314
and stir our hot chocolate
with it.

440
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,447
Yeah, we definitely
won't do that.

441
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,147
What?
It's just tinted lip balm.

442
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,888
It's cold outside.

443
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,934
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

444
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,023
Good luck.

445
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,982
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

446
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,549
Be careful.

447
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:06,813
Tinted lip balm.

448
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,429
Come on, Scarlet,

449
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,301
it's just a little freezing
rain.

450
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,000
You used to do this all the
time.

451
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,785
Okay.

452
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,875
No, no.

453
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,922
Ugh, this would not be happening
if you were back in New York

454
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,839
where people actually
bring their animals to you.

455
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,754
Well, now there's a concept.

456
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:42,241
Yes, Jade.
Okay, good night.

457
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,591
No, no, no.

458
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,245
I'm on the edge of my seat,
I promise.

459
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,203
Yes, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

460
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,074
Okay.
All right, bye.

461
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,122
Um, Dr. Miller,
thank you for coming.

462
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,341
Hi.

463
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:00,607
Sorry, please come in, come in.

464
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:04,654
So when I brought him home,
he was great actually,

465
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,222
and then I went upstairs
and I worked on the computer,

466
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,036
and when I came down and he was
like this.

467
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,661
Banjo?

468
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,229
Well, yeah. I wasn't really
looking for a dog,

469
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,971
but there's just something
about him.

470
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,581
Well, Christmas has a way

471
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,627
of making things like
that happen.

472
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,979
Let's see what's going on.

473
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,677
How you doing?

474
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,465
Good boy, good boy.

475
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,467
Well, he's a little dehydrated.

476
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:43,954
Come here.
Good boy.

477
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:46,479
Good boy.

478
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,613
Heart and lungs sound fine.

479
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,920
A couple of minutes ago
it was crazy high, like 130.

480
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:56,010
Well, that's normal
if you're a dog.

481
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,101
Oh, belly's a little tender.

482
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,021
I have been hearing
a lot about parvo.

483
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,067
We mostly see parvo in
young dogs and puppies.

484
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,982
No offense, sweetheart.

485
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,595
Aw.

486
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,119
If you don't mind, I'd
like to take a look around,

487
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,947
see if he left us some clues.

488
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,428
Yeah, knock yourself out.

489
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,659
Wow, what's all this?

490
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,009
Okay, please pardon the mess.

491
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:42,230
Uh, this is a Buche de Noel,
a Yule Log Cake.

492
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,276
At least, it will be.
Um...

493
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,603
Yeah, I thought I'd try my
hand at it, surprise the staff.

494
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,716
I am not done yet,

495
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,108
so go easy.

496
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,287
- Mystery solved.
- What is it?

497
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,685
- I did not give that to him.
- Mm-hm.

498
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:06,472
Well, he got it
and he enjoyed it.

499
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,474
Wow, he ate all of it.

500
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,084
- That is really good.
- Yeah?

501
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:11,453
- Yeah.
- Does it pass the test?

502
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:12,478
Mm-hm.

503
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,827
Oh, but his poor belly.

504
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,916
Yeah.
We'll get him fixed up.

505
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,304
So Milo, you know,
I think I've told you

506
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,096
that when your mom was your age,

507
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,491
I used to take her with me
on house calls.

508
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,120
I used to take her with me
to the farms

509
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,711
to take care of the animals

510
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:33,237
and she learned a lot about
veterinary.

511
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,763
So I was wondering, maybe
you'd like to come along.

512
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,594
Something on your mind, Ace?

513
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,944
I still don't have a
Christmas present for mom.

514
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,468
Can we go to the all night
drug store?

515
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,949
Well, there's not one
of those around here,

516
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,778
but what do you think
she'd like?

517
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,824
Well, you know how crazy
mom is about Christmas.

518
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,652
I want to buy her something

519
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,916
to remind her of Christmas
all the other times of year.

520
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,092
Okay. Well, I'll tell you what,

521
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,443
why don't we finish
our hot chocolate

522
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:08,447
and then I will help you make
her something for Christmas.

523
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,364
- Mm.
- Mm.

524
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,453
Mm-hm.

525
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,780
I'll give him something
to settle his stomach

526
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:23,374
and then I'll leave you to get
back to your Buche de Noel.

527
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,028
You can't drive home in this.

528
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,988
It's not far, I'll be fine.

529
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:32,166
And get up that hill?
No.

530
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,344
Yeah, it was already pretty
slippery on the way down.

531
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,078
Yeah, and if you bang up
your dad's van,

532
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:39,869
you're gonna be in some serious

533
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,393
grounded for the rest of
senior year kind of trouble.

534
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,048
And there is no way
I'm missing prom.

535
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,742
Seriously, the storm
is gonna blow over

536
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,051
in about an hour or so,

537
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:51,228
and I just made you
a cup of coffee.

538
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,018
Thank you.

539
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,237
So, just relax and wait it out.

540
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,458
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,333
That's it.
Don't be afraid of the hammer.

542
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,380
I'll get it lined up for you.
Okay, go ahead.

543
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,904
Good, good.
Good.

544
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,777
All right.
Really, that's great. Okay.

545
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,430
The nail went in kind of
crooked.

546
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,128
Oh, you know what?
That's okay.

547
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,302
It gives it character.

548
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,044
I just want it to be perfect.

549
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah, I know, Milo.
But in my experience,

550
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,919
character trumps perfection
every time.

551
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,967
All right, so let's get to
painting.

552
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:35,534
You want to use green?

553
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,842
So I'm obviously the worst dog
dad ever.

554
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,151
What? I can't even keep Banjo
out of trouble

555
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,326
for less than a day.

556
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,458
It was an accident.

557
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,784
And you wouldn't believe
the things

558
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,723
I've seen owners do on purpose.

559
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,508
- Like what?
- There was this one lady...

560
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,858
who wanted to straighten her

561
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:57,991
poodles hair because she wanted
him to match

562
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,708
her daughters
for the Christmas card picture.

563
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:00,926
You're just trying to make me
feel better.

564
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,605
- It did.
- How did that work out?

565
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,087
Not well, as you can imagine.

566
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,526
And I have had my share of
parental fails.

567
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Sure.

568
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:13,746
One time a while back,

569
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,225
when I was even later than usual

570
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,140
picking my baby up from
daycare...

571
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,273
What, they had already
cleaned the kennels?

572
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:23,799
No, not my dog.
My kid, my actual human son.

573
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:27,411
- Oh, you have a son?
- Yeah.

574
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,762
Are you surprised?

575
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:35,245
No. I kind of thought of
you as just, you know,

576
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,858
pretty girl in a big
city, hitting the clubs,

577
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,232
breaking all the guys' hearts.

578
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,881
Well, until they start letting
you leave

579
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,254
a little boy at coat check...

580
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,429
What's his name?

581
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,867
Milo.

582
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,043
Milo, like
"The Phantom Tollbooth?"

583
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,003
Yes!
No one ever gets that.

584
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,657
It was my favorite book
as a kid.

585
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,528
Mine too!

586
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,922
Oh, my goodness.

587
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,272
My husband always thought
it was an unusual name,

588
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:05,711
but he eventually went along
with it.

589
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,017
He knew better than to
argue with a pregnant lady.

590
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,107
Well, he's a smart man.

591
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:15,155
So, how's he liking Vermont
so far?

592
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,507
Um...

593
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,641
Well, he loved it.

594
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:28,429
He passed away eight years ago,

595
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:31,780
just a couple of weeks
before Christmas.

596
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,174
- Milo was two.
- I'm sorry.

597
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,871
That's awful.

598
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,961
Yeah. Yeah, it was bad.

599
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,878
We were fresh out of vet
school, just moved to the city,

600
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,012
and after it happened,

601
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,144
my dad wanted me to move back
to Vermont,

602
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:53,323
but I just, I couldn't
imagine giving up so easy.

603
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:56,892
So I just holed up in the
apartment for the first week

604
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,983
and had groceries
and diapers delivered

605
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:03,116
from the bodega downstairs.

606
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,162
So, eventually I bundled up
the kid

607
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,295
and we took the subway
to Chinatown

608
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,863
where we ate our weight
in dumplings.

609
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,603
And then we walked up
to little Italy

610
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,083
to see the Christmas lights.

611
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,479
And the next day
we took the subway

612
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,656
to see the holiday
windows at Fifth Avenue.

613
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,224
And then pretty soon we
were taking the three train

614
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,400
to the nine like it was nothing.

615
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,315
Well, it couldn't have
been easy then,

616
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,925
and even now.

617
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,623
Yeah, but we've got it down
to a science.

618
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,585
So what about you?
When do you ever get a break?

619
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,587
You know, if you wanted
to go for a run

620
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,545
or on a date or something?

621
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,852
Well, I'll worry

622
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,724
about my cardiovascular health

623
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:48,161
and my love life once Milo
heads off for college.

624
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,599
But I'm fine.

625
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,993
We're fine.
Ask anyone.

626
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,385
Oh, I will.

627
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,175
It is still coming down
pretty hard.

628
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,395
Do you want to just help me make

629
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,180
some of the cakes
for the veterans home?

630
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,965
You don't have to do
anything, just supervise.

631
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,228
That's more my speed.

632
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,883
Okay.
Here, follow me.

633
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,503
- Is that mom?
- Yes, it is.

634
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,985
- Is this Josie?
- That is Josie the kitty.

635
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,279
You know, your mom used to
decorate the Christmas tree

636
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,685
with kitty toys and kitty
treats.

637
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,079
And by morning, all the
treats would be gone.

638
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,909
- Who's this?
- That's grandma.

639
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:45,566
- She was pretty.
- She was pretty, yeah.

640
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,140
I think this one got into the
Christmas pictures by accident.

641
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,049
Let's see.
No, you know what?

642
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,503
That was actually Christmas Eve.

643
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,487
I got a call
from the Marris farm

644
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,271
that one of their mares
was colicky.

645
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,360
- What is that?
- Uh...

646
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:58,854
It's like a really bad
tummy ache.

647
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,581
How did you make her better?

648
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,715
Well, believe it or not,
I put a tube up her nose.

649
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,019
That's crazy!

650
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,804
Yeah, the horse thought so too.

651
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,216
Good thing your mom was with me.

652
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,937
What did she do?

653
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:12,462
Well, she rubbed the horse's
neck in just the right place

654
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,900
and she sang Christmas carols.

655
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:17,380
And before you know it, the
horse was all calmed down.

656
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,687
I didn't know mom knew
how to calm down a horse.

657
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,863
Yeah, after we got the horse
calmed down

658
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:24,953
it was too late to cook,
so we decided to go out

659
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,390
and have a Christmas Eve
ice cream supper.

660
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,264
Let's see, what else?

661
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,006
Oh, wow.
Who's this?

662
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,766
Bet you recognize those three
characters.

663
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,575
It's me and mom and dad!

664
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,491
I wish I could remember
being with him that day.

665
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,494
Or any other day, actually.

666
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,062
Well, you know, your dad,

667
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,759
when he finished building
a snowman,

668
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,197
he built a snow dog
and a snow kitty

669
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,981
and three little
snow guinea pigs.

670
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:55,201
Mom said the only thing
he loved more than animals

671
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,419
was me and her.

672
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,075
Yeah, that about sums up
your dad.

673
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,294
And your grandpa, too.

674
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:06,690
So, let's pick a picture
for your mom's frame.

675
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,823
- Okay.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

676
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,478
That's a good one too.

677
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:13,219
- I think this is the best.
- Okay.

678
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,916
When mom looks at it,
it'll be like

679
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,483
she's with you every day.

680
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,269
Well, you know, if I had you

681
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,619
and your mom
with me all the time,

682
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,752
it would be like Christmas
every day.

683
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,605
Well, I can't tell if it's...
Maybe it's too cold?

684
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,153
It's supposed to be holding
together.

685
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,981
You got me.

686
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:39,158
I'm not exactly what you
would call a gifted baker.

687
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:42,639
We order in a lot, especially
on days when I work late,

688
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,337
which is pretty much always.

689
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,904
Ah-ha!

690
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,818
Oh, there you go.

691
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,821
Uh, that's not half bad.

692
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,824
I think it's great that your
kid is able to see his parent,

693
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,436
you know, working hard
doing something they love.

694
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,135
Give me a job.
Give me something to do.

695
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,571
- I wanna help.
- Uh...

696
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,269
This was tough enough,
and you said

697
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,532
you can't bake your way out
of a paper bag. No.

698
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,249
Well, you shouldn't bake
in a paper bag.

699
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,189
It's a fire hazard,
everyone knows that.

700
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,321
Come on, give me
something to do!

701
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,369
Uh...
Okay.

702
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,327
So these, um,

703
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,677
these are white chocolate
with food coloring,

704
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,332
and we basically just have
to decorate the top now.

705
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,465
- Grab a piping bag.
- Okay.

706
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,467
You can do the red berries.

707
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,543
You're right, this
is harder than it looks.

708
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,520
Wow, you're-you're
an artist, too.

709
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,107
How is it that
we never crossed paths

710
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,567
at Coolidge High?

711
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,916
Um...

712
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,486
Probably because I went to
Bronx Science.

713
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,184
- Wait, so that means...
- I'm a New Yorker.

714
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,839
So what brought you here
to Vermont?

715
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,643
So, after my residency,
I joined a two year

716
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,947
program where
you go and you work

717
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,757
in an underserved rural area,

718
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,977
and then they wipe out
your student debt.

719
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,370
I realized I really started
enjoying my life here.

720
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,111
I-I have such an insane
schedule.

721
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,002
I work full time
at the office, and then I spend

722
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,438
another day and
a half at the veterans home.

723
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,377
I just love living here.

724
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,946
Everything from like the air,
to the trees, to the stars.

725
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,514
And then also everyone
here is just so nice.

726
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:17,386
Just a wild guess,

727
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,606
how many of these nice people

728
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,695
are female?

729
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,350
I guess probably...

730
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:27,048
Yeah, so the women in
Vermont are very friendly.

731
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,050
Okay, so why did you leave?

732
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,791
Um...

733
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:34,708
Well, I didn't want to stay

734
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,405
in one place for the rest
of my life.

735
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:40,061
New York was just so
strange, and hard, and weird

736
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:44,370
that conquering it made
me feel like a superhero.

737
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:47,503
I think I fell in love
with that feeling,

738
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,766
and then the city along with it.

739
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,725
Being here with my dad is great,

740
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,249
but New York during
the holidays?

741
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,382
I just remember icy sidewalks

742
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,253
and trying to build a snowman
out of slush

743
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,168
from the fire escape.

744
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:01,742
And then I would look out
the window

745
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,694
and I would just see tourists
flooding in,

746
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:08,132
wanting that New York
Christmas experience.

747
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:09,458
I don't know,
I just didn't get it.

748
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,179
See, that's the thing.

749
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:14,007
To really enjoy Christmas
in New York,

750
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,793
you have to embrace your
inner tourist.

751
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,623
'Cause then you have ice
skating at Rockefeller Center.

752
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,190
- Okay.
- You have Santa Land at Macy's,

753
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:24,931
Christmas movies
at Nighthawk Cinema.

754
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,543
We go every year and we watch
"Miracle on 34th Street"

755
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:32,635
and we eat this huge
tub of parmesan popcorn.

756
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:36,465
And then you've got the
Nutcracker and the peace tree.

757
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,077
Peace tree?
That's a new one for me.

758
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,382
Oh, it's this huge
Christmas tree

759
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,516
at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine.

760
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,996
And they string it with a
thousand white origami cranes

761
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,695
that represent dreams come true.

762
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,304
Okay, I'm sorry,
I have to stop you.

763
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,090
Everything you're saying
is great.

764
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:53,544
You have this thing
on your chin.

765
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,699
- What?
- Can I just...

766
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:55,852
Can I please get that for you?

767
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:56,877
- Yes.
- Yeah?

768
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,096
Please.

769
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,229
I'm sorry.

770
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,883
It's so embarrassing.

771
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,239
- Oh.
- What's that?

772
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,545
Uh, the meringues.

773
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,634
They're very temperature
sensitive.

774
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,419
All right, coming in.

775
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:18,942
- Oh!
- Oh.

776
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,423
Sorry.
Hang on, here. Um...

777
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:25,427
So they were supposed
to look like mushrooms.

778
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,388
- Look who's made a recovery.
- Oh, Banjo!

779
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,086
Do you want to say thanks
to Dr. Miller?

780
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,785
He can call me Scarlet.
You can call me Scarlet.

781
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,269
All right, well,
if we can call you Scarlet,

782
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,228
can you at least call me Josh?

783
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:47,319
It'd be nice not to be
Dr. Foster for a night.

784
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:48,494
Sure.

785
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:55,283
Well, I guess it looks
like I can, um...

786
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,069
- Get going.
- Yeah.

787
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,637
He's better,
and the weather is...

788
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:02,811
Yeah.

789
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:07,208
Oh, hey, can I get
your phone number?

790
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,688
I mean, you know, just in case

791
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,038
Banjo gets in to
any other kind of trouble.

792
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,735
- Sure.
- Yeah?

793
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,872
Hey, do you wanna try
a mushroom?

794
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:22,092
Oh, sure.
Thank you.

795
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,620
So, here.
It's a little deflated.

796
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,976
- Hey, Scarlet?
- Hmm?

797
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,979
I know what you're saying
about Christmas in New York.

798
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,937
Mm-hmm?

799
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,810
But I really think this
year, Christmas in Vermont,

800
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,333
you won't miss a thing.

801
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,117
Well, we'll see.

802
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,124
You have to, you have to,
you have to chew.

803
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,345
You have to chew?

804
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,220
Are you still at work?
Nope.

805
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,657
But doc, Mr. Smith just
called on the emergency line.

806
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,271
Baby Cat won't eat her
bedtime snack.

807
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,834
He's beside himself.

808
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:10,271
Gently recommend that he stop
feeding her

809
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,205
half a pound of salmon
for dinner every night

810
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,057
and that should clear
the problem right up.

811
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,799
Oh... Wait a minute,
are you still out?

812
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:20,020
I just finished up a house call,
actually.

813
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:21,824
Oh, so that's what the kids
are calling it these days?

814
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,545
The weather was terrible,

815
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,721
so I watched the owner
make a Buche de Noel

816
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,419
while I waited out the storm.

817
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,464
Some nice old lady?

818
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,467
A young man, actually.

819
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,295
I knew it!
I knew it, I knew it!

820
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,645
All right,
that's enough out of you.

821
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:37,819
Bye!

822
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,346
I'm so happy, grandpa.

823
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,237
I was afraid there wouldn't
be any good trees left

824
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,306
four days before Christmas,

825
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,200
but I'm pretty sure
I found the perfect one.

826
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,788
You sure did.

827
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,842
I can't believe I got to
help with the axe part.

828
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,054
Tell you what, if you can
keep a secret, so can I.

829
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,228
Okay.

830
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:00,713
What a perfect morning
for a walk.

831
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,497
Oh, what's going on here?

832
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,891
Grandpa didn't put the
ornaments in the shed after all.

833
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,956
We found them while we were
putting away the Christmas...

834
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,591
Yeah, I thought it'd be best
to not have them, you know,

835
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:12,899
out so that the raccoons could
play bowling with them.

836
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:14,422
So we went out and found

837
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,206
the perfect Christmas tree
in the woods,

838
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,165
and we've been decorating
it right now.

839
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,558
Oh.

840
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:25,564
Well, that's not exactly
truth in advertising.

841
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,479
I guess they were fresh out of

842
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,133
Christmas pain in the
butt for dad ornaments.

843
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,485
Oh, wow.

844
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,617
- You found Hazel!
- Who's Hazel?

845
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:39,273
Well, one winter when
I was about your age,

846
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,556
there was this little rabbit
who used to come visit us

847
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,408
on the back porch.
I named her Hazel.

848
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,194
And I used to leave food out
for her every single day.

849
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,117
What time did you get in
last night?

850
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:01,034
Oh, around 10:30-ish.

851
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,252
Uh-huh.

852
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,707
Freezing rain was out of
control,

853
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,604
so I had to wait for it to stop.

854
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,301
Is the dog all better?

855
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,303
Actually, it was Banjo.

856
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:10,565
What was wrong with him?

857
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,567
Well, he had what vets call

858
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,743
a dietary indiscretion.

859
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,093
It means he ate something
he shouldn't have.

860
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,618
Let me guess, French fries?
Chicken wings?

861
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,924
No, he knocked over a bowl
of frosting

862
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,186
and had a little feast.

863
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,842
Oh, so Josh is also a cook?

864
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,152
Oh, are you expecting someone?

865
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,521
No, I don't think so,
but, you know,

866
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:34,785
it's not unusual in these parts

867
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,504
for a neighbor to come by
to say hi

868
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:39,725
and just happened to have
a cat with a sore paw.

869
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,944
Hey, Josh.
Hi, Banjo.

870
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:43,163
Banjo!

871
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:44,469
Wait, wait.

872
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:45,644
- Hi.
- Hi.

873
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,820
- You must be Milo.
- Yeah!

874
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,822
Banjo is so amazing.

875
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,477
Banjo is incredible and I
am very lucky he chose me.

876
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:53,976
- Yeah.
- Do you want to play with him?

877
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,654
Oh, yeah!

878
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,482
When Scarlet was over last
night,

879
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,049
she told me about a tradition
that she and Milo have,

880
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,529
and I got an idea.

881
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,098
Hoping you could help me
with it.

882
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,624
Come on, buddy, I think
you're gonna love this.

883
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,627
Whoa! Is this like our own
private movie theater?

884
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:16,065
- It most certainly is.
- Wow, this is something.

885
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,896
So, I know it's a little early,

886
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,856
but you can't have a movie
without snacks, right?

887
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,466
- Here.
- Parmesan corn!

888
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,096
Yep. Your mom told me
it was your favorite,

889
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,514
but in my family,
we're all about the candy.

890
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:30,863
Are you sure you're a doctor?

891
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,345
Knock yourself out,
we're on vacation.

892
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:41,351
So, is your family coming
up for the holidays, Josh?

893
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,179
Here you are. Um...

894
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:47,009
No, unfortunately they are
not gonna make it this year.

895
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,360
I've got Banjo.

896
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,580
Isn't that right, boy?
Banjo!

897
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:56,497
- Oh, come here.
- He's so cute.

898
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,934
- Do you have any pets, Milo?
- Well...

899
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:02,155
Our life is just too crazy
right now.

900
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,929
Well, maybe it wouldn't be
quite so crazy

901
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,767
if you lived in Vermont.

902
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,595
What, are you thinking
about moving back?

903
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,901
- Not really.
- Maybe.

904
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,511
All right.

905
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,687
Well, let's start this show.

906
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,575
Mom, look,
"Miracle on 34th Street!"

907
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,069
I know. And we thought
we wouldn't

908
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,926
get to see it this year.

909
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,190
That's very sweet.

910
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,148
My pleasure.

911
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,466
This is amazing.

912
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,207
It tastes just like
the Parmesan popcorn

913
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,730
at Nighthawk Cinema.

914
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,689
Thank you.
It's actually a modification

915
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:00,256
on my mother's top secret
cheddar recipe.

916
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,476
Can you tell me?

917
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,696
I'll guard it with me life.

918
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,437
Okay.

919
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:10,310
So, you have to mix the
popcorn with the butter

920
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,181
and you have to stir in

921
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:14,270
an insane amount of grated
cheddar cheese.

922
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,011
Hmm, okay.

923
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,449
And, I mean, that's it.

924
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,624
She does something to make
it taste really fancy...

925
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:24,672
- Uh, sea salt maybe.
- Mm.

926
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:28,197
Well, you definitely
inherited your mother's gift.

927
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,548
I can only hope I have
something half as good

928
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:32,767
to pass down to Milo.

929
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,639
What are you talking about?

930
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:37,076
He's probably gonna grow up
with this incredible talent

931
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,339
for delivering calves
wearing pink coveralls.

932
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:41,863
Those pink coveralls
brought me good luck.

933
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:44,866
I should wear them on all my
farm calls.

934
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
Your coveralls are
actually really inspiring.

935
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,701
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

936
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,505
I was thinking about it,
what are the odds

937
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:57,139
that we were
at the same general store

938
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,968
in the same aisle at the same
exact time?

939
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,622
And that I also felt the need

940
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:03,711
to critique your choice
of breakfast cereals.

941
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,321
That was only
after I accidentally

942
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:06,845
criticized your profession,

943
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,195
which I want to make sure
you know

944
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:11,284
I have nothing but respect
for vets.

945
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,158
And I have nothing but
respect for frosted cereal.

946
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:20,902
You wanted them too.

947
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:23,165
I did.
I did want them.

948
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:26,952
Santa!

949
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,831
Maybe I didn't do such a
remarkable thing after all.

950
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,014
That was awesome.

951
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,649
Yeah, it gets better
every time, doesn't it?

952
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:52,586
Chris Kringle would be a
perfect name for kitten.

953
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,360
I wonder if Santa has a vet
on the staff.

954
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,111
Well, yeah, of course he does.

955
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:57,678
He's gotta make sure those
reindeer

956
00:43:57,852 --> 00:43:59,177
can help him deliver
all those presents.

957
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,507
I wonder if one of the reindeer

958
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,204
had a dietary indiscretion.

959
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:05,817
Well, if he did,
I'm sure they'd fly back

960
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,351
from the North Pole
so your grandpa

961
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:10,125
can take care of them.
Maybe even your mom.

962
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,997
It would definitely
be my grandpa.

963
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,086
I feel like a reindeer
would have a hard time

964
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,044
figuring out the subway.

965
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:19,004
I see. But there are advantages
to living in the boondocks.

966
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:20,788
There definitely are,

967
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:23,486
but me and mom are New
Yorkers and it's cool there.

968
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,053
What's the best part?

969
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,055
I like to go see Santa
at Macy's.

970
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:30,363
Mom's favorite thing is ice
skating at Rockefeller Center.

971
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,060
Oh, are you a good skater?

972
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:35,455
I'm actually a very good
skater, but my mom is worse.

973
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,414
That is true. That's very true.

974
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,547
In fact, one time she fell
right in the middle

975
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,984
of the skating rink
and couldn't get up,

976
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,552
so she had to slide to
the edge on her butt,

977
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,486
and her jeans got so
wet it looked like she...

978
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,619
Okay, okay, all right, all
right. That's a great story.

979
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:50,963
I think we can end it right
there.

980
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,602
Well, it sounds like
a lot of fun.

981
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,537
There is great fun to
be had in Vermont, too.

982
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:56,389
Like a movie in a barn.

983
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,521
They definitely don't have
that at home.

984
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:01,699
They definitely don't.

985
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:08,531
Look! A reindeer!
It could have been Santa's.

986
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,620
Yeah, probably getting
ready for that long ride.

987
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:12,642
Well, I hate that I have
to go to work, you guys.

988
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:15,538
We could have made this a
double feature, stayed in.

989
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,106
Next time.
What are you doing today?

990
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,848
Um, I don't know.

991
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:24,112
Speaking of work,
remember Maisy Phillips?

992
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,811
Oh yeah. She had those two
little colts I loved as a kid.

993
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,726
And now it's a little herd

994
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,815
and they're due
for their shots today.

995
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,730
How are you on herd health?

996
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:34,644
I think I can manage.

997
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,124
Okay then.

998
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,128
Well, looks like I'm
going to work today too.

999
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,565
Off you go.

1000
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,393
All right,
Merry Christmas, Maisy.

1001
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:45,699
All right.

1002
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,033
Make sure to send me pictures

1003
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,528
as soon as Gertie has her foal,

1004
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,332
and if she has any
problems, give me a call.

1005
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:51,436
Thank you so much, Scarlet.

1006
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:52,638
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1007
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,273
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.

1008
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,234
Hey.

1009
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,768
Can we do tooth whitening
on a dog?

1010
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,801
No.

1011
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:02,953
What if she's got an audition

1012
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,017
for a national commercial?

1013
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:05,371
Not even if she's accepting

1014
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,808
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1015
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,984
You would not believe
the state I am in,

1016
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:11,158
and in public no less.

1017
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:13,422
Doc, try me.

1018
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:15,468
Well, I have a crazy idea.

1019
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:17,426
How about you hop on a train,

1020
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,863
come up here for a few days,

1021
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,317
and then you're back in New York

1022
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:21,589
in time for Christmas dinner?

1023
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:23,650
Radical change of plans,
I like it.

1024
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,019
Sometimes a radical
change of plans

1025
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,323
is just what the doctor ordered.

1026
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,960
I can't wait!

1027
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:31,745
Shelby, no tooth whitening
on the dog, please.

1028
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:40,338
Oh, good. Looks like
you're getting the hang of it.

1029
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:43,409
- Mm-hm.
- That's great.

1030
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,256
You know, when your mom
and I first did this,

1031
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,543
she was just out of third grade,

1032
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,023
and we got out the potatoes,

1033
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:50,797
and got out all the ink
and the ink pads,

1034
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,375
and we got ink all over
the place and all over us.

1035
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:56,552
So we ran down
to the old swimming hole,

1036
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:59,120
and splashed around for
awhile, and got all cleaned up.

1037
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:01,862
Wow.
That sounds so cool.

1038
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,385
Wouldn't it be awesome

1039
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:04,885
if I can come visit you
for the summer?

1040
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:06,998
Awesome doesn't begin to
describe it.

1041
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,131
Who is the greatest sheep
vaccinator

1042
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:13,482
in all of New England?
Dr. Miller.

1043
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:15,096
Well, you're right,
I am pretty good,

1044
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,380
but you're coming right along.

1045
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:18,836
Ha-ha, so funny.

1046
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,707
What's going on here?

1047
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,710
Potato stamping.
The presents were too brown.

1048
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,059
They needed a little zhuzh.

1049
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:27,845
Oh, what a great idea.

1050
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:33,067
Oh, dad, do you mind if David
comes up for a few days?

1051
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:35,722
Of course not.
The more the merrier.

1052
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,159
Oh, man, these are so much
neater

1053
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,944
than the ones
that we used to make.

1054
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,163
We used an 11 scalpel,

1055
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,730
and that really did the trick.

1056
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:45,906
Wait, you let a 10 year old
use a scalpel?

1057
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,735
Grandpa held the bottom
and I held the top.

1058
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,737
Yeah, give me a little credit,
honey.

1059
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,870
After all, you survived
all the way to adulthood

1060
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:54,132
under my watch.

1061
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,007
That's so nice.

1062
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:01,879
- What's that?
- It's Josh.

1063
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:04,074
He's inviting us all to go
see "The Nutcracker" with him

1064
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,467
tomorrow afternoon at the
community barn.

1065
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:06,666
I made an appointment

1066
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,711
with the Davis farm
for two o'clock.

1067
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,148
Do I have to go?

1068
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,540
Well I love ballet,

1069
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:13,368
especially "The Nutcracker."

1070
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,109
Do you remember when we went
last year

1071
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,633
and the tree got so big,
like magic?

1072
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:19,070
That was fun, right?

1073
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,072
That was one minute
in like 10 hours.

1074
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:24,292
Sometimes you have to try things

1075
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:27,992
a few times before you know
you really like them,

1076
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:32,648
and it was very nice of
Dr. Foster to invite us,

1077
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:35,608
so we're gonna go and we're
gonna have a good time

1078
00:48:35,782 --> 00:48:37,131
and keep an open mind.

1079
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:38,741
And we're gonna be thankful

1080
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,396
that we have such
a thoughtful friend.

1081
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,223
Doesn't it usually take
more than a few days

1082
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,225
to make friends with someone?

1083
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:46,314
Sometimes you just
have a feeling.

1084
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:03,636
It's three days
before Christmas,

1085
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,725
don't we have other things
we need to do?

1086
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:06,963
I'm sorry to say it, buddy,

1087
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,467
but I think we're all caught up.

1088
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:09,816
- Hi.
- Hi.

1089
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,310
I'm really happy you guys
made it.

1090
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,601
Me too.

1091
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:13,776
Thanks for inviting us.

1092
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,343
It was very nice of you.

1093
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,519
I'll keep an open mind.

1094
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:19,454
I know you're probably used to
the New York City

1095
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:20,914
Ballet's "Nutcracker," but this,

1096
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:22,568
I think, will
be a little more fun...

1097
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:24,700
- Especially for Milo.
- Ooh.

1098
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,789
Any children who would
like to be in the show,

1099
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,052
please come sign up.

1100
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:29,053
- Yes.
- What's this?

1101
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:30,619
This is the best part.

1102
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,578
- Hi, Dr. Foster.
- Hi.

1103
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,884
Oh, any child in the
audience can be in the show.

1104
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,843
We have lots of parts
to pick from.

1105
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:38,473
That sounds fun, Milo.
What do you say?

1106
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:40,542
We have spots open for guests

1107
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:42,327
at the fancy Christmas party?

1108
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:43,719
No?
Snowflakes?

1109
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:45,460
- Uh, candy canes?
- Un-unh.

1110
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:46,940
The Mouse King's soldiers?

1111
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:49,116
- That could be okay.
- Yeah.

1112
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,596
We have one spot left,

1113
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,947
but you have to be
really scary though.

1114
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:58,125
Can I see your
most terrifying face?

1115
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:00,432
Arrr!

1116
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:03,000
Very impressive.
You're hired.

1117
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:04,629
Just go right on in there
to get set up

1118
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:05,872
with some ears and cheese.

1119
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:06,742
Vivian sweetie,
go take him to the

1120
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,006
dressing room, okay?

1121
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,617
And now you guys get to
have a real child-free date.

1122
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:12,792
Enjoy.

1123
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,185
- Oh.
- Oh.

1124
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,925
We're not actually on a...

1125
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:22,062
They also have hot chocolate.

1126
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,498
- Oh.
- Hi, come on in.

1127
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:24,978
Come have your seats.

1128
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:26,980
Hi, come on in.
Hello.

1129
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,590
We're about to start the show.

1130
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:29,983
Come have a seat.

1131
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:31,724
- Hi.
- Hi. Good to see you.

1132
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,380
Hi. Come have a seat.

1133
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,912
If everyone could please have
their seats.

1134
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:51,004
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome.

1135
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:53,224
Thank you all so much
for being here tonight.

1136
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,052
We're so excited.

1137
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:58,098
So sit back, relax,
and enjoy our production

1138
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,752
of "The Nutcracker."

1139
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,280
Places!

1140
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:40,836
Throw the cheese.

1141
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,556
Do you see him?

1142
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,939
I've never seen him have so much
fun. That was incredible.

1143
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:41,549
Yeah, he was throwing
that cheese

1144
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:43,856
like he was in the major
league, it was amazing.

1145
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,380
It was so cute.
It was fun.

1146
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,382
Actually, can you excuse
me just for a minute?

1147
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:50,079
Oh, yeah, sure.

1148
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:02,396
Mom, did you see me?

1149
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,050
There's my favorite
little rodent.

1150
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,921
You were awesome, buddy.

1151
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,141
And you were too.

1152
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:10,187
That's Vivian.
She's shy.

1153
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,450
She only talks to people
she knows.

1154
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:15,192
Well, she doesn't know you
that well either, does she?

1155
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,845
We were mouse soldiers together,

1156
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,717
so we're pretty much best
friends.

1157
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,154
Well, that's great.
That was fast.

1158
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:23,048
Sometimes you just have
a feeling, you know,

1159
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,853
like you said about Josh.

1160
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:28,727
All I said was that I have
friendly feelings for doctor,

1161
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:31,425
uh, Josh, like you and Vanessa.

1162
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,733
Vivian.
I love her and she loves me.

1163
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:38,127
I actually never said anything
about love.

1164
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,173
Okay.
Let's take a selfie.

1165
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:44,090
Milo, get in here with mom.
Here. All right, everyone ready?

1166
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,614
You got to do something really
ferocious.

1167
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,008
- Rawr.
- Rawr!

1168
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,491
Uh, we should go.
Yeah.

1169
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,363
Vivian?
There you are, cupcake.

1170
00:53:57,408 --> 00:54:00,106
You did such a good job.

1171
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,153
That's so nice.

1172
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:06,373
And you were a great mouse too.

1173
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:07,722
Thank you.
So was Vivian.

1174
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,028
I'm Scarlet, by the way.

1175
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:11,248
- Scarlet Miller?
- Yeah.

1176
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:13,162
I'm Alice Barstow.

1177
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,861
We were in advanced biology
together senior year.

1178
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,732
- You remember Mr. Hayden?
- Yes.

1179
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:19,734
He used to tell the rest of
us that we should

1180
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:21,867
all aspire to be more like you.

1181
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,172
That is mortifying,

1182
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,218
but it's really good to see you.

1183
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:27,133
I had no idea we were
neighbors again.

1184
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:29,067
We should get the kids together
for a play date sometime.

1185
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:30,286
That is, if you guys
aren't too busy

1186
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,572
getting ready for Christmas.

1187
00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:33,792
Milo and I don't actually
live here,

1188
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,577
and Josh and I,
we're not together.

1189
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,623
I mean, we're physically
standing

1190
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,016
- here together, but...
- Right.

1191
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,932
Just to clarify,
we're just friends.

1192
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,543
Got it.

1193
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,153
You're being so weird, mom.

1194
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,808
I heard a crazy rumor

1195
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:52,898
that Santa might be
coming into town tomorrow.

1196
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:55,814
That actually sounds perfect.

1197
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,868
My friend David is coming
in town from New York,

1198
00:54:57,903 --> 00:54:59,252
but he doesn't get in
until late.

1199
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:01,210
David is definitely not just
your friend.

1200
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,605
Oh, okay. We're gonna, um,
we're gonna get out of here

1201
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:07,042
It was so good to see you.
Thank you so much.

1202
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,043
- It was my pleasure.
- Bye.

1203
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:10,219
- Bye.
- See you.

1204
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:19,794
Hi, my name is Scarlet Miller.

1205
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:21,709
I'm here to see Dr. Foster.

1206
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:23,232
You must be Dr. Miller's
daughter.

1207
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,582
That's me.

1208
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,845
I remember you when
you were little.

1209
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,456
How you used to always love to

1210
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,328
come with him on his
house calls.

1211
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:32,822
By the time I was eight,
I figured

1212
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:34,505
I was pretty
much a doctor myself,

1213
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:36,724
and I was ready to go
to work as his partner.

1214
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:38,944
I know he'd love it if you did.

1215
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,686
Go ahead and take a seat
and I'll call Dr. Foster.

1216
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,688
Okay, awesome.
Thank you so much.

1217
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:46,125
And I'm gonna take the children

1218
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:47,735
and we're gonna go
find some candy.

1219
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:48,954
Okay.

1220
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:50,521
So we just need to make sure

1221
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:52,020
that you're keeping up
with your exercises,

1222
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:53,915
and of course the glucosamine.

1223
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:56,004
Okay.
I surely will, doc.

1224
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,547
And you make sure you and your
family

1225
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:59,573
have a nice Christmas,
all right?

1226
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:02,010
And don't let your wife
do too much work.

1227
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:03,447
Oh, that won't be happening.

1228
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:04,621
I'm not married.

1229
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:05,840
You got a girlfriend?

1230
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:07,014
No, not at the moment.

1231
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:09,191
Oh, doc, you better get on that.

1232
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,106
It's really not that hard.

1233
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,543
You a smart doctor.

1234
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,806
You need a smart, nice girl.

1235
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,416
Hi, Josh.

1236
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,376
- Scarlet.
- Ooh, she'd do just fine.

1237
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,508
- I'll do what just fine?
- Uh, nothing.

1238
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:24,772
You know, it's really
not good to be alone,

1239
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,386
and she look like a nice
church girl,

1240
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:27,882
- come from a good home.
- Thank you.

1241
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,274
- Thank you very much.
- And she cute.

1242
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:30,822
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1243
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:32,519
Mrs. Bix, thank you.

1244
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:38,873
That's Mrs. Bix.
She's one of our patients.

1245
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:40,048
Um, she's a character.

1246
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:42,094
Yeah.

1247
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:44,488
Sorry, I wasn't
expecting you so early.

1248
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:46,359
Santa's not here yet.

1249
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,362
I have to run into my office
and get him.

1250
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,059
- Okay.
- Wink, wink.

1251
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:07,511
- This one's cool.
- Yeah.

1252
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,216
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

1253
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,522
Ho, ho, ho.

1254
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:25,442
Hey, Santa, Vivian said you
look very much like Josh.

1255
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:29,446
Hm. Well, I'll let you in on
a little secret.

1256
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,754
It is me!
It's Josh.

1257
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:35,168
Now, Santa was very busy today,

1258
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,975
so because I'm such good
friends with him,

1259
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:39,499
he asked if I would stand in
for him.

1260
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:42,763
But unfortunately,
the elves that he sent

1261
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:44,809
seem to have disappeared,

1262
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:48,377
and all they left behind
are their hats.

1263
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,728
Now, would you two be
willing to stand in

1264
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:52,773
and be my elves for the day?

1265
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,909
Definitely.
But Vivian wanted to point out

1266
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,607
that those hats still have
the price tags attached.

1267
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:03,349
What? What?

1268
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,786
Uh, those elves can be
so tacky sometimes.

1269
00:58:08,093 --> 00:58:10,225
There. Now, I'm gonna need

1270
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,533
your help
to pass these cookies out.

1271
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:17,276
Vivian also wanted to
know if we could eat it.

1272
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:21,715
Of course.

1273
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,198
What time did the last batch
come out?

1274
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:28,330
Uh, 11:15.

1275
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,960
I swear I haven't felt
this out of my depth

1276
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,420
since organic chemistry.

1277
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:33,597
I actually kinda
liked organic chem.

1278
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:35,076
Of course you did.

1279
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,166
All right everyone,
gather around.

1280
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,733
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1281
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,319
We're gonna make this
the best Christmas ever.

1282
00:58:41,343 --> 00:58:42,649
- Yes.
- Hands in.

1283
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:44,564
Elf power on three.

1284
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,523
One, two, three.

1285
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,046
Elf power!

1286
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:53,268
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1287
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,706
Merry Christmas!

1288
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,273
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1289
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:00,232

- Thank you, Santa.
- Thank you.

1301
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:12,478
Ooh!

1302
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:19,006
Hi darling, how are you?

1303
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,966
Please excuse me.

1304
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:27,121
I was wondering if maybe
you had some plans?

1305
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:29,234
- What? What?
- Oh.

1306
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:32,019
Sorry. Sorry.

1307
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,954
Uh, I was wondering if maybe
you could sneak away

1308
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:36,023
for a little bit tomorrow night.

1309
01:00:36,197 --> 01:00:37,808
Well, that's very sweet,

1310
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:39,960
but I know if I keep Milo
out late on Christmas Eve

1311
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:41,725
he'll never get to sleep.

1312
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:43,335
Oh. Uh...

1313
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:46,381
I-I mean just you,

1314
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:48,296
maybe after you put Milo to bed.

1315
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,821
Well, yeah, my dad could
watch him, so that would be...

1316
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:51,995
That'd be great.

1317
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,824
Scarlet!

1318
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:55,366
Oh, my friend David
just got into town.

1319
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,131
- Hi.
- Hi.

1320
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:58,625
- Oh, my goodness.
- I missed you.

1321
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,134
I missed you too.

1322
01:01:00,308 --> 01:01:01,962
- Hi, I'm David.
- I'm Santa.

1323
01:01:02,136 --> 01:01:03,790
Josh. Um...

1324
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:06,140
Well, you look great.

1325
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,403
Hi, kids.
Let's go, come on.

1326
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,539
Thank you again for today.

1327
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,368
The kids loved it.
I did too.

1328
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,222
It was a million times better
than going to

1329
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,850
see Santa in New York.

1330
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:22,113
At Macy's you never
get to be an elf.

1331
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:24,178
Could we come here the
next time we're in Vermont?

1332
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,161
I'm sure that we could work
something out.

1333
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:32,601
So, how's 8:30, the pine woods
trail head?

1334
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:33,994
Sounds perfect.

1335
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:38,477
Vivian?
Hey, sweetie.

1336
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:40,174
Come here.
Hi, Scarlet.

1337
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:41,959
Hi.
Hi, Santa.

1338
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,482
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1339
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,832
Thank you so much
for inviting Vivian today.

1340
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:48,400
She was a fantastic elf.

1341
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:50,358
Oh, Abigail can't wait to
see you tonight.

1342
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:52,852
She said to come hungry because
she got way too much steak.

1343
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,842
Oh, I'll take steak over
milk and cookies any day.

1344
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:01,543
Now, come on my elves,
We have gifts to pass out.

1345
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,893
Ho, ho, ho.

1346
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,157
"Too much steak."

1347
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,898
Oh, Abigail has such a crush
on him.

1348
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,378
Well, kind of like every
other woman in this town.

1349
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:16,341
Can you believe that she
would pass on a message

1350
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:20,127
from his hot date just
like right in front of me?

1351
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:21,607
Does she know you're into him?

1352
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,305
I am not into him,

1353
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:26,568
but she should know
that it's inappropriate

1354
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,007
to talk about that sort of
thing while he's working.

1355
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,488
And plus he's got this like
whole Casanova thing going on.

1356
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:35,142
- Hey, doc?
- What?

1357
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:37,928
The two of you are crazy
about each other.

1358
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:40,408
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- That is so not true.

1359
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:42,802
Even if it was,
it doesn't even matter

1360
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:46,240
because we live like 300
miles away from each other.

1361
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,349
What do you always tell me
when we have 20 appointments

1362
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,027
to fit into 15 appointment
slots?

1363
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:52,029
- I tell you to make it work.
- Scarlet.

1364
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:53,291
Make it work.

1365
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:03,997
I thought most Christmas Eve
surprises

1366
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,565
happened in front of
a roaring fire,

1367
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,307
or underneath
the Christmas tree,

1368
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:12,789
not in the dark woods
in the middle of the night.

1369
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:15,617
It's 8:35 p.m.

1370
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,359
And I'm pretty sure you know
your way around these woods.

1371
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,275
Yeah. Me and my friends actually
used to have a fort

1372
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:24,452
right here between
these three trees

1373
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:25,906
in front of these princess
pines.

1374
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:27,673
- Princess pines?
- Yeah.

1375
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:30,067
Princess pines.

1376
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,983
Oh, because they're small
and cute.

1377
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:39,424
When I was little,
I used to come out here

1378
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:41,513
and, uh, my friends and I,

1379
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:45,082
we would decorate all these
princess pines for Christmas.

1380
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,475
We would imagine all the
birds and mice and chipmunks

1381
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:50,304
just gathering around and
opening their presents,

1382
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:52,916
and singing carols.

1383
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,048
That actually sounds like
a lot of fun.

1384
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,223
It was.

1385
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:03,274
You know, New York has
so much to offer,

1386
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:08,757
but I have to admit
that I do get a little sad

1387
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,890
knowing that Milo won't grow up

1388
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,719
playing in the woods like I did.

1389
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:16,896
Well, who knows.
Life is full of surprises.

1390
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,395
And I'm gonna be taking you
someplace

1391
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:20,813
that I think will cheer you up.

1392
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:22,423
Where are we going?

1393
01:04:22,597 --> 01:04:24,861
You'll see.
You ready?

1394
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:26,732
Welcome to Rockefeller Center.

1395
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,565
Wow, this is...

1396
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:36,263
It-it's beautiful.

1397
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:37,830
What is all this?

1398
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:40,267
Well, they decorate it
for the winter festival.

1399
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,241
I might yield a little
influence in this town,

1400
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:44,271
so I made a couple calls.

1401
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:47,927
You wanna go skating?

1402
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,105
I-I would love to, but I...

1403
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:55,413
Don't even worry about it,
I got you covered.

1404
01:04:57,154 --> 01:04:58,372
Here, have a seat.

1405
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,772
Oh, thank you, but those
are not gonna fit me.

1406
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,252
I have tiny Cinderella feet.

1407
01:05:08,426 --> 01:05:10,254
- No, this is mine.
- Oh.

1408
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:13,320
These are for your little
Cinderella feet.

1409
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:15,215
- Weren't these heavy?
- Uh...

1410
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:18,566
Yeah, I thought I was
gonna keel over back there.

1411
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,283
- I have to tell you...
- I have to warn you,

1412
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,092
I'm actually really bad
at skating.

1413
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:24,964
Me too.

1414
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:28,837
The truth is, once I outgrew
decorating Christmas trees

1415
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,883
for woodland creatures,

1416
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:34,365
I started to spend all
my time in the library.

1417
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:35,801
Of course you did.

1418
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,630
All I wanted
was to get into college

1419
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:40,762
and out of Vermont.

1420
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,896
And by my 18th birthday,
I was gone.

1421
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,898
You didn't miss it?

1422
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:47,900
Of course I did.

1423
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:50,685
I mean, leaving my dad was like,

1424
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,123
I don't know, like

1425
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:54,559
leaving my heart behind.

1426
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:57,736
But I knew if I stayed

1427
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,608
I would never get a
chance to come into my own

1428
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:04,003
or even figure out
what that meant.

1429
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:06,266
You seem to have done
pretty well for yourself.

1430
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:09,182
I think so.

1431
01:06:09,356 --> 01:06:11,837
And New York was the
perfect place to do it.

1432
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,057
Shall we?

1433
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,363
Okay.

1434
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:21,107
Go ahead.

1435
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,543
- Oh.
- I'm okay. I'm good.

1436
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:23,936
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1437
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,025
Just got to get my ring legs.

1438
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,159
Oh, my goodness.

1439
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,508
It sounds like we had pretty

1440
01:06:30,682 --> 01:06:32,031
similar high school experiences,

1441
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:33,805
except I couldn't wait to
leave New York.

1442
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:36,514
- Why is that?
- Uh...

1443
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:38,361
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I love my family,

1444
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,170
I just wanted a different life.

1445
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:42,017
And then I got here and now
I can't imagine leaving.

1446
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,217
I never imagined air
could be this good.

1447
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:45,740
It even tastes good.

1448
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:49,309
- I think you're right.
- We're good.

1449
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,495
All right, I'll admit it,

1450
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:04,194
this is better than
Rockefeller Center.

1451
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:05,369
Right?

1452
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:06,979
I am victorious!

1453
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,938
And to be honest,

1454
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,593
I would spend most of my
time over there on the edges

1455
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,595
just holding on for dear life.

1456
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,573
Well yeah, only because
those little seven-year-olds

1457
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,237
with the skating outfits
are in the center

1458
01:07:18,295 --> 01:07:19,774
doing triple axles.

1459
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:22,342
Right? Making me wonder
just how I've managed

1460
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:24,953
to accomplish so little
with my life.

1461
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:26,520
Well, 'cause let's face it,

1462
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:28,696
you do nothing but lie
around and cure sickness

1463
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,437
and raise a child.

1464
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:32,744
Yeah. Let's see one of those
little smarty pants

1465
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:34,398
try to vaccinate a ram.

1466
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:18,529
That's not bad.

1467
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,066
I... I can't.
I can't do this.

1468
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,590
Uh... what? But why?

1469
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:42,857
No judgment, and you should live
your life however you want,

1470
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:50,169
but I can't be just another
girl in your fan club.

1471
01:08:50,908 --> 01:08:52,345
Another woman?

1472
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,000
Scarlet, what are you...

1473
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:56,783
I'm sorry, what are you
talking about?

1474
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:59,221
You cannot be so naive
to think that

1475
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:01,658
you don't have every woman
in this town

1476
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:03,443
wrapped around your little
finger.

1477
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,314
I'm the only doctor in town.

1478
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:07,447
All these women,
they're my patients,

1479
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:09,841
but you are not.

1480
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,538
I feel like we fit
really well together

1481
01:09:12,712 --> 01:09:16,108
and I would hate for us to
walk away from that feeling.

1482
01:09:16,282 --> 01:09:19,154
I think we should figure it out.

1483
01:09:19,328 --> 01:09:21,200
Long distance is so hard.

1484
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:22,699
So what if it wasn't long
distance?

1485
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:24,508
You and Milo could move back.

1486
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,687
That's your solution?

1487
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,210
I mean, yeah.
Yeah.

1488
01:09:31,384 --> 01:09:33,647
It would be, it would be
absolutely perfect.

1489
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:36,084
Your dad has plenty of room.
He and I can help with Milo.

1490
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,975
And I know you love taking
care of all the sheep...

1491
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,828
You know what? I-I have been
making my own decisions

1492
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:42,917
- for a long time now, Josh.
- I know.

1493
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:45,442
And I don't see any reason
to stop now.

1494
01:09:48,836 --> 01:09:50,969
You know, eight years ago,

1495
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:54,189
Milo and I decided to make
a go of it in New York,

1496
01:09:54,364 --> 01:10:00,196
and I built a business
and a life that I am proud of.

1497
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:05,462
And you just expect me
to just give that all up

1498
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:09,205
because you have a good
feeling about us?

1499
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,032
We've known each other
for five days.

1500
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,078
Scarlet, Scarlet, hang on.

1501
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,652
Scarlet, that's not what
I'm saying.

1502
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,038
I-I swear just when I look at
you and Milo,

1503
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,779
really you both
look so happy here.

1504
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:22,479
I am not a damsel
in distress, Josh.

1505
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:24,611
And Milo and I,
we don't need saving.

1506
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,832
I'm sorry.

1507
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:39,191
I have never met anyone
like you before,

1508
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:44,327
and I-I probably
never will again,

1509
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:50,071
but I am not ready to
give up my entire life

1510
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,509
based on a feeling.

1511
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:07,524
Phoebe was just getting a
little too rambunctious, huh?

1512
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:08,960
I think she fell off a stump

1513
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:10,701
and really scraped her leg.

1514
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,835
Oh. That's interesting,
she climbed up on a stump.

1515
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,487
- Hey.
- Hi, dad.

1516
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,576
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Suzanne.

1517
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,970
It's really good to see you.
It's been a long time.

1518
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:21,799
Sophie here cut her leg,

1519
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:25,063
so I just want to clean it up

1520
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:26,673
and put a few stitches.

1521
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:28,545
Okay. You want me to grab
the chlorhex?

1522
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1523
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,293
What was Josh's big surprise?

1524
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,121
Roller skating.

1525
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,515
Well, that sounds like fun.

1526
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:43,951
It was okay.

1527
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:47,999
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

1528
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:51,089
Get you all set up here.

1529
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:53,874
Okay, so I wanna do a ring block

1530
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,659
so she doesn't feel the sutures.

1531
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,749
Okay. You should probably give
her some Vanamine too.

1532
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:01,273
I already did.
See? Great minds think alike.

1533
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:04,755
I'll place the block.

1534
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:09,150
- Ready?
- All right, here we go.

1535
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,415
- You're doing great.
- Well, I learned from the best.

1536
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,634
Why don't you grab
the suture too?

1537
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:15,809
All right.

1538
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:24,427
Good girl.

1539
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,734
There you go, sweetie.

1540
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:31,085
Yeah.

1541
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:36,352
All right.

1542
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:43,402
- All right, I think that's good.
- There we go. You okay?

1543
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:46,231
- That should do it.
- Perfect, okay.

1544
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,799
There we go.

1545
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:52,237
All right Suzanne, so she'll
be okay in a few days.

1546
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:53,931
Just try and keep her off of
that hoof.

1547
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:55,936
Thanks, doc and doc.

1548
01:12:57,808 --> 01:12:59,810
Yeah, thanks for your help, doc.

1549
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:01,551
Yeah, it was fun.

1550
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:03,050
It is fun working together,
isn't it?

1551
01:13:03,074 --> 01:13:04,945
It is.

1552
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,035
I'm gonna upstairs
and check on Milo.

1553
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:09,385
All right, I'll clean up.

1554
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:10,821
All right.
Thanks, dad.

1555
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:12,300
All right, sweetie.

1556
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,366
Is it Christmas yet?

1557
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,499
Not quite, sweetie.

1558
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:39,110
I'm so happy because
it's almost Christmas,

1559
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:42,418
but I'm also sad because after
Christmas we have to go home.

1560
01:13:42,592 --> 01:13:45,638
I wish we could stay
here forever.

1561
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:49,381
Well, it's always hard when
vacation comes to an end.

1562
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,165
I liked the vacation parts,

1563
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:53,167
but I liked the other parts
even better,

1564
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:57,041
like Josh, Vivian, grandpa,
and Banjo.

1565
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:59,217
They're here when it's not
even vacation.

1566
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,916
But if we stayed here
in Vermont,

1567
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,614
wouldn't you miss being
a New Yorker?

1568
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:07,791
We'd still be us,
just in Vermont.

1569
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:10,271
Is Josh going to come
for Christmas tomorrow?

1570
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,534
I really like Josh.

1571
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,018
Me too.

1572
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:37,168
Well, he's out like a light.

1573
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:40,693
He's such a great kid.

1574
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:42,782
And he's having a blast.

1575
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:44,262
Yeah.

1576
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:47,091
Well?

1577
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:51,269
Date didn't go as planned maybe?

1578
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:58,494
I don't know, dad. Josh asked me
to stay here in Vermont.

1579
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,672
And what do you think?

1580
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,504
I just can't imagine
moving backwards.

1581
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:10,506
I don't think moving
back to Vermont

1582
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,770
would be like moving back
in time.

1583
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:15,423
I mean, look at all
you've gained.

1584
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:18,818
Your character, and know how,

1585
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:22,039
and silly pastel overalls.

1586
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:26,347
Those are yours to keep.

1587
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,481
Look how you handled
that goat today. So confident.

1588
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,439
Thanks, dad.

1589
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:36,444
I will always love New York
for showing me how strong I am,

1590
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:44,583
but I see how much Milo
loves it here in Vermont

1591
01:15:44,757 --> 01:15:47,934
and how great it is
to sit down to dinner

1592
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:50,023
with the two of you every night,

1593
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:57,030
and how much fun it is
to deliver a baby calf

1594
01:15:57,204 --> 01:16:01,600
and walk around with an
old school doctor's bag.

1595
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:04,168
Oh, yeah, there's that.

1596
01:16:04,342 --> 01:16:07,040
I see how life could be
less of a sprint.

1597
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:13,133
How I'd have a lot more
time to stop and smell the...

1598
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:15,179
Roses.

1599
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:16,746
Princess pines.

1600
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,619
Stop and smell
the princess pines.

1601
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:25,102
I'm just not used to needing
anything from anyone.

1602
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:28,714
Well, I know a little bit
about that.

1603
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:33,806
When you were a baby
and your mom had passed,

1604
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:39,725
I was hell bent against
letting the townspeople

1605
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,206
come to my rescue,
so I learned to change

1606
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,730
a diaper with the best of them,

1607
01:16:44,904 --> 01:16:47,820
wrestle you into your coveralls,

1608
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:50,780
and then later on
make potatoes stamps.

1609
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:53,826
And I wouldn't trade any
of that for one minute.

1610
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,742
But the whole time I thought
I had something to prove,

1611
01:16:57,569 --> 01:16:58,962
and I didn't.

1612
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:01,094
People want to help,

1613
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:03,227
and it's no surrender
to let them.

1614
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:06,622
Raising a kid on your own
is hard,

1615
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:08,319
even for pros like us.

1616
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:12,628
What do you want?

1617
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:17,589
I just can't believe that
Josh would ask me to give up

1618
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,287
everything I've worked
so hard for.

1619
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,638
You know, nobody's perfect.

1620
01:17:23,508 --> 01:17:25,388
You don't get to be my age
without being able to

1621
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:27,860
pick up a few things
from across the room.

1622
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:32,343
What, like a tooth root
infection

1623
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,737
or a ruptured cruciate ligament?

1624
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:37,043
Love, sweetheart.

1625
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:38,741
Love.

1626
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:42,527
Josh likes you a whole lot.

1627
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:45,269
And he just wants to
get to know you better

1628
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:47,445
without there being 300 miles
between you.

1629
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:52,842
Well, people can't always
get what they wish for.

1630
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:57,324
Well, you know,
it's Christmas time.

1631
01:17:57,498 --> 01:18:00,893
And sometimes,
if you wish hard enough,

1632
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:03,766
miracles can come true.

1633
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:08,901
Thanks, dad.

1634
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,425
Merry Christmas.

1635
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:14,602
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1636

1637
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,114

1638
01:19:31,288 --> 01:19:32,985
Good morning.
You're up early.

1639
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:35,814
Yeah, I've been doing some
thinking, and I wanted to see

1640
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:37,487
if you'll watch Milo for me
this morning.

1641
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:38,948
- Of course.
- Okay.

1642
01:19:39,122 --> 01:19:40,642
Wait, wait, wait.
What's the big hurry?

1643
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:43,343
I have a few Christmas
miracles to attend to.

1644
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,088
♪ Jingle bells,
jingle bells ♪

1645
01:19:49,262 --> 01:19:51,047

1646
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

1647
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:03,799
I-I came over early
to look for you.

1648
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,803
I actually went
looking for you too.

1649
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:13,243
- I'm sorry, I overreacted.
- No, it's okay. I-I'm sorry.

1650
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,438
I should've never made you feel
uncomfortable or overstepped.

1651
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:20,337
I just needed to figure a
few things out for myself.

1652
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:24,820
This is beautiful.
Wow.

1653
01:20:24,994 --> 01:20:27,126
I-I remember
all the paper cranes

1654
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,042
on the tree at the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine,

1655
01:20:31,217 --> 01:20:35,787
how they represent dreams
coming true, and

1656
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,721
I want all your dreams
to come true, Scarlet.

1657
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,356
That's, that's all I want
for you.

1658
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:44,883
How did you make all these?

1659
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,670
Oh, I, I might have poured
my heart out

1660
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,151
to Mrs. Bix, and she rallied
the troops

1661
01:20:52,325 --> 01:20:55,459
and everyone pulled through.

1662
01:20:55,633 --> 01:20:57,713
And then I got here and your
dad's truck wasn't here,

1663
01:20:57,765 --> 01:20:59,463
and then I was worried
that you had left.

1664
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,291
- No.
- I should've never acted like

1665
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:03,597
Vermont was the only place it
could happen,

1666
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:06,339
or that it's the only
place that we could happen.

1667
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:10,735
- Vermont is your home.
- I want you to be my home.

1668
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:12,519
I want to be yours.

1669
01:21:16,523 --> 01:21:18,830
I know we haven't known
each other for very long,

1670
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:23,095
but sometimes you just
have a feeling.

1671
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:39,938
Was that a meow?

1672
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:42,201
When I went to your house
and you weren't there,

1673
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,725
I had to go pick up
something for Milo.

1674
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,486
But I thought you said
a meow wouldn't work

1675
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,294
with your life in New York?

1676
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,428
Why don't you come on inside?

1677
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:55,258
- Can I help you with that?
- Please.

1678
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:10,838
- All right, a snake.
- This guy's for you.

1679
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:12,013
How does that feel?

1680
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,624
- Heavy?
- Furry.

1681
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:15,017
Furry!

1682
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:17,062
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey!

1683
01:22:17,236 --> 01:22:18,605
- Hey, Josh, Merry Christmas.
- Mom.

1684
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:20,239
Can we open presents now?

1685
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:22,024
Yes, we can.

1686
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:28,030
- Merry Christmas.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1687
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:30,597
- All right, come on.
- Okay, let's get in here.

1688
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:33,426
- I got a snake.
- Wow, look at this thing.

1689
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,274
- That's amazing. Wow.
- And I also got dinosaurs.

1690
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:37,430
And you also have one more
very special surprise.

1691
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:39,780
I think you should open it
right away.

1692
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:43,349
No way!
He's seriously mine?

1693
01:22:43,523 --> 01:22:45,351
He seriously is.

1694
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,284
But I thought you said
our crazy New York life

1695
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:50,479
wouldn't work for a kitten?

1696
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:52,141
That's true.

1697
01:22:52,315 --> 01:22:54,708
But I think a kitten
would be very happy

1698
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:57,320
with our new Vermont life.

1699
01:22:57,494 --> 01:22:59,365
What are you talking about?

1700
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,630
Yeah, you're gonna have to
expand on that.

1701
01:23:03,804 --> 01:23:05,502
I will always love New York

1702
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:08,679
for showing me I can do
anything I want,

1703
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:11,116
but what I want has changed.

1704
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,423
What I want is to come home.

1705
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:16,034
I can't wait to tell Vivian!

1706
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,732
Let's go call her right now,
okay?

1707
01:23:20,604 --> 01:23:24,086
We can show your new
friend around the house.

1708
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:37,186
Surprise.

1709
01:23:39,275 --> 01:23:41,016
Uh, wow.

1710
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,321
Mm-hm.

1711
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:43,757
What do you think?

1712
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:47,413
Well, I think now that I've
gotten to know your family,

1713
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:49,241
I guess it's time for you
to meet mine.

1714
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,244
I would love that.

1715
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:54,246
Next time they're in Vermont

1716
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,596
we should have them
over for dinner.

1717
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,400
Well, I was thinking we could
go visit them

1718
01:23:58,424 --> 01:23:59,643
