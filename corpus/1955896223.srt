Be advised
some systems
may be affected.

Copilot: I don't trust
this acat to fly our plane.

189
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,689
Just don't spill
any coffee on it.

190
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,658

to level 29.

192
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,668

of lethal and
nonlethal weapons.

195

Wow. This plane
is amazing.

I know it better
than anyone.

00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,951
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

Hmm.

202
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,962
I bet he's cute.

203
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,163
Yeah.
Yeah.

on a diet,

I'm gonna show you
something really cool.

who's working
the route with us?

Heh. Yeah, that's
a low-probability target.

216

Hi, Ken.

220
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,891
So what's the difference
between captain Simms
and a jet engine?

221
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,395
A jet engine stops whining
once it lands.

223
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,269
Um, coffee, I guess.

Oh, of course. Sure.

225
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,190
Let me know if you
need a refill.

226
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:24,511
So how'd it go with
your in-flight girlfriend?

227
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,347
Simms,
you wouldn't understand.

228
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,849
Neither will you
unless you

229
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,650

and ask her out.

230

00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,127
Sir, could you please
explain what you did

233
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,095
with your traffic control
for those planes?

234
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,598
Look, why don't
you show me what you
think I just said?

235
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,168
Okay. Both planes
are headed for Detroit.

236
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,170
Americana blue enters
our sector here.

Ehh. That should
never happen.

239
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,409
That's why you told
americana blue to climb.

240
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,846
Exactly.

241
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,020

these reports coming in.

dropping everywhere.

than n.A.S. Thinks
it is.

Listen, I can't
take the risk.

254

remove you.

the best coverage
out here, but, um,

it sure is.

is tamarack Ridge?

Well, you need
to get there

There's a tower there.

279

an analog signal

280

a shared medium.

your demux computers,

the signals together.

If I can get the signal
strong enough,

we're the president's
best hope of trying

366
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,299
to reestablish contact
with air force one.

367
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:14,046
Wait. So the satellites
could be entering
our atmosphere?

368
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,848
The f-16s
should be escorting

369
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,384

370
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,987

my dinner eats vegans.

with heart medicine.

our beacon is out.

543
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,545
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,318
The acat is trying
to eliminate human error,

545
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,687
but it's misidentifying us
as a threat.

546
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,722
Disable it, sir?
Negative.

547
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,024

there is a threat.

Well, I'll try
to alert security

00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,573
about a possible
acat malfunction.

553
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,711
Sir, the acat
marks two targets
as hostile approaching,

are spinning,

558
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,759

any control, sir.

559
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,896

so you need to take me
to your C.O. right now,

718
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,659
or you're gonna have
to explain to congress

719
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,795
why you let
a civilian airplane
hit air force one.

720
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,965
All right, let's go.

721
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,005
[Steam hissing]

722
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,692
[Radhika screams]

723
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,360
Hey! Where are you?!

724
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,930
[Gasps] Over here!

725
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,932
Ohh ho! Please!

726
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,100
Where are you?!

727
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,301
Help me!
I'm over here!

728
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,003
Please help!

729
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,738
Oh, please.

730
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,933
Bob: I've never seen
anything like this.

731
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,802
Where are you going?

732
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,639
To the bunker.

733
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:00,946
[Grunting]

734
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,650
Damn it.
Nothing?

735
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,819
Thing's not going anywhere.

736
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:08,887
We've haven't had
any identification tags

737
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,455
on these radar targets
at all.

738
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,490
Cleveland control must
have been knocked out
by the storm.

739
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,425
Yeah, and without
any identification tags,

740
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,494
acat is marking
everything as a target.

741
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,030
Including us.

742
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,699
Sir.

743
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,434
Attempting to contact

744
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,870
air force one, colonel.

745
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,374
Anything?

746
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,742
B.a.c.n. Is down,

747
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,744
so we're trying
to go off network.

748
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,212
Central command
through national guard

749
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,147
is feeding us intel,
but...

750
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,017
We might as well be
using smoke signals
right now, sir.

751
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,687
What was
the latest report?

752
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:42,988
Eyeballs have stated

753
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:45,390
that air force one
is in lockdown mode.

754
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,259
Any other birds
around it will be
deemed hostile.

755
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:51,697
We need to assemble a crew
for operation Sam fox.

756
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,498
Sam fox? Yes, sir.

757
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,400
But with what, sir?

758
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,338
That.

759
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:08,513
Are we
completely blind?

760
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,514
Tcas is nonfunctional.

761
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,216
We have no warning system.

762
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:12,718
Oh, shit.

763
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:14,820
Visual scans
in effect every
30 seconds.

764
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,787
Aye.

765
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:20,091
We need to clear
the aisle.

766
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,097
Gentlemen,
would you mind helping?

767
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,034
Yeah.

768
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,401
All right,
let's roll him
to the right.

769
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,203
On his side on 3.
1, 2...

770
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,204
3.
3.

771
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,340
[All grunting]

772
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,776
[Screams]

773
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,477
Let's go.
Over here.

774
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,847
Lindsay: Try and
get him in a seat.

775
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,251
[Computer beeps]

776
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:48,887
Oh, no.
The acat has marked
an unknown target.

777
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,322
And if it continues
on its current
path and speed,

778
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,624
that airplane
will be within
100 meters of us

779
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:54,993
in less than
an hour, sir.

780
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,561
Let's fix this thing
so we won't

781
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:57,929
be there when
it happens, major.

782
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,803
[Screaming]

783
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,506
[Alarm blaring]

784
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:11,076
What the heck?

785
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:12,143
Status?

786
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,611
Air craft addressing
and reporting system

787
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,646
is fried, too.
We can't be sure

788
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,849
what Cleveland knows
about our situation.

789
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,018
Can we get him
to stand?

790
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,392
Right.

791
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,526
No, no, no, no, no.

792
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:29,961
Slam--slammers
are in the tube.

793
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:31,029
Slammers are
in the tube,

794
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,597
and based on
its size and speed,

795
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,799
that unknown target

796
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:35,466
is a civilian
aircraft, sir.

797
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,805
You telling me
we're about to fire
on a civilian plane?

798
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,707
I'll go get some blankets
to cover up.

799
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,409
Sir, I need
you to get back
into your seat.

800
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,543
Aah!

801
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,677
Sir, I'm gonna
have to ask you

802
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,046
to get back
into your seat, please.

803
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,148
You can't make me
die up here.
No, no, sir.

804
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,282
No, no, no, sir!

805
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,118

Take him out!

808
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:57,889
Sir, stop!

809

Sir, calm--
[Scattered yelling]

810
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,228

Sir!

813

all over the body!

815

of the beast!

Thank you.

818

Let's get him
back to his seat
right now, okay?

819
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,082
On three.

820
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,084
Sir...

821
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,954
Is there anything
we could do to stop this?

822
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:32,123
No, major,

823
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,425
there isn't.

824
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,865
Good. Thank you.

You got 'em closed?
Yeah.

You sure?

829
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,390
It's headed
right toward 'em.

830
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:11,162
Okay,
I'm gonna meet you
in the back, okay?

831
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,230

Bringing her down.

844
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,255

00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,376
I have to warn
the captain.

What's going on?

852
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,987
Nigel's checking now, sir.

853
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:43,788
Put your
oxygen masks on!

Oh, no, Lindsay!

There's
an unexploded missile!
It's in cabin!

856
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,827
I think he said
there's a missile
in the cabin.

[Chuckles]

900
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,892
Yeah, but it's still
headed right for us.

901
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,427
If we don't change
our course,

902
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:18,429
we're gonna collide
with it in less
than 30 minutes.

903
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,998
Well, the acat
has our course
locked in.

904
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:24,269
But that DC-9
is flying right at us.

905
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,904
Why is it off
its approved flight path?

906
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,613
This used to be an--
an old military base.

907
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:38,082
The army has some old
communication equipment

908
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,951
that they stowed away
in a concrete bunker.

909
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,052
If we can communicate,

910
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,954
we can stop the collision.
Come on.

911
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,333
[Grunting]

912
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,970
We need an acetylene torch
to open this thing.

913
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,472
It's welded shut.

914
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:02,940
Do we have time
to find one?

915
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,377
No. Damn it.

916
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,579
There's gotta
be another way
to save those planes.

917
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,750
Gotta be.

918
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:19,023
Status?

919
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:20,358
Still disabling,
sir.

920
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:26,096
Something's coming up
on us real fast.

921
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,999
Looks like a c-130.

922
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,335
C-130? Why?

923
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,505
It's gotta be
operation Sam fox.

924
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,614
There's gotta
be a way to prevent any more
of our missiles from firing.

925
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:47,051
Maybe i--i can cut
the control panel,
i--i think.

926
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:49,019
Do it.

927
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,057
[Alarm blaring]

928
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,925
Acat didn't
like that one bit.

929
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,026
Let's hope it worked.

930
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:00,998
There's gotta be a way
to reduce our airspeed.

931
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,368
Come on. Come on.

932
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,016
[Whispering]
Who's there?

933
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,387
Major Roberts,
is that you?

934
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,389
Where's
the president?!

935
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:26,256
Last I checked,
he was in his suite.

936
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,825
I'm going to look
now, sir.

937
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,527
Sergeant!

938
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,562
Proceed
with caution.

939
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:42,206
Mr. President.

940
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:45,075
Joan, is that you?
Yes, sir.

941
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,544
Do you have
milani with you?

942
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,246
No, sir, I don't.

943
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,648
Where is she?

944
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,016
What's going on
out there?

945
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,518
The security doors
are programmed

946
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,753
to isolate
a threat, sir.

947
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,855
What threat?
Did someone
take milani?

948
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:58,856
Oh, god, no.

949
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,257
I don't know, sir.

950
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:01,926
Agent Lee is locked
in the security station.

951
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:03,961
Agent Roberts is locked
in the lavatory, sir.

952
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,330
I was in the hallway
when the doors
deployed, sir.

953
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,098
W-we'll find her.
We'll find her.

954
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,735
Uh, Joan, listen.
I need status from
the control cabin.

955
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:14,171
Go and report back.
And, Joan,

956
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,840
find milani.

957
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,708
Yes, sir.

958
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,210
Where did our girl--
I mean, where could
she have gone?

959
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,612
No, no.
She was
sitting right--

960
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,784
agent Lee.

961
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:30,087
The president
and Mrs. Phillips
are secure, sir.

962
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,456
Milani is missing.

963
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:32,990
I'm going forward
to the control cabin.

964
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,859
Keep me advised.

965
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:52,710
Sir, that civilian plane
is still headed
right towards us.

966
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,612
We can't execute
Sam fox at this speed.

967
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:55,813
Can you slow us down?

968
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,815
Sir, the avionics are
way too delicate.

969
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,984
I cut any more
of these wires,

970
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:00,985
and I'm bringing us down.

971
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,530
I've only got
one round left.

972
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:19,504
Identify yourself.

973
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:21,071
Cabin crew chief, sir.

974
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,908
Joan,
the security door's
malfunctioning.

975
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,576
We've weakened it
from the inside,

976
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:28,513
but is there any way
you can open it
from out there?

977
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:32,950
If I can guide it
on this end, sir,
it might work.

978
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,951
You push. I'll pull.

979
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,521
1, 2...

980
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,623
[Both grunt]

981
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,426
Again, sir.

982
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,795
1, 2, 3!

983
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,599
[Beeping]

984
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,671
Joan, the acat's
marking the cockpit door
as being attacked,

985
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,372
that there's a threat
on the main deck.

986
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,708
Crew chief,
I think that means
us and you.

987
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,646
What status shall I report
to the president, sir?

988
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:04,081
We must override
the acat.

989
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,418
Sir, I gave the president
the override codes.

990
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,920
Go get the codes, Joan,

991
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,356
and bring 'em
back to me, okay?

992
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:14,959
And for
the president's
ears only,

993
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,628
operation Sam fox.

994
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,234
Milani, where are you?
[Sighs]

995
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:32,777
Now we're
getting somewhere.

996
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:35,713
Joan.

997
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,316
Milani.

998
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:41,051
Joan, what happened?
I got locked out.

999
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:43,387
The new acat program
has malfunctioned.

1000
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,322
Is my dad okay?
Yes, they're fine.

1001
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,323
They're locked
in the suite.

1002
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,457
Could I talk to them?

1003
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,793
No, not yet.

1004
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:51,696
We need to make sure
there isn't an intruder.

1005
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,430
Where are
the agents?

1006
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,600
Agent Lee is locked
in the security station.

1007
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,735
Agent Roberts is locked
in the lavatory.

1008
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:00,605
What are you gonna do?

1009
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:02,807
I need to get
the override codes
to colonel lawler.

1010
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:05,242
I gave them to your dad
in a folder. Remember?

1011
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:09,246
Yeah. With his paperwork
in the suite.

1012
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:14,051
Milani, I need you
to sit tight.

1013
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,165
That's right.

1014
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:32,102
[Spoon clatters]

1015
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,073
We don't need these
anymore.

1016
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,474
Look, we're too low.

1017
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,876
Aoki, what the hell's
going on?

1018
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,377
Look, whatever that
was that hit us,

1019
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,880
it compromised
our fuel tanks.

1020
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,048
Great.

1021
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:45,650
Anything with
an integrated circuit

1022
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,784
is completely
burned up.

1023
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,786
What about landing?

1024
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:52,322
Landing gear appears
to be nonoperational.

1025
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,792
Is there
any good news?

1026
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,729
Well, at least we're
still locked on
to our beacon.

1027
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:08,138
The acat is detecting
a hostile intruder
on the main deck.

1028
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,775
After everything
that thing's done today.

1029
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:12,109
It's gotta mean Joan,
major.

1030
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,878
There's nobody else
in the hallways.

1031
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:16,613
Yeah, and we
don't have much time
to change course.

1032
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,918
If she can't
get us those codes,

1033
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,420
we are betting
the president's life

1034
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,922
on operation Sam fox.

1035
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:27,491
Yeah, and it's never
been done at this speed.

1036
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:30,027
It's impossible
at this speed, major.

1037
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,963
We gotta abort
the mission.

1038
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,564
Yeah, but how?

1039
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,767
I don't know.

1040
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:41,638
Sir! Sir,
what are you doing?

1041
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:44,909
Colonel lawler...

1042
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,844
What, major?!
Please.

1043
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,079
You will crash
this plane.

1044
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,784
If I didn't think
putting a bullet
in this thing

1045
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:56,153
wouldn't take us
all down with it...

1046
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,057
Colonel.

1047
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:04,294
Sir, please.

1048
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,800
There's gotta be
another way.

1049
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,270
All right.
We have to think.

1050
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,638
Yeah.

1051
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,306
All right.

1052
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,242
Yeah. We gotta think.

1053
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:19,443
We gotta think.

1054
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:32,622
Nigel.

1055
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,758
Nigel.

1056
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,760
He got sucked
out of the plane.

1057
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,061
Where the hell were you?

1058
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,266
One of the passengers
was hit by the missile.

1059
01:01:58,082 --> 01:01:59,283
[Gasps]

1060
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:04,088
Could you grab
a blanket?

1061
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:04,989
Thank you.

1062
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:09,559
Sir, would you mind
helping move him?

1063
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,197
Let's get him in that...

1064
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:14,364
Chair right there.

1065
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,973
Yeah, keep his head
covered.

1066
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,575
Thank you. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

1067
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,178
You can go
back to your seat.
Thank you.

1068
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,358
She was sitting
right here when--

1069
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:15,725
she can't have
gone far.

1070
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,862
She wouldn't go off
by herself,
would she?

1071
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:19,864
No. No, she wouldn't. Um...
My god.

1072
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:21,765
[Knocks on door]
Sir.

1073
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:22,867
Mr. President.

1074
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:24,301
Yeah, Joan.
Joan, is that you?

1075
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,102
I found milani.

1076
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,536
She's under
the stairs.

1077
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,005
I told her
to stay put.

1078
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:30,207
Rest assured there's
no sign of an intruder.

1079
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,977
Colonel lawler
believes the acat
is malfunctioning.

1080
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,012
W-what?
Malfunctioning?

1081
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:39,283
Yes, sir.
He told me to tell you
operation Sam fox.

1082
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,450
No. No, don't--

1083
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,419
don't worry. Calm down...
Is it that serious?

1084
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:43,453
And we'll get
through this.

1085
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,654
All right. Uh,

1086
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,722
what's lawler's plan?

1087
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:46,891
He wants to try

1088
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,125
the executive
override code, sir.

1089
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,927
Will it open
these damn doors?

1090
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,328
We hope so, sir.

1091
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:54,364
Could you
please pass the codes

1092
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:55,232
under the door, sir?

1093
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:57,234
Yeah. Yeah.
Hold on a second.

1094
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,941
All right, uh, Joan,

1095
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,343
there are 5 copies
of the override codes.

1096
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,345
I'm keeping one, okay?

1097
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:12,516
And, Joan, hurry.

1098
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:16,820
Just--just hurry.

1099
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,055
Understood, sir.

1100
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,471
I need
the flight attendant.

1101
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,605
Ma'am.

1102
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:41,145
Ma'am, I need your help.

1103
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:43,480
Ma'am.

1104
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,581
I need my medication.

1105
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:46,283
Okay. Do you remember
where it is?

1106
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:48,818
Yeah, it's in the red bag,
but they took it.
I have epilepsy.

1107
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,620
If I don't get
my medication,
I could die.

1108
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,788
Okay. We'll get it
for you.

1109
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,157
I know where it is.

1110
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:54,959
Sir, could--
would you mind
getting it for her?

1111
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,226
I'm having an aura.

1112
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,327
That means I don't
have a lot of time.

1113
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,862
I need those pills.
Okay, okay.

1114
01:04:58,862 --> 01:04:59,964
We'll get them
for you.

1115
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:02,199
What the hell
is going on now?

1116
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,968
She needs
her medication.

1117
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:05,169
It's in
that red bag.

1118
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:06,270
Whoa.

1119
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,173
What do
you think
you're doing?

1120
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,175
She needs medication.
Can't you see that?

1121
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:13,010
You're not
touching that bag.

1122
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,079
I won't touch the patch.
I'll just get the pills.

1123
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,614
It's too big a risk.
She could die.

1124
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,517
Look, if you
touch that bag

1125
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,686
and that hole reopens,

1126
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,089
it's a death sentence
for everybody
on this plane.

1127
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,890
Look, I don't want
to die either, okay?

1128
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,492
I'll just get the pills
nice and easy.

1129
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,194
That's what you say,
but what if you're wrong

1130
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:31,228
and it blows? What then?

1131
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,396
You can't take
that chance.

1132
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,431
I have a baby at home.
What about him?

1133
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,500
Lindsay: Hurry.
She's starting
to convulse.

1134
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,002
She's sick.

1135
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:40,504
It's not worth it.

1136
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:41,638
Go sit down.

1137
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:44,008
We all deserve to live,
not just the two of you.

1138
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:46,343
I said sit down.

1139
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:47,311
Hey!
Get back!

1140
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,479
Put your hands
on me.

1141
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,115
Come on!

1142
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:55,119
We gotta route them
around that somehow.

1143
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,321
Look, I'm not giving up,
but how are we

1144
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:59,289
supposed to contact them
with no electronics?

1145
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,926
Maybe we could ping
their receiver somehow.

1146
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:06,030
The DC-9 still has
equipment from the seventies.

1147
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:08,198
There's only
one place I know

1148
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,666
that still has
that ancient equipment.

1149
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:10,767
Where's that?

1150
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,536
The aviation museum.

1151
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:16,440
Come on.
My car is blocked.
We gotta use yours.

1152
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,121
Gentlemen, people!

1153
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:32,856
It's getting so strong.

1154
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:35,125
I need something
for her mouth.

1155
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:39,563
Oh, god.

1156
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:40,764
Oh, god.

1157
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:43,200
This is what you want.

1158
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,069
Don't you dare
look away from her.

1159
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,172
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:07,557
She's gone.

1161
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,493
This is
what you wanted.

1162
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,464
You still have to live
with yourselves.

1163
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,342
Gentlemen,
back to your seats.

1164
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,314
Here she comes.

1165
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,749
It's not gonna work
at this speed.

1166
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:09,719
Boom attached.

1167
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,621
Lieutenant Montgomery,
prepare for extraction.

1168
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,259
Operation Sam fox
is coming.

1169
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:16,860
Now I want you to go.

1170
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,862
No. No,
not without milani.

1171
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:20,464
It'll be easier
for me to help milani

1172
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:22,832
if I don't have to worry
about you getting hurt.

1173
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,168
Henry,
I don't understand.

1174
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,270
I thought they said it
was just a malfunction.

1175
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,305
All right, look.
Operation Sam fox is here.

1176
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:30,674
That means we need
to get off this plane.

1177
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:33,177
Mr. President,
let's go.

1178
01:08:33,177 --> 01:08:34,511
No, no, no.
You're taking her first.

1179
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:37,181
Sir, my orders are
to extract
you first.

1180
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:38,315
I am your
commander in chief,

1181
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,184
and I am giving you
a direct order

1182
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:41,618
to take my wife first.

1183
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:45,189
Sir, my orders are
to extract you and
then your family.

1184
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,858
I am the president
of the United States,

1185
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:52,229
and you will do
what I tell you now.

1186
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,766
Yes, sir.

1187
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,436
Ma'am, I need you
to step into
the harness.

1188
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,605
Henry, I don't think
I can go through with this.

1189
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:05,209
Kim, Kim, I need
you to stay with me
for milani, okay.

1190
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,444
Oh. Okay. Exactly how
is this gonna work?

1191
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:09,746
We're going tandem.
I'll be right here.

1192
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:10,847
Oh, god. Henry.

1193
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:12,015
Honey,
I know you're scared...

1194
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:13,283
I'm really
freaking out right now.

1195
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,418
But this is
the safest way.

1196
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,019
You might get hurt
if you stay here.

1197
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:17,954
Okay.
Mr. President,
the rope.

1198
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,423
What about milani?
I will find milani.

1199
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:21,591
Don't worry, okay?
Now, I know you
can do this.

1200
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,826
We have to go.

1201
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,728
Henry, I don't think
I can go through with this.

1202
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:25,962
Yes, you can,
sweetheart.

1203
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,297
Henry, I can't do this!

1204
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,532
I will be with you
all the time.

1205
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:30,234
I'm gonna need you
to hold tight, sir.

1206
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:31,568
I love you, honey.

1207
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:32,536
Love you.

1208
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:44,914
Sir, the plane
is changing course
to avoid turbulence.

1209
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,317
We gotta move fast now.

1210
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:54,258
[Kim screaming]

1211
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,295
Something's wrong.

1212
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,496
They're
falling away.

1213
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,966
Did the acat
deploy weapons?

1214
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:05,168
Nah, it's a negative, sir.
That's gotta be something else.

1215
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,170
Something's wrong.
It's all wrong, man.

1216
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,872
[Screaming]

1217
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:15,512
It's too heavy.

1218
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,814
[Groaning]

1219
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,785
It's not gonna hold!

1220
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,656
[Screaming]

1221
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:46,009
Okay. Okay.

1222
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,111
Okay. Okay.

1223
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:50,079
[Sobbing]

1224
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,247
[Hatch closes]

1225
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,250
He saved me. Ohh.

1226
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,420
[Sobbing]

1227
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:06,330
I'm getting reports
that Sam fox has failed.

1228
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,831
At which point
did it fail?

1229
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,599
Did the president
make it on the plane?

1230
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,067
Details are
unclear, sir.

1231
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,702
Keep trying.
Yes, sir.

1232
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,237
Are you in charge?

1233
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,805
Not now.
Yes, now!

1234
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:19,008
Private, this is not
a holding facility.

1235
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,444
I made him take me to you!

1236
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,746
Private, get her
out of my face.

1237
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:25,649
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
I can talk to the airplane.

1238
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:28,051
You can't talk
to air force one
right now,

1239
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,353
because you have
no communications.

1240
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:32,356
But I can!
I can do this.

1241
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,593
You have 30 seconds
to tell me how.

1242
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,895
I need to make it
to the top of that mountain,

1243
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:41,931
and I need to make it
up there in less
than five minutes.

1244
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:54,043
Whatever it takes,

1245
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,779
we've gotta
land this plane.

1246
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,381
Yes, sir.

1247
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,383
Colonel,
I have the codes.

1248
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:03,520
Thank god.

1249
01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:06,590
I'll slide them
under the door.

1250
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:07,891
Coming to you now, sir.

1251
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:09,393
Okay.

1252
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:12,662
They won't fit, sir.

1253
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,130
There's not
enough space.

1254
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,899
[Beeping]

1255
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:19,469
Joan, the acat's
marking you as
a hostile intruder.

1256
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:22,005
It's got you
in its crosshairs.

1257
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,740
Lawler:
We gotta move fast.

1258
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,309
I'll read them
to you, sir. Um...

1259
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:29,312
Step one, biometric
identification, sir.

1260
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,415
Do you see
the system, sir?

1261
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:34,984
Activating
biometric station.

1262
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,423
All right.
Once identity...

1263
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,158
[Electricity crackling]
Is verified,
you'll press--

1264
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:44,561
Joan,
something's wrong.

1265
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,697
The acat's--aah!

1266
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,198
The acat's trying
to kill us, Joan!

1267
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,867
What?

1268
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,102
[Crackling]
Sir!

1269
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,104
Colonel!
Run!

1270
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,873
Run, Joan!
Colonel, sir!

1271
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,575
[Yells]

1272
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:13,923
[Helicopter blades whirring]

1273
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,706
We've got 5 minutes
to get this to work.

1274
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:33,209
This analog system
is independent
from the acat.

1275
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:35,278
What can I do
to help?

1276
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:37,346
Well, we need a radio.

1277
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,748
Okay.

1278
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,484
First let's...

1279
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,015
Anything?

1280
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:15,685
Nothing.

1281
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,721
I need to boost
the signal.

1282
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:22,826
Mr. President!
Mr. President!

1283
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:23,827
Joan.

1284
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:24,961
Mr. President.

1285
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:25,962
What's the status

1286
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,230
in the control cabin?

1287
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:29,232
The acat has killed
colonel lawler

1288
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,567
and major Lewis, sir.

1289
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,302
Agent Lee is trying
to disable it now.

1290
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,005
W-wait a minute.
Who will fly the plane?

1291
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,578
Joan, you have got
to get us out of here.

1292
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:42,912
Once the acat
is turned off,

1293
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,782
there will be no one
flying this plane.

1294
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:46,683
Joan!

1295
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,417
Joan, can you hear me?

1296
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,687
Joan! Joan!

1297
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:52,121
Sergeant, are you there?

1298
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,995
[Laser blasts]

1299
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:04,701
Wait.

1300
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,255
Milani!

1301
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:53,149
Here. Try this.

1302
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:56,686
[Static buzzing]

1303
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,455
Okay. We got radio.

1304
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:00,990
Okay, now for radar.

1305
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,330
Hand me the batteries from
the, uh, security lights.

1306
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,665
Here.

1307
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:10,634
Come on, baby.

1308
01:16:10,634 --> 01:16:13,402
This has got to work.

1309
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,038
Come on, now.

1310
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:21,778
All right.

1311
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,214
[Pinging]

1312
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,083
[Laughs] We got radar.

1313
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,484
Okay.

1314
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:30,453
But we won't
have radar tags.

1315
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:34,523
Well, we'll just
get the altitude
from the pilot manually.

1316
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,225
We'll do it
the old way.

1317
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,727
Okay.

1318
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:41,530
Americana blue,
this is Cleveland control.

1319
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,666
Please respond.

1320
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:43,867
[Static crackles]

1321
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,570
Americana blue 23,

1322
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:50,740
this is Cleveland control.
Please respond.

1323
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,746
Damn it.

1324
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,688
Dad.

1325
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:05,789
[Gasps]
No. Milani.

1326
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,523
Milani.
Are you okay, honey?

1327
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:09,693
Dad, dad, the--
the lasers got Joan.

1328
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:10,894
All right, listen.
Listen, milani.

1329
01:17:10,894 --> 01:17:11,961
Listen very carefully.

1330
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,763
Can you get
the override codes?

1331
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,265
Got it.

1332
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,566
Good girl.
Good girl.

1333
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,702
Now listen, milani.

1334
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:20,169
The lasers are
motion sensitive,

1335
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,604
so try to avoid them

1336
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:23,506
or--or distract them
if you can.

1337
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:25,041
Distract them with what?

1338
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,210
Anything, sweetheart.
Anything you can find.

1339
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,912
Dad, dad,
they're coming.

1340
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:30,179
Once you
turn off the acat,

1341
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,548
there will be no one there
to fly the plane

1342
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:34,317
until I get there,
so just stay calm

1343
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,318
and grab the stick, okay?

1344
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,055
Oh, be careful,
milani.

1345
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:52,335

There's something wrong
with our beacon.

the wrong way.

figure out

1365

Listen, these old planes
have analog systems.

01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:17,486

can reach somebody
in Detroit on that.
