1
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,076
Hey, TJ. What's up?

2
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,954
- What's your worst day ever?
- I don't know.

3
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,799
- Today?
- No, really.

4
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,113
When I got arrested
for stealing telephone poles.

5
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,553
Why?

6
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,833
Remember that story
about the father and daughter?

7
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,679
- That drunk guy?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,917
- Did you like that?
- Yeah, it was very good.

9
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,272
They rejected it.

10
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,794
Forget them, TJ.
Just...

11
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,428
And get this...
Wilson calls me in his office today.

12
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,235
They want to make me
a shop supervisor.

13
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,870
- Do you want to get out of here?
- I can't. I've got to string chairs.

14
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,915
No. I mean, get out of here.
Go some place else.

15
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,752
- Where?
- It doesn't matter. Who cares?

16
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,430
As long as we're out of here.
Look at this place!

17
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,552
What's wrong with you, Burke?

18
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,756
Every day people do something with
their lives. It's never you or me.

19
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,673
TJ, we're from Detroit. We're the
best skiers on this mountain.

20
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,352
- This isn't a mountain.
- The Wings are going to the Cup.

21
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,518
The Wings are never
going to the Cup.

22
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,350
And I'm about to close a deal
with Rita at Sal's Place.

23
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,917
- Just because you had her...
- I never touched her.

24
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,874
She's got a tattoo
of Wile E. Coyote on her ass.

25
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,189
- How do you know that, then?
- That is not the point!

26
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,075
You're making five bucks an hour
working on a landfill.

27
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,193
- I'm on a list at the foundry.
- Oh, God...

28
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,914
Is that all you want out of life?

29
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,192
No, that's not all, I got plans, but...

30
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,231
What are they?

31
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,035
I got my wants.
Things that I'm going to do.

32
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,199
What things?
What are your plans, Dex?

33
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,549
Why are you doing this to me?

34
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,834
Because I'm going to leave.

35
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,275
And I don't want to do this alone.
I want you to go with me.

36
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,678
OK.

37
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,394
Good.

38
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,235
- So I've got to quit my job?
- You got it.

39
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,393
That I can do.

40
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,912
- Jackson Hole looks cool.
- It's 40 below there.

41
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,113
We're from Michigan.
It'll be like living in Miami.

42
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,118
- Vail?
- What about it?

43
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,676
No, the guy who designed Wendy's
went nuts there.

44
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,156
- Steamboat Springs?
- What about Aspen?

45
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,837
"The most famous ski resort, Aspen
has many employment opportunities.

46
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,555
"Housing is in short supply.
Job competition is fierce.

47
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,116
- "A playground of the rich."
- What do you think?

48
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,917
- We'd be like Beverly Hillbillies.
- lt'll be like Mackinac lsland.

49
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,954
You got a chick from Yale.
I slept in the car.

50
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
- She had a friend.
- A cousin.

51
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,833
Who could've made an onion cry.
That face still haunts me.

52
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,715
This is KHI Radio in Aspen,
Colorado.

53
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,194
Dex, wake up!
That was Aspen.

54
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,995
- I heard it on the radio.
- Really?

55
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,270
Great, man.

56
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,677
Holy shit!

57
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,113
The lifts don't open till 9.

58
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,633
- We wanted to get first tracks.
- You guys must be new. Come on.

59
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,913
This is outrageous!
Anywhere around here will be fine.

60
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,116
- Where are you from?
- Detroit.

61
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,788
Out here to be ski instructors?

62
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,869
About a hundred a year show up.
Locals call it "Freshman Class".

63
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,277
You read about movie stars
and want to move here.

64
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,552
Yeah, that's all part of it.

65
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,320
I hope you guys are good.

66
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,950
When you're ready, go!

67
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,594
Come on, 25!

68
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,748
- These guys are good.
- But they're not from Detroit.

69
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,433
This isn't a circus.
Stay on the ground!

70
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,869
For those of you still standing...
Welcome to the Aspen Ski School.

71
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,595
My name is Karl Stall.
I'm the ski school director.

72
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,588
- There are five positions open.
- Three!

73
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,590
- Where are you from?
- Mount Brighton.

74
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,315
- Do you have anything tougher?
- Shut up.

75
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,909
Yes, I have...

76
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,915
What's with these pants, TJ?
Everybody's got a good butt.

77
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,270
Must have a law against ugly women.
How you doing?

78
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,119
How are you?

79
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,309
Look, if...

80
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,556
If I don't make the cut...

81
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,275
- You'll make it.
- Then don't worry about me.

82
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,439
- I'll go back to Mount Brighton.
- Forget it, you'll make it.

83
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,474
If I make it, you don't,
I'm staying here.

84
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
- You can't.
- Why not?

85
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,557
I can't leave you stranded
with women like that.

86
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,594
Is that money or what?
You'd hurt yourself.

87
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,350
- She's coming over here, TJ.
- She is.

88
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,997
- I don't speak American Express.
- Say you were in the Olympics.

89
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,715
Excuse me, my friend here
was not in the Olympics.

90
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,434
- No?
- No.

91
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,710
Why not?

92
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,515
I won $50 bowling
and lost my amateur status.

93
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,469
Bryce?

94
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,357
Check that out.

95
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,395
She was staring at you
like you're on the menu.

96
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,477
T J Burke salad!

97
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,830
Her earrings are bigger
than my nuts.

98
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,797
- Maybe she's a comparison shopper.
- They pay ski instructors, right?

99
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,878
Who cares?

100
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,350
Order me another beer.
I got to go to the john.

101
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,114
It's open!

102
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,956
Mr Stall, can I talk to you?

103
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,071
I've posted the results.

104
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,035
- I know.
- Congratulations.

105
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,314
- I probably don't know you well...
- You don't know me at all.

106
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,717
No, that's true.

107
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,471
But I think you're making a mistake
not hiring Dexter Rutecki.

108
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,913
- He'd make a great ski instructor.
- How would you know?

109
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,918
I just know. He's a great guy.

110
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,872
Our clients pay $400 a day
for lessons.

111
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,755
They expect ski instructors
to be a certain type. Like you.

112
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,431
Part of the job is fulfilling
a fantasy. You're the fantasy.

113
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,630
But I'm afraid your friend is not.
You ski very well.

114
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,310
- So does he.
- Skiing is the easy part.

115
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,435
I can't take this job without him.
He's my best friend.

116
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,631
I can't just leave him.

117
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,431
Why not give him all the students
nobody else wants?

118
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,153
- TJ, are you awake?
- Yeah.

119
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,795
- I didn't make the cut, did l?
- You got the job, didn't you?

120
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,754
- My name looked a little funny.
- There's no room to get paranoid.

121
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,636
- And I was the sixth guy...
- Dex, you skied great.

122
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,598
Just go to sleep.

123
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,872
- I really made the cut?
- Yes!

124
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,071
- But you should get a different hat.
- What are you, the fashion police?

125
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,310
This is just great.
I told you to fill the propane!

126
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,718
- I was excited. I forgot.
- So we freeze to death?

127
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,879
- We'll find a place open.
- Where? It's 5 in the morning!

128
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,638
- Was that the one we heard?
- I hope so.

129
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,072
- Great, we know her. Come on.
- Dex, wait.

130
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,194
Can we come in?

131
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,118
- I'm on the air.
- We're out of propane.

132
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,472
- Actually, we're fine.
- He's lying. We're freezing.

133
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,958
- I'm not lying. We'll be fine.
- He's lying!

134
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,430
- We won't stay very long.
- Stay until you get warm.

135
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,712
My name is TJ.
This is my friend Dexter.

136
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,151
- We're new in town.
- There's a news bulletin.

137
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,071
- We were hired as ski instructors.
- 100 guys try. They only take five.

138
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,840
- Six!
- Six.

139
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,594
- Maybe two make it till spring.
- We'll make it.

140
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,475
Not sleeping in your car
at 36 below zero.

141
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,077
About 1 0 inches of new snow
will make you feel great.

142
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,912
- Actually, it's a van.
- What?

143
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,680
You said we were sleeping
in a car.

144
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,752
- Don't think that we're ski bums.
- You better find a place to live.

145
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,633
Do you know a place like, maybe,

146
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,469
$350 a month,
couple of bedrooms, a view?

147
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,148
Yeah... Missouri.

148
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,433
She's serious.
We better go.

149
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,469
- How much for the coffee?
- Don't freeze to death.

150
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,356
Citizen of the Day is Milt Phillips,
a 26-year-veteran of the Fire Dept.

151
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,676
Congratulations, Milt!
Good job.

152
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,429
Every winter we do this,
even though I don't want to.

153
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,235
I get four weeks off.
You get two, and I get two.

154
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,436
- I take my two in Aspen.
- I'm a warm weather person. Bahamas!

155
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,509
Hi there, I'm TJ.
I'll be your ski instructor.

156
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,797
What the hell. Marriage is a
compromise. We'll work it out.

157
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,839
I don't want to ski with Santa!

158
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,316
You didn't want to ski
with Hans or Mark either!

159
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,035
Daddy and I want to ski, Kimberly.
Santa will be fun.

160
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,758
- I hate Santa!
- I'm sorry.

161
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,829
I wasn't nuts about him either.
I always got socks.

162
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,634
Good luck!

163
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,990
How are you guys doing?

164
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,069
So we got
Donner, Dancer, Prancer...

165
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,350
...and Dumbo.

166
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,553
- He was an elephant!
- Elephants can ski.

167
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,036
- I want to be Blitzen!
- OK, you're Blitzen.

168
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,152
- And you're Dumbo...
- No!

169
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,988
All right... Donner, Dancer,
Prancer, Rudolf, Gumby,

170
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,156
Dumbo, Blitzen, Sneezy,

171
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,031
Burpy, Chewie and Cheesy.
You guys want to go skiing?

172
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,074
Let's go skiing. Follow me!

173
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,915
Keep your knees bent.

174
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,076
That's it.

175
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,113
Stay on the centre of your skis.

176
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,349
- Is this great or what?
- Oh, yeah!

177
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,075
You're ski instructors.
I'm Santa Claus.

178
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,794
- How is the suit?
- Like a Porsche.

179
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,468
This woman was all over me.

180
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,395
You can't pick up women
when you're Santa Claus.

181
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,909
Rutecki!

182
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,759
It's probably about
that Easter Bunny suit.

183
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,431
Kimberly's mother said thanks.
You did a good job.

184
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,432
A hundred bucks and away!

185
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,395
- Best restaurant in town?
- I've got a doctor's appointment.

186
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,631
I've got to dump this suit.

187
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,749
Good evening.

188
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,829
- Great atmosphere, huh?
- I wonder how much it is.

189
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,032
These things
don't have prices on them.

190
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,674
I got a hundred bucks.
Relax.

191
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,077
- Bonsoir, messieurs.
- No, thank you.

192
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,711
Excuse me.

193
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,436
- How much is the shrimp?
- Scampi, white sauce, or cocktail?

194
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,115
- The cocktail.
- $7.

195
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,793
- How many shrimps do you get?
- One, à la carte.

196
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,113
OK...

197
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,073
I think I'll have the cocktail.

198
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,317
- How many shrimps, sir?
- One.

199
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,875
Very good.
Pour vous, monsieur?

200
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,197
- You got beef?
- Of course.

201
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,115
- What does "à la carte" mean?
- Taking the shrimp out of the shell.

202
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,269
- Think we got enough for a pizza?
- You should've had the beef.

203
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,119
Dexter, we live in a car.

204
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,869
- We did not order that.
- The lady said congratulations.

205
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,955
Drink.

206
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,035
- Very good.
- Should be. It's $600 a bottle.

207
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,479
It's good.
A little tangy, but...

208
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,116
I could get used to that.

209
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,519
How was the wine?

210
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,437
Great.
But I think it's champagne.

211
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,512
I'm glad you liked it.
I'm Bryce Kellog.

212
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,393
I knew it would be
something like that.

213
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,753
Congratulations
on making the ski school.

214
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,316
I'm having some friends tonight.
Would you come?

215
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,917
Both of us?

216
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,514
Of course.

217
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,872
- Are we otherwise engaged?
- I think we're available.

218
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,753
Sure.

219
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,751
Come on, then!

220
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,272
Bryce.

221
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,636
- Hallo, Franz. Do you know TJ?
- I've been waiting for you.

222
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,755
- Are you sure you haven't met?
- I've seen your picture on a poster.

223
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,916
TJ's one of the new guys.

224
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,839
I can tell.

225
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,554
- If I'm in the way...
- Don't be silly.

226
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,716
No, be silly.

227
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,839
Du bist Gast hier, Franz.
Vergiss das nicht.

228
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,114
- Letzten Winter war ich nicht Gast.
- But seasons change.

229
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,274
- Do they?
- Yes.

230
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,790
Can I get a drink?
Do you know a T equila Slammer?

231
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,152
- I went to high school, yes.
- Could I have one?

232
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,510
Excuse me, how much do you think
it costs to heat this place?

233
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,676
That much, huh?

234
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,316
- So you're new in town, TJ?
- Well, l...

235
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,037
- Yeah.
- He's beautiful.

236
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,199
Thank you.

237
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,837
- What do you do, TJ?
- The greatest job: ski instructor.

238
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,114
- I thought I had the greatest job.
- Henri's retired.

239
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,952
My dad is your age. He's still got
eight years before he hits pension.

240
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,316
Hi.

241
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,312
- Are you enjoying this party?
- Yeah.

242
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,519
- I'm Tina.
- Dexter Rutecki.

243
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,748
Rutecki?
That is quite a mouthful.

244
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,590
My real name is David. When l
was a little kid I was real smart,

245
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,271
so everyone called me Poindexter.
They shortened it to Dexter.

246
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,190
That was better for me,
'cause it lowered my expectations.

247
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,392
- I'm being a moron. I'm nervous.
- Why?

248
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,594
Have you looked in the mirror? Your
boyfriend lets you go out like that?

249
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,794
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- Did I tell you I'm Dexter Rutecki?

250
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,436
- Where are you from?
- I'm Bryce's roommate.

251
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,272
- Bryce has a roommate?
- Bryce has a lot of rooms. And you?

252
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,157
- We've got a place by the mountain.
- Maybe I could see it sometime.

253
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,750
Either that,
or we could drive it over.

254
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,034
Back it up!

255
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,635
Great.

256
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,559
- I don't know...
- No, no! It's got a great view.

257
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,312
...whatever that stuff is. Got a full
rising package, all the Rossi gear...

258
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,159
...that's the new
seven-inch case, everything.

259
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,239
Corporate sponsorship...
Superstar gonzo ski-star...

260
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,112
You can't park there.

261
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,837
- We can't?
- No, there used to be a sign there.

262
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,670
- Was there a sign there?
- I didn't see a sign.

263
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,634
We've been kicked out of
every parking spot in town.

264
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,071
- Is there any overnight parking?
- No.

265
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,910
- It keeps the local population down.
- How did you become part of it?

266
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,240
- Easy. I was born here.
- We'll drive around all night.

267
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,910
I'll drive, you sleep.
You drive, I'll sleep...

268
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,593
Ask Mrs Harder at the gas station if
you can rent the place by the river.

269
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,997
- Tell her I sent you.
- Thank you!

270
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,239
It doesn't look like
you'll get to be locals on your own.

271
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,750
- We don't know your name.
- It's Robin.

272
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,678
- Come on.
- Hey, Robin...

273
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,990
Could l...

274
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,357
Could I buy you a drink sometime?

275
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,597
I stopped dating ski instructors
when I was sixteen.

276
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,349
- Why?
- Because they always leave town.

277
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,516
I just got here.

278
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,515
Give it a chance.

279
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,919
- It didn't go so good, huh?
- No.

280
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,119
- You got to be kidding. A caboose?
- lt'll be like living in a cartoon.

281
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,437
- Robin is doing this on purpose.
- She likes you.

282
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,872
- She thinks we're interlopers.
- What is this, Scrabble?

283
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,390
She gives you a hard time.
That's a good sign.

284
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,553
It's gonna be great!

285
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,669
All aboard!

286
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,198
I'm Andy Mill. Welcome to Aspen
Annual Powder 8 Championships!

287
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,789
Teams have come to find out

288
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,912
who are the best skiers
on the mountain.

289
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,792
Dave!

290
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,834
- Who's that up there?
- Franz Hauser and Rudy Zucker.

291
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,315
That guy from the poster?

292
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,478
It doesn't look so tough.
It's not so hard.

293
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,555
They're the best skiers. Won the
Powder 8 three years in a row.

294
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,356
Teams of two ski figure eight
patterns through the fresh powder.

295
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,074
Whoever makes
the most perfect tracks wins.

296
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,397
- What do you say we win this thing?
- Sure.

297
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,116
You've got to be able to ski
anywhere, any conditions.

298
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,348
You've got to do it without getting
killed or caught. It is illegal.

299
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,840
They want to make changes, but they
do the same things over and over.

300
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,114
Insanity is doing the same things
and expecting a different result.

301
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,518
Like a fly trying to get out.
It keeps hitting the glass.

302
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,550
Motivation is not enough.
You've got to have a better strategy.

303
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,920
Welcome to the 20th century.
You got a phone.

304
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,999
- Who is this?
- You're breaking my heart.

305
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,238
- Bryce?
- That's better. Are you busy?

306
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,715
No. We're not doing anything.

307
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,391
Why don't you come up to the house?
Alone.

308
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,672
Is Tina there?
Your roommate.

309
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,754
I don't have a roommate.
Just come up to the house.

310
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,028
- Another party?
- She wants me to come up.

311
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,038
- Where's Tina?
- I don't think she lives there.

312
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,596
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.

313
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,639
- I don't have to go.
- We're not married. Go ahead.

314
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,517
I'll just say hi.
When I get back, we'll do something.

315
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,995
- All right?
- Yeah.

316
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,710
Bryce?

317
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,595
Bryce!

318
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,069
Hello!

319
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,555
Bryce!

320
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,238
Bryce, it's TJ!

321
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

322
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,430
I'm afraid
there isn't a lifeguard on duty.

323
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,952
- Can you swim?
- Like a fish.

324
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,354
Hello, Bryce's house...home.

325
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,031
No, I'm just a friend.

326
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,629
Can you hold on one second?

327
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,876
Hello, this is Bryce's house.

328
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,312
Please don't answer my phone.

329
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,788
- They were ringing.
- They'll do that. Sit down.

330
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,711
Ronnie, we'll have breakfast. Put all
calls through to the Denver office.

331
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,798
Aspen just brings out
the best in people.

332
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,032
What would you like it to bring out
in you? Who do you want to be?

333
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,952
- I'm being it: ski instructor.
- I want to know what you want to be.

334
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,119
- It's not a bad life, Bryce.
- What happens when you're 40?

335
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,155
Thanks!

336
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,437
- Nah. Forget it.
- What?

337
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,473
No, it's just...

338
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,029
One time l...

339
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,757
- I wanted to be a writer.
- Really?

340
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,192
I wrote some stuff and tried
to sell it to magazines, but...

341
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,359
I never went to college,
so I never learned how to do it.

342
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,076
Do you read?
Anything that isn't in paperback?

343
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,398
No. They're the only things
that fit in my ski parka.

344
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,910
Remembrance of Things Past
by Proust.

345
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,114
Maybe you shouldn't read that
just yet.

346
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,437
- I had a great time.
- So did l.

347
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,912
- Am I going to see you again?
- After you read these.

348
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,510
Hey, Dex!

349
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,672
- Did you hold up a bookstore?
- Bryce got them for me.

350
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,633
Was your dinner conversation
boring her?

351
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,796
No.

352
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,111
We talked about writing, and...

353
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,515
She thought I should read these.

354
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,635
- T J Burke show, coming at you live!
- What's your problem?

355
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,628
I just spent the entire night
watching ping-pong.

356
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,391
- I'm sorry I left you alone.
- The Koreans are amazing.

357
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,311
- Where are you going?
- To practise for the Powder 8.

358
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,150
Wait.

359
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,199
We've got to stop.
I'm going to trombone breakfast.

360
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,392
What are we doing without oxygen?
Planes above 1 0,000 feet carry it.

361
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,596
- What are we at, like 1 2,000?
- No. 1 4,000.

362
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,873
- You shouldn't smoke here.
- I've got to expand my lungs.

363
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,955
- This is beautiful, huh?
- Powder 8. Let's go.

364
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,115
TJ! Burke!

365
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,233
Burke!
I'm coming, TJ!

366
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,475
- Slow down.
- You're going to the hospital.

367
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,478
We can't go to the hospital.
I'm fine.

368
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,235
- We had a little accident.
- What happened?

369
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,274
He fell into a crevasse skiing.
You got any medical facilities?

370
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,358
Yeah. Come and sit over here.

371
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,916
- It's not that bad.
- Lay right down here.

372
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,510
Let's see what we got...

373
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,270
There's a wooden box in the
top drawer that I'm going to need.

374
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,120
- Thanks, Robin.
- He should have gone to hospital.

375
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,269
- If we get caught, we're fired.
- That's better off than being dead.

376
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,189
- I would've been if not for him.
- That was foolish.

377
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,109
I know. But if I let him die,
his old man would kill me.

378
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,948
- This is funny, isn't it?
- He doesn't think it's funny.

379
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,914
There's a reason
you're not supposed to ski up there.

380
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,672
- We were practising for Powder 8.
- Something to risk your life for.

381
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,474
Come and pick TJ up
in the morning.

382
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,798
How about I stay here,
and TJ picks me up tomorrow?

383
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,355
How about not?

384
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,350
- He might have a concussion.
- You get all the luck, TJ.

385
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,118
I know.

386
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,952
- I'm going to bed.
- Thank you.

387
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,439
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

388
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,993
- Thanks.
- Want me to stick around?

389
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,431
- No.
- Are you sure?

390
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,393
- Yeah.
- All right.

391
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,512
She has got to put this ball away...

392
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,958
Question is,
when will she take the chance?

393
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,154
That's it! Oh, but she missed!
What a bad break for Yang.

394
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,878
OK guys, here's the deal.

395
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,152
First kid who can go
the whole day without crying

396
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,272
gets to ski behind the big kid. Me.

397
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,552
Who wants to be the first one
to not cry?

398
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,231
- Me!
- OK, you get to wear my magic hat.

399
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,910
Hi, Ronnie.
Is Bryce there?

400
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,590
- No, she's in Philadelphia.
- Till when?

401
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,828
Didn't she tell you?
I assumed that she'd let you know.

402
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,352
- Well, you'd think so.
- I'll tell her you called.

403
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,919
Burke! Franz is sick.
You take the Hanson family.

404
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,636
- I'm Franz's alternate.
- I'm the ski school director.

405
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,276
- If this is a big deal...
- It's a very big deal.

406
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,950
The Hansons will meet you
at the airport.

407
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,072
- What do you think of that spot, TJ?
- It looks outrageous!

408
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,399
- Lucky for you Franz got sick.
- Yeah. I feel a little bad.

409
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,637
Don't, man.
Franz is a dick.

410
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,279
Those are my clients, Burke.

411
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,914
I'm sorry, but you were sick.

412
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,635
When the Hansons come back,
I won't be sick.

413
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,196
Do you want to split the tip?

414
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,269
I don't want to split the tip!

415
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,836
Franz, they already booked me.

416
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,916
Asshole! I'm not here
for the party. This is my job.

417
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,752
Some rookie is not going to take it
while skipping a semester of college.

418
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,590
You got nothing to worry about,
asshole. I don't go to college.

419
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,311
Dick.

420
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,477
- That isn't your swing.
- Nobody was using it.

421
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,672
You know something?

422
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,111
You ought to be a plastic surgeon.
Look at this.

423
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,276
There's almost no scar.

424
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,869
I'm glad you gave it time to heal.

425
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,233
I'm not the one with the rule
about not dating ski instructors.

426
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,513
- "Thank you" would have been nice.
- That's why I'm here.

427
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,396
Could l...
Could I take you to dinner?

428
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,878
- You think I've changed the rule?
- It's just dinner.

429
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,914
That's all it's got to be.
Just dinner.

430
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,076
Where?

431
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,589
Anywhere you want to go.

432
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,436
OK.

433
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,835
OK?
OK.

434
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,952
OK. Good.

435
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,234
- I'll see you later, then.
- OK.

436
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,908
OK. Bye.

437
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,832
I majored in broadcasting. I was
going to be the next Jane Pauley.

438
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,670
- What happened?
- After graduation I got a dream job.

439
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,031
- Where?
- In LA.

440
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,031
The station manager said if I slept
with him I could have my own show.

441
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,393
But he was lying, so I came home.

442
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,078
- Where did you go to college?
- Light truck assembly plant.

443
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,275
- I think Aspen is my college.
- Are you learning anything?

444
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,270
That I want to be more
than just a ski instructor, yeah.

445
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,598
If I had gone to college,
I wanted to be a writer.

446
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,633
Maybe I could become one here.

447
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,759
What?

448
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,235
- Is that funny?
- No.

449
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,790
But everybody comes to Aspen
to be saved.

450
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,515
Oh, God.
I don't want to be saved.

451
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,033
- What do you want to write?
- I've got to live first.

452
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,476
I got to live a big life,

453
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,955
read everything, meet people.

454
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,756
I have this friend who's been
helping me out. She's very bright.

455
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,393
It's not a person.
It's Bryce Kellog.

456
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,276
She always gets the pick of the
litter. You should be flattered.

457
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:28,352
I know how it works. My dad was a ski
instructor. He's in the French Alps.

458
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,273
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. They have great snow.

459
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,798
Me and my mum were shopping.
I guess I was about five.

460
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,154
This little kid started following us.
He wouldn't leave us alone.

461
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,957
He wouldn't tell us his name.
Nobody we talked to knew who he was.

462
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:33,190
He stayed with us for three days.
When his old man came, he got scared.

463
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,517
He ran and hid in my room.

464
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,636
When I asked him why, he started
crying. He stayed over after that.

465
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,630
- I've looked after him ever since.
- Who looks after you?

466
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,432
He does.

467
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,554
You'll get used to him.

468
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,638
I'm trying to concentrate here.
Hold it down!

469
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,231
- When can I read something?
- There's nothing to read yet.

470
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,560
I get halfway through something
that's no good, and I throw it out.

471
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,069
Maybe I don't have anything
worth writing about.

472
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,396
I don't think that's true.

473
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,710
Can you smell that?
Winter's coming.

474
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,955
- Are you looking forward to it?
- Yeah.

475
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,435
- And you?
- No.

476
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,113
- Why not?
- I kind of like the off season.

477
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,318
- Really?
- Yeah.

478
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,155
TJ!
Check it out, man!

479
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,432
You're on the cover
of Powder Magazine!

480
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,393
You're a star!

481
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,031
Another season in paradise.
Open the mountain.

482
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,152
Swanson, you take Mrs Franks.

483
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,477
Chris, you have a lesson
at the Jerome.

484
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,159
Gazzi... Mountain Masters.
Corbett is still in Arizona.

485
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,470
Rutecki!

486
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,468
Congratulations.
Your first private lesson.

487
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,434
- Thanks, Karl.
- Meet Mr Hayward at the bottom.

488
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,560
What?

489
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,951
He's been through
everybody else.

490
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,998
Good luck, Dex!
I had him yesterday.

491
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,953
- Mr Hayward!
- Are you him?

492
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,191
- Probably. Dexter Rutecki.
- Mort Hayward.

493
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,712
- Where the hell have you been?
- How do you ski, Mr Hayward?

494
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,593
Shitty.

495
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,837
- What do you want to work on?
- What do you think?

496
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,316
You're too tense, Mr Hayward.
Relax.

497
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,715
Push out!

498
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,794
- Oh, shit, no!
- Push your feet out, Mr Hayward!

499
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,673
Snowplough!

500
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,518
Just sit down!

501
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,311
Bail!

502
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,151
Rutecki, where's your student?

503
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,716
He was running
a stop sign on Aspen Street.

504
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,752
- Did he get hurt?
- No, he called from the hotel bar.

505
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,479
- You think it's funny?
- Relax. We're not curing cancer.

506
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:44,038
We're teaching people how to slide
down hills with sticks on their feet.

507
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,789
- I'm sorry.
- You're a professional instructor.

508
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,470
- I'm suspending you for two weeks.
- You serious?

509
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,835
Yes, I am.

510
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,511
Jake, this is Dexter Rutecki.

511
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,275
- Let me take you to dinner.
- You took me last night.

512
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,678
- And when the season ends?
- I'll take you to Mexico.

513
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,598
KHI is looking
for a dachshund named Sasha.

514
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,510
Sasha has a cashmere sweater
and gold collar. Don't step on her.

515
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,996
- What do you think?
- It's good.

516
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,395
Really good.

517
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,152
If you write that for somebody, you
better be willing to go all the way.

518
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,836
Maybe I am.

519
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,549
- Can I talk to you?
- It's my first beer of the day.

520
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,070
It's not about the beer.
It's about Tina.

521
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,875
- What about Tina?
- Do you know what she does?

522
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,790
- I haven't asked.
- Maybe you should.

523
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,870
Don't tell me how to pick my friends.
I'm good at that. I picked you.

524
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,119
- Hello?
- Hi.

525
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,038
Bryce?

526
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,550
- Can I explain?
- You don't have to.

527
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,951
- Things are different now.
- Can I see you?

528
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,630
No.
I have to go.

529
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,472
You don't hate me, do you?

530
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,555
No. But you went to Philadelphia.

531
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,957
Someone has to make money
in this family.

532
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,714
Where are you going?

533
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,755
- I have a private lesson.
- I know. I hired you for the day.

534
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,590
I figured you'd be mad, and l
wanted to see you. And it worked.

535
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:56,428
You're on the cover and the poster.
You could get used to that.

536
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:03,079
They photographed all the guys.
I was the only one with my eyes open.

537
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,158
Would you like to come up
for a drink?

538
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,237
- This was a nice day, but...
- Please.

539
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,228
- I just want to talk.
- About what?

540
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,228
About maybe being friends again.

541
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,672
I just miss it very much, that's all.
Just a drink.

542
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,114
Just a drink! Come on.

543
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,836
- I just can't do it on my own.
- Why not?

544
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,995
Because my mother's coming
tomorrow. I have to pick her up.

545
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,918
Give this to a guy named Steve.
He'll know what you look like.

546
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,318
- What's in it?
- It doesn't matter.

547
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,832
If the police bust you,
you'll take a lie detector test.

548
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,999
You'll pass because
you don't know what's in it.

549
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,352
- You are full of shit.
- It's a shitty world.

550
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,150
How much?

551
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,630
A thousand bucks.

552
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,519
- I give this to a guy named Steve?
- If I wasn't busy, I'd do it myself.

553
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,109
I'll do it.

554
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,630
- Is that clock right?
- Yeah.

555
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,230
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Kind of.

556
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,439
You know a guy named Steve
something, Stevie Dee, the Stever?

557
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,200
Never heard of him.

558
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,959
- Are you Steve?
- I'm afraid not.

559
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,276
- Got some coffee for me?
- Black?

560
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,436
Can I get another one?

561
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,999
Maybe he's Steve.

562
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,793
- Are you Steve?
- Steve who?

563
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,914
- Steve who?
- I don't know his last name.

564
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,636
Good morning.

565
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,079
- You OK there, cowboy?
- I'm fine.

566
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,468
- Anybody in there?
- Yeah.

567
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,669
If you want to frisk me, go ahead.
I got nothing.

568
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,950
Are you sure you're OK?

569
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,590
Are you Dexter?

570
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,519
- Why?
- I'm Steve.

571
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,433
We might have a little problem.

572
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,593
Can I talk to you?

573
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,995
No.

574
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,476
Please?

575
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,550
Till the end of this song.

576
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,920
- I had a private lesson.
- All night?

577
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,912
- Were you with Bryce?
- Can I explain?

578
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,999
- If so, that's explanation enough.
- Yes, I was.

579
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,511
- She hired me for the day.
- And you can't say no?

580
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,191
She's just interested in my work.
She's trying to help me.

581
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,598
- To be what?
- To be more than a rivet-head.

582
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,432
Whether you ever make anything
of yourself is completely up to you.

583
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,677
- And so far, it isn't much.
- It might be.

584
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,518
A writer. How romantic. It goes
well with being a ski instructor.

585
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,757
It works great with the ladies.

586
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,239
But writing isn't making people
feel things that aren't even true.

587
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,989
I meant every word.

588
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,671
Aspen Citizen of the Day
is ski instructor T J Burke.

589
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,908
Ladies, if you got a big house
and lots of money, he's available.

590
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,758
Goodbye, TJ.
You'll fit right in.

591
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,070
Dex... Jesus.

592
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,350
Get out!

593
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,955
- No more!
- Dex, it's me. It's TJ.

594
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,869
- TJ, I screwed up, I screwed up!
- What happened?

595
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,878
- They're gonna kill me!
- Who?

596
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,150
This guy is gonna kill me.

597
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,555
I thought I could make some money.

598
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,990
I just thought, one time.

599
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,790
What happened?

600
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,349
Tina's friends...

601
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,996
I thought I'd make some money.

602
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,317
How much do you owe?

603
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,909
Ten grand.

604
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,549
This guy is gonna kill me, Teej.

605
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,630
Next time,
I'll expect you to say goodbye.

606
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,359
A friend of mine's in trouble.
I need $10,000.

607
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,231
- Is that an apology?
- This isn't easy for me, Bryce.

608
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,193
You're doing just fine.

609
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,917
- I'll pay you back.
- How?

610
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,275
I don't know.

611
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,228
It doesn't have to be this hard.
Do you know that?

612
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,597
Yup.

613
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,479
- Who are you?
- A friend of Dexter Rutecki's.

614
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,954
He owes you ten grand.
Now you leave him alone.

615
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,554
This is exactly like the time
I found the boomerang!

616
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,230
- We were 1 1 years old!
- I thought we were friends!

617
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,830
- So did l!
- I am sorry! I will pay you back.

618
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,670
- It's already been paid back.
- The guy was gonna kill me.

619
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,031
- So now he's not.
- So now you leave?

620
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,394
- I would've done the same for you!
- It wouldn't have happened to me!

621
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,038
T J Burke show, live every night
banging an uphill bitch, gigolo!

622
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,360
You're going to screw your way
out of the working class?

623
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,915
Take a fucking look at yourself!

624
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,069
Is this what you want?

625
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,079
I'm tired of picking up after you.

626
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,875
You don't have to pick up after me!

627
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:26,828
Aspen Citizen of the Day is Steve
Temple, ski instructor and bartender.

628
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,596
Ed Goulow is 31 years old today.
He's an Aspen lift operator,

629
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,555
an avid fly fisherman, artist,
and entrepreneur.

630
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,870
Robin?

631
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,350
Lovely...

632
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,313
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

633
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,996
No! Put it...

634
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,431
- Get up!
- No!

635
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,392
- Yes.
- No!

636
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,719
What's your problem? Shit!

637
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,028
- It's freezing!
- Good.

638
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:34,119
- What are you doing?
- We're going jogging.

639
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,153
I don't jog!

640
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,715
I'll drag you behind my car!

641
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,434
- Now shave!
- Why are you doing this?

642
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:48,192
I met two guys, and I liked them.
But I hate what's happened to them.

643
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,709
Now wash!

644
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,715
Could I talk to you?

645
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,550
Sure.

646
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,597
Well, I missed you.
How are you doing?

647
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,716
I'm OK.

648
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,351
- How are you doing?
- Good.

649
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,716
That's good.

650
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,920
I'm going to go home. To Detroit.

651
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,677
Put my name on the list at Ford.
Maybe get your old job.

652
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,834
I don't want to go back empty-handed.
I wanted to ask a favour.

653
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,828
I want to win the Powder 8.
I want you to be my partner.

654
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,634
Sure.

655
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,111
I'll see you.

656
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,470
- Should I call you?
- Tomorrow.

657
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,634
- I'll see you.
- In the morning.

658
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,512
- Do you remember this place?
- I will always remember it.

659
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,508
- It's been a hell of a ride, huh?
- Yeah, it has.

660
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,149
Let me ask you a question.

661
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,309
When we made the ski school,
did you put my name on that list?

662
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,715
Yeah.

663
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,960
How did you get it past Karl?

664
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:08,119
I told him I wouldn't work
unless he hired you.

665
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,597
Tell you what, how about I open them,
and you close them.

666
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,951
Give me, say, 20 feet.
Then you drop in.

667
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,670
I've been following you around
for two years.

668
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,474
There's no one
I would've rather followed.

669
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,114
Today, you're going to follow me.

670
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,834
Try and keep up.

671
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,194
Avalanche!

672
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,231
Dexter!

673
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:17,639
An avalanche yesterday claimed the
life of Aspen local Dexter Rutecki.

674
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:27,397
Rutecki was swept into the slide
while practising for the Powder 8...

675
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,397
His partner, T J Burke,
was treated for minor injuries.

676
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,628
TJ, come on.
Take the day off.

677
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,276
I've got to clean out his locker.

678
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,031
There's a reason
no one's ever skied that mountain.

679
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,473
I should have called in for the
avalanche report, but I didn't.

680
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,559
I guess Dex would say
it's a little late for that.

681
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,352
Go home, TJ. Get some sleep.

682
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,118
Nine o'clock line-up. You're late.
Let's go.

683
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:18,237
I'm just...getting his things together,

684
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,000
so I can send them back to his mum.

685
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:30,353
I...can't find one of his gloves.

686
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,595
I came to tell you I'm very sorry.
I know you loved him a lot.

687
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:47,071
Things happen, TJ.
To everyone.

688
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:52,074
- It didn't happen to me.
- Yeah, it did.

689
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,393
I was afraid to come out here
without him.

690
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,071
It's not your fault.

691
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,351
Take care of yourself.

692
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,237
Are you going to get dressed?

693
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,194
- No.
- We have guests coming over.

694
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,757
You got a big house.
There's a lot of room.

695
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,839
You're very depressing lately.

696
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,231
Put on the cashmere sweater
and black pants.

697
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,793
You look beautiful in that.

698
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,632
- He was my best friend.
- Oh, was he?

699
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,828
What does that mean?

700
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,918
I'm sorry he died.
I am.

701
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,516
But you wanted more, and he didn't.
And now you have it.

702
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:33,633
You?
Till when?

703
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,549
- Until it's over.
- Then what?

704
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,276
- Then we change partners.
- Just like that?

705
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,152
Yes.

706
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,393
We're the same, TJ.

707
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,753
No, we're not, Bryce.

708
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,709
Goodbye.

709
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:26,718
Mr Burke. I'm one of the new guys.
Todd Pounds.

710
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:35,598
- That'll disappoint a lot of kids.
- You do this when you're new.

711
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:43,157
- Yeah, I remember.
- I just wanted to meet you.

712
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,351
OK.

713
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,194
Nice to meet you.

714
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,755
They say you're the best skier
on the mountain.

715
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,509
- I don't know.
- I plan on being that, too.

716
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,474
I mean second best, of course.
If you don't mind.

717
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:11,038
- It's a big mountain, Todd.
- Do you have a partner for Powder 8?

718
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,396
- No.
- You want one?

719
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,919
No.

720
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,715
I was an Olympic hopeful.
I ski pretty good.

721
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,309
I'm not looking for a partner, Todd.

722
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,878
- If we win, we're the best.
- I'm not looking for a partner!

723
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,230
OK.

724
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,474
I was just asking.

725
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,950
See you later, Mr Burke!

726
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,995
Hey, you!

727
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,993
We got a renegade going O.B.
We're after him.

728
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,197
TJ, you son of a bitch!

729
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,951
- Were you trying to make the news?
- No.

730
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:52,756
I'm supposed to fire anyone
who skies out of bounds. Even you.

731
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,272
- How am I supposed to handle this?
- Any way you want.

732
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,274
Stop blaming yourself for Dexter.

733
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:10,632
I'm not.
I just miss him.

734
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:15,311
- This is a good-time business.
- Take my picture off the poster.

735
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:22,550
It'd be better if you could
straighten yourself out. Can you?

736
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,438
You were the best skier
on the mountain.

737
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,310
Skiing's the easy part, Karl.

738
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,033
They say you're the best skier
on the mountain.

739
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,674
- Hey! Mr Burke!
- How you doing?

740
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,950
Good. Where have you been?

741
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,032
- You got a partner for the Powder 8?
- No.

742
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:30,835
- Do you want one?
- Are you kidding? Me and you?

743
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,396
- Me and you.
- Absolutely.

744
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,953
Good.

745
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:57,355
I'm cranking these down.
You marker out, we don't win.

746
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,677
- What if I crash and burn?
- You won't.

747
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,911
Hey, Burke.

748
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,598
Try not to kill him, too.

749
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:28,150
The Vail team is putting on
quite a show here today.

750
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,875
McCarthy is very...
Tough break for the team...

751
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,197
Reigning champions
Franz Hauser and Rudy Zucker.

752
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,836
They've won the Powder 8
for the last three years.

753
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,713
They're going
for a fourth straight win.

754
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:02,630
They're among the best in the world.
The rhythm's perfect, the turns...

755
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,157
This team is going to be
very hard to beat.

756
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:14,992
What a run from Franz Hauser and
Rudy Zucker, reigning champions.

757
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,517
It's a perfect 1 0, 1 0, 1 0!

758
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,679
An unprecedented fourth title
for the team from Aspen!

759
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,872
- What's going on?
- We haven't gone yet.

760
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:33,154
- Nobody ever beats these guys.
- You tell them we're going.

761
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:38,354
Even though this event has been won,
there's a team demanding to compete.

762
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,633
T J Burke and his partner Todd
Pounds of the Aspen Ski School.

763
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,153
- No matter what I do, you follow me.
- All right, if I can.

764
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,679
We can.

765
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,077
...after his partner was killed
in an accident...

766
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,076
Watch these guys now.

767
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,109
Unbelievable!
Burke has led Pounds off course!

768
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,709
They're skiing off the back side!

769
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,634
They've gone off of our monitors.

770
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,393
They have won
the 1 1 th Annual Powder 8!

771
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,272
All right, T J!

772
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,992
So how does it feel?

773
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,956
It feels good.
Dexter would have liked it.

774
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,154
Yeah.

775
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,629
I'm sorry.

776
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,991
For everything. For all of it.

777
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,556
I just wanted to tell you that.

778
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:08,878
- Before you left town?
- I'm not leaving. I'm staying.

779
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,991
Why?

780
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,113
To see if I can become
a real writer.

781
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:23,431
I think you already are one. I read
your story. I think it's great.

782
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,158
And because I love you.
