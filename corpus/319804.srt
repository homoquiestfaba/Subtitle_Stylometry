1
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:29,088
Sharon!

2
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,488
She's not here.

3
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:35,562
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,262
Sharon!

5
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,196
- Sharon!
- She's there.

6
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:44,567
Sharon!

7
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,037
Honey!

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,907
Sharon!

9
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:56,308
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,332
Sharon!

11
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,145
Wait.

12
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,992
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:54,599
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,277
Home.

15
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:11,620
Home.

16
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,385
No!

17
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,131
- Home! Home!
- We're going home.

18
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,170
Silent Hill!

19
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:28,036
- Silent Hill!
- Rose!

20
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:30,177
- Wake up.
- Hey.

21
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,041
- It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
- It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:34,738
It's okay.

23
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:38,676
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

24
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:41,515
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get there.

25
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,591
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

26
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:46,385
No.

27
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,193
- She said it again.
- I know.

28
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:55,997
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- Calm down, baby. It's okay.

29
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:57,729
- It's okay, baby.
- We're right here.

30
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,343
It's okay.

31
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:06,271
It's okay.

32
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,482
It's okay, baby.

33
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,638
- Wanna see?
- Sure.

34
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,283
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

35
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,552
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

36
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

37
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:04,931
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

38
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,868
Do you know where we're going?

39
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:10,845
No?

40
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:14,607
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

41
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,048
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

42
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,116
...called Silent Hill.

43
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,057
I don't remember.

44
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,392
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

45
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:31,430
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

46
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,570
Daddy's not coming?

47
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,672
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

48
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,222
Hey.

49
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,022
Hey.

50
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,260
Break's over, sweetie.

51
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:35,720
You awake?

52
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,660
You wanna go?

53
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:59,877
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

54
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:05,225
<i>Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.</i>

55
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:09,152
<i>Please leave a message,
and I*ll call you back.</i>

56
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,010
Oh, no, Rose.

57
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,592
No.

58
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,925
Honey, you're awake?

59
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,329
Long drive.

60
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:56,868
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

61
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,708
Why did you change your pictures?

62
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,906
I didn't.

63
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,139
- Mommy?
- You can't remember?

64
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,547
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

65
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:15,314
- Baby, you can't remember doing this?
- Who did that?

66
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:18,550
- Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
- Mommy, who did that?

67
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,921
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

68
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:24,558
Can you wait in the car for me?

69
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,200
Can I sit in front?

70
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:31,135
- Of course you can sit in the front.
- Okay.

71
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,983
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

72
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,621
Hi.

73
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,352
I just wanna pay for the gas.

74
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,620
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

75
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,799
I can't seem to find it on the map.

76
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,458
- Why do you wanna go there?
- I- I read about it.

77
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:04,436
Road don't go through no more.

78
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,335
Your card was declined.

79
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,270
Hey there.

80
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:17,041
- Is everything all right?
- Don't talk to strangers.

81
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,119
Good girl.

82
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:23,348
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

83
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,725
Why did you cut off the cards?

84
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,956
<i>That*s not gonna stop me
from taking her there.</i>

85
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:35,102
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

86
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:37,598
<i>She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.</i>

87
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:40,506
The medication doesn't work.

88
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,303
She's getting worse every day.

89
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,173
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

90
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:49,917
<i>...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.</i>

91
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,949
<i>I*m not giving up on her, Chris.
I*m not.</i>

92
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,088
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

93
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:57,019
<i>Yes, Chris, I read them.</i>

94
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:00,786
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

95
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,597
<i>Listen, honey...</i>

96
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:06,290
<i>- I love Sharon every bit as much as I-
- Chris, I gotta go.</i>

97
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,165
- I love you.

98
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:14,001
- Need any help, ma'am?
- No, we're- We're fine, thanks.

99
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:18,339
We're fine.

100
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:36,180
Are we there?

101
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,750
Not yet, honey.

102
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,072
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

103
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:55,607
Hey!

104
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,325
Mommy!

105
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,255
It's okay. It's just the radio.

106
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,661
- I'm turning it off.
- Mommy!

107
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,380
Sharon?

108
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,721
Sharon!

109
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:58,427
Somebody! Help!

110
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,595
Please!

111
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,635
We've had an accident!

112
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,346
Anybody!

113
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:23,318
Sharon. Honey.

114
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,561
Ashes.

115
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,271
Sharon!

116
00:15:58,486 --> 00:15:59,475
Sharon!

117
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,915
Wait!

118
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:03,823
Sharon!

119
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,515
Wait!

120
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,347
Sharon!

121
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,251
Sharon?

122
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:44,922
Honey?

123
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,874
What's happening?

124
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,650
<i>Mommy.</i>

125
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,819
Sharon.

126
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,592
Sharon?

127
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,307
Sharon?

128
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:06,138
Hello?

129
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,589
Hey!

130
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,290
Wait!

131
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,021
Hey!

132
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,597
Sharon.

133
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:35,428
Sharon.

134
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:38,830
Sharon.

135
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,653
No!

136
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,307
Help me!

137
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,415
Help.

138
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,285
Help me. Help.

139
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,182
Someone! Shit!

140
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,889
Get off me! Get off!

141
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,661
Get off! Get off!

142
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,161
Get off me!

143
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:14,061
No! Get off me!

144
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:18,635
No! Get off me! Get off me!

145
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:36,353
Get off-!

146
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:31,401
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

147
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,164
Please.

148
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,976
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

149
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:41,708
My daughter.

150
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,912
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

151
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,485
We've all lost our children.

152
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:49,553
Our light.

153
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,526
They deceived me.

154
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,126
Their evil.

155
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,857
Their hate.

156
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,360
They hurt my child.

157
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,537
They did terrible things to her.

158
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,533
Alessa.

159
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:10,771
This is my daughter, Sharon.

160
00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:12,878
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

161
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,211
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

162
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:21,349
Yes, she's mine.

163
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,715
- It was mine.
- It's mine.

164
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,755
- It's mine.
- It's mine!

165
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,756
- It's mine!
- Get off me!

166
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:38,097
Into the fire
she swallowed their hate.

167
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,825
- Hi there.
- Yeah.

168
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:14,232
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

169
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:17,138
- Maybe you saw her?
- Daughter worked night shift.

170
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:24,410
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

171
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:26,779
- How do I get there?
- You don't.

172
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:28,956
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

173
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:31,647
...still burning underground,
you know?

174
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,384
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

175
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,921
Okay...

176
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,459
...where's the turnoff?

177
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,244
Sharon?

178
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,750
Come on.

179
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:41,486
<i>Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.</i>

180
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:43,663
Christopher, it's me.

181
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:47,823
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

182
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,299
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

183
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:53,769
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

184
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,471
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

185
00:26:57,678 --> 00:27:01,341
Please, please, hurry.

186
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:05,209
Fuck. Come on!

187
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,853
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

188
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:13,025
Put both hands on the wheel.

189
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:17,026
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

190
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,828
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

191
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,003
- Get out of the car.
- What?

192
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:24,728
Move it.

193
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,600
Jesus, what are you doing?

194
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:29,901
- You're under arrest.
- What?

195
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:33,103
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

196
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:36,078
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

197
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,807
My daughter, she's in danger.

198
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:40,111
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

199
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,551
Listen to me, she's ill.
She sleepwalks.

200
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:45,122
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

201
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:49,827
Officer Bennett to base, over.

202
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,029
Base, do you copy, over?

203
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:57,130
- Shit.
- You're bleeding.

204
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,606
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

205
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:07,269
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

206
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,980
- You all right to walk?
- Sure.

207
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:13,812
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

208
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:15,318
What?

209
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,319
You're going back to the station.

210
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,653
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

211
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:23,190
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

212
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,955
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Have you heard...

213
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,656
...a single word I've said?

214
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,263
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around...

215
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:33,269
<i>- Silent Hill-
- sorry-</i>

216
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:35,032
<i>- Sharon-
- lost-</i>

217
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:40,839
<i>- think I know where-
- going to the school to look for her-</i>

218
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:42,515
<i>I*m not okay-</i>

219
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:46,914
<i>I need your- Your help.
Please, hurry!</i>

220
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,436
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

221
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:10,474
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

222
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:15,714
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

223
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:20,280
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

224
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,222
<i>Bring him down.</i>

225
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:24,050
- Come on.
- You've seen her?

226
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,656
Where is she?

227
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,733
Inspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

228
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:37,165
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

229
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:38,599
I know. Hang on a second.

230
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:41,172
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

231
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,605
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

232
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,302
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

233
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:48,310
- Good Christ.
- Now, you mind telling me...

234
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,483
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

235
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,777
- Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
- My pleasure, Chris-

236
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:55,649
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

237
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,324
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

238
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:00,584
I've also got a missing deputy.

239
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:02,887
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

240
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:05,861
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

241
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,364
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

242
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,469
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

243
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:12,229
- Let's take a look around.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,304
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

245
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:19,005
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

246
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,874
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

247
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:23,982
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

248
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:27,620
- I thought it would help her.
- You people. You get off the highway...

249
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:31,450
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

250
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:35,558
Why aren't you listening to me?

251
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:38,161
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

252
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:41,630
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

253
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,666
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

254
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,669
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

255
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:49,035
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

256
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,575
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

257
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,178
Come on.

258
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,881
What the hell?

259
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,651
Okay.

260
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:40,088
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

261
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,886
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

262
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:44,496
No. Get walking.

263
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:47,326
There's a fire-lookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

264
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:50,264
- It should have a radio.
- Fuck you, you stupid cop.

265
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:53,771
This place is completely cut off.

266
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:57,043
- You have no idea what's going on.
- Hey!

267
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,339
Hey, you up there!

268
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,641
I'm a police officer!

269
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,416
What's going on?

270
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,928
What is that?

271
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:24,769
Stand back.

272
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,709
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

273
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,214
Stay where you are!

274
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,417
Stop!

275
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:42,330
Sharon!

276
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:13,561
<i>Rose.</i>

277
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:35,416
<i>Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...</i>

278
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:37,522
<i>...and I will take you to safety.</i>

279
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,591
<i>Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...</i>

280
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,762
<i>...and I will take you to safety.</i>

281
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:45,659
- Why don't you let me do that?
- Ninety percent of the time...

282
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:47,197
...when a wife takes a run...

283
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:49,665
...she takes the daughter
to a place like this...

284
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,895
...I'd say she's damn mad
at her husband.

285
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,838
You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

286
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:59,479
No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

287
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,114
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

288
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,180
You see the barbershop over there?

289
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:07,245
- Used to be my father's.
- Your father?

290
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:10,485
He's dead.

291
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:13,257
November '74,
when the fire caught.

292
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,793
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

293
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:19,966
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

294
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,829
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

295
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:24,628
That was the end of Silent Hill.

296
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,035
These were good people,
most of them.

297
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:30,606
Some, you might say deserved it.

298
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,335
A little bit.

299
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,162
Sharon!

300
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:23,050
Sharon.

301
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:28,724
Where are you hiding?

302
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:44,300
<i>Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!</i>

303
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,446
Alessa Gillespie.

304
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,011
Hey!

305
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:56,782
Hey!

306
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:00,751
Wait!

307
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:07,019
It's okay.

308
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,221
It's gonna be okay.

309
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,935
I promise I'm gonna help you.

310
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:08,313
Come on.

311
00:43:08,848 --> 00:43:10,679
Oh, God.

312
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:12,609
Come on.

313
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:23,861
Help me. Oh, God.
Please, please, help me. Help-

314
00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:32,035
Help me. Please, help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

315
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:27,049
It's happening again.

316
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:48,132
Help me! Please! Please!

317
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,905
Come on! Come on!

318
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:18,792
Rose!

319
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,129
Sharon!

320
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:27,964
Rose!

321
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:33,263
Rose!

322
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:45,878
Rose.

323
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:03,564
- Rose!
- Put your mask on.

324
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,398
Rose, where are you?

325
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:15,170
- I felt her.
- You what?

326
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:16,712
Her perfume.

327
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,483
- She was here.
- Who was?

328
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:21,710
- My wife.
- She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

329
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,685
- Perfume.
- Breathe. Through that mask.

330
00:49:26,192 --> 00:49:28,786
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.

331
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:30,792
Chris, come on.

332
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:34,664
- She was here.
- No, no, she wasn't here.

333
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:35,834
I know it.

334
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:52,879
Come on.

335
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:55,519
Come on. Let's keep looking.

336
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:24,609
Get off! Get off! Get off!

337
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:40,429
Get me that pipe.

338
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:43,564
Rose, the pipe!

339
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,731
Okay. Okay.

340
00:50:48,374 --> 00:50:51,070
- I got it. I got it.
- Quick, come on!

341
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:08,255
Can we get out of here?

342
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:10,420
We're trapped.

343
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,497
Last mag.

344
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:15,360
- That's all the bullets you got?
- Yeah.

345
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:19,662
Thanks.

346
00:51:31,817 --> 00:51:33,011
You hear that?

347
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,925
That's him.

348
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:50,258
Stay down! Stay down!

349
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:52,528
Jesus Christ.

350
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:56,038
Get down!

351
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:04,741
Shit!

352
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:12,640
What?

353
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,622
What the fuck?

354
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:56,328
What the fuck?

355
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:01,360
You saw that, right?
That was real?

356
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,269
What the fuck is going on?

357
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:08,167
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

358
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:10,774
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

359
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:13,877
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

360
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,773
I don't even know where to start.

361
00:54:17,183 --> 00:54:18,844
I found this.

362
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,019
It's from a hotel.

363
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,155
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

364
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:26,585
Hotel?

365
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:31,519
Hey.

366
00:54:33,365 --> 00:54:35,424
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:39,160
We're gonna be okay.

368
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:54,016
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

369
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,211
We got men up here
all night long.

370
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:59,152
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

371
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,259
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

372
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:05,055
You're not telling me everything.

373
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:07,662
What really happened up here?

374
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,165
Just let it rest in peace.

375
00:55:13,405 --> 00:55:15,805
<i>- Directory assistance.
- Toluca County Archives, please.</i>

376
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:17,498
<i>One moment.</i>

377
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:20,175
<i>- Archives?
- Yeah, listen.</i>

378
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:22,973
Do you have the records there
from Silent Hill?

379
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:26,310
<i>- Which records, sir?
- The police records.</i>

380
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:28,953
<i>Sorry, sir,
those records are confidential.</i>

381
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:31,316
No, no, I can't-
No, listen, I-

382
00:55:31,524 --> 00:55:33,719
<i>Sorry, sir,
I can*t access that information.</i>

383
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:35,393
<i>- Listen, goddamn it.
- Sir.</i>

384
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:36,993
<i>- This is an emergency.
- I can*t-</i>

385
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:39,187
<i>I can*t help you.</i>

386
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:58,143
They used to say
this place was haunted.

387
00:55:58,784 --> 00:56:00,877
I think they were right.

388
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,923
<i>Help! No!</i>

389
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:14,963
<i>- Stay away.
- Come on.</i>

390
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,068
Stay away, sinner.

391
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,601
Get back!

392
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:21,602
Hey.

393
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,502
It's here.

394
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:27,539
Faith is our destroyer.
Faith has brought us doom.

395
00:56:27,746 --> 00:56:29,611
- Get back!
- Hey, hey!

396
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:32,750
- Get back!
- Hey, stop.

397
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:35,318
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

398
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:37,853
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

399
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:40,616
It's your sins which hold you here.

400
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,384
- Stop your lies!
- Calm down.

401
00:56:42,595 --> 00:56:43,562
Calm down, it's okay.

402
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:45,855
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- She's gone.

403
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,424
What's your name?

404
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:52,362
Anna. My name is Anna.

405
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,596
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

406
00:56:54,807 --> 00:56:57,867
- I've seen her before.
- Dahlia was cast out.

407
00:56:58,077 --> 00:57:00,136
Not even the darkness wants her.

408
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:02,940
- She's lost her daughter too.
- What?

409
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:08,484
- Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
- What are you doing here, Anna?

410
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:12,814
Mother needs more food.

411
00:57:13,459 --> 00:57:15,017
You mean there are
other people here?

412
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:20,131
Christabella keeps us safe.

413
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,732
- Anna.
- We take refuge in the church.

414
00:57:23,302 --> 00:57:26,169
Anna, listen to me.

415
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:29,139
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

416
00:57:29,475 --> 00:57:32,137
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

417
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:34,312
Tell me, have you seen her?

418
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:35,878
Do you know where she is?

419
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:42,620
If she has faith, she might survive.

420
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:43,788
If not...

421
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:47,850
I'm taking this.

422
00:57:50,195 --> 00:57:51,890
Have you seen this?

423
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:54,728
I've seen it at the school.

424
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:59,100
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

425
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:03,765
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

426
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,881
Rose, look at this.

427
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:22,119
- What is it?
- Just like yours.

428
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:26,998
- Where did you find it?
- They're all over the floor.

429
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,474
Rose.

430
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:44,806
Check this out.

431
00:58:46,685 --> 00:58:50,781
- What number did you take this from?
-111.

432
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,089
We gotta go to room 111.

433
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:30,246
Gucci.

434
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:02,811
<i>- Directory assistance.
- Yeah.</i>

435
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:06,015
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

436
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:08,216
<i>One moment, please.</i>

437
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:12,427
<i>- Yes, I have that information for you.
- Yeah.</i>

438
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:15,593
Can you give me that address?

439
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:28,004
We are wandering far
from refuge here.

440
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:33,116
Let's keep her with us.
She's all we got.

441
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,972
There's no room 111.

442
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,615
The first burning.

443
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:08,976
- What is it, Anna?
- The first burning.

444
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,122
Before the town had a name.

445
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:14,781
The elders of my elders
kept us pure.

446
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,692
The founders of this town
were witch-hunters.

447
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,688
Burning the witch
held back the darkness.

448
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:22,526
It stopped the apocalypse.

449
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,032
It's here.

450
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:48,620
There's a room in here.

451
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:01,665
Look at this.

452
01:03:09,648 --> 01:03:11,172
Here.

453
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:13,578
Damn.

454
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,895
What is this place?

455
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,298
I don't know.
We're in the next building.

456
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,564
Some factory, maybe?

457
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,436
Looks like there was a fire.

458
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:47,550
Hey.
