1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>... a struggle against</i>
<i>the common enemies of man...</i>

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,432
<i>... a date which will live in infamy...</i>

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,951
<i>... ask not what your country can do</i>
<i>for you...</i>

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,510
<i>... grand and global alliance</i>
<i>for all mankind...</i>

5
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,356
<i>Day 198 of the Bug War.</i>

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,188
<i>Another planet, another campaign,</i>
<i>another briefing.</i>

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,393
<i>And the Roughnecks thought</i>
<i>there were no surprises left.</i>

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,669
Attention!

9
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,079
<i>They were wrong.</i>

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,674
At ease, Troopers.

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,398
This is Tophet,
the planet we are currently orbiting.

12
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,677
Sicon high command has deemed it
a strategic disembarking point...

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,876
...to Quad 9 of the Omega galaxy.

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,509
Preparations for a base
are to begin immediately.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,355
Your boy's got stars in his eyes.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,717
More like rocks in his head.

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,388
Any intel, sir?

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,517
Fluctuating magnetic forces have made
our satellite scans inconclusive.

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,432
That's where you come in.

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,678
Alpha Team will be one part
of an expeditionary force...

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,557
...dropped onto the planet's surface.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,270
Your mission, recon Sector 7-H
to determine its viability as a landing zone.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,550
Sky marshal wants this base built
and operational ASAP, and so do I.

24
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,074
That is all.

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,071
Sergeant, full prep detail and
weapons check. Geosynch drop at 0600.

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,438
All right, Apes, we're not getting paid
by the hour, so let's move, move, move!

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,955
Lieutenant, I just need a few words
for my pre-battle profile.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,515
No. Is that few enough?

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,430
- New toy?
- It's not a toy.

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,513
It's a translating arachnid
linguistic communicator.

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,598
- "TALC box," for short.
- Thanks for clearing that up.

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,957
It analyses Bug screeches
for specific auditory patterns.

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,793
Once its microprocessor
deciphers the code...

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,474
...it simply assigns each
to its English equivalent.

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,039
You can't understand a Bug.

36
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,118
It doesn't think like a human.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,195
- Trust me.
- Well, don't keep us in suspense, Jenkins.

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,356
What's it like inside a Bug's head?

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,868
Empty and black. It lives only to kill.

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,911
- I wish I had a squad of Troopers like that.
- One's enough for any squad, Sarge.

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,432
- Hey, come on, come on!
- All right, guys. Knock it off.

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,358
- Whoa, whoa. Save it for the Bugs.
- Ten-hut!

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,639
What's going on here, Sergeant?

44
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,315
Just testing the power suits
for structural integrity, sir.

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,233
- That right, Jenkins?
- Yes, sir.

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,756
Drop in T minus two minutes.

47
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,757
<i>Entering ionosphere.</i>

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,158
Drop in T minus...

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,598
<i>... fifteen seconds.</i>

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,674
Live forever, Apes.

51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,636
Jettison pods now!

52
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,352
My jets aren't firing!

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,995
- Thanks, Diz.
- No problem.

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,310
Remind me to fire my travel agent.

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,751
Jenkins, you getting anything?

56
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,559
No, sir.
Must be the magnetic interference.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,231
All right, Apes, combat wedge.
Gossard, on point.

58
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,993
Since when do Bugs build condos?

59
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,229
They don't.

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,468
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Yeah.

61
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,757
But are they ever coming back?

62
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,750
I want a structure-by-structure sweep.

63
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,230
- Higgins, Flores, cover our backs, here.
- Yes, sir!

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,151
And the winner of the award
for Journalistic Excellence is...

65
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,992
...Pvt. R. Higgins.

66
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,039
Thank you, thank you.

67
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,632
Stand by the building, Diz,
so I can get a sense of scale.

68
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,236
Lieutenant, the welcoming committee
is here, and they didn't bake a pie.

69
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,549
On our way.

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,036
So, hot enough for you?

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,151
Did they just save us?

72
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,434
Halfway across the galaxy,
and I finally meet a gentleman.

73
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,348
Hold your fire!

74
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,475
Easy.

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,797
What are those things?

76
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,474
Probably asking themselves
the same question.

77
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,520
Obviously adapted
to the extreme environment.

78
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,955
I'll need to run some tests. Or not!

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,878
Talk to me, Jenkins.

80
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,792
Picking up a complex thought pattern,
but it's jumbled, conflicting.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,752
How do they feel about trespassers?

82
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,516
Okay, I guess, or we'd already be a
side dish on the Tophet blue plate special.

83
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,195
Cool.

84
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,192
- What's the call, LT?
- Our op is recon.

85
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,518
The dwellings are sparse...

86
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,434
...reflecting either a primitive nature
or a highly evolved minimalist existence.

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,033
That narrows it down.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,912
Looks like they brought us home
to meet the family.

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,437
One alien steps forward.
Could this be their leader?

90
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,589
Whoa!

91
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,198
Guess they're a little camera-shy.

92
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,674
Stow your weapon, Sergeant.
Their house, their rules.

93
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,953
Skinny has a lot to learn about hospitality.

94
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,998
Sergeant, you and Flores finish
the perimeter sweep.

95
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,229
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,270
Guess we stay here and have tea?

97
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,590
- Great conversationalists.
- Any ideas?

98
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
Sir, my TALC box,
with some modifications.

99
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,589
Do it.

100
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,511
- Looks like we're double dating.
- Don't flatter yourself.

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,390
Don't turn your back, even for a second.
Aliens, you can't trust them.

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,396
Sarge, we're on their planet.
Doesn't that make us the aliens?

103
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,280
Something's been using the buildings
for a chew toy...

104
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,352
...but there's not a Bug in sight,
dead or alive.

105
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,949
Right. Be gentle.

106
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,078
Can it understand me?

107
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,874
<i>Yes.</i>

108
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,238
- It can talk?
- So can a parrot.

109
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,073
- That don't make it smart.
- Said the parrot.

110
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,116
I'm Lt. Razak of the Strategically
Integrated Coalition of Nations.

111
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,592
<i>I am Col. T'Phai.</i>

112
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,474
<i>Why are you here, Razak?</i>

113
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,954
We hope to establish a base of operations
on your planet to help us fight the Bugs.

114
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,674
- <i>There are no Bugs here.</i>
- But...

115
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,273
<i>The Bugs are dead.</i>

116
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,148
<i>They attacked, but ultimately</i>
<i>could not adjust to our atmosphere.</i>

117
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,072
<i>Alpha Team, this is Valley Forge.</i>
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

118
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,037
We copy, Valley Forge. Go ahead.

119
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,798
What's the hold-up, Lieutenant?

120
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,758
I have a dozen ships up here
with their meters running.

121
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,991
Sir, we've encountered
an indigenous race, humanoid.

122
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,479
They appear to be friendlies.

123
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,438
Always knew we weren't alone out here.
Now we have an ally.

124
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,557
Look forward to meeting them.
Now, what's the Bug count?

125
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,836
Well, sir, zero confirmed, but...

126
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,471
Razak, no Bugs and a village full
of friendlies equals a secure LZ.

127
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,398
Find us a spot to land.

128
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,959
<i>Over and out.</i>

129
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,670
Don't suppose you guys have an empty
parking lot around here somewhere.

130
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,239
"Ing lot"?

131
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,239
It's nice to meet another species
that's not trying to off you all the time.

132
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,990
If all the Bugs died
from exposure to Tophet's atmosphere...

133
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,271
...where are all the corpses?

134
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,200
- Something's wrong.
- Earthquake?

135
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,315
It's a trap.

136
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,673
Troopers, fire!

137
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,238
Alpha One to Valley Forge.
Alpha One to Valley Forge!

138
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,191
<i>Your friends will land,</i>
<i>and they will be destroyed...</i>

139
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,750
<i>... just like you.</i>

140
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,072
Roughnecks, with me!

141
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,992
Dude's wearing the bars.

142
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
Alpha Team, do you read? Over.

143
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,279
This real estate's getting hard to hold!

144
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,959
If we don't wave off the landing fleet,
a whole lot of Troopers will be Bug bait.

145
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,710
Blue Leader, this is Alpha Team.
We are under attack.

146
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,072
Fall back to the village.
Doc, Brutto, lay down smoke.

147
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,151
Rico, Flores, cover the flank.

148
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,989
- We certainly are popular with the locals.
- We need high ground.

149
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,349
- You up for a climb, Ape?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,430
Mercury flares. Universal warning.

151
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,877
Listen up, Roughnecks.
Peel off and take up cover positions.

152
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,874
We have to hold them off long enough
for Rico to warn the landing fleet.

153
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,278
- Still no coordinates from Alpha Team.
- No problem.

154
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,436
I'll find us a nice shady place to park.

155
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,795
Whoa!

156
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,234
It's Rico!

157
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,630
- We have a red on the LZ.
- Abort!

158
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,473
<i>All ships abort!</i>

159
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,632
They're coming back, right?

160
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,717
Behind every great man...

161
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,315
I've got a plan. Trust me.

162
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,478
Only one way to find out.

163
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,792
Nice of you to drop in.

164
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,951
<i>Commence retrieval of ground forces.</i>

165
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,558
LZ's too hot for touchdown.
Let's try a hook and ladder.

166
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,831
- Have you guys ever done this before?
- First time for everything.

167
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,677
One shot. If you're off the mark,
Trooper shish kebab.

168
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,353
I'll be back!

169
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,990
<i>The war had been pretty simple</i>
<i>up till then.</i>

170
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,918
<i>Us versus the Bugs.</i>

171
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,238
<i>But now, with the skinnies allied</i>
<i>with the arachnids...</i>

172
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,629
<i>... Sicon couldn't help but wonder</i>
<i>how many other enemies were out there...</i>

173
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,509
<i>... waiting.</i>

174
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,352
<i>Day 19. A momentary lull in the battle</i>
<i>against the Bugs and the skinnies...</i>

175
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,793
<i>... for control of Tophet.</i>

176
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,117
<i>Both had turned out to be a lot tougher</i>
<i>than Sicon anticipated.</i>

177
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,077
<i>Troopers were trained to be fearless.</i>

178
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,958
<i>But the truth was</i>
<i>that every Trooper feared something.</i>

179
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,715
<i>Maybe it was staring into the</i>
<i>cold black eyes of an attacking Bug or...</i>

180
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,589
<i>... being crushed inside a power suit</i>
<i>by a skinny constrictor blast.</i>

181
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,074
<i>For one Trooper, it was the quiet.</i>

182
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,870
<i>First things first,</i>
<i>and squashing Bugs always comes first.</i>

183
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,316
<i>Dispatch number 137-B.</i>

184
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,592
<i>This is FEDNET correspondent</i>
<i>Robert Higgins reporting.</i>

185
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,631
<i>As I continue to cover the war from</i>
<i>the front lines, I find myself on Tophet...</i>

186
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,877
<i>... a torrid planet in the binary system</i>
<i>of Ranara Seven.</i>

187
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,278
<i>The enemy was well dug in when I dropped</i>
<i>to the surface with the first MI troops...</i>

188
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,592
<i>... Razak's Roughnecks:</i>
<i>Sgt. Brutto, Doc LeCroix...</i>

189
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,190
<i>... Dizzy Flores, Jeff Gossard...</i>

190
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,355
<i>... Johnny Rico, Carl Jenkins...</i>

191
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,519
<i>... and, of course, the subject of this piece,</i>
<i>Lt. Gene Razak...</i>

192
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,189
<i>... an aloof study in quiet courage.</i>

193
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,634
Boy, this piece is going to win me
the Mirtel Award.

194
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,633
Higgins, Gossard needs a body.
You qualify.

195
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,479
This is constrictor solvent test one.

196
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,077
Calibration on hold,
pending arrival of test subject.

197
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,110
Get a skimmer ready.
I want to poke around.

198
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,556
- Sir, if I could just ask you a few questions.
- Not now.

199
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,950
- But sir...
- Is your oxygen mix whacked out, Higgins?

200
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,433
The lieutenant said no.

201
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,956
Sir, with all due respect, this is my job.

202
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,837
And this is mine, Private.

203
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,117
You want more access, you gotta earn it.
You rated on the skimmer?

204
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,268
- Well, I passed the simulator course, but...
- Good. Gear up.

205
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,191
Sir, according to high command...

206
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,078
...there hasn't been Bug activity here
for over a week.

207
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,788
- Keep your eyes on the road, Private.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,998
I was just wondering if you
knew something high command didn't.

209
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,152
- You ask a lot of questions, Higgins.
- I'm a journalist, sir.

210
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,637
That's too bad.
I don't talk to journalists, only Troopers.

211
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,956
- Dust storm?
- Let's take a look.

212
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,670
This may not be a good time
to mention it...

213
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,514
...but I never actually passed
the simulator course.

214
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,474
I did it.

215
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,595
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- Trouble.

216
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,752
Blister Bugs. Spit acid that'll burn
through a power suit...

217
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,831
...quicker than you can scream for help.

218
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,920
HQ, this is Alpha Leader. Over.

219
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,311
<i>Commander Marlow here, Alpha Leader.</i>

220
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,311
<i>We have a hot zone</i>
<i>down here, Commander.</i>

221
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,436
<i>Bug activity, battalion strength.</i>

222
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,229
<i>If they make it to the Montabi Mountains</i>
<i>and dig in, we'll never get them out.</i>

223
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,475
- Copy. Your recommendations?
- An air attack will only scatter them.

224
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,394
Anti-matter missiles. Take all the Bugs
at once. Efficient, nonradioactive.

225
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,789
My thoughts exactly. Make it happen.

226
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,509
We need a few hours to plot the attack
sequence, prep the ships and payloads.

227
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,558
We'll take it from here, Lieutenant.
Better clear out of there.

228
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,712
We're gonna light up that sector
like the Fourth of July.

229
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,358
<i>Roger that, Valley Forge.</i>

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,749
<i>Roughneck HQ, we're heading home.</i>

231
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,918
Alpha Leader, do you read?

232
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,792
<i>Transferring coordinates now.</i>

233
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,792
- We have to go in after them.
- That's not standard procedure.

234
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,512
Forget procedure, Sarge.

235
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,114
If the crash didn't finish them,
that Bug horde will.

236
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
- You don't know that. I'm with Rico.
- Too risky!

237
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,312
- Troopers don't leave their own behind.
- Stand down, Private!

238
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,758
I'm not endangering the entire squad
just to pick up a couple of corpses.

239
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,314
Sgt. Brutto, they're alive. I can feel it.

240
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,311
You better be right, Brain Boy.

241
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,994
Radio's dead.

242
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,719
So we just wait for the rescue team.
Right, sir?

243
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,478
There won't be any rescue.

244
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,150
I just called in an air strike, son,
and we're standing on ground zero.

245
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,919
They won't risk an evac team.
We're on our own.

246
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,350
There's a relay outpost
about 10 clicks north.

247
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,357
Its radio might still be operational.

248
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,477
- North. That's...
- The heart of Bug country.

249
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,552
If you're gonna shoot something...

250
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,118
...I suggest you use this.

251
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,273
Listen up, Apes.

252
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,032
We have two hours,
47 minutes for retrieval.

253
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,112
Those anti-matter missiles
are gonna be vaporizing...

254
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,475
...everything within the Mito sector.

255
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,429
What are you waiting for, a good-bye kiss?

256
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,669
Saddle up.

257
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,428
Nice shortcut.

258
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,632
I think we have company.

259
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,473
Constrictor spray!

260
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,634
I'd like to see that glop crunch
three tons of reinforced titanium.

261
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,353
You were saying, Sarge?

262
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,833
We're going down!

263
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,437
- Out!
- Door's jammed!

264
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,754
Who needs a door?

265
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,279
Head for cover!

266
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,429
Gossard!

267
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,389
Not good.

268
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,155
I'm increasing your O2. Deep breaths.

269
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,910
Another successful field test, Goss?

270
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,194
Fire in the hole!

271
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,549
Troopers, we are leaving!

272
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,352
Must be advance scouts. Move!

273
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,192
I think we made them angry.

274
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,639
That's right, you overgrown roach.
Come and get me!

275
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,752
Sir, what are you doing?

276
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,195
Jump!

277
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,309
- No sign.
- They must be on foot.

278
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,751
What does your crystal ball say now?

279
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,990
It says we should follow their tracks.

280
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,588
<i>Attention all squads, Mito sector.</i>

281
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,392
<i>This is Major Barcalow.</i>
<i>Air strike will commence in 58 minutes.</i>

282
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,876
<i>Return to base immediately.</i>
<i>All squads acknowledge. Over.</i>

283
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,996
Sounds like a garbled transmission to me.

284
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,708
Yeah. We'd better get to higher ground
and hope for a clearer signal.

285
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,319
What now, sir?

286
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,239
Time to abandon ship.

287
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,795
Thanks, son.

288
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,233
Chemistry 101, Private.

289
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,836
The high alkaline content in the soil
neutralizes the acid.

290
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,880
Lieutenant, how did you lose your arm?

291
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,518
My first solo command
during Operation Pest Control.

292
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,190
My orders were to move my squad
through a valley and secure the hill...

293
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,633
<i>... on the other side.</i>

294
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,632
<i>Simple op. After all, the valley was quiet.</i>

295
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,918
<i>Then it was quiet again.</i>

296
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,471
Still feel it sometimes.
Phantom limb syndrome.

297
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,155
I guess some pain is
never meant to go away.

298
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,711
- We better keep moving.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,997
Better hope we find the lieutenant
and Higgins before they do.

300
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,716
- Does brainiac look a little fried to you?
- Lf he is, then so are we.

301
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,149
All squads reporting clear of the
attack zone, Major, except for Alpha Team.

302
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,589
Their last known location was right here.

303
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,949
- The attack will proceed as planned.
- But, sir...

304
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,799
They have their orders, and we have ours.

305
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,878
Be it ever so humble...

306
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,999
It works!

307
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,717
Make that call now!

308
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,792
Triangulate on that signal.

309
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,791
Seventy-six degrees longitude,
forty-eight degrees latitude...

310
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,552
...two clicks that way.

311
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,271
Lieutenant, we have a problem.

312
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,476
We have more than one, Private.

313
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,393
We've just received an SOS signal
from the Mito sector.

314
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,432
- It has to be the Roughnecks.
- Carmen, you don't know that.

315
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,875
It could be a computer glitch
or a temporal echo.

316
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,474
I can be there with a retrieval ship
in 10 minutes.

317
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,439
The anti-matter engine mix is complete,
and the missiles are loaded on all craft.

318
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,033
<i>What's the holdup, Major?</i>

319
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,511
The attack squadron will disembark
in 10 minutes.

320
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,913
Any ideas?

321
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,398
Just one. Go out like Troopers.

322
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,755
- Is this a private party?
- The more the merrier.

323
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,432
Gossard, patch into the main antenna,
and get us a ride home!

324
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,557
This is Alpha Team.
Requesting emergency evac.

325
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,992
This is Lt. Ibanez. Hold tight.
I'm inbound to your 20. ETA, two minutes.

326
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,995
Valley Forge, this is Exterminator One.

327
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,548
We are clear
and assuming attack formation.

328
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,029
<i>Rescue One, what's your status?</i>

329
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,828
<i>Almost there.</i>

330
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,797
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see the prom queen.

331
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,632
You gotta love that girl's timing.

332
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,755
Everybody slides. Go! Go!

333
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,996
All ships, initiate attack run.

334
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,911
<i>Copy that, Exterminator One.</i>

335
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,110
Carmen, get outta there! We're coming in!

336
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,156
Two more packages, and I'm out.

337
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,869
Go!

338
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,634
<i>Target's acquired. Awaiting command, sir.</i>

339
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,512
<i>Sir, the Bugs will scatter</i>
<i>if we don't fire now.</i>

340
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,310
- Sorry, Carmen.
- <i>All ships, missiles away.</i>

341
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,752
Give me your other hand!

342
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,150
Now you have something to write about.

343
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,029
<i>Hold on.</i>

344
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,955
Yes!

345
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,280
Sorry, I don't pick up hitchhikers.

346
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,154
You didn't really know
if they were still alive, did you?

347
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
<i>Lieutenant, how did you lose your arm?</i>

348
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,238
<i>I guess some pain is</i>
<i>never meant to go away.</i>

349
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,190
<i>In the Bug War,</i>
<i>individual achievements didn't mean much.</i>

350
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,510
<i>Troopers lived and died as a team.</i>

351
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,472
<i>But some battles couldn't help</i>
<i>but be personal...</i>

352
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,029
<i>... and they were meant to stay that way.</i>

353
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,349
<i>Day 27 of the Tophet Campaign, or</i>
<i>"Operation Shake 'N Bake," as we call it.</i>

354
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,156
<i>In the great Bug War,</i>
<i>each squad worked together as a team.</i>

355
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,039
Sarge, I'm open!

356
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,390
<i>Every Trooper had a role to play.</i>

357
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,635
<i>At least, that's what</i>
<i>the Sicon recruiting poster had said.</i>

358
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,919
Yeah! All right!

359
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,595
That's illegal use of the head, brain boy!

360
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,514
Trust me, Sarge.
It doesn't take a psychic to read your mind.

361
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,233
Huddle up, Roughnecks. New game plan.

362
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,794
Jigsaw Pass, 80 clicks southwest.

363
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,112
It's the main supply artery between Bug
armies on either side of the mountains.

364
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,756
- Sicon's been trying to take it for weeks.
- Air strike?

365
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,119
Not an option. Command wants to use
the pass to move our own troops.

366
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,955
- They won't risk turning it into a rock pile.
- So what's the op, LT?

367
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,158
We follow this path through the range.
It'll dump us into the Bugs' back yard.

368
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,276
Then, clean out anything that crawls.

369
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,432
- Sector sounds hot, sir.
- Affirmative.

370
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,154
That's why Sicon sent us a little help.

371
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,193
- Another nose to wipe.
- Not exactly.

372
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,028
- <i>It's a tin can with legs.</i>
- <i>A cybernetic humanoid assault system.</i>

373
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,071
<i>Titanium-reinforced superstructure...</i>

374
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,748
...and the firepower of an entire squad.

375
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,034
Totally autonomous.

376
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,079
Its primary processor runs
on a bio-enhanced logic matrix.

377
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,239
- How about in English, Goss?
- Its CPU is a learning computer.

378
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,153
Its cognitive skills are human-like.

379
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,072
Looks like we're out of a job.

380
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,311
- How long's it stay fresh in that can?
- What's it made of, plastic?

381
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,755
Can the chatter! Is it on?

382
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,279
<i>I am fully operational, Lt. Gene Razak...</i>

383
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,955
<i>... serial number JR902441...</i>

384
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,478
<i>... decorated for meritorious service</i>
<i>10 times.</i>

385
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,070
- <i>Brutto, Francis, Sergeant.</i>
- "Francis"?

386
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,914
Don't nobody say a word.
All right, sweetie pie.

387
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,628
- We know who we are.
- Do you have a name?

388
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,673
- <i>Registration number 102261JLP.</i>
- I don't care what it's called.

389
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,513
We all are a bit sceptical
about this piece of hardware...

390
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,115
...but it has been assigned to our squad,
and we will deal with it.

391
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,599
Understood, Roughnecks?

392
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,795
Sir, yes, sir!

393
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,873
We move out at 0430.
I suggest you Apes grab some sack time.

394
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,235
In case you've forgotten,
we have a war to win!

395
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,435
<i>Lt. Razak...</i>

396
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,149
<i>... I have no need for rest,</i>
<i>therefore I volunteer to stand watch.</i>

397
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,029
A machine programmed to kiss butt.
What will they think of next?

398
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,636
Very well.
Pvt. Flores will relieve you at 0100.

399
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,909
Dismissed.

400
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,394
Roughnecks, take five.

401
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,199
Jenkins, on point when we move out.

402
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,671
<i>Your decision is ill-advised.</i>
<i>My power supply, motor reflexes...</i>

403
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,719
<i>... optical and auditory sensors are</i>
<i>all far superior to any human.</i>

404
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,839
I am not in the habit of having my orders
questioned by anyone or anything.

405
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,673
Now fall back and take up the rear, soldier.

406
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,351
Not very smart for a computer.

407
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,194
<i>Pvt. Higgins, your lack of training</i>
<i>is impeding the squad's progress.</i>

408
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,756
Thanks for the encouragement.
Why don't you just go on ahead?

409
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,990
<i>I cannot break formation.</i>

410
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,512
You and that junk pile better get it in gear,
or we're leaving you behind as Bug bait!

411
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,589
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,308
Earthquake!

413
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,949
Help!

414
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,352
- It saved my life, Rico.
- Self-preservation.

415
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,474
You would have knocked it off the cliff.
It's a machine, not a Trooper.

416
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,878
Thanks.

417
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,032
I don't know what to say. How you doing?

418
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,078
<i>I am functioning</i>
<i>within acceptable parameters.</i>

419
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,919
Well, it might be acceptable to you, but...

420
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,229
...the squad seems to think
you're running a little low on social skills.

421
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,118
<i>That does not hinder</i>
<i>the performance of my duties.</i>

422
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,350
You know, a squad is a team.

423
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,718
And if you're not on the team,
you're on your own. Trust me. I know.

424
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,677
First off, you need a name,
not a registration number.

425
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,912
It'll humanize you.

426
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,510
Cybernetic humanoid assault system.
C-H-A-S.

427
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,791
Chas! What do you think?

428
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,232
<i>I have no opinion.</i>

429
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,158
You also have to learn to talk like an Ape.

430
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,676
You need to start learning the lingo.

431
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,355
For example, Troopers don't "retreat,"
they "beat feet."

432
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,116
<i>Striking one's pedal extremities would</i>
<i>cause injury, making escape impossible.</i>

433
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,955
- Carl, are you okay?
- Bugs!

434
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,519
We're surrounded!

435
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,151
Einstein's fried a fuse.

436
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,229
This time I think the kid may be right.

437
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,029
- <i>Stay back.</i>
- Good tip.

438
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,830
What kind of Bug is that?

439
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,435
<i>Entomological classification,</i>
Choloeoptera volklorix...

440
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,988
<i>... commonly called a Tophet Blaster Bug.</i>

441
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,389
<i>The insect draws heat</i>
<i>from its surroundings...</i>

442
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,952
<i>... to ignite a biochemical reaction</i>
<i>in its prothorax, releasing an energy wave</i>...

443
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't mean to break up the lecture,
but we got Bugs at 12:00.

444
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,875
- 6:00, too!
- Time sure flies when you're having fun!

445
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,549
Flores, Gossard, Jenkins, cover our flank.

446
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,235
Brutto, Doc, take down
the warriors in front! Rico, with me.

447
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,913
Where are you going?

448
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,356
Not bad, for a tin can.

449
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,919
Tougher than an MI drill sergeant,
more poised than the most seasoned vet...

450
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,834
...the cybernetic humanoid assault system,
or "Chas" to his squad mates...

451
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,434
...is Sicon's Trooper of tomorrow.

452
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,671
So much for truth in broadcasting.

453
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,469
If I didn't know better, Johnny Rico,
I'd say you were jealous.

454
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,788
He is quite a specimen,
tall, dark and aluminium.

455
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,115
Lieutenant, you better have a look-see.

456
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,918
Think anybody's home, sir?

457
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,912
Better organize a welcome wagon,
just to be sure.

458
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,993
<i>Lt. Razak, your caution is unnecessary.</i>

459
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,239
<i>Fleet bombed this village 33 hours ago...</i>

460
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,474
<i>... with a likelihood of enemy survival</i>
<i>at less than 9 percent.</i>

461
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,798
Well, my gut tells me
there's something down there.

462
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,110
<i>But internal organs cannot speak.</i>

463
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,033
Sorry, wirehead.
Instincts can't be downloaded.

464
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,797
<i>Lt. Razak, there is no enemy presence.</i>

465
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,395
<i>I volunteer to scout ahead.</i>

466
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,559
Jenkins, you're up.

467
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,196
Carl!

468
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,279
Sniper!

469
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,555
- Shooter's 20?
- Unknown.

470
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,515
Chas, help Carl! We're pinned down!

471
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,830
- We'll light him up. Get Jenkins!
- Goss, constrictor solvent!

472
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,397
On three. One, two, three!

473
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,789
- You look good in a straightjacket.
- Not my size.

474
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,398
Rule Number 1:
Troopers take care of their own.

475
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,670
<i>I violated no regulations.</i>

476
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,752
Regulations?
We're talking about a Trooper's life!

477
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,471
<i>Pausing to assist Trooper Jenkins...</i>

478
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,438
<i>... would have required</i>
<i>an extra 12.25 seconds.</i>

479
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,478
<i>During any operation,</i>
<i>there are acceptable losses.</i>

480
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,071
You just don't get it, do you?
You never will, because you are a machine.

481
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,878
- He's right!
- I'm with him.

482
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,873
Stand down! Now, you.
Finish the sweep of the village.

483
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,668
That machine is gonna get us all greased,
one way or another.

484
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,150
It was a mistake, sir.
He probably just needs a chance to learn.

485
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,595
If we live long enough
for it to get its diploma.

486
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,671
<i>When we return to base camp...</i>

487
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,150
<i>... my recommendation will be</i>
<i>that the cyborg be deactivated.</i>

488
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,958
- But, sir...
- Case closed.

489
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,868
That glorified toaster makes
one more wrong move...

490
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,672
<i>... I'm pulling his plug myself.</i>

491
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,190
<i>Alert. Defensive systems operational.</i>

492
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,990
- Move it! Fire!
- Caldwell's down! Fall back!

493
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,634
Intel says the Bug-to-Trooper ratio
in the pass could be as high as 10-to-1.

494
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,712
<i>Lt. Razak, I will analyse the situation...</i>

495
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,268
<i>... and project an acceptable casualty rate.</i>

496
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,273
- Acceptable to who?
- Chas, a Trooper is not a statistic.

497
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,990
Losses are never acceptable.

498
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,712
This crack will dump us smack
into Bug central.

499
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,872
Then we secure the area.
Read me, Roughnecks?

500
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,830
So much for technical superiority.

501
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,716
<i>Enemy alert. Attack systems armed.</i>

502
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,949
What?

503
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,833
<i>When bringing up the rear,</i>
<i>it is your responsibility...</i>

504
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,354
<i>... to be alert to enemy activity.</i>

505
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,194
Jigsaw Pass is just the other side
of this field.

506
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,069
<i>Stop.</i>

507
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,508
<i>My sensors indicate that this is a trap.</i>
<i>We are in danger.</i>

508
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,959
Really? I thought those nice Bugs
just wanted to play patty-cake.

509
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,748
A minefield.

510
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,951
Skinnies have mines?

511
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,952
They must have modified
some of their gas demolition devices.

512
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,519
So we use scanners.

513
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,672
Skinnies aren't big on metal parts.
The mines won't show up.

514
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,069
What about grenades?
Set them off, clear a path.

515
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,515
We set off one,
it might start a chain reaction.

516
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,353
And then, "Boom, boom, boom!"
Good-bye, Troopers.

517
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,990
Think fast. Company's coming.

518
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,793
Freeze, Frankenstein!
You're not going anywhere without us.

519
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,078
- Wait, Rico. He must have a plan.
- Yeah, saving its own iron butt.

520
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,032
Rico, a little help here.

521
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,672
We need an exit plan.

522
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,190
- What's it doing?
- Marking a path through the minefield.

523
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,109
Welcome back.

524
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,237
<i>My olfactory sensors were able</i>
<i>to detect the gas pockets.</i>

525
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,392
<i>I cut a coolant line to create</i>
<i>a trail for the squad to follow.</i>

526
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,392
<i>I suggest we beat feet, sir.</i>

527
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,909
Move out, Apes, but stay on the path!

528
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,874
Move!

529
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,758
The chain reaction!

530
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,514
Man down!

531
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,079
<i>Do not move!</i>

532
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,390
- I'll get him.
- <i>No. I will.</i>

533
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,640
Chas, can you defuse it?

534
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,234
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>The trigger is pressure sensitive.</i>

535
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,198
<i>Without weight displacement,</i>
<i>the mine will detonate.</i>

536
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,548
- Get out of here, or we're both dead.
- <i>I was never alive.</i>

537
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,392
<i>You're right, Pvt. Higgins.</i>

538
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,869
<i>Some losses are not acceptable.</i>

539
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,515
<i>Go. I will cover your retreat.</i>

540
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,118
<i>I am out of ammunition.</i>

541
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,071
He's drawing them in.

542
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,591
<i>Roughnecks, ho!</i>

543
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,071
- Fall back!
- Go!

544
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,438
All right, Roughnecks,
we still have a job to do.

545
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,991
<i>With the mobile infantry gaining control</i>
<i>of Jigsaw Pass...</i>

546
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,150
<i>... the Bug army was split in two.</i>

547
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,355
<i>Officially, Alpha Squad suffered</i>
<i>zero casualties on this op.</i>

548
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,910
<i>But that day, every Roughneck knew</i>
<i>they had lost one of their own.</i>

549
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,992
<i>Ultimately, high command determined</i>
<i>that cyborgs weren't cost effective.</i>

550
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,990
<i>Good thing Troopers come cheap.</i>

551
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,873
<i>Day 83...</i>

552
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,313
<i>... the Tophet Campaign.</i>

553
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,992
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>the day-in, day-out struggle to stay alive...</i>

554
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,753
<i>... created unbreakable bonds</i>
<i>between Troopers.</i>

555
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,953
<i>Most of the time.</i>

556
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,991
I'm telling you, LT,
Jenkins froze up on that ridge.

557
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,672
He's gonna get us all greased.

558
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,115
Do you have a specific
recommendation, Sergeant?

559
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,034
Yes, sir. Section 8.
Then medevac him out ASAP.

560
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,389
Rico.

561
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,035
You can't do that, Lieutenant.
Section 8 labels a guy forever.

562
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,315
- That's the point.
- Jenkins is one of us.

563
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,914
He's a cry-baby. I know it, you know it.

564
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,878
- Back in formation, both of you.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,830
I hate to say it, Rico,
but Brutto may have a point.

566
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,629
Carl hasn't been the same
since that Brain Bug thing on Hydora.

567
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,313
<i>This is Sgt. F. Brutto, who,</i>
<i>just minutes ago...</i>

568
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,119
<i>... took down a Blister Bug</i>
<i>with a single shot.</i>

569
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,919
- <i>Sergeant, could you turn this way?</i>
- <i>Like this?</i>

570
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,916
Skinnies! On the ridge!

571
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,319
Take cover!

572
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,188
Situation report!

573
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,794
Jenkins down, Doc down, Gossard down!

574
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,111
This is Alpha Team requesting
emergency reinforcements.

575
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,113
I'll take Goss.

576
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,875
No!

577
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,356
This is Rico. Dizzy is down.

578
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,476
Rico, keep moving!

579
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,553
Lieutenant!

580
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,478
Easy, sport.
The good news is, you're whole.

581
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,519
- What's the bad news?
- Look around.

582
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,514
- Where are we?
- The Hotel Skinny.

583
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,872
- Troopers check in, but...
- Skinnies stripped us clean.

584
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,871
Weapons, communicators.

585
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,634
I'm not even sure
I'm wearing undies anymore.

586
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,555
They missed this.

587
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,154
I don't even wanna know
where you were hiding that.

588
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,437
Perfect. When they come back,
I'll grab the biggest skinny...

589
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,875
...you file his nails till he begs for mercy.

590
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,589
Stow the attitude, Sergeant.
I wanna know why we aren't already dead.

591
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,274
What were those explosives
the skinnies tossed at us?

592
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,113
They disable by concussion, not shrapnel.

593
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,918
Skinnies wanted us breathing.

594
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,151
- I don't think I wanna know why.
- The mind is their master.

595
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,879
The mind is their master,
and the mastermind is coming.

596
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,349
Somebody shut off the hi-fi.
I'm trying to think.

597
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,590
- First time for everything.
- The mind is their...

598
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,240
- I said zip it, Private!
- The mind is their master.

599
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,437
- Back off, Sarge!
- That sounds a lot like an order.

600
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,476
Call it a personal request.

601
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,471
Call that a personal reply.

602
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,437
All right, guys, knock it off.
Hey, come on! Come on!

603
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,748
Break it up!

604
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,751
The enemy's out there, not in here.

605
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,432
Yes, sir.

606
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,268
Come on. Come on.
Hey, nobody's gonna hurt you, little guy.

607
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,196
- Looks like you're a daddy.
- Definite family resemblance.

608
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,636
- Don't think it's dangerous, do you?
- I'm sure it's harmless.

609
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,633
That's what we said about Higgins,
and look at all the trouble he causes.

610
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,239
Take it easy.

611
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,556
The mastermind is coming.
The mastermind is coming.

612
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,479
Don't touch him!

613
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,193
Come on! I'm just getting warmed up!

614
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,549
So much for the benefits of shock therapy.

615
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,235
- Where do you think they're taking him?
- Interrogation.

616
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,555
Get your hands off me, you freaks.

617
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,397
Looks like that thing's not going anywhere
without you.

618
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,516
If he can get in,
we must be able to get out.

619
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,158
A little narrow, isn't it?

620
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,595
If I cobble our power suit
batteries together...

621
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,591
...then apply an initiating charge...

622
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,750
...boom, instant escape hatch.

623
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,675
I need something to ignite the sequence.

624
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,432
Call him Sparky.

625
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,677
Don't we need our
power suit batteries to live?

626
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,876
Each suit has an hour of built-in reserve.

627
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,952
- And after that?
- How long can you hold your breath?

628
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,109
Goss.

629
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,148
Do it.

630
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,996
Just you and me, brainiac.

631
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,959
The mind is their master,
and the mastermind is here.

632
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,556
Hello? Is anybody home?

633
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,551
What mastermind?

634
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,471
The mastermind is here.

635
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,233
Come on, kid.
We have to find a way out of here.

636
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,109
If you're expecting a smooch hello...

637
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,034
...forget it.

638
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,157
- <i>We are seeking information.</i>
- Buy a newspaper.

639
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,993
<i>I do not believe that would be necessary.</i>

640
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:30,029
All you're getting out of me is Brutto,
Sergeant TP052061.

641
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,475
One zap should start a chain reaction.

642
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,958
Might buy us a few seconds
when the party starts.

643
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,071
Come on, Sparky. Show time.

644
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,832
Ready here, Rico.

645
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,713
Let me try.

646
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,313
Clear!

647
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,118
Go, go, go!

648
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,916
<i>You are resilient, but you will weaken.</i>

649
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,873
Think again.

650
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,474
<i>But I am not the thinker. He is.</i>

651
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,153
We climb.

652
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,673
Fire in the hole!

653
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,474
Skinnies closing in.

654
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,710
Most geysers erupt
at predictable intervals.

655
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,392
Up and out. Move!

656
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,037
<i>I find it crude</i>
<i>to suck out a creature's brain.</i>

657
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,755
<i>Crude, but effective.</i>

658
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,598
The mastermind.

659
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,672
- Jenkins.
- Sarge.

660
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,438
- Help me.
- Look at me.

661
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,750
You can fight it. Focus.

662
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,709
Open wide!

663
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,513
We go right.

664
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,989
Skinny detachment, 20 meters that way.

665
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,672
How do you know?

666
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,914
Oh, yeah.

667
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,910
Couldn't we just take the elevator?

668
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,954
Move it!

669
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,549
- Don't wait for me.
- I'm not gonna.

670
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,470
Now I know how popcorn feels.

671
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,714
- How much time left on our auxiliary?
- In 10 minutes, we're statues.

672
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,156
Saddle up, Apes!
We're going in for Brutto and Jenkins.

673
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,232
Didn't we just get out?

674
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,638
Jackpot. Jenkins!

675
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,632
Maintain radio contact. Let's move.

676
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,876
- Brutto.
- I missed you too, Goss.

677
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,513
Brutto, Jenkins, you two all right?

678
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,718
Brain Bug tried
to part our hair permanently.

679
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,712
We dealt with it.

680
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,715
Lieutenant.

681
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,190
I raised a retrieval ship on patrol
just outside the village perimeter.

682
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,078
They're ready for pickup,
but we're redlining our reserves.

683
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,118
Ready, Roughnecks?

684
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,995
Rico!

685
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,110
Say hello to an old friend!

686
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,116
Jenkins, dump the constrictor!

687
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,593
Everybody in!

688
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,268
Plug in to recharge off the ship's outputs.

689
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,399
Rico, come on!

690
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,553
This piece of techno junk
is running out of juice!

691
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,991
Jenkins, back in the skimmer!

692
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,037
Get out of here, Sparky! Go!

693
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,358
Thanks for the jump start, pal.

694
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,874
I should keep you
in my glove compartment.

695
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,112
I think we'll find you a quieter home
back at HQ.

696
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,396
Maybe we should adopt him. You know,
Rico, and me and Sparky, makes three.

697
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,559
Hey, Sarge,
after spending a little time together...

698
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,710
...are you and Jenkins best buds now?

699
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,992
I'll take that as a "no."

700
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,229
<i>The whole incident was catalogued</i>
<i>as engagement 2124 in the Y sector.</i>

701
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,038
<i>Just another piece</i>
<i>in the puzzle of the Bug War...</i>

702
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,954
<i>... leaving only a select few to know</i>
<i>what really happened that day.</i>

703
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,757
<i>Day 89, the Tophet Campaign.</i>

704
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,358
<i>My grandmother used to say:</i>

705
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,876
<i>"If you can't stand the heat,</i>
<i>get out of the kitchen."</i>

706
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,950
<i>That's tough to do</i>
<i>when you're the main course.</i>

707
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,035
Incoming!

708
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,914
- You can set your watch by those things.
- I did.

709
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,911
Thirty-two seconds between blasts...

710
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,230
...each wave better than 1,000 degrees.

711
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,912
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

712
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,398
This is Alpha One.

713
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,630
<i>Heat wave is clear,</i>
<i>and the clock is running.</i>

714
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,359
Roger that, Alpha.
The big dog's coming in.

715
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,040
He's coming in. I feel so loved.

716
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,999
Rocking yourself to sleep?

717
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,275
- What do you mean by that?
- Lighten up, dude.

718
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,069
- Dizzy's just messing with you.
- You think I've cracked. Everybody does.

719
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,991
Can you say "psycho"?

720
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,517
You don't eat, don't sleep.

721
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,235
- We're just worried about you.
- Don't be. I can take care of myself.

722
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,518
T minus 15 seconds until next blast wave.

723
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,593
- Target in range now.
- Firing.

724
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,431
Missile impact in five...

725
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,590
...four, three...

726
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,353
It blew up early!

727
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,719
Evasive!

728
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,151
- Big Dog, we have zero kills.
- <i>Copy that, Alpha Team.</i>

729
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,476
<i>But that was the biggest</i>
<i>firecracker on board.</i>

730
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,552
- Talk to me, Goss.
- The blasters' collective body temp...

731
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,517
...has formed an intense heat barrier.

732
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,068
It detonated the missile
before it reached the Bugs.

733
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,071
- Options?
- Residual heat from the Bugs...

734
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,752
...radiates out in a mushroom shape.

735
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,116
Underneath their abdomens,
there's a significant drop in temperature.

736
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,873
Detonate a charge under there,
and it's bye-bye, blasters.

737
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,430
How do we get close enough to plant
a bomb without becoming TV dinners?

738
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,397
Molecular Kevlar shields.

739
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,592
Prototypes, highly reflective.

740
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,989
They're supposed to be resistant
to 1,100 degrees.

741
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,833
- Supposed to be?
- They've never been field-tested.

742
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,115
Why do I have a feeling
that's about to change?

743
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,157
- I need two Troopers for the assault.
- Give me a shield.

744
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,549
Those heat waves are giving me a rash
all over my...

745
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,200
- Sarge, spare me the visual.
- Jenkins.

746
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,959
I'm all over it, LT.

747
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,591
Fine, Rico. Let's move!

748
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,110
Tell me again why this is a good plan.

749
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,388
The heat turned the sand to glass.
It's as slick as ice.

750
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,438
- Modern art?
- Yeah.

751
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,114
"Ode to a Sicon Skimmer."

752
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,509
Incoming!

753
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,509
Whoa!

754
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,833
My shield's turning to butter!
We gotta pull back!

755
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,313
- We might not get this close again.
- Rico!

756
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,998
Strike!

757
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,509
Yeah!

758
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,109
You're turning into
my kind of Trooper, Rico.

759
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,432
- Short on brains, long on guts.
- Thanks, Sarge. I think.

760
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,072
There's something here.

761
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,629
Your wires are crossed, brain boy.

762
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,310
Sarge, are you okay?

763
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,870
- Watch out for that first step.
- It could be a bunker.

764
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,073
Colonel T'Phai.

765
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,156
<i>Yours is a weak and pitiful race,</i>
<i>condemned to extinction.</i>

766
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,676
Two hours.
Not even name, rank or serial number.

767
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,670
Sir, high command on the com link.

768
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:23,120
Jenkins, Intel wants you to give it a shot.

769
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,793
Jenkins, Intel wants you to give it a shot.

770
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,191
<i>Humans, your time is over.</i>

771
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,554
Two voices?

772
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,512
He's not alone in there.

773
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,277
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I could do a workup.

774
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,830
<i>Keep your machines away from me!</i>

775
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,075
Cranium intact, dura mater clear.

776
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,675
Circumferences... What?

777
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,030
- What's that?
- <i>No! No!</i>

778
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,756
- Looks kind of like a...
- Bug!

779
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,279
Somebody get it off!

780
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,794
Fourth down!

781
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,991
Some kind of mind control Bug?

782
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,870
Did anybody get the license plate
of that Bug?

783
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,033
Bio-weapons will want a live specimen
to study, not a chunk of charcoal.

784
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,635
Last time I checked, this was a war,
not a biology class, Doc.

785
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,632
- No sign, Lieutenant.
- Doc, Brutto, secure the exits.

786
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,109
The rest of you,
I want a room-by-room search.

787
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,595
Shock sticks only, maximum setting.

788
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,999
What about him?

789
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,155
- You're the baby-sitter.
- Yes, sir.

790
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,914
I'll have him in his jammies by 8:00.

791
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,191
Always hated hide-and-seek.

792
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,076
Still wanna take this thing alive?

793
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,519
This is Pvt. R. Higgins.
I'm with Col. T'Phai...

794
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,875
...the once-fearsome leader
of the skinny army.

795
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,589
Col. T'Phai, what is it like
to have a Bug living inside your head?

796
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,550
<i>It's full of surprises!</i>

797
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,033
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

798
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,797
- It's here.
- Is that the good news or the bad?

799
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,588
Over here!

800
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,875
<i>I will have my revenge!</i>

801
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,109
We're in the supply room!
We need backup now!

802
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,669
Carl!

803
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,669
No!

804
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,909
No...

805
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,554
...more...

806
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,959
...Bugs!

807
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,428
Johnny.

808
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,837
Alpha waves are flat-line,
no motor response.

809
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,628
Nerve synapse diagnostics negative.

810
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,948
The chase, Doc.

811
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,237
Maybe the specialist
on the med asteroid can do more.

812
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,753
I'm sorry, Rico.

813
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,273
You said you could take care of yourself.

814
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,154
You've always had
a way with the women, pal.

815
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,111
Take care of him, Carmen.

816
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,111
- He's...
- You can count on it.

817
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,509
I just shipped my best friend off
to a medical asteroid because of you!

818
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,149
- Stand down, Private!
- <i>The Bugs are your enemy, not I.</i>

819
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,629
- Wrong!
- Rico, that's an order.

820
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,955
This isn't over.

821
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,316
<i>I was only attempting</i>
<i>to destroy my enemy.</i>

822
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,356
<i>I am no different than you.</i>

823
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,079
Check the mirror. You're nothing like me.

824
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,234
<i>My people are slaves, controlled by Bugs.</i>
<i>Our actions are not our own.</i>

825
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,392
I'll be sure to mention that
to all the Trooper widows.

826
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,109
- That's enough, Private.
- Why do Bugs need slaves?

827
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,998
<i>To work in the mines.</i>
<i>We are forced to extract...</i>

828
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,435
<i>... the phosphorus substance</i>
<i>we call "zylon."</i>

829
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,750
I've gathered samples of this stuff nearby.

830
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,957
It's a highly volatile,
bio-fissionable material.

831
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,789
An organic fuel not that different
from what we use in our spacecrafts.

832
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,394
So Tophet is just a Bug pit stop?

833
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,870
<i>A transport Bug is being filled</i>
<i>with zylon as we speak.</i>

834
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,430
I guess we have to stop that Bug.

835
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,036
Yesterday, he was trying to kill us.

836
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,475
And today we're helping him
save his lousy race?

837
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,790
Welcome to the insanity of war, Sergeant.

838
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,670
These emit high-intensity X rays...

839
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,194
...like the ones
that drove the Bug off T'Phai.

840
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,077
The range is limited. Five meters.

841
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,469
So you'll have to get
up close and personal.

842
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,836
Sure. We'll explain to the skinnies
that this is for their own good.

843
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,356
And hope that their Bug tenants
don't wanna grease us in the meantime.

844
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,116
<i>There. Land on the backside</i>
<i>to avoid detection.</i>

845
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,430
Now I'm taking orders from him?

846
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,273
Not again.

847
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,911
I hate to say I told you so.

848
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:59,313
- <i>Do not move, or they will fire.</i>
- I'm not going down without a fight.

849
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,159
<i>Trust me.</i>

850
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,030
You heard him, Sergeant. Freeze.

851
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,592
I'm the jealous type.

852
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,515
- You could've hit me!
- <i>Yes, but I did not.</i>

853
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,876
That weapon doesn't belong to you.

854
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,474
It might help if you let us in
on your little plan.

855
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,790
<i>There is now a plasma Bug in the mine.</i>

856
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,639
Not good.
One plasma blast into a zylon deposit...

857
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,676
...and you can kiss this rock good-bye.

858
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,435
Why would Bugs blow up a planet they've
been fighting three months to keep?

859
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,988
Maybe they finally have
what they came for.

860
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,195
Let's move!

861
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,194
Not exactly a <i>Whistle While You Work</i>
kind of place.

862
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,670
- What's wrong with them?
- <i>My race needs sunlight to live.</i>

863
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,069
- <i>Without it</i>...
- You're breaking my heart.

864
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,270
Real love-them-and-leave-them types.

865
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,237
Transport Bug, high noon.

866
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,238
Plasma Bug at 4:00.

867
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:17,519
Flores, Rico, take the transport Bug.
Goss, Doc, the plasma.

868
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,398
The rest of us will deal with
the Bugs and skinnies.

869
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,993
<i>What about me?</i>

870
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,188
You stay put.
We hit the dance floor in 30 seconds.

871
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,430
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir.

872
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,236
How are we supposed to keep that thing
from lighting this place up?

873
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,750
I have just what the doctor ordered.

874
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,231
We're only trying to help!

875
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,159
Lt. Razak?

876
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,710
- Higgins!
- Save your breath, Lieutenant.

877
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,153
Behind you!

878
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,874
<i>I was bored.</i>

879
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,512
Train's leaving without us.

880
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,475
Hold on!

881
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,435
Low bridge!

882
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,195
- Any other bright ideas?
- Just one.

883
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,111
Let's go out with a bang!

884
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,919
Plasma Bug's neutralized.

885
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,753
- <i>My people are safe.</i>
- What about ours?

886
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,997
- End of the line!
- Did you have to put it like that?

887
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,149
Jump!

888
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,558
You sure know how
to show a girl a good time.

889
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,114
<i>The battle for Tophet was winding down.</i>

890
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,875
<i>A few mop-up missions, and the Troopers</i>
<i>would be on their collective way.</i>

891
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,349
<i>We had saved the troubled planet...</i>

892
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,397
<i>... and lost a good friend.</i>
