00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,338
You think God's still going
to bring him back to you?

532
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:12,427
Well, he said if I have
the faith of a mustard seed,

533
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,596
I can move a mountain.

534
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:21,186
And also if I ask and I
don't doubt, I shall receive.

535
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,655
He didn't say maybe.

536
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:29,611
So yes, I do believe that he
is going to bring him home.

537
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,113
Okay, Mom.
Okay.

538
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,917
[phone beeping]

539
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:40,121
(female #6)
Mr. Bauman, you have
a call on line one.

540
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:42,624
(Christopher)
Stacy, take a message.

541
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,126
I'm in a meeting right now.

542
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:46,127
As I was saying,
the D.A's office--

543
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:53,218
Mr. Bauman, Mr. Bauman,
we paid you $25,000 cash

544
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,554
and you haven't set foot
in court to represent

545
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,773
Mr. Jonathan Chase.

546
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,276
You don't answer his calls
from jail and not once,

547
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,280
not once have you visited
him to discuss his case.

548
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,736
Now I'm politely
requesting a full refund.

549
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,238
What are you, kidding?

550
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,623
You got jokes, right?

551
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,208
Does it look like
I'm joking?

552
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,711
Does this look like
a flea market bargaining table?

553
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:24,215
Listen, Mr. Jonathan Chase chose
this law firm to represent him

554
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,168
and you agreed
to pay his legal fees.

555
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,338
And we're doing everything
we can to get him out.

556
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:31,839
Well, I'll tell you what.

557
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,343
Your best, it's just
not good enough.

558
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,262
So here's the deal.

559
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:41,733
Refund a portion
of say, say $15,000,

560
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,987
which is extremely more than
fair due to the fact

561
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,356
that you haven't done anything.

562
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:55,079
I would take seriously
a proposal to you, Mr. Bauman.

563
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,256
Stacy, get me
Walter from the D.A.'s office.

564
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,207
Yes, sir.

565
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,927
By the way, your
brother's on hold for you.

566
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,464
What is it, Joshua?

567
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,466
Hey, I was gonna pass
over and see my son today.

568
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,353
I thought you might
want to come meet him.

569
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
Listen, Joshua.

570
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,773
I don't have time
to discuss this,

571
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:25,109
but I'm sure your son will feel
glad about the opportunity

572
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,396
of seeing his father.

573
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,619
Man.

574
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,208
(Mark)
So what do we do now?

575
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,709
Business as usual.

576
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,711
Let's keep going.

577
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,915
Okay, well, his
court date's scheduled--

578
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,732
Hey, Kelly.
It's good to see you.

579
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,817
Joshua, what
are you doing here?

580
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,935
I'm here to get some of
Kelly Marie's Hot Wings.

581
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:08,936
Best in the world.

582
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:10,855
Yeah, well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

583
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,690
The last time I entertained
you with a home cooked meal,

584
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,275
we both fell into sin.

585
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,277
Hey look, Kelly, I'm
just here 'cause I told you,

586
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:19,781
you know, when I got out,
I wanted to make things

587
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:20,832
better between us.

588
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,283
So, you know, here I am.

589
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:24,752
I know I've been absent
from my son's life--

590
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,455
Absent from our son.

591
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:29,457
Okay, yeah, absent from our
son's life for a long time,

592
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:33,928
but, you know, I promise
I'm gonna make it up to him.

593
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,930
You know, can I
at least see him?

594
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,348
He's at basketball practice.

595
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,802
Joshua, don't make any
promises you can't keep.

596
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:44,522
Look, you know,
I'm just trying to say

597
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,276
that I want to be here
for him, you know?

598
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,728
I want to be a real positive
role model in his life.

599
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,146
Oh, he's got a role model.

600
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,115
What do you mean
he's got a role model?

601
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,117
You got a man now
or something?

602
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,568
Yeah.

603
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,570
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do have somebody in my life.

604
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,155
Somebody who won't leave us.

605
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:03,658
Somebody who provides
all of our needs.

606
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:05,660
I hope you get
to meet him soon.

607
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,996
Man, the only person I want
to see right now is my son.

608
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,967
Look Joshua, I got a lot
of studying to do so

609
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,970
I am going to get my cooking
degree this time around

610
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,921
without any
of your distractions.

611
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,890
So if you really
want to see your son,

612
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,927
then why don't you meet us at
Casey's on Saturday at noon?

613
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,812
Okay.

614
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,147
I'll be there.

615
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,350
And hey, I'm gonna help you
open your franchise one day.

616
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,819
Kelly Marie's Hot Wings.

617
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,188
Whatever.
Goodbye, Joshua.

Mr. Taylor, hi.

I'm Laura Miles.

00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,864
I'm the business loan
officer for the branch.

626
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:07,865
Nice to meet you.

627
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,119
Well, I have to say
I'm very impressed

628
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,704
with your
hot wing business concept.

629
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,590
That's what
I'm talking about.
Very interesting.

630
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,591
Unfortunately, our bank will
not be able to assist you

631
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,509
with this business loan.

632
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,595
What do you mean you can't
assist me with the loan?

633
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,264
Mr. Taylor, unfortunately,
your credit scores are low.

634
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,265
You have no collateral.

635
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,267
Frankly, you have
no business track record.

636
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,187
You simply do not
Look-- qualify for this loan.

637
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,555
But this is
an awesome concept.

638
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,472
And people will
love Kelly's wings.

639
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,109
So, I mean, as much
as they love these wings,

640
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,395
we could turn that kind
of profit around in no time.

641
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,896
A couple months, tops.

642
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,816
There's gotta be some way
I qualify for half that

643
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:43,568
or something.

644
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,570
I'm afraid not.

645
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,071
All right.

646
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:51,075
I'll tell you, though,
Kelly Marie's Hot Wings,

647
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,378
is gonna make it someday.

I need your help, dude.

I've been out here looking
for work and trying to hustle,

but man, I really need
a business loan, bro.

654
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,738
A business loan?

655
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
Yeah, look.
Check it out.

Don't worry
about $35,000.

660

Just, you know,
give me a chance, dude.

00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:35,753
Give you a chance?

00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,755
Let's see.

663
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,257
We gave you a chance
to go to college,

664
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,760
but instead you chose jail
and hurt mom at the same time.

665
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,263
You blew it, so you don't
get any more chances.

666
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,765
I can't help you,
little bro.

667

I'll never leave you.

No, not tonight.

a little later.

catch up with you all day.

fall into temptation.

from your mom's house.

about employment.

Thank you so much.

783
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,609
You know, Mom, the reason I
haven't been going to church is

784
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,476
because I've been so busy.

785

so much going on.

Chris, you know it's
not just about church.

It's about a heart
relationship with our Father.

seem to have forgotten.

You never make time
for him, Joshua.

Oh, that's right.

Somebody's that's gonna
supply all your needs, huh?

810

I did say that.

811

that you get to meet him.

00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,486
and he'll be right with you.

874
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,772
Thank you.

875
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,619
You really don't want
to divorce him, do you?

876
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:46,840
No, I don't.

877
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,594
But I tried everything
and nothing seems to work.

878
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,881
Have you tried praying
and asking God

879
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:57,884
to restore your marriage?

880
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:00,520
No, I haven't.

881
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:12,282
I was in that same situation
until I realized without Christ

882
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:19,206
my marriage would
continue in turmoil.

883
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:28,882
Here's the number to
a Christian marriage counselor.

884
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,841
You don't need
a divorce attorney.

885
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,761
Your marriage
can be healed.

886
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,485
Would you mind
if I prayed with you?

887
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,988
No.

888
00:49:54,858 --> 00:50:00,664
Father,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

889
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:07,004
I come before you,
interceding on behalf of

890
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:14,678
this woman, her children,
and her husband, O God.

891
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:21,385
Father, I just pray in the name
of Jesus Christ that you heal,

892
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:27,774
restore, and reconcile
this marriage.

893
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:32,779
God, I know that
you are able.

894
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,616
You created marriage.

895
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,454
And you said what
you put together,

896
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,624
let no man put asunder.

897
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:50,414
Keep them now
as only you can.

898
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,915
Hmm.

899
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:58,388
In the name of
Jesus Christ I pray, amen.

900
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,640
Amen.

901
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,510
It's gonna be
all right.

902
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,596
Thank you.

903
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:12,602
Okay Stacy, okay.

That if you confess with
your mouth the Lord Jesus

905
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,917
and believe in your heart that
God raised him from the dead,

906
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,336
you will be saved.

Your Heavenly Father's desire

908
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:39,262
is to deliver you
from satanic bondage.

909

(Mrs. Bauman)
When are you going to stop
doing things your own way

910
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:46,219
and start doing things his way?

911
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:57,197
Lord Jesus, today I
commit my life to you, God.

912
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:02,702
And I ask you to be my
personal Lord and Savior.

913
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:08,208
Forgive me, God,
for all of my sins.

914
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,211
For so long I've just been
livin' my life for myself,

915
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:16,166
but now, now I want to
live my life for you, God.

Dear Mom, I think you'll be
pleased to know that today

920
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,057
I'm truly a new man.

921
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,559
I've repented and truly
dedicated my whole life

922
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,562
to Jesus Christ.

923
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,064
I don't know what's gonna
come from this situation

924
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,567
I've foolishly
gotten myself into.

925

I'm incarcerated and facing
5 years for probation violation

926

for something I didn't do.

927
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:33,076
But now I realize that runnin'
from God is the worst position

929
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,582
To live life without him
is an eternal tragedy.

Raised in the hood,
I was forced to bang.

940
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:16,536
Threw away my nine
and I flushed the 'caine.

941
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:19,039
Since I gave my life to
Christ I'm no longer the same.

Hey man, I know some
people on the outside.

Hey Tre, Tre, listen--it's

Could you just tone
it down a little bit?

951
00:54:34,387 --> 00:54:36,222
I'll send you a CD

So it says it right here,
2 Corinthians 5:17,

"Therefore, if any man be in
Christ, he is a new creature.

"The old things
have passed away.

Um, Mr. Bauman
just hired me.

Tell me you
did not fire Stacy.

Well, good morning

This is my law firm.

969

Look, this isn't a game.

I mean, how is it that you
claim to be a Christian,

00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,763

Christ Association,

974
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,183

You know the police
officer that arrested you?

00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:34,340
Well, he typed in the wrong
license plate number

988
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,844
and the judge has ordered
your immediate release.

989
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:40,146
Pack your things.

990
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,400
Okay, Mr. Taylor.

991
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,101

No, right here is fine.

1008

We're from
the Texas Bar Association

1009
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,970
and we've been investigating
many complaints

1010
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,224
about this law firm
concerning accusations

1011
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:25,642
of not representing
clients properly.

1012
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:31,114
No communication with clients,
failure to represent clients,

1013
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,617
and the list goes on, including
excessive attorney fees.

1014
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,738
What evidence do you have
to support these accusations?

1015
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:40,740
(male #7)
Sir, you failed to appear
before the board

1016
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:43,209
to disprove these accusations.

1017
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,211
Unfortunately,
a decision has been made.

1018
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,715
We have sufficient evidence
showing that your practice

1019
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,468
has had a total disregard
for proper standards

1020
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,470
of legal representation.

1021
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,972
Therefore, the Texas
Bar Association has made

1022
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:00,927
a determination regarding
Christopher Bauman,

1023
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:06,182
member number 24689738,
hereby revoking all

1024
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,269
legal practice credentials,
effective immediately.

1025
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,772
Give me that.

1026
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:18,027
How is it no one
called me before this?

1027
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:22,248
Our phone calls went
unanswered and we never received

1028
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,834
a response from our
certified letters.

1029
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,620
Frankly, Mr. Bauman, you've
left the Association

1030
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,873
no other options.

1031
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,008
(male #8)
Furthermore, Mr. Bauman,

1032
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,596
due to the number of complaints
and threats from your clients,

1033
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,882
the judge has granted
your landlord

1034
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,935
a notice to vacate
the premises against you.

1035
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,354
But he can't do that.

1036
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,856
Ha-ha, oh, I'm afraid he can.

1037
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,643
In fact, he already has.

1038
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:54,447
Mr. Bauman, you have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

1039
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,484
Forty-eight hours.

1040
00:58:58,484 --> 00:58:59,986
You can leave now.

1041
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:01,988
Mr. Bauman, clock's tickin'.

1042
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:05,208
Forty-eight hours.

1043
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauman.

1044
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,797

want anything to do with him.

just acknowledge God

1426

and he will show us the way.

1427
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,751
Yeah, you right.

1428
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:53,752

Yes, son?

1447
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,655
Can I ask you a question?

1448
01:24:03,655 --> 01:24:05,657
Yeah, man, shoot.

1449
01:24:05,657 --> 01:24:07,542
I know Jesus was
able to walk on water,

1450
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,545
but how was Peter able
to do the same thing?

1451
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,298
You know, Jesus
said to Peter, "Come."

1452
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:17,752
And with faith, anybody can
accomplish the impossible.

1453
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:21,056
You just have to believe.

1454
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,257
You know why Peter
began to sink?

1455
01:24:22,841 --> 01:24:25,643
Because he didn't believe?

1456
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:30,315
No, 'cause he took
his eyes off of Jesus.

1457
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,233
That's exactly what
happened to me.

1458
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,352
You know, I took my eyes
off our Heavenly Father

1459
01:24:34,352 --> 01:24:37,355
and I began to look
at all the other stuff

1460
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:42,026
going on around me and my
whole life began to sink.

1461
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:44,946
But then Peter caught
up to Jesus to save him?

1462
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,031
Is that what you did also?

1463
01:24:47,031 --> 01:24:50,168
Yeah, that's
exactly what I did.

1464
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,837
So then it's possible for
you to overcome the pain

1465
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,840
Uncle Christopher
caused you, right?

1466
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,844
Yeah, man.

1467
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:02,013
You know, I suppose
you're right.

1468
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,882
You're a pretty
smart little dude.

1469

I appreciate this time
we get to spend together.

1470

Mom said it'll be this
way between us always.

1471
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:16,144
So long as we keep our
eyes on Jesus, keep our faith,

1472
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,612
and endure to
the end, then yeah,

1473

road map to get through life.

1501
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,720
Good morning, Mr. Bauman.

1502
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,638
I'm Dr. Wilburn.

1503
01:26:33,638 --> 01:26:34,556
How do you feel?

1504
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:36,975
Okay, I guess.

1505
01:26:36,975 --> 01:26:37,976
What happened?

1506
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,811
Mr. Bauman, healthy kidneys
clean the blood by removing

1507
01:26:39,811 --> 01:26:43,147
excess, fluids,
minerals, and wastes.

1508
01:26:43,147 --> 01:26:45,567
When your kidneys fail,
as yours have done,

1509
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,237
these things build up in
your body, causing harm.

1510
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,623
Your uncontrolled
high blood pressure,

1511
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,909
which I suspect over
several years has caused

1512
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,794
your kidneys to fail.

1513
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:59,581
When that happened, you got
an increase of potassium in

1514
01:26:59,998 --> 01:27:03,418
your blood, causing your heart
to develop an arrhythmia,

1515
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:06,004
which caused it to stop.

1516
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,806
You haven't seen a physician
in over 10 years

1517
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,675
according to your family.

1518
01:27:10,675 --> 01:27:13,261
If you had seen a physician
several months ago,

1519
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:16,264
this may have been prevented.

1520
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,566
You have to take better
care of yourself.

1521
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,069
What are you saying?

1522
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:25,356
Mr. Bauman, over
the last 2 or 3 days,

1523
01:27:25,857 --> 01:27:31,029
we've run various labs
and diagnostic tests on you.

We've come
to the conclusion that

1525
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:36,834

Mr. Bauman, what I'm
saying to you is this.

1528
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:50,765
You need to be on dialysis
for the rest of your life

His blood pressure's

he's taking better
care of himself,

1565
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:29,874
and one of my cardiology
colleagues recently informed me

1566
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:33,761
that Christopher's heart
is functioning normally.

1567

Only that he receive it.

Well, Your Honor,
I'm not certain.

1688
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:02,399
I've represented many families
going through what I now realize

1689
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:06,821
to be a tragedy and never
thought for more than a moment

1690
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,691
the harm that
perhaps I've caused.

1691
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:12,776
So yesterday, as I sat
down with my client,

1692
01:37:12,776 --> 01:37:15,279
I gave her different
words, living Words.

1693
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:18,616
I shared with her
this Scripture.

1694
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:22,169
It says that tribulation
produces perseverance,

1695
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,923
and perseverance character,
and character hope,

1696
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:29,093
and now hope does
not disappoint.

1697
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,961

has to do with this case?

01:37:38,302 --> 01:37:40,221
Your Honor,
if I may continue?

01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,689
(Judge King)
All right, go ahead.

1703
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,191
I understand this is not
church and I'm not a preacher,

1704
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,978
but this is a place of justice
and justice is found

1705
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:49,480
in these living Words.

1706
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,199
This Scripture says that
the reason that you see so many

1707
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:56,287
cases and that I work so many
cases is because our marriages

1708
01:37:56,287 --> 01:38:01,292
in this society have no hope
because they have no character.

1709
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,079
And today, true justice
is through hope.

1710
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,997
And just as this Scripture says
that hope will not disappoint,

1711
01:38:06,997 --> 01:38:13,554
today my client receives
hope and she understands,

1712
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,506
just as perhaps many of
the marriages that are

1713
01:38:15,506 --> 01:38:17,892
hanging on by the last thread
need to understand,

1714
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,227
that it's not time
to run from our problems,

1715
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:24,181
but to run through our
problems and to persevere.

1716
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:27,685
Divorce doesn't fix things,
it doesn't solve problems.

1717
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:29,186
Love is the answer.

1718
01:38:29,687 --> 01:38:32,690
Today, my client is
in the right place.

1719
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:34,441

And where's this?

1720
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:36,277

because she's heard

1721

perseverance gives character

1722
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,750
and character hope.

1723
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,252
Well, I can see your client
obviously found the hope

1724
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:49,540
that she was looking
for 'cause she's not here.

our loved one,
Joshua Taylor.

1760

The Bible also makes it clear

1761

that the only way
that he could go to heaven

1765
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,160
was through
faith in Christ alone.

Do you know that Jesus came
to this world to die for you?

1767

He didn't just come
to be an example,

1768
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:31,118
he came to be the lamb of God
who takes away

the sin of the world.

1770
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:34,171

our redeeming sacrifice,

Why?

Because he wanted to make it
possible to everybody who is

1775
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:50,888
within the sound of my voice,
he wanted to make it possible

Christopher, if you're
reading this letter,

then it's definite
that I have passed on.

1841
01:48:15,272 --> 01:48:17,157
When I left Seguin
with my family,

1842
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,160
I must admit I was filled
with bitterness towards you

1843
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,996
and hadn't yet learned
to love unconditionally.

1844
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:25,949
But God, through his Word,
touched my heart

1845
01:48:25,949 --> 01:48:27,834
and moved me to forgive.

1846
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:30,954

without an earthly dad

1847
01:48:30,954 --> 01:48:33,840
in our lives, but I must
tell you Christopher,

1848
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,009
when I accepted
Jesus as my Savior,

1849
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:38,461
I met my Heavenly Father.

1850
01:48:38,461 --> 01:48:39,379

one of two roads to be on,

1853

the road to heaven
or the road to hell.

1854

Pray, repent, and open
your heart to God.
