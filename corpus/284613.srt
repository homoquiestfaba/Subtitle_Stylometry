1
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,633
Uncle Chan, your football
skill is very good!

2
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,434
How about we have a
competition with them today?

3
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,040
Good!

4
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:52,974
Let's go.

5
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,107
I don't have a football,
why are you stopping?

6
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:35,880
Uncle, pass the ball!

7
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,355
Great, it's got in!

8
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:47,523
Great!

9
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,257
Uncle Chan, that pass was really good!

10
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,367
Right, I have to go to work.

11
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,902
I'll play with you
again tomorrow, goodbye.

12
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,377
Very good! Very good...

13
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,174
Fai, give Grandpa
medicine when you're back.

14
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,608
I know, Mum.

15
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,816
My Mum is calling me.
I have to go, goodbye!

16
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,184
Mum, do you know?

17
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,428
I'm especially good today.

18
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,492
Grandpa, do you know I'm
especially good today?

19
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,928
I kept passing the players
and finally came to the goal.

20
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,702
It's a big kick into
the goal, yeah! I got it!

21
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,299
I can see it.

22
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,832
Fai, did you give medicine to Grandpa?

23
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:29,932
I know.

24
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,077
Mum, do you know the reason why

25
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,143
I feel specially good when
playing football with Uncle Chan.

26
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,182
Mum, is Beckham cool?

27
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,043
Am I looked like Beckham?

28
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,582
Like who?

29
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,285
Beckham.

30
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,019
The guy we saw together
from the video last time.

31
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
The guy whom I've pointed to you.

32
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,758
I do recall him.

33
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,455
Is it the one that is skinny with bald?

34
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,328
Skinny and bald.

35
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,361
That is my idol!

36
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,931
How can you describe him in such a way?

37
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,736
Grandpa, you should know who is Beckham?

38
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,310
No way,

39
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,083
women don't understand these things.

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,120
Mum, do you think

41
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,848
I'll become a football star in future?

42
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,392
Maybe.

43
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,796
You don't even have a
little confidence in me.

44
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,027
Grandpa,

45
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,468
you should believe that I can
be a football star in the future.

46
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,408
Grandpa knows me well.

47
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,872
Yes, Grandpa is great.

48
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,645
Mum is no good, right?

49
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,677
I never say that.

50
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,817
Fai, Mum has to go
to hand in the script.

51
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,990
Fai, I've put the lunch
in the rice-cooker.

52
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
You need to heat it before
giving it to Grandpa to eat.

53
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,385
You can read him some news afterwards.

54
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,388
And remember to massage
the finger for Grandpa too.

55
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,155
I understand.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,399
Right, also...

57
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,332
Don't run around and
don't play computer games.

58
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,507
You don't have to worry me. Pay
attention to yourself instead.

59
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,969
Be careful when you go out
and watch out for traffic.

60
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:12,973
Yes.

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,580
Also, keep yourself warm
in order not to catch cold.

62
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,042
You must eat something at lunch time.

63
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,617
Otherwise, you'll have a
stomach-ache when you're in a rush.

64
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,909
I'll remember it.

65
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,354
Grandpa, am I right?

66
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,657
Okay, I'll take your
advice, little chap.

67
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,551
I'm off.

68
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,823
Goodbye!

69
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,104
Okay, stop playing

70
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,310
Do put on your clothes quickly as we've
to go in the Operating Theatre now.

71
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,879
You danced very well.

72
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,948
Thank you.

73
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,747
I can't see you to have
a little bit of panic.

74
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,319
Why do I have to be panic? It's
just to extract the bone marrow.

75
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
It's no bad. Will it affect
tonight's Ladies Night?

76
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,122
Ladies Night! Yeah!

77
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,587
It's also Anita's birthday tonight.

78
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,324
Anita's birthday?

79
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,264
No problem. You should tell her.

80
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,458
Today, you saved a life
of a Japanese's boy.

81
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,964
She'll think that you're very different.

82
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,831
If you can't get hold of
her, I'll bring you out.

83
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,733
Then... I need to consider it.

84
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,074
Consider?

85
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,976
It's only joking. Silly guy!

86
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,506
The operation went very well today.

87
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,149
Thank you!

88
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,579
Bye! Bye!

89
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,063
Hi!

90
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,766
Your coffee is ready.

91
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,029
Two. Two?

92
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,205
Isn't it usually only one?

93
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,268
Today is not the same.

94
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,832
Thank you.

95
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,305
Wait...

96
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,410
Old lady.

97
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,689
Thank you! It's nothing!

98
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:50,897
Officer Kao

99
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,905
It's for you, Bon.

100
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:54,903
For me?

101
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,505
It must be Yan Yan.

102
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,467
Aren't you helping Yan
Yan buying coffee everyday?

103
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,508
How can I bring it?

104
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,337
I'm not that narrow minded. Hold it.

105
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,508
You want me to take care
of Yan Yan in Japan, right?

106
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,015
I'll also take care of
her even without coffee.

107
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:06,947
Is it? Give me back.

108
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,177
No way!

109
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,851
If you are worry, go with her next time.

110
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,790
It's not late.

111
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,224
Thanks.

112
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,828
Yan Yan's coffee, very precious.

113
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,288
Let's go.

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,693
Bye. Bye.

115
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,091
What?

116
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,432
Your pair of trousers
wasn't broken today?

117
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,570
No!

118
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,139
You wasn't bit by Harry today?

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,338
It's getting old, can't
catch up with me any more.

120
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,136
Who's getting older?

121
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,377
I didn't say it's you.

122
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,771
Hurry up to get change.

123
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,486
How's it? Is it okay?

124
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,285
This is no. 18 already.

125
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,588
How can you remember it so clearly?

126
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,093
Of course, 18 lives.

127
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,289
Also, when it comes to no. 20...

128
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,695
You have to marry me.

129
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,701
You've said it, don't regret.

130
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,666
Work hard!

131
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,635
Okay! Work hard!

132
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,975
Dr Kao

133
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,914
Hey man. Is it serious?

134
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,651
Why you both asking the same question?

135
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,715
The way you asked made
things get serious.

136
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,291
You'd better extract
it for me right away.

137
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,529
Okay, don't worry, you'll be fine.

138
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,287
Okay.

139
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:26,926
No. 3

140
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,552
I must arrange the time so
as to accompany you next time.

141
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,381
Good.

142
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,419
If you really want, we go together.

143
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,984
Then, you go to the meetings for me.

144
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,785
Goodbye! Bye.

145
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:57,759
Take care of Yan Yan for me.

146
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,919
Goodbye!

147
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,826
You should go back to work.

148
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,789
It goes successfully!

149
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,049
8; B9; B10

150
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,717
This side! This side!

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,059
Go in a bit!

152
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,672
Fat guy, I caught you this time!

153
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,379
You're a ghost. I'm a ghost.

154
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,146
I'm not playing, I feel dizzy.

155
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,949
4...

156
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,429
Grandpa, I'm back.

157
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,779
I feel very dizzy and tired.

158
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,109
You alright.

159
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,480
Grandpa, did you practice?

160
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,285
Grandpa.

161
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,750
Do you know? Mum said that

162
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,861
only if you can hold up your thumb,

163
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,364
you should be able to
stand up and be alright.

164
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,795
So, you have to be good.

165
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,591
Work hard, understand?

166
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,537
Otherwise, you need to
back to the hospital.

167
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,134
Then, we can't see each other so often.

168
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,172
So, you really have to work hard.

169
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,440
Work hard...

170
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,728
Grandpa, alright.

171
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,596
It probably because of
the football just now...

172
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,575
The emergency ward sent
this medical record.

173
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,582
When he came here this afternoon, his
temperature was 38.7 degree Celsius,

174
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,078
heart beat 112 per minute.

175
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,287
Blood pressure 110,70.

176
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,353
Normal white blood cell
is sixteen thousand.

177
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,127
Haemoglobin is eight gram.

178
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,123
Platelet number is fifty thousand.

179
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,006
Patient's relatives are here.

180
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,454
Doctor

181
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,250
How do you do?

182
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,891
How's my son?

183
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,461
Initially, it's confirmed that
it's a problem related to the blood.

184
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,555
We still have to check
the actual situation.

185
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,832
The problem is related to the blood?

186
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,295
What does it mean?

187
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,938
Has he had anaemia for a long time?

188
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,032
Anaemia?

189
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,873
No. He was very well this morning.

190
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,044
No anaemia.

191
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,145
Don't get panic,

192
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,239
it could be something wrong physically.

193
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,453
So, let the boy has a good rest first.

194
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,052
This examination result
needs to take some time.

195
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,618
Don't worry too much.

196
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,475
Mrs Chan, it's me.

197
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,842
How's my papa?

198
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,875
This afternoon, it was lucky
that I went to have a look.

199
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,449
Otherwise, I can't imagine.

200
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,158
Luckily, it's just minor
scratches on the skin.

201
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,019
But, he hasn't eaten
anything for the whole day.

202
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,892
Is he okay?

203
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,426
He ate a little bit afterwards

204
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,293
and he's sleeping now.

205
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,664
Is Fai alright?

206
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,066
You didn't even say
a word before dieing...

207
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,144
Brother, have you seem my Mum?

208
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,747
Mum.

209
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,917
Mum

210
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,327
Mum

211
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,567
Mum

212
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,319
Fai.

213
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:32,922
Mum, where're you going?

214
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,455
Where have you been?

215
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,471
Fai, let's go.

216
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,197
Mrs Luk

217
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,873
Dr Lee, how's the
medical result of my son?

218
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,252
Mrs Luk, we don't want
to hide it from you.

219
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,727
Luk Fai's disease is a
serious non-lymphatic cell

220
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,829
Type M4 haemophilia

221
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,587
which is blood cancer.

222
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,061
In a simple terms,

223
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,801
it's a abnormal change of the
white blood cells in his blood.

224
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,573
And this abnormal
cells continue to grow,

225
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,709
at a great rate.

226
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,501
If it didn't cure in time,
the death rate is very high.

227
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,514
So, bone marrow transplant

228
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,149
have to be carried out immediately

229
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,283
after the chemotherapy

230
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,290
Otherwise, his life won't
last for more than 6 months.

231
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,493
It is due to a number of
recent successful cases,

232
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,719
being released afterwards.

233
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,230
Everyone has some
understanding about it.

234
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,260
Of course,

235
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,925
it can't be cured completely.

236
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,829
But, you should prepare it psychology.

237
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,115
Mrs Luk, you alright?

238
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,588
How's it?

239
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,526
You alright?

240
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,868
Mum, where've you been? It
took you so long to come back.

241
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,400
Mum, do you know?

242
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,438
Last night, there were
so many people crying.

243
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,840
Then, the guy next to me
was covered with white cloth

244
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:16,878
and taken away.

245
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,478
Mum, when can I leave the hospital?

246
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,721
What's the hurry? Doctor hasn't
completed the examination yet.

247
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,325
How can I not hurry?

248
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,417
I still have to watch football today.

249
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,457
Mum, I don't want to
stay in the hospital.

250
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,695
There are a lot of children get sick.

251
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,897
Mum, have you been listening to me?

252
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,372
I am listening.

253
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,443
Something wrong.

254
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,040
You look weird today.

255
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,079
Mum's stomach is not well.

256
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,848
You're always not having
your meals properly.

257
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,219
Is it hurt?

258
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,694
Mum is alright once Fai massage for me.

259
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,529
Now, you are a good boy.

260
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,129
Come and rest in bed.

261
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,765
Okay. I take a rest.

262
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,222
You get some stomach
tablets from the doctor.

263
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,660
Okay. I know.

264
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,595
Come, lie down.

265
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:21,975
Mum

266
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,743
Grandpa is alone at home,
who give him medicine?

267
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,384
You do have to worry.

268
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,454
Miss, I want to ask you.

269
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,289
Doctor say bone marrow
transplant is necessary.

270
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,158
Isn't it once it is
transplanted, it'll be fine?

271
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,969
When healthy bone
marrow are transplanted,

272
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,001
the new blood produced will
contain no cancer cells.

273
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,604
Of course, the disease will be cured.

274
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,946
But, it isn't that easy.

275
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,209
Why?

276
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,751
Bone marrow transplant
is very expensive.

277
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,246
It needs two to three
hundred thousands dollars.

278
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,188
Also, it must be matched.

279
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,551
It isn't easy to get
the right one to match.

280
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,028
The chance is only one in ten thousand.

281
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,758
The right match is very difficult.

282
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,966
Haven't you seem there are
so many children waiting?

283
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,296
What can I do?

284
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,207
Nothing, just wait.

285
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,302
Depends your luck.

286
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,773
Who? It's me.

287
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,608
Mrs Chan.

288
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,738
What's the matter with you?

289
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,041
I am telling you Fai has blood cancer.

290
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,186
Blood cancer? Yes.

291
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,252
Can't be.

292
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,611
I also don't believe.

293
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,717
Then, we'd better quickly
donate the blood to him.

294
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:22,652
Is that work?

295
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,159
Of course.

296
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,421
Well. You all wait for
me tomorrow morning.

297
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,098
We can go to the hospital together.

298
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,200
You go now. Okay.

299
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,935
Officer

300
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,136
Luk Fai's bone marrow exam
report is not so optimistic.

301
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,635
I know. I've seen the report.

302
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,971
Make an appointment for
me with Luk Fai's mum.

303
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,981
I want to find out,

304
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,578
how much psychological
preparation has she got.

305
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,187
Okay. I'll inform Mrs
Luk as soon as possible.

306
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,187
Send Luk Fai's genes arrangement
information out quickly.

307
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,828
It has been sent off.

308
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,928
Including Guangzhou,
Jinan, Wuhan & Chengdu.

309
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,721
What about Taiwan & Hong Kong?

310
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,728
Were also sent.

311
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,120
My boy.

312
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,653
Were you good yesterday?

313
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,089
Did you sleep well?

314
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,519
You know? Grandpa is
very much thinking of you.

315
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,625
Don't you want me?

316
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,428
Are you sure you don't want me?

317
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,464
See what I have brought for you?

318
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,466
Fai, you see.

319
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,403
Mum has to go back
to look after Grandpa.

320
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,409
And also have to hand in
the script to Auntie Wong.

321
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,342
You know?

322
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,342
Mum, when can I really go?

323
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,612
I think a few more days.

324
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,323
Anyway, Mum will accompany
with you these few days,

325
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,390
okay?

326
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,693
No, I don't want to
stay in the hospital.

327
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,984
I want to go home.

328
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,925
Fai, you're the best.

329
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,397
Mum has told you earlier,

330
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,469
there's no other choice except
staying in the hospital if you're sick.

331
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,063
I know you're very bored.

332
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,197
Okay.

333
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,068
What about you speak to Dr Lee.

334
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,837
If he can let you go, I
bring you home right away.

335
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,373
What do you think?

336
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,751
You know, Mum is very much
like to bring you home.

337
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,850
Without you at home, Mum
has lost an assistant.

338
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,225
You see, no one will do
the massage for Grandpa.

339
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,958
And no one will give medicine
to Grandpa too, right?

340
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,094
Mum, what diseases have I got?

341
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,167
Why is it my whole body has no strength?

342
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,747
Mum, where're you going?

343
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,847
Mum has to go the toilet
and will be back right away.

344
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,740
Why are you here? Are
you looking for me?

345
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,346
Beijing has just admitted a new patient.

346
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,640
A boy who is eight years old.

347
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,413
What's the name?

348
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,554
Called Luk Fai.

349
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,877
Luk Fai?

350
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,316
Right, there was a girl called Yin Yin,

351
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,683
Has she got the right match?

352
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,219
Not yet.

353
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,229
Still on the waiting list.

354
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,625
The blood samples are so few.

355
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,630
I think it's very difficult.

356
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,571
Sometimes, this job do
make people desperate.

357
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,139
It's not.

358
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,502
In fact, I think no matter
how many times of failure,

359
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,840
and if only one is successful,

360
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,740
this job is still worthwhile.

361
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,977
I understand.

362
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,616
But there're so many
people don't understand.

363
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,922
Why are you giving up
your original doctor's work

364
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,886
and go to work for the
Care Unit as volunteer?

365
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,890
I also don't know.

366
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,629
I just like this job.

367
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,198
I work happily.

368
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,360
Dr Kao, sorry.

369
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,525
Patient in the Operating
Theatre is ready.

370
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,966
Can you go and have a look? Okay.

371
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:27,968
I'm off first.

372
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,611
Who do you want?

373
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,819
I...

374
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,791
That day my Mum and I saw you to
have hair cut outside the door.

375
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,760
Do you stay in this hospital too?

376
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,933
What's wrong with you?

377
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,964
Why did you let your mum

378
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,639
to shave your head?

379
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,711
It's because my disease
would cause my hair to shed.

380
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,850
It hurts my mum.

381
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,386
So, I let my mum to have it shaved.

382
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,320
Are you also having haemophilia?

383
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,928
I don't know.

384
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,599
You look pretty healthy
and same as I was.

385
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,927
But since you stay here,

386
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,568
it must be the same.

387
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,965
Don't you know about it?

388
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,640
Haemophilia can whiten
the color of the blood.

389
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,776
When the blood is damaged,
would be hair shed?

390
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,477
You'll find out more in the future.

391
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,121
I think you should be okay.

392
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,863
Sister, your picture is very pretty.

393
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,300
Do you like it?

394
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,764
Yes!

395
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,433
Then, I give it to you.

396
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,733
Thank you, sister.

397
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,702
Since I was admitted
to hospital till now,

398
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,571
I carry this pair of shoes everyday.

399
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,880
Today, it's the first time I wear it.

400
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,007
Sister, you danced very well!

401
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:47,935
But, you have to promise me,

402
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,176
if you really become a Ballet dancer,

403
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,639
you must invite me to
see your "Swan Lake" show.

404
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,314
I won't forget.

405
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,817
That day, I'll invite Dad, Mum

406
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,183
and also you

407
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,318
to see my performance.

408
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,562
We surely can wait for
that day to come, right?

409
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,764
No problem.

410
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,891
What?

411
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,701
We make a deal for our promises.

412
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,035
Then, we both can't change our mind.

413
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:24,037
Done and no change for one hundred year.

414
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,283
I'll wait for you to
become the real No. 10.

415
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,816
Then, you should invite
me to see the World Cup.

416
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,952
No problem.

417
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,623
Sister, your hand is very cold.

418
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,762
I can't stand cold weather.

419
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,699
Then, you come close to my
body. I can stand the cold.

420
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,468
Feel warmer now?

421
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,701
Will you forget me? Fai.

422
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,811
No, when we leave the hospital,

423
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,738
you're still my sister
and I'm your brother.

424
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,382
Okay. We'll keep as it is

425
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,479
until we become old.

426
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,800
Please don't worry, we must try our best

427
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,194
to cure your child.

428
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,993
How can I not to worry?

429
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,305
Dr Lee, I'm his mum.

430
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,938
But I look like an idiot now,

431
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,904
I know nothing.

432
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,073
How's my son?

433
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,734
What will happen later on?

434
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,106
I don't know anything.
How can I not to worry?

435
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,578
Dr Lee, can you guarantee
to save my son's life?

436
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,115
I can't guarantee anything for you.

437
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,481
But you must believe me.

438
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,119
We'll try our very
best to cure your son.

439
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,019
This is our duty as
doctor, you understand?

440
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:45,956
Don't worry!

441
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,300
The dreadful haemophilia,
accordingly to my knowledge,

442
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,137
western medicine has a method
for the bone marrow transplant.

443
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,840
That's currently
considered to be better.

444
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,939
Having the experience of hospital life,

445
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,947
you'll know the abnormality
and weakness of life.

446
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,609
So many lovely children,

447
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,082
they still haven't
seem the future rainbow.

448
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,085
But they have to go through
this kind of torture.

449
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,998
My son is one of them.

450
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,691
A few months later,

451
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,163
we perhaps can't see them again.

452
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,507
My son is waiting for
the bone marrow matching.

453
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,705
By waiting for the coming
of a new life again.

454
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,443
As a mother,

455
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,179
I'm not able to give him a second one.

456
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,620
The only thing I can give him,

457
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,789
is to let him live happily
everyday for the rest of the days.

458
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,719
91; B92; B93; B94

459
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,831
95; B96; B97; B98

460
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,091
99; B100

461
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,359
It's great! Uncle Chan,
you broke the record!

462
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,672
102; B103; B105

463
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,009
Very good.

464
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,372
I've been very busy lately,

465
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,611
so I haven't got time to see you.

466
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:10,705
Where's Mum?

467
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,207
Mum has gone to hand in the scripts.

468
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,647
Uncle bought you a new
football. Do you like it?

469
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,619
Yes! Thank you!

470
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,984
Uncle, this ball is for adults.

471
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,087
No problem.

472
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,823
You wait until you leave the
hospital. I'll play with you.

473
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,856
Mum, Uncle Chan is here.

474
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,031
Kin Kao, why are you coming?

475
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,526
I specially take a day off

476
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,726
to see Fai.

477
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,037
Thank you.

478
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,406
Fai, it's late. I've to go now.

479
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,542
Goodbye Uncle Chan!

480
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,677
Goodbye! Hope you get well soon!

481
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,142
Thank you Uncle!

482
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,150
Kuen, there's one thing I
want to discuss with you.

483
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,446
Uncle Chan, don't forget
to wait for me to come out

484
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,712
and bring me to play football.

485
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:51,883
Alright!

486
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,585
Kuen,

487
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,824
this is our police's
colleague a little gratuity.

488
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:57,858
Hope that you'll accept.

489
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,753
Kin Kao, no...

490
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,829
I can't take this money.

491
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,623
No, I learn from my Mum.

492
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,528
Fai's medical fee is very expensive.

493
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,933
We've contributed about
ten thousand dollars.

494
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,531
It isn't a lot, hope you take it.

495
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,980
Kuen, Fai will be alright, don't worry.

496
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,113
Okay. It's late, I have to go.

497
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,817
Thank you, Kin Kao.

498
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,830
Today, I received an appreciative
letter from a little guy in Japan.

499
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,037
He said that he had recovered very well.

500
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,929
He can go home in one
to two month's time.

501
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,405
That's great.

502
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,605
He particularly wanted
to thanks for you.

503
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,045
For what?

504
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,537
Especially is to you.

505
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,036
And also Allen, the bone marrow donor.

506
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,547
You see, he also sent
us this pair of doll.

507
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,853
It's lovely! Very lovely!

508
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,785
Officer...

509
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,393
News just came from Shenyang that

510
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,858
they found a couple of right matches.

511
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:07,758
It's great! For who?

512
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,694
Luk Fai.

513
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,696
Who is the donor?

514
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,391
A lady called Wong Mei.

515
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,827
She is 32 years old and is a Librarian.

516
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,596
Good, very good. Yes.

517
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,466
But before it's confirmed,

518
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,505
don't tell the relatives
about this news.

519
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,243
Okay.

520
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,912
Donor's will is also a problem.

521
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,542
So, we've to contact the
other side immediately.

522
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,614
Okay.

523
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,849
SHEN YANG

524
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,392
How do you do, doctor.

525
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,721
I am Wong Mei.

526
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:39,691
Fine. I'm Lee Chung.

527
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,728
Fine, Dr Lee.

528
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,093
I can't imagine...
You're a pregnant woman.

529
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,362
Does it matter?

530
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,806
It's okay. I think to save a
person's life is more important.

531
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,533
Of course, it's a top priority
to save a person's life.

532
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,770
But both yourself and your child's
safety are also very important

533
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,675
Although there're examples of pregnant
women having bone marrow extraction.

534
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
However, if there's any possibility
causing harm to the baby,

535
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,676
we'd better try to avoid it.

536
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,379
We do appreciate you very much.

537
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,684
It's a pity that I can't help.

538
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,549
Thank you.

539
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,975
I learnt that Luk Fai
had a high temperature.

540
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,846
Luckily, he's okay.

541
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,116
For children who got
this kind of diseases

542
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,622
is really something cry one's heart out.

543
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,387
Sometimes,

544
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,591
I don't know whether
I can take it anymore.

545
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,236
Please let me cry now,

546
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,729
I have no more tears.

547
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,505
When facing this kind of thing,

548
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,942
we as mothers have no other choice.

549
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,675
We can only do our best.

550
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,180
So my advice to you, is to take it easy.

551
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
I went to see a Chinese
doctor a few days ago.

552
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,727
He persuaded me to make use of
the western medical treatment.

553
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,034
He said bone marrow transplant
method is the last resort.

554
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,738
You see Chinese medical
doctor also believes in it.

555
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,608
Is there any other alternative?

556
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,851
Now, I only know

557
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,922
Dr Lee is a very trust worth person.

558
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,620
He treats other people's children

559
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,062
like his own.

560
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,996
It's more than half a
year, if there's no him,

561
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,508
I'm afraid I can't last till today.

562
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,341
I do trust him.

563
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,843
If he can't even save Yin Yin...

564
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,677
I think this is fate.

565
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,989
So, for both of us,

566
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,626
only persistent.

567
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,829
Persistent is the only way.

568
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,900
Luckily,

569
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,305
Yin Yin is a very
mature kid in the family.

570
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,779
Sometimes, she even comfort me.

571
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,449
She said...

572
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,145
Mum, you have to hold on to it.

573
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,952
You must hold on.

574
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,251
It isn't easy to come to see a picture.

575
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,719
Can't you relax a bit?

576
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,822
Please put aside the
work for the time being.

577
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,997
Since there're still half an hour to go,

578
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,964
you wait here, I'll be ready soon.

579
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,595
But your Mum wanted
me to take care of you.

580
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:41,929
If you were tired to death,

581
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,604
what shall I tell your Mum?

582
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,772
I think you've done a good job.

583
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,068
No, have a rest first.

584
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,277
Have your eyes closed,

585
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,247
rest for a while.

586
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,541
Okay, then.

587
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,484
Happy Birthday!

588
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,152
You still remember my birthday!

589
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,953
Of course. I don't even remember myself.

590
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,452
It's very pretty!

591
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:07,864
Your heart...

592
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,995
all devoted to the Care Unit

593
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,796
I almost forgot.

594
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,300
How can it be?

595
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,596
It's very pretty, thank you!

596
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,877
Luk Fai's match!

597
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,236
This is no. 19 already!

598
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,404
Go back quickly!

599
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:27,713
But...

600
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,277
in that case, our film will be over.

601
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,417
See it next time.

602
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,853
TAITUNG PRISON

603
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,945
Are you Mr Ng Sung Yung?

604
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,013
Sorry, I've seen your information.

605
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,488
You born in 1959.

606
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,256
What's matter?

607
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,958
We sent you this flower.

608
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,457
Hope you can get out
from the prison soon!

609
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,202
I'm Suen Yan Yan

610
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,098
from the Care Unit of Taipei Hospital.

611
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,065
The things is

612
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,403
there is a boy from
Beijing, called Luk Fai.

613
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,474
He has haemophilia.

614
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,138
He probably can survive

615
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,380
for another half year.

616
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,348
This's why he needed the bone
marrow transplant urgently.

617
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,349
My bone marrow?

618
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,846
Yes, it was September 12 last year

619
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,851
Didn't you have the blood
donation at Kaohsiung?

620
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,748
You're very lucky!

621
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,487
There're so many people
have the blood donation.

622
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:44,992
But, the chance to match
successfully is slim.

623
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,055
For you,

624
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,289
you can even save a person's
life in such a short time.

625
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,860
So, you're really very lucky!

626
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,396
I really feel happy for you.

627
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,936
You shouldn't be happy too
early as I didn't say to donate.

628
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,070
Why?

629
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,068
You were volunteer for the blood
donation and wish to help people yourself.

630
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,938
That was at that time only.

631
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,133
I was able to go round
everywhere at that time.

632
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,643
I'd never expect.

633
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,310
Mr Ng, but...

634
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,313
So what? Shit!

635
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,242
In my life,

636
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,909
this was the first time in
jail of such poor condition!

637
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,648
I wanted to be a good man.

638
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,914
Also, my business was doing not bad.

639
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,723
He talked about things
which were ages ago.

640
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,894
Then, I was taken here somehow.

641
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,286
Mr Ng...

642
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,530
Mr Ng, would you please
consider it again?

643
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,832
There's no need to be unhappy.

644
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,237
How come?

645
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,041
At first, it was a pregnant woman.

646
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,945
Now, this guy is like that.

647
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,018
What can Luk Fai do?

648
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,721
There must be a way.

649
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,144
Is there any other way?

650
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,790
You should know how difficult
it is to get the right matching.

651
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,991
It's already not easy to get two so far.

652
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,429
But now the situation is like that.

653
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,858
It could be that Ng Sung
Yung, has been kept too long.

654
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,862
Thus, his mood is a bit change.

655
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,838
He probably will change
his mind later on.

656
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,441
I also don't know.

657
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,109
He only said to me he wanted
to be a good person at first,

658
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,673
but this society didn't
give him a chance.

659
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,772
Thus, he became a bad guy.

660
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,509
As he went for the blood
donation, it showed that...

661
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,449
he did wanted to help people.

662
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,419
He said that he donated
blood for running only.

663
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,028
So he didn't know what made
him donate blood originally.

664
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,127
Really?

665
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,593
Then, what can we do?

666
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,658
Try again.

667
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,066
I won't give it up.

668
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,540
I've spent so much money on you.

669
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,339
Lying ill in bed but who
would bring me medicine.

670
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,811
Hung Shun died but life remains alive.

671
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,881
Slaves... Ah... Slaves

672
00:44:51,689 --> 00:45:00,722
Worrying that arrows will
punch through your body

673
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:10,102
And your body buried no where

674
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,336
Great! Good!

675
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,610
Kids, be quiet.

676
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,542
I know, Auntie.

677
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,704
Good boy.

678
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,284
Thank you for coming to see me.

679
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:24,882
When can you be discharge?

680
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,090
Fai, where has your blood gone?

681
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,185
What does this mean?

682
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,852
All the adults have the
blood transfusion for you.

683
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:33,861
I don't need blood transfusion.

684
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,223
We also have to do the
blood transfusion for you.

685
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,729
Donate what? I wasn't injured.

686
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,503
You'd better ask your Mum.

687
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,369
Why are you touching my head?

688
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,272
Is it...

689
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,543
those who are bald will go to heaven.

690
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,748
What do you mean by going to heaven?

691
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,288
Silly guy, it means dead.

692
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,191
It can't be.

693
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,190
Will your hair shed?

694
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,293
Fai, do you have this disease?

695
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,030
What kind of disease have I got?

696
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,422
Didn't your Mum tell you?

697
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,863
But, I learnt from my Grandma,

698
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,696
yours is haemophilia
disease, a serious one.

699
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,703
It's cancer...

700
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,638
So, what can we do?

701
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,609
That's enough, let's go.

702
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,683
Good-bye, Fai!

703
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,116
See you tomorrow.

704
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,285
No...

705
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,486
I don't want to have my
head shaved. Please don't!

706
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,290
I don't want my hair to
get shed. I don't want it!

707
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:45,362
Please don't! I don't want
to have my head shaved...

708
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,571
Yung, you have to take it easy.

709
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,882
Our life have almost gone half way.

710
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,811
We've been going in and out
from the prison all the way.

711
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:10,256
Honestly, what a waste of our life!

712
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,726
People outside treat
us like waste material.

713
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:21,366
Our family have no one to respect them.

714
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,969
In the end, it's already too late.

715
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,112
We can't go back and
start all over again.

716
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,810
Why don't we do something meaningful?

717
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,479
At least this can relieve
your uneasy feelings inside.

718
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:42,983
You think about it.

719
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,693
If this kid without you,

720
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,261
he probably can't even
see the sun tomorrow.

721
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,532
Just assume that your
ancestor owed them.

722
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:02,937
If you don't speak it out

723
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,750
No one knows

724
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:15,892
Sometimes, it needs to air-out

725
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:23,257
A full chest of sorrow

726
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,067
Do you like swan?

727
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,476
Okay, and you?

728
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,008
Yes, I like.

729
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,713
I hope I can be the same as swan.

730
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:40,777
I can fly to the sky.

731
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,750
Then, I have no more
vaccinations and medicine.

732
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,720
But your Mum can't find you.

733
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,851
If I were there,

734
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,627
Mum didn't have to worry about me.

735
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,992
What sort of a place?

736
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,523
Place where swans go.

737
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,358
Can I go as well?

738
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,567
I don't know.

739
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,770
If you had the right
bone marrow matching,

740
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,734
you could stay with your Mum.

741
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,108
Can I go to see you?

742
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,681
No, you can't come back.

743
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,712
Is the place very far away?

744
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,750
It's just above there.

745
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,319
Above the blue sky.

746
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,221
Yin Yin, how do you feel? Yin Yin...

747
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,951
Yin Yin, what happen to you?

748
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,128
Yin Yin, wake up!

749
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,557
Yin Yin...

750
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,863
Yin Yin, wake up!

751
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,837
Yin Yin, wake up!

752
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,610
Yin Yin...

753
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,406
Help...

754
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,810
Help! Help!

755
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,578
Nurse!

756
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,384
Nurse, Yin Yin's fainted!

757
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,314
What happen?

758
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,322
Yin Yin has fainted!

759
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,395
Auntie, has Yin Yin passed away?

760
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,378
Auntie, will I be the same as Yin Yin?

761
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,910
Once I became bald, I'd go
to a very far away place.

762
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,411
Auntie, don't cry.

763
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:06,685
Yin Yin said there was no need to cry.

764
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,718
What else did she tell you?

765
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,898
She would go to a place
where she could dance everyday

766
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,624
and wouldn't get sick.

767
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,628
So, you shouldn't cry.

768
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,404
Auntie...

769
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,200
Auntie, don't worry.

770
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,910
I'll go to see her.

771
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,822
Grandpa...

772
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:22,293
Grandpa, you'd better
hold up you thumb quickly.

773
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:29,136
Grandpa, this might be
the last time I help you.

774
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,873
Grandpa, don't worry.

775
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,003
Mum will help you in the future.

776
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,242
Grandpa, I've to go.

777
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,747
You know, I got a very serious illness

778
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,681
and soon will get bald.

779
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,487
Then, I'll go to another
place same as Yin Yin.

780
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,155
Grandpa, I don't want
to go to the hospital.

781
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,964
I'm scare. I've to hide myself.

782
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,533
Grandpa, please don't tell Mum.

783
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:02,937
I have to hide myself.

784
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,306
So, they can't take me away.

785
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,451
Mum

786
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,990
Why were you running out
from the hospital secretly?

787
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,557
I miss Grandpa. I don't want
to go back to the hospital.

788
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,137
But your illness hasn't been cured yet.

789
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,529
I'm not ill.

790
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,442
Let's wait for the medical result first.

791
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,042
You still haven't
finished the checking up.

792
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,518
Please hold on for a few more days.

793
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,113
Only a few more days, okay?

794
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:58,559
Mum, I don't want to have
my head shaved. I'm scare.

795
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,156
Shave your head?

796
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,261
Who said that?

797
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,727
Yin Yin shaved hers.

798
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,995
Then, she died afterwards.

799
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,236
Don't talk nonsense!

800
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:10,701
Again,

801
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,603
Mum won't allow them to shave your head.

802
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,334
Yin Yin's mum was saying the same thing.

803
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,779
But she had the head shaved at last

804
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,148
and died.

805
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,842
You both aren't the same, Fai!

806
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,043
We are the same!

807
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,545
I know I have haemophilia.

808
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,485
Soon, I'll die same as Yin Yin.

809
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:31,993
Fai...

810
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,529
You don't have to
deny. I know everything.

811
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:39,857
Fai...

812
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,468
Mum didn't want to deny it.

813
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,333
I only think that you're too young.

814
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:46,572
You may not understand.

815
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,975
In fact, you need not to worry.

816
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,472
For your illness, it's because...

817
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,911
there're some unhealthy
thing inside your blood.

818
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,681
Thus, your bone marrow can't
produce any healthy blood.

819
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,615
But this is not important.

820
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,956
As the doctor said, once you'd
the bone marrow transplanted,

821
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,489
you'll be alright.

822
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:03,822
I don't believe!

823
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,593
I don't want to go back to the hospital!

824
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,225
Fai, why are you being
not understanding?

825
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,294
Now, there's a man in Taiwan who
donates his bone marrow to you.

826
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,363
If you do run away, how
can they cure your illness?

827
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,365
My illness is incurable!

828
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,601
Mum, I beg you.

829
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,237
I don't want to go back
to the hospital. I'm scare.

830
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,402
Grandpa, protect me!

831
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,443
Fai, you're the best.

832
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,781
Good boy, Fai...

833
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,251
don't run away, come back.

834
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,684
You come back and listen to me.

835
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,116
Come back...

836
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,349
We're all working hard on
this. I'm not going back; K

837
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:40,223
You can't be like that,
listen to me, Fai...

838
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,050
You look at me.

839
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,524
You look at me, Fai.

840
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,695
You tell me.

841
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,061
Have Mum ever cheated you?

842
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,703
I know very well how you feel...

843
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,235
I know how scare in your heart.

844
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,140
Mum is also very frighten.

845
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:33,913
Do you know?

846
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:37,352
I always think you're
the man in the family.

847
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,087
No matter what will happen.

848
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,292
We handle it together, aren't we?

849
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,129
Now you have this illness.

850
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,992
I know how hard your feel.

851
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,600
Mum feels the same way, Fai.

852
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,138
But, we need to handle it together.

853
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,535
I know, you won't leave me alone.

854
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,741
You won't let me alone to face it,

855
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,244
right?

856
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,518
Fai, don't you want to
become a football star?

857
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,455
You must hold on to it!

858
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,360
If you gave it up now,

859
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,626
Mum would look down upon you.

860
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,530
Mum, can I still play football?

861
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,063
Of course!

862
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,070
Do you know? If the donor's bone marrow

863
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,898
can fit into your body.

864
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,709
Your illness can be cured and you
can also play football afterwards.

865
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,278
Fai, you have to trust yourself and Mum.

866
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,582
Mum, I won't run away.

867
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,747
I want to cure my illness with you.

868
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,020
Because I want to play football.

869
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,293
Mum, don't cry.

870
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,423
In fact, I don't want to go.

871
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,892
I miss you and Grandpa.

872
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,843
TAITUNG AIRPORT

873
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,532
TAIPEI SUNG SHAN AIRPORT

874
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,830
It seems nothing can hold you back.

875
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,671
Don't give up anything.

876
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,050
Thank you, Mr Ng.

877
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,188
Thank you.

878
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,952
This is Dr Kao who will
do the operation for you.

879
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,130
Very handsome!

880
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:02,058
Thanks!

881
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,094
Please sit.

882
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,458
Why?

883
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,062
It's because you're our Joss.

884
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:09,197
Joss?

885
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:10,535
No need.

886
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,632
I'm alright.

887
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,871
It's okay, Mr Ng, please.

888
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,746
What do you really want?

889
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,576
My son is a good person.

890
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,982
Why are you cheating him?

891
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,345
Why were you calling him to
extract his the bone marrow?

892
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,856
I do think you are a good guy.

893
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,714
Why don't you find a proper job?

894
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,425
You come to cheat my son instead.

895
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:32,691
No, Auntie.

896
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,429
Bone marrow extraction won't
do any harm to the body.

897
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,667
The new bone marrow
will soon grow again.

898
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:40,994
You're talking rubbish!

899
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,731
You think it's as easy as water tap

900
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,735
to turn it on and off for water.

901
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,205
That's good.

902
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,670
Since you're in charge, why
don't you come & join him?

903
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:50,913
Don't do it, let's go.

904
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:52,981
Me?

905
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,675
What? Let's go!

906
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:55,576
You scare?

907
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,079
It's not that simple as you think!

908
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:00,249
Go!

909
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:02,049
Mum

910
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,856
Yung

911
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,060
I told you not to come.

912
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,720
Were you force to come?

913
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,701
Yung, isn't it something wrong with
your brain being too long in the prison?

914
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,037
Don't you know that

915
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,805
bone marrow extraction doesn't work!

916
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,699
Mum, it should be alright.

917
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,343
Why are you making a fuss?

918
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,544
Auntie, there's nothing to worry.

919
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,975
Give bone marrow is just the same
as blood transfusion. Very safe.

920
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,374
Yes, don't worry. I am a doctor.

921
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,109
I can guarantee that you it'll be fine.

922
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,054
Yes, he is the officer in charge
of the blood and oncology section.

923
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,246
He is...

924
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,654
Since you're a doctor,
you should save people.

925
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,123
Why don't you extract
yours but my son instead?

926
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,223
Donating bone marrow must have
the genes matched each other.

927
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,227
If it doesn't fit,
the donation is wasted.

928
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,598
Who are you trying to deceive? No way!

929
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:47,463
Mum

930
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,036
Mum...

931
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,568
Yung

932
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,239
You used to say to me to be a good son,

933
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,278
and required me to respect others.

934
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,611
But I've been doing
bad things all the way.

935
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,313
Also, I was in and out
the prison all the time.

936
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,653
Mum, from today's onwards,

937
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,691
please let me start my
new life again, alright?

938
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,553
I beg you and let me do one good thing.

939
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:26,540
Thank you!

940
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,248
Starting from today,

941
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,884
bone marrow transplant
is starting the countdown.

942
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,017
Tomorrow,

943
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,285
we'll start non-destructive
therapy on Luk Fai.

944
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,389
All the cancer cells in his
body will be killed gradually.

945
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,530
Then, we can wait for the transplant
of the healthy bone marrow.

946
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,166
If the donor can't supply
the bone marrow in time,

947
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,366
or there's any accident
happened during the delivery.

948
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,237
The patient will die undoubtedly.

949
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,802
Luk Fai will not be able to walk
out the non-bacteria room alive.

950
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,577
Fai, don't be afraid.

951
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,470
We should all know,

952
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,206
bone marrow can only keep for 24 hours.

953
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,638
Especially this time,

954
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,472
the bone marrow has to
deliver from Taipei to Beijing.

955
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,808
In addition, the journey
is not direct and far away.

956
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,520
So, we've to plan it properly this time.

957
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,584
Absolutely no mistake is allowed.

958
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:11,229
Mum, don't worry. I can hold on to it.

959
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,266
Don't worry.

960
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,309
Mum, can you promise me one thing?

961
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:22,809
Sure.

962
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,353
I want a genuine
No. 10 Football T-shirt.

963
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,657
When I finished this treatment,

964
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,288
I can put on the new Football T-shirt.

965
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,456
Okay.

966
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:43,294
Fai, Mum loves you.

967
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,634
I love you too, Mum.

968
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,160
This is no. 19 already.

969
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,173
There's only one left,
then you will have to...

970
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:19,773
marry me.

971
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,409
You can't deny.

972
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:26,980
Work hard!

973
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,210
Work hard!

974
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:32,646
Dr Kao.

975
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,224
Thanks for the hard work. Thanks.

976
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,920
Mr Ng, how do you feel? Alright?

977
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:44,127
Dr Kao.

978
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,058
Are you nervous?

979
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,662
After I've seen all these,

980
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:48,062
it's really a bit nervous.

981
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,903
Don't worry, it should be o. k.

982
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:51,400
Start anaesthesia

983
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,046
Dr Kao

984
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:03,543
What's the matter?

985
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:07,515
I want you to do me a favor.

986
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,852
Please say.

987
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:13,788
Can I refuse to take
aesthetic injection?

988
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,187
Why?

989
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,732
It's very painful.

990
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,964
It needs over 100 injections.

991
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,372
I did so many bad things before,

992
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,536
I want to take this
chance to mitigate my sin.

993
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,048
But this is against the regulation.

994
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,145
I know. Thus, I ask you for a favor.

995
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,918
Today is so special.

996
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,519
This is the date that
I'll start a new life.

997
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,856
I'd like Dr Kao to give me a chance.

998
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,029
Dr Kao, please give me a chance.

999
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,569
Okay. I give you an
injection to see how it goes.

1000
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,005
If you can't stand it, I'll
give you aesthetic injection.

1001
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,439
Thanks!

1002
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,201
The second one.

1003
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:09,684
Dr Kao

1004
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,117
What?

1005
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,182
Isn't it very painful?

1006
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,482
Yes. Yes?

1007
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,351
Are you alright?

1008
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:16,988
A little bit nervous.

1009
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,122
Listen to the music and relax a bit.

1010
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,122
Okay...

1011
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,196
I still haven't vaccinated yet.

1012
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:27,666
Relax a bit more.

1013
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,367
No, Dr Kao...

1014
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,740
Dr Kao, why are you shaking?

1015
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,776
Everybody be careful,
there's an earthquake.

1016
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,190
Don't panic! Protect the patients!

1017
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:33,434
Dr Kao,

1018
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,899
is your needle inside the bottom?

1019
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,498
It's taken out already, don't worry.

1020
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,067
Everybody has to be calm.

1021
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,771
Once the electricity is resume,
we'll carry on the operation.

1022
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,074
If we can't send out
the bone marrow today,

1023
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,143
we can't save the kid Luk Fai in China.

1024
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:46,672
We carry on if it's ready.

1025
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,441
You okay?

1026
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,552
Will there be any danger?

1027
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,910
No, don't worry.

1028
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,783
On the safe side,

1029
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,549
shall I give you an
aesthetic injection, okay?

1030
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,750
Okay...

1031
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:00,526
Check the instrument.

1032
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,731
Be careful! There's some aftershock!

1033
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,963
Relax, don't panic.

1034
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,234
It'll soon over.

1035
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:11,832
Great!

1036
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:19,406
Okay.

1037
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,782
There's an earthquake with a
magnitude of 6.3 scale in Taiwan area.

1038
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:23,775
The core of the earthquake is 10.8 km

1039
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,319
from the east station
of Miao Li San Yi Centre.

1040
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,021
Depth is 23.4 km.

1041
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,618
At this moment, due to the earthquake,

1042
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,017
all the roads traffic
are seriously affected.

1043
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,986
Every section of the highways
has been seriously paralyzed.

1044
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,897
Telecommunication is also badly hit.

1045
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,429
Moreover, most of us do concern about

1046
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,432
the bone marrow extraction
operation at the Taipei hospital.

1047
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,228
It's also affected by this
sudden serious earthquake.

1048
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:44,266
...to confirm the result.

1049
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,908
The receivers of the bone
marrow is someone called Luk Fai.

1050
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,700
He is 8 years old from Beijing.

1051
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,008
In other words,

1052
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,337
the delivery of bone marrow
will be another scene of

1053
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,846
long journey transportation and rush.

1054
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:12,658
Have you found Bon?

1055
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,325
Not yet. There's no signal.

1056
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:15,704
But he has set off earlier.

1057
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,098
He should have arrived
the airport before us.

1058
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,339
Everything is in a mess
after the earthquake.

1059
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,039
Hope everything goes well.

1060
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:23,774
It's because of the earthquake,

1061
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,777
all the main roads and
traffic are running into chaos

1062
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:26,843
and congestion.

1063
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,477
For the air traffic,

1064
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,979
all the flights are maintaining the
normal schedules for the time being.

1065
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,844
This is the report for the moment.

1066
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,179
God, it's too bad!

1067
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,788
What shall we do?

1068
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,255
We ring up Bon and say
that we'll a bit late.

1069
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,361
I've kept ringing him
but can't get through.

1070
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,206
Excuse me.

1071
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,470
Are there any flights to Hong Kong

1072
01:11:58,747 --> 01:11:59,679
after 5 pm?

1073
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,684
Mum, I feel very painful.

1074
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,663
Fai, be good.

1075
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,860
Just give a bit more patient,
Uncle will soon be here.

1076
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:23,895
Mum

1077
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,604
I want to wear my new football T-shirt.

1078
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:31,968
Let me think about it.

1079
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,194
Please.

1080
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,563
Alright.

1081
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,324
Fai, do you know why Mum

1082
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,696
bought you such large size?

1083
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,174
It's because when you grow up,

1084
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,707
you can still wear it.

1085
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,636
So, you don't have to
ask me get you a new one.

1086
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,544
Mum, you're so stingy.

1087
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,882
Mum, can I wait till...

1088
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,156
the day to put on this
new football T-shirt.

1089
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,454
Of course.

1090
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:22,788
On that day,

1091
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,796
Mum and Grandpa will go
to see your match too.

1092
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,135
Fai, you have to hold on to it.

1093
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,131
Don't let your Mum down, okay?

1094
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:32,998
Mum

1095
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,659
Chi Yuen, we can't move as
it's block at the far end.

1096
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,595
Would it be the earthquake
damaged the road?

1097
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,325
I go and have a look.

1098
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:01,865
How's it?

1099
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,502
It looks like there was an accident.

1100
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:04,330
Really?

1101
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,468
Very serious.

1102
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,741
Is there any other road?

1103
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:07,534
I've a look.

1104
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:08,741
Come back quickly!

1105
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:17,609
I am a doctor, can I help?

1106
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,616
Good, inside there...

1107
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,087
Don't touch her...

1108
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,419
I am a doctor, excuse me.

1109
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:35,600
Her breath and pulse are stop.

1110
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,329
Nurse...

1111
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,406
This patient needed
emergency treatment, quickly!

1112
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:40,972
Carry her out first!

1113
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:44,909
Be careful, stretcher...

1114
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:46,880
Stretcher...

1115
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,575
Quick, help her for emergency treatment!

1116
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,463
Don't move the patient.

1117
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,821
His leg might have a fracture,
help him to fix it in position.

1118
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,025
How's it? Can you move?

1119
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:16,138
Telephone can't get through
because of the earthquake.

1120
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:20,381
Are you alright? Where is the pain?

1121
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,247
Leg... My leg hurts!

1122
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,787
Hello, Bon.

1123
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,017
I couldn't get through
your telephone at all.

1124
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,688
My God, where are you?

1125
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,250
Can you move?

1126
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,095
I don't know where we are.

1127
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:37,560
You don't know?

1128
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,595
What do you mean by you don't know?

1129
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,235
How can one don't know where one is?

1130
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:43,394
No, there was a traffic
accident ahead of us.

1131
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,629
Chi Yuen is helping to save people.

1132
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:49,801
It should be alright, be careful.

1133
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,172
My daughter? Where's my daughter?

1134
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:55,874
Is she okay?

1135
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:56,779
All yours.

1136
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,748
Okay.

1137
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,288
Dr Kao must have forgotten the time.

1138
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,085
Ms Suen, do you mind to hurry up a bit?

1139
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,221
If we can't catch the plane
at 5 p. M to Hong Kong,

1140
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,961
then we certainly can't
catch the one at 7:50 p. m.

1141
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,859
The last flight from
Hong Kong to Beijing.

1142
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,124
Then, we're screwed!

1143
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,526
I know! I know!

1144
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:13,829
Okay, bye!

1145
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,476
Chi Yuen!

1146
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:27,678
Chi Yuen!

1147
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:30,907
Chi Yuen, alright?

1148
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:32,344
You get on first...

1149
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:33,755
I've already contacted with Bon.

1150
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,478
He said that

1151
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,556
if we couldn't make it in
30 minutes to the airport,

1152
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:39,751
we won't be able to catch the
last flight to Beijing at 7:50 p. m.

1153
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:40,417
Excuse me.

1154
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:41,653
Are you listening?

1155
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,489
No problem, go round the lanes.

1156
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,000
Was that man okay?

1157
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,434
He hurt his chest.

1158
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,999
Life should be no danger.

1159
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,567
You really want to go with the driver?

1160
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,335
If we made a mistake, it'll be finished.

1161
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:57,640
The driver should know
the routes very well.

1162
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,943
Also, we have no other choice.

1163
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:01,549
Time is running out.

1164
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:08,112
What is the matter?

1165
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,516
Which is the right route to the airport?

1166
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,283
Listen to me, I'm so sure.

1167
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,893
I go the airport everyday.

1168
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,856
There's a chimney in
the front, can't you see?

1169
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,064
Then, turn right.

1170
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,391
Thank you! Thank you!

1171
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,696
The earthquake has
just over, be careful!

1172
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,205
Watch out!

1173
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,311
Oh no!

1174
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:38,914
I'll go and shove it.

1175
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,180
Give way Brother Cow!

1176
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,924
We're in a hurry, don't come over...

1177
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,695
Go over there, quick...

1178
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,289
That's it. Don't come out.

1179
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:56,762
Its head is blocking the way.

1180
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,929
No problem, I'll watch out.

1181
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,473
Go away, go away.

1182
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,509
Don't come over here.

1183
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,202
Are you sure this is correct?

1184
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:32,469
Should be correct.

1185
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:33,668
But, I think...

1186
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,867
I think there's no roads in the front.

1187
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,445
This is a property road and it
should be connecting to outside.

1188
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,438
How soon shall we arrive?

1189
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,415
It's only 15 minutes left.

1190
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:45,752
We may not be able to make it.

1191
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:56,159
Sit still!

1192
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:01,731
There's no road...

1193
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:10,302
The bridge is broken, what shall we do?

1194
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:12,480
Drive over it, be careful!

1195
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:28,453
Be careful!

1196
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,005
My hand seems to be dislocated.

1197
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,484
Incredible... the bend
starts with the slant.

1198
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:55,348
Yan Yan!

1199
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,281
I can't open the door!

1200
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,324
You try my side.

1201
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:04,195
You okay?

1202
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,060
Bone marrow... One pack is missing!

1203
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:09,932
How come it's missing?

1204
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:10,862
I don't know.

1205
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:21,475
Finished... what can we do?

1206
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,242
It's over there!

1207
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,732
Driver, do you mind to go a bit fast!

1208
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,500
Thanks for your help. We're in a hurry.

1209
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,372
TAIPEI CKS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

1210
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,136
Bon, quick!

1211
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:47,971
Quick!

1212
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,736
What happened to you?

1213
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:51,745
Let's go inside first.
Can we still make it?

1214
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,947
There's a flight to Hong
Kong in 40 minutes later.

1215
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,945
The last flight from Hong
Kong to Beijing is impossible.

1216
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,945
Impossible! What shall be do?

1217
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,051
Don't panic. I've already
contacted with the Airline.

1218
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,320
There's still no news at the moment.

1219
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,881
You'd better go and check.

1220
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,255
Okay. You wait and I go and ask again.

1221
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,697
Ms... Excuse me.

1222
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,996
I've just explained to you
regarding that thing, how's it now?

1223
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,086
It's my fault.

1224
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,282
I only thought of the emergency
work and forgot the time.

1225
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:39,491
This ended up of this delay.

1226
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:43,158
If we couldn't catch the flight,
what would happen to Luk Fai?

1227
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,360
You shouldn't blame yourself.

1228
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:48,769
Under such situation,

1229
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:50,698
no one will turn a blind eye
and do nothing to save life.

1230
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,802
Also, there's still a chance.

1231
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,911
Aren't we still waiting for the news?

1232
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,547
Is your hand alright?

1233
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,391
The Dragon Air in H.K. Have
already known about the delivery

1234
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:22,034
of your bone marrow
business There's no problem.

1235
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:22,567
Okay?

1236
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:23,567
Okay.

1237
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:24,796

Quick... Get ready for boarding!

1240
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,312
The airline has already
contacted the H.K. Airport.

1241
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:32,036
They said

1242
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,238
the last flight of Dragon Air
is willing to wait for you.

1243
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,508
Really? It's great!

1244
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:39,915
What's it?

1245
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,091
It hurts very much...

1246
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,162
It hurts very much!

1247
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,102
What are you doing?

1248
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,510
You want me to go on board like this?

1249
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,215
This is...

1250
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,448
already 20 pieces of tie.

1251
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,320
Really?

1252
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,201
You can't deny.

1253
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,618

Congratulations! Luk Fai.

01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,429
Do you know who is this gentleman?

1262
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,341
He's the person who has
donated his bone marrow to you.

1263
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:58,911
Uncle!

1264
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:46,230
All bone marrow donations would not
do any harm to the person at all.
