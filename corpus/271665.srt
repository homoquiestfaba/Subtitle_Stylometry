1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You have a long time with the Company
Delta. A whole life, Charlie.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
17 missions in América Central,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
6 in the Medium East.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
4 in the Asian Southeast

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A true turn to the World.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A perfect record, from
the first day of training.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The perfect Soldier.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
"The works are always clean",
it is that that you/they say your superiors.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Any committed mission
in your register.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You know the cost to workout, to equip
and to maintain a soldier like you?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
756.000 dollars, Charlie.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It is a work life
for some people in this Country.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You were the defense and the support of thousands
that not even they know you.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We have in itself a great investment.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For where wants to begin?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For the beginning.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
- Good, I was born at a small town...
- No that I begin.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It is important that he/she understands because
he/she is here, Lieutenant.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Does he/she understand reason, not?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I have faith that the word correcta
it is "interrogation"

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And that more has faith?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That in the it equips Delta don't like
of the ones that they resign.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Because we didn't begin
for the I begin?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Me and the auxiliary shooter Curtis Bantree...

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it was attributed us a mission
to assure an area...

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
where would have room a sale
of foreign weapons

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ZEBISTAN, CLOSE TO TURKEY
TWO MONTHS BEFORE

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We had pictures of satellite of the place.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We arrived thirty six hours
before the sale.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We had aerial support
of a helicopter...

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and one equips in earth,
infiltrated in the sale...

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
two men and a woman.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Our work was to observe and to protect.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Supposedly, it was a routine work.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But he/she didn't leave how we waited.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What needs at this time
it is a big and cold mug of beer.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It will be the first thing that I will do
as soon as this finishes.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To hold on to an enormous piece
of ham "New York."

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
To light the old barbecue with firewood
own to burn, of the original.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You knew that the best place to find
is firewood to burn in New Mexico?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
New Mexico.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, there is nothing nor nobody there in low.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We are already here at the 34 hours, Charlie.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You think the pictures of Satellite
were correctas?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't see any sale of
missiles stolen for here.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They are there, only with the salesperson.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't see nothing else than powder.
But that know me.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you to think in giving up?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sometimes.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe get one of those works
stupid of office...

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
with a secretary and a computer.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh no, no, no, not.
Men like us...

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we are not office men,
we are not friends of the office.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You perfectly know.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The old ones veteran they say:
“never leave the work...

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
it doesn't import him/it all try to flee.”

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Such time could be the first.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I already lost some things
in this whole time, Curtis.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is your wife, not?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You know Charlie, he/she is always the wife,
he/she believes, I know.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Attention, ours arrived equips.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Charlie, I see two hidden,
to 274 meters of here...

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to northwest of the slope of that hill.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Understood.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It is here.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There is somebody that listens to me.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ready and to the wait.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are two hidden behind you,
in the rocks the about 37 meters.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ahead with the operation.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It is there the bad come.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you bring the money?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, I have him/it here.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He/she shows him/it.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That seems to be the leader.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He/she is complete.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you want to see the merchandise?

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can count four ugly.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Understood.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shit, she is of ours equips.
They have one of ours, Charlie.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The combat procedure is always
to kill the Officials first.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He/she is later the soldiers,
that knows me very well.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But this time was different.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who decided that you didn't proceed
the due procedure?

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I felt that the feminine member
he/she could be committed.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Was anybody to think to kill her?

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not on that moment.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It is then as it was that it determined
what was she in danger?

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That is my quality.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is badly, Charlie.
They are to mistreat the girl.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It is a shit.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Distance?

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
155 meters.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What devil is been to pass?

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Shit

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Charlie!

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is badly,
this is badly! Charlie.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Officials first, ok?
He/she makes him/it already...

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Officials first,
what devils...?

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My brother!

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of where see the shots?

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I waited for a long time!

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Anything of that is your fault, Charlie.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They knew the risk about working infiltrated.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There, on top of that mountain.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Shoot.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
"Angry A", "Angry A"... "Red Fox"
I need immediate transport home.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We are going in Charlie!

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:32,000
"Red fox", "Red Fox",
we go to I walk.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My brother.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Fa-los-ei to pay and I will use his/her money
for killing.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And it went home!

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Correcto.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bantree and me regressámos the
Los Angeles.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Where does his/her wife live?

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.
We are separated

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Lament.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What tells us respect, it is what happened
after the return.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know what happened.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Say-millstone in their own words.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I returned to Los Angeles...

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and it took me about two days
to contact my wife and children.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It is later notified my superiors
that he/she would give up the position.

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Park MacArthur
Los Angeles.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ei! My music is not free, did you know?

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Stupid!

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you think I make this for my health?

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:09,000
- Thank you very much and that God blesses you.
- To you also.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Dad!

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hello, my princess.
You are very well.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Dad, Sam said that it doesn't go
to take the small-lunch...

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I told him/her that he/she has,
it is not true?

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What does happen he/she?

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Today I don't want to go.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But reason?

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But you don't have to go,
we only go you and me.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sam?

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sam, have to go with your father.

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Lisa and Sam,
they will look for your things.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Go.

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
- Hello!
- Hello!

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Somebody called of your office
asking for you.

143
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He/she tells them please, that not
do call for here, ok?

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He/she is well.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You didn't tell them anything, you no longer
you live here, there are almost eight months.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes, he/she already told them, but I suppose
that you had a bad day.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I thought that of course
we would respect our space...

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
during the separation period.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am to try.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
How is it going the work?

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, thank you.
He/she hears, I have to go...

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
my boss has a presentation inside of
one hour and I need to have this in order.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Already it has been six months that I am in that place
and I seem still a beginner.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mammy, that is as it was when all
did we live together, in it is it true?

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No so much, my love.

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It goes and it takes your backpack, your father
he/she will drop you off at the school after the small-lunch.

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He/she is well.

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He/she never knew when you would return, Charlie...

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and I learned not caring,
but the children...

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There is one week behind,
Sam watched a war film…

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I woke up ace three of the morning and him
he/she was in my bed, to cry...

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and to say that you no longer you would return.

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But I returned.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And for how long?

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
One week, maybe two.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know.

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Will you give up again?
the last lasted two weeks.

168
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He/she hears Maggie, please.
All have decisions to take,

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and this, you already took her.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No Charlie,
you are that you took her.

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
- You seem me well.
- You also.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Dad, I am already ready.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Mammy, don't you want connosco to come?

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This time no, wanted.
Does everything bring?

175

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hello son, vitality.
He/she gives a hug to the mammy. See you later.

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hello! That surprise,

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
- Hello, Maysie.

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then, what will want?

182
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
- Wheat pancakes for all.
- There is no problem.

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
- As you are?
- Oh, you already know, well.

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
People buying the kiosk for
a coffee Gourmet with healthy food.

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
- Don't we want that, or do we want?
- Not.

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
- Uncle Donnie!
- Hello.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
- As it was?
- We spoke later.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
- Do you want to take the small-lunch connosco?
- We will eat wheat pancakes.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
- Wheat pancakes!
- Yes.

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Who wanted to order you?

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Only a coffee.

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh yes, did you have a bad night?

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He/she gives me only a coffee, Maysie.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Right.

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sam is depressed.

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, I am not.

197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is there some problem, Sam?

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It is that I don't want that my dad
go again.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:15:17,000
- He/she has to work,
it is not true?

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you well?

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
- Small-lunch with me tomorrow?
- Clear, without lack.

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He/she was to think that this weekend
could we go to the coast, that you/they find?

203
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Also with the mammy?

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know, it can be that the mammy
be very busy.

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I know boys, I know...

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He/she looks, your mother and I have a pair
of things to get right...

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but that doesn't mean that
don't see again, ok?

208
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
- Already in I want him/it you to go again.
- Sam are not rude, somebody can see us.

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Already go, the school will begin,

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will be here to your wait
when do they leave, is it well?

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He/she gives me a kiss.

212
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That is my place.
Leave.

213
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Do excuse?

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Disappear.

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Forgive his/her majesty.

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He/she is going you.

217
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, no, hey...
It is destroyed.

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He/she is not to work.

219
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No, I was awaiting 15 to 20 minutes...

220
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was so much hungry that I had
that to buy a cold.

221
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Please, let to help me her.

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You you are Snow, it is not true?

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes.

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
My God, I am friend of the
his/her husband, Charlie...

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
combinámos to take the small-lunch,
but something happened in the...

226
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
in the school, with Sammy and small Lisa.

227
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How? With Sam and Lisa?

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
- Yes, something happened.
- What did happen?

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Look, park his/her car and come with me,
my car is there, we are going in him.

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:18:00,000
- It puts you in the car.
- We go, we go...

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
- You made a mistake in the person.
- It shuts up and he/she will run everything well.

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You cannot crawl for the streets
like this without further ado.

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That is America,
this happens everyday.

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The hunt is to begin, my friends.

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Vain.

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The bear is in movement.

237
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
For the time being we have the mammy Ursa and
fast we will have the small bears also.

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That will do with that the dad Bear
come to have connosco.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And he/she reminds you, this is a city
very big and our Bear...

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
he/she has friends that we cannot see.

241
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We have to check that no the
find until that the hunt finishes.

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How is our "Ursita?"

243
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:10,000
"Ursita" is ready.

244
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He/she is well Charlie, now the game
he/she comes to your own patio.

245
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hut of Curtis Bantree.

246
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hello beauty!

247
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Where do you go?

248
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He/she carries you well, be a good dog.
Will you be to take care of the Fort?

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you want him to swallow you a steak with bone?

250
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I adore you.

251
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
A steak and we will make a barbecue.

252
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Where do you go?

253
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You cannot come, you have to be to take care of the Fort.

254
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Will you make that for me?
See you later.

255
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hello, he/she is Curtis, I am not home,
please leave his/her message.

256
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
- Hello?
- Specialist Delta, Curtis Braintree?

257
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Bantree.
Am I to speak with...?

258
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Excuse me, the American names
they are difficult to pronounce.

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes, clear.
What can make for itself?

260
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No. Is best it what can me to do for itself?

261
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hear, I give him/her 5 seconds before it hangs him/it.

262
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Five seconds, it is what need.

263
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He/she is well, then what is that
can you do for me?

264
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can assure him/her that you
he/she is a person died.

265
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Am I? Because thank you very much for the warning.
See you later then.

266
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Good-bye.

267
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
As if it felt to the knowledge of the
"end" of Sergeant Bantree?

268
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
"End?"
That is a good word!

269
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
"End", "neutralization",
"extermination", "fire friend"...

270
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
that other one is also good.
"Secret", "illegal Chuis"...

271
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You have an Agency that only
they can publish this parts of speech.

272
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and they still call everything
this "a circus."

273
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
- Military rules.
- I know the rules.

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Then answer to my question.

275
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
How did I feel?
My priority is my family...

276
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
my wife and my children.

277
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And how they see,
Curtis was as of the family.

278
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Thank you!

279
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Say!
Mister...

280
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It is for itself.

281
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
- Yes!
- Good days, Charlie.

282
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
With who I do speak?

283
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
An old enemy.

284
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, yes? Which?
What is that you want?

285
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I want you, Charlie.

286
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Then because you don't leave
from where are to see yourself.

287
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Because that is not the way as you do,
it is not?

288
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know than you are me to speak.

289
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Somebody wants to speak with you,
Charlie.

290
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Charlie, helps me!

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Everything will turn out right, love.

292
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Now that I have your attention...

293
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Who are you?

294
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Ok Charlie, these are the rules...

295
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
First I will kill you,
as you killed my brother and to my men.

296
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Here and in front of all!

297
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
In my Country, when
we hunted a Bear...

298
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
we didn't kill him/it there same,
we give him/her the opportunity to escape.

299
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I want that you run, Charlie.
I want you to think in as it will be your death.

300
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I want you to be afraid of dying and not
to know nor when nor where.

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is only more other day for me, friend.

302
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
He/she thinks about your family, Charlie.

303
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You are a dead man,
only that you still don't know him/it.

304
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You arrived late, I already have them in my power.
It silences you and he/she listens.

305
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Leaning that could kill my brother
and to my men...

306
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and to return to your Country, without further ado,
as if everything was forgotten.

307
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No Charlie.
This time you won't forget...

308
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
this time the war came home with you.

309
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You remember the park, the girl to sing
and the veteran of war?

310
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I have something there for you...
some flowers...

311
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
if you get to arrive,
you can save them.

312
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And he/she reminds you, Charlie...

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If you talk to somebody about this,
one polices, to the woman, to any one!...

314
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
… they will die,
no you Charlie, them.

315
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
As he/she said, Charlie.
There are rules in this.

316
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He/she sees the light post in front,
the globe is…

317
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:47,000
it is more or less the size
of your head.

318
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And he/she reminds you, if you speak with
somebody they will die.

319
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:19,000
As your family, Charlie.

320
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Then you contacted the "administration"
without authorization.

321
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I did what had to do.

322
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The first contact in a situation like this,
he/she is his/her Commander.

323
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Nolan was the only on whom
he/she could trust on that moment.

324
00:27:33,000 --> 00:28:07,000
To notify, to improvise, to use.
Basic rules of training.

325
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Company of Samuel and Siblings.

326
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Maggie Johnson please.

327
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Lament, you Johnson still didn't arrive...

328
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Please introduce his/her identification.

329
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Please wait.

330
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
National agency of Safety.
Center of Communications for Satellite.

331
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Hello Charlie,
How are you, my brother?

332
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He/she hears, you have to tell me,
how was the climate in the coast This?

333
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
- Nolan!
- I am I and unmarried woman.

334
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
How is that of you leave us?

335
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What does happen he/she, my brother?
No longer you like to travel?

336
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
- He/she hears me with a lot of attention.
- This well, I hear you.

337
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
They discovered me.

338
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That you speak?
Charlie, that is impossible.

339
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Nobody can see your file..

340
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Because somebody made him/it.
There is a, maybe two or three...

341
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and they are professional.

342
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I believe, your word is enough for me.

343
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He/she is well. I have been covering you,
he/she tells me just the one that I have do.

344
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I want you to find
Maggie and the children.

345
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
They said that you/they had them
but I want to have the certainty.

346
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
- It verifies the old address.
- It is well.

347
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I have to my front, all
the numbers that I need, now listen...

348
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
he/she tells me from where are and I send you two agents
before you place the telephone.

349
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
No, now he/she listens to me...
don't say anybody.

350
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That shit speeches, Charlie?
You cannot make this alone,

351
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you want him to remind you of the
rules of the house?

352
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Now, he/she waits there and I will send you two agents
the fastest that it can..

353
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't forget that you are just a civilian.

354
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He/she leaves me just to do you a report.

355
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, they said that if they saw somebody
to help me, they matá-los-went.

356
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That means, that nobody can help myself.
That is only between you and me.

357
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You and me?
Char...

358
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Charlie, both we can enter
in serious problems, do you know?

359
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
On the other hand, my area supervisor is
to arrange an excuse to order me for…

360
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the "manuseamento of files" and
I don't belong to that.

361
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh, what is,
without value there is no glory.

362
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
As he/she told you, I cover your backs
but, you are without protecção...

363
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
in other words, as besides I can do
to meet.

364
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I still don't know.

365
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I need that find
Curtis also...

366
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I have a bad premonition
concerning this.

367
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Charlie, are you there?
Charlie?

368
00:30:17,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now our Bear
he/she begins to run.

369
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Linda woman,
you won't be any problem.

370
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't play me.

371
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You have to be quiet except
I will make to remain silent.

372
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
He/she stole my telephone!
He/she stole my telephone!

373
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I have a robbery in the park, a telemóvel.
Suspect escaped among them hoist,

374
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and it is going in the direcção This,
I need the Police of Los Angeles.

375
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Attention the all of the units of the park,
he/she looks for of a suspect,

376
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Caucasian, 1.82 meters, 87 kilos.
Telemóvel robbery.

377
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He/she is careful Charlie.

378
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Hello, I am me again.

379
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Charlie, I called the school,
your children are well,

380
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
but I didn't get to find Maggie.

381
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
- They have her.
- Oh my God.

382
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Don't worry, I will order
somebody to collect the children.

383
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Ok. It links me to Donovan,
he/she should be on some side of L.A.

384
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you to play? Charlie,
he is in the blacklist of the Agency.

385
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Therefore it is the only
on whom can trust.

386
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Reason?
You know what did in Balkans,

387
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
he/she had luck of not being in the list
of extermination of the Agency.

388
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, it is only to pass for
difficult times.

389
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Haul of that, he/she left does six months and
nobody knows where to find him/it,

390
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
besides if you want to find him/it.

391
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I know him/it, it seeks him/it in the coffee of the
Maysie downtown.

392
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Good, fortunately you know
where finding.

393
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We have past a lot of thing together.

394
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I violated a lot of
rules for that so-and-so.

395
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
- Nolan?
- It is well, it is well. No longer I speak about him.

396
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Did you hear some thing on Curtis?

397
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Not to the moment.
He/she still didn't answer to the telephone.

398
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
He/she hears, Charlie.
I have to tell you this.

399
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I am very nervous,
I don't know if I can make this alone.

400
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
He/she lets to call me for support.

401
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No.
What do have in the satellites?

402
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Because, not a lot, without one
official authorization.

403
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I don't have real time in video and only if
actualiza every 30 seconds, or more.

404
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because he owes a spy in some side
and somebody with Maggie.

405
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They should have three.

406
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Is it true that will do this alone, not?

407
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You will make the hero paper in this everything.

408
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Charlie, the world is full of heroes
but unhappily they are dead.

409
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You really want to end with
the list of those "finished."

410
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Nolan have to believe me...

411
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
they are suspected that somebody me
he/she is to help, they will kill her.

412
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
They want me.

413
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Charlie, maybe be the sobrestimar
this man.

414
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I want to say, up to now it has not been being able to
to do anything to you nor the children.

415
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
No!
This type is good.

416
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Only making his/her game and
he/she only wants to see me to run.

417
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And that is what I will do.

418
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Now, I will need a weapon.

419
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
He/she says Donovan to put in some
place, a HK-91.

420
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It is later can seek the spy,

421
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but they don't make anything until that you/they have mine
children in a safe place. Is he/she clear?

422
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
- It is well, you are the Boss.
- Well.

423
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
- Charlie?
- Wait.

424
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Is Charlie there?

425
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I believe that it is him to try to locate her/it me,
he/she tracks the telephones of the park and...

426
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
he/she seeks the location of this call.

427
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There is no problem.

428
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But he/she listens, I will need one minute
for finding, it maintains him/it in line.

429
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He/she is well.

430
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can see you of here, Charlie.

431
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then, it kills me.

432
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Cannot you see me, not?

433
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You can be to be seen.

434
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I refer to you.
I know that your spy can.

435
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It is a feather that you don't have
tomatoes for you kill me you even.

436
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I can do what want
and when I want,

437
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I can put an end to yours
life when he/she wants.

438
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Be not stupid, Charlie.
You only have to the sunset,

439
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
to find your family.
Maybe the “chu-chu” number a, help you.

440
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Wait.
Ei.

441
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
- Nolan?
- I am here.

442
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Do you have something?

443
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
- I have enough for an I track of voice.
- Well.

444
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Now discovers
who is that type.

445
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
He/she gave me other place! He/she mentioned "chu-chu."
I believe that he/she wanted to say the park of the convoy.

446
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
The telemóvel is to be without battery,
I need a radio and a weapon.

447
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Don't worry, they will be there.

448
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He/she listens, taken care outside, ok.
You don't have any support.

449
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't want that anything you happen,
did you understand?

450
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
He/she is well.

451
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Charlie? Charlie!
Damned you are, Charlie?

452
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
- What is to do?
- Mister.

453
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Stop.
You were to speak with somebody.

454
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes, it was to speak with mine
computer Charlie.

455
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Damned you are, Charlie.

456
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Where are you, Charlie?

457
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Do you see safety's guard?

458
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I suppose that we would meet here and us
it would take where it was the robbery of the telemóvel.

459
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This should be a case for
a simple patrol guard,

460
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
therefore they dress uniforms
and we dressed fact.

461
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The Headquarters asked us that us
we gathered with him here.

462
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It should be for here in some side.
Of all the forms will stretch out the muscles.

463
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
High, don't move.
It puts you down of belly..

464
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is not a good idea.

465
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You already heard me, he/she already said
it puts you down of belly.

466
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I am not able to, now he/she listens to me,
he/she is in serious danger.

467
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Belly down.

468
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
"Nick's"

469
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Donovan. Please.

470
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
He/she is your mother.

471
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes!

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Donovan, is Nolan.

473
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
He/she listens, Charlie's wife was
kidnapped and that is a tremendous situation,

474
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and he/she doesn't have any support.

475
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Hear, I know that already plenty time passed,
but we know that can help us.

476
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What was all this?

477
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I notified you Demmings, levá-la-ei
his/her class inside of one moment.

478
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I apologize for requesting so much
identification but...

479
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
he/she should understand that should be a lot
careful on these days.

480
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I need that me light ace children.

481
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Because, when I was at the school
he/she didn't need to worry for these things.

482
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh, his/her accent,
is it Russian?

483
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No, for anything.

484
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Here it is.
Mrs. Demmings!

485
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Where are the children?
Lisa and Sam?

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:07,000
- I end of giving to his/her uncle.
- To his/her uncle? Which uncle?

487
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Where do we go, Tio Donnie?

488
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I will take care of you for some instants,
is he/she well?

489
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That well!

490
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:28,000
- Do they want go greet Maysie?
- Yes.

491
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh shit. Now all will know.

492
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh Charlie!
The police walk to your search...

493
00:39:34,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you will find attention
even if don't want.

494
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:25,000
- I lost him/it.
- He/she finds him/it.

495
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
- Do they want something to eat?
- It is well.

496
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You are the sure that Charlie
did he/she tell you for you make this?

497
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Donnie, that happens?

498
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
If he/she tells you, he/she will have to kill you.

499
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Then, being like this
it is better not to ask.

500
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I will collect your father,
will you be well here?

501
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Do they want cookies with milk?

502
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Side This of the dam.
He/she is going crossing until in half.

503
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The wind approaches of the water
approximately to 6 us...

504
00:41:34,000 --> 00:42:10,000
some mil/pontos ahead.

505
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,000
He/she goes, it goes.
There it is where you are.

506
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:29,000
He/she is going from behind of the fence.

507
00:42:29,000 --> 00:43:17,000
How are you me to see?

508
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I already have him/it again. He/she is in...

509
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
He/she found the finder.

510
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You cannot lose him/it,
understood?

511
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He/she will already appear.

512
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
No, he knows this place very well,
you cannot lose him/it.

513
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You should do with that he/she appears in the place,
right now.

514
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
He/she could leave badly.
We should not try.

515
00:43:41,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I won't return you to say.
He/she orders him/it now.

516
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hello Donovan,
are you there?

517
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
- Yes.
- Where?

518
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
In the top of the park.

519
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, then I will facilitate you.

520
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The spy's last position was in it
limit of the park.

521
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
In the Northwest corner. I have two points
to blink in the thermal radar.

522
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The movement finder indicates that the
spy can be in an of the two places,

523
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The two close to the sniper.

524
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:37,000
- Are you the sure of that?
- Yes.

525
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Hello, friendly.
Do you have a cigarette?

526
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I don't smoke.
Is he/she well?

527
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yes.

528
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That emblem in your shoulder, is of the First of
Infantry-triangle Despert of Iron, not?

529
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because yes, yes, but that was and
that is now.

530
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:19,000
- How much is there walks in the streets?
- I woke up here this morning.

531
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Good days!

532
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
- Is it well?
- Yes, it is well.

533
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
- Is his/her friend?
- It is now.

534
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Clear.

535
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I noticed that you have accent.

536
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Ah!
Swiss.

537
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You know, "clocks cuckoo."

538
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Certain, " clocks cuckoo."

539
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Hello, where did it get this?
Is Turkish tobacco, it is not true?

540
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yevon does want to kill you...
your head's price is very good.

541
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Thank you my friend.

542
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
- Kaufer!
- Never again.

543
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Are you, Charlie?
slippery man.

544
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
There is a change of plans, Charlie.
He/she told you concerning the convoy,

545
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
but now you should be there inside of three
minutes, or the flowers leave.

546
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- Wait one second.
- Three minutes.

547
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Ei, ei. Damned you are,
he/she returns with my motorcycle.

548
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
For more how long
should we be here?

549
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Not for a lot.

550
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Is the dad well?

551
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Of course yes.

552
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Can you tell me?

553
00:48:10,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Your dad is well and
he/she will be soon here.

554
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
366 meters.
Winds to 2 us.

555
00:49:54,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Possibility of collateral damage.

556
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Here Feretti, the suspect of the robbery of the
telemóvel left the park.

557
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:43,000
He/she already has her, don't shoot.

558
00:51:43,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Well thought Donovan.

559
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
- Is yours?
- Yes.

560
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Then, because it hid him/it in the grass?

561
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
- It would be like this safer.
- No if he/she forgets.

562
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You are right.
Thank you, I will remember that for the close.

563
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
- Did you already find him/it?
- No, he/she still swims.

564
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This is still there in bass,
He/she finds him/it.

565
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:13,000
- It disappeared.
- He/she finds him/it.

566
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Hello, are you lost?

567
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I need that show me
the form of leaving of here.

568
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
"Now he/she reads", you have 20 dollars.

569
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
This place is enormous.

570
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Somebody as you can walk
to give turns during hours.

571
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
- Please, I need your help.
- Do you really walk with hurry, not?

572
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
- Are you going on the way to the office?
- Please.

573
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Do I know you, ah?

574
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You were the type that didn't give me nor
ten cents for my music.

575
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because now, I give you something,
then we are tied.

576
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Hello, do I sing very well, ok?
I participated...

577
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Forget.

578
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Wait one second.
Do both of us have problems, is it well?

579
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Now, it shows me the way of leaving
of here and we already separated.

580
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
In the box what is there?

581
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Problems.

582
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
The women have to live of something.

583
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The problems that I speak to you, you not even
you can imagine them.

584
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Now, I ask you once again,
do you show me the way of leaving of here?

585
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Please.
I am you to ask that you help me.

586
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
He/she loosens me.

587
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Excuse.

588
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
For here.

589
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
- Nolan?
- I hear you, Donovan.

590
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Do you listen something?

591
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I believe that you/they already have the package.
And you that have?

592
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Charlie was right,
there is one equips completes.

593
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Spy and sniper.

594
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Charlie thinks that has something to see
with his/her last work.

595
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
He/she waits, I am to receive
an information.

596
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I have the head office of confirmed voice.

597
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He/she is a called man Yevon Bodnar, and
I am to receive more information.

598
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Hello Donovan, listens this, Bodnar leads
a counterattack group...

599
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
with financial connections to unions of
several crimes in the...

600
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Medium East and in the This of Europe.

601
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Basically, he sells mercenaries
to the best request.

602
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
- Do you have a picture?
- He/she will already appear.

603
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:54,000
When will that be?

604
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That is the far away
that can take you.

605
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The river of Los Angeles is for beyond,
the freeway is above,

606
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And the city is in that direcção.
See you later.

607
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Wait one second.
One more favor.

608
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
He/she looks at this picture well.
He/she tells me if you recognize something.

609
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Something as the place where was removed.

610
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Who is?

611
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
My wife.

612
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It is very beautiful.

613
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
That he/she walks her to do her/it with a badameco
like you?

614
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I already asked me even
for many years.

615
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
This could be in any besiege.

616
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Will she be lost?

617
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No, they kidnapped her.

618
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
He/she looks, I don't want to wrap up
with something like that, ok?

619
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
- Are you a police?
- Not.

620
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That is something that I have that
to solve for me even.

621
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Do you have children?

622
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yes.
Two.

623
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Charlie, are you there?

624
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yes, ahead.

625
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
He/she hears Charlie,
I have, bad you announce.

626
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The police received a call from one
man that drove for "Canyon Road",

627
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and he/she saw Curtis' car fly in pieces.

628
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Charlie, I feel a lot, but
Curtis is dead.

629
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I am going to the war, take your
final positions.

630
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
- Charlie?
- Where are you?

631
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I found the damned, but I didn't get
to find the sniper.

632
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Where caralho are?

633
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Somewhere to the side
of the river of Los Angeles.

634
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
What shit is to do there?

635
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
They are to guide me, Donovan, I think if
they are to hide close to the river.

636
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That river runs during quilómetros.

637
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,000
They attracted me here.

638
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
- The spy left, and me also.
- It goes.

639
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
- Nolan?
- I am here and I think I know who is.

640
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Who is?

641
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,000
The name is Yevon Bodnar and you are right,
It is of the last work, the one of Zebistan.

642
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I don't know my brother, I find
that if it escaped you one.

643
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
He/she waits, I will have recognition
of the face inside of one seconds.

644
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Charlie, Bodnar is not a good boy, it is
a member of a paramilitary group,

645
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that he/she sells their services to the best price,
most groups of the Medium East.

646
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But he/she hears this, it was a bad boy in the
Chechénia because not even...

647
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
the Russians wanted to have
anything to see with him.

648
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
He/she seems it was part of one
illegal organization here us...

649
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
in the United States, but not
he/she has a lot to speak.

650
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Charlie, this type is a great terrorist
world, care with him.

651
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
There is no problem.

652
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Well, because we were already in a lot of ranch and me not
I am ready to get lost now.

653
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
He/she won't pass.
In the thermal radar what is there?

654
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Wait.
I already have him/it.

655
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It seems that there is a lot of heat beyond.

656
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It prepares you, because this is
to put very hot.

657
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Your husband seems that it still continues
with life, but...

658
00:59:25,000 --> 01:00:07,000
but that pity, soon more will be dead.

659
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
He/she is to enter in the park.

660
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Probably on the side This.

661
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Hello, the picture that showed me...
I know where it is.

662
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The where?

663
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
In the old prison, a little more above the river.

664
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
They closed her/it before me am born,
nobody returned her to use.

665
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That is a great help, thank you.

666
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:50,000
We go, I will show you.

667
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Two different shootings.
A busy day.

668
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
He/she doesn't fit,
I don't get to imagine.

669
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That type was murdered with his/her weapon
and this died for a squeeze from behind...

670
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
that it broke him/her the neck.
It is there is still the one of the park of the convoy.

671
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Then you think
all are linked.

672
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The park is very small
for so much coincidence.

673
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Ok, that it is to the to flee
our suspect?

674
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't know, but we will have
of stopping quickly.

675
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
What road do think he/she chose?
The mountains to our turn,

676
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
or it was underneath of the river.

677
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
He/she has to be for the river.

678
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Now yes, you are to think
Sherlock.

679
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I hope it is comfortable.

680
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
- It is going to the hell.
- I live there.

681
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It is now,
also you and Charlie.

682
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
He/she will never be able to leave of here.

683
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Actually, I could never understand the attitude
that the Americans have.

684
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The bravery, or maybe stupidity...
when they are against the wall...

685
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and without place where to go,
because they don't give up?

686
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Because we are correctos.

687
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Ah! But clear,

688
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
the divine right of America of saying to the
world as they should live.

689
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Because you have 200 cereals for the
small-lunch in the supermarket,

690
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
do they think that we needed that?

691
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:27,000
He/she hears me.
No longer they can continue us to ignore.

692
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
His/her husband soon will be here
prontinho for to save,

693
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
as in all the films
of Hollywood,

694
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
but this will finish a little different.

695
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,000
he/she won't save her nor you to him.
You will lose.

696
01:02:46,000 --> 01:03:00,000
This time, the bad will win.

697
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
It is exactly up there.

698
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
- Donovan?
- Yes.

699
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You know the old prison
that it is beside the river.

700
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yes, I will give a view of eyes.

701
01:03:13,000 --> 01:04:30,000
- I will enter.
- It protects the backs.

702
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Nolan?

703
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Charlie,
can you see the prison?

704
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
No, and you don't have
anything in the thermal radar?

705
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I am in that.
He/she sees her that the prison has some residents.

706
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But since they closed is able to be her
any one, beggars, cheap...

707
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
- Some movement?
- Three potential "Objectives."

708
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Charlie, leaning that the
Can Maggie be there?

709
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I think my "enemy"
he/she wants that will discover.

710
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Because they took her?

711
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
They want me.

712
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Will you kill this type, ah?
What if he/she sits down when anybody is killed?

713
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I never thought about that.

714
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
With that weapon class, almost
that could see them in the eyes.

715
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Sometimes.

716
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Do your children know that it is it what do?
The Bible says that she should not kill.

717
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Sometimes God uses the darkness
to give us more light.

718
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Both of us have worlds
a lot of bad, don't you find?

719
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You should go.

720
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Not even I know your name.

721
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
- Charlie.
- My name is Sunny.

722
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Do you see him/it what want to tell you?

723
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:39,000
- It is careful, Charlie.
- You also.

724
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
- Nolan?
- I am here.

725
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Did you already find them?

726
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I am already in that for you, Donovan.

727
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
He/she listens, I have other two illustrations and
I don't have idea of who can be.

728
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
He/she waits, one of them is been to move and
the other is in the same place,

729
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
more or less the about 45
meters to your front.

730
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Understood.

731
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Nolan, am to west,
what do visualize?

732
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I have three illustrations inside the
prison on the south side,

733
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
nobody is to his/her turn.

734
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Ok, listens. One is the
to move and the other ones two are quiet.

735
01:07:29,000 --> 01:08:00,000
He/she hears Charlie, you only have an opportunity
and I don't want to give you the wrong.

736
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:17,000
- Do Donovan, already have the spy?
- Yes.

737
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:47,000
- I see the Bear, and it comes for here.
- The where?

738
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,000
- A dead.
- Good work.

739
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Does he/she repeat, where are you?
Damned you are.

740
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yes gentleman.
I arrive in five minutes.

741
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
We have a report of a Caucasian man
close to the river of Los Angeles,

742
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
taking a weapon of great load.

743
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
A weapon of great load?

744
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
He/she thinks that is our man.

745
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I don't know, we go.

746
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Where do we go?

747
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
If who is to run the river near
he/she is our suspect,

748
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
what believes that it is, and if
it follows the same direcção,

749
01:09:25,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I think we will reach him/it
in the old prison Lincoln.

750
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
- Nolan?
- Charlie, I can just hear you.

751
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
- In what direcção they are?
- It moves you a little for the right.

752
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Ok, already get to see you. The more loud
you go, better I can see you,

753
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and when you are at the level of the other ones
I will tell you and there it is where they are.

754
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
He/she is well, now it is here with me Nolan.

755
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It maintains an eye in my backs.

756
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
- Second floor.

757
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
- Ok Charlie, there are two illustrations
a little more visible than you,

758
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
probably because you are
two or three levels below.

759
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
He/she continues to move and like this
I can see you better.

760
01:11:31,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Understood.

761
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:16,000
To your left, Charlie.
Bravo, you are in the same level.

762
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
There are cells in all of the sides and
a great open corridor.

763
01:12:22,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Charlie to your left, to 18 meters.
You are almost to arrive.

764
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:37,000
He/she moves you.

765
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
A dead, but
they still have Maggie.

766
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Charlie, I have two illustrations above you
and they move fast,

767
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I believe that it is a higher level.

768
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
He/she moves you.

769
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
He/she continues to walk.

770
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Charlie, they are above you.

771
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:37,000
- Is it here?
- Yes, we go.

772
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
He/she looks in front Charlie.

773
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:48,000
They are three illustrations, two of them are to the
your front. He/she has to be Maggie.

774
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Turn off.

775
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Lament Mister, I cannot make that.

776
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
We have a life situation or death
outside with one of ours.

777
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Charlie Snow is not one of ours.

778
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He/she abandoned the Agency,
we don't have any obligation.

779
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
But Mister, technically still
he/she belongs to the Agency,

780
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and that does with that we have
obligation with him.

781
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You leave him/it of that sorts things out and deixá-la-ei to go
just with a warning,

782
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
doutra forms you are out also.

783
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
This well.
Then I am out also.

784
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But not before finishing this work.

785
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Charlie Snow is there without connection,
he/she doesn't have anything and they have his/her wife.

786
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Not even he/she can ask for us help.

787
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Nevertheless I have that him
everything to supply of here,

788
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
so that he and his/her wife leave alive
of this, it is exactamente that I will do.

789
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Please, Mister, for love of God, not
he/she sees that that man needs our help.

790
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Charlie has to solve their problems
for his/her own bill.

791
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
He made this decision
when he/she abandoned the Agency.

792
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Then respectfully I make petition of
I access to his/her superior,

793
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
as dictated the protocol
of the norms of the Agency.

794
01:15:43,000 --> 01:16:00,000
- You want to pass on my head.
- Yes, gentleman. It is immediately, Mister.

795
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:26,000
- It frees her.
- Charlie!

796
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Quiet.
He/she releases the weapon.

797
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I belong to the special units
and they have my wife as hostage,

798
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't have time for this.

799
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
- It releases the weapon or shot.
- It releases her already.

800
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
They have my wife.

801
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It places the weapon in the ground, we don't want
that skirt hurt, he/she throws her already.

802
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Then you will have to shoot.

803
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Asking for support in the old prison, several
dead suspects, I request helicopter.

804
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Quiet, it lets to go her and it places your weapon in the
ground, you don't have to go where.

805
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Still no Charlie, we have unites
debt to pay off. You and me.

806
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
He/she lets to go her
and I will let to live you.

807
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Leaning that that is what worries me.

808
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
The only way to live this battle is
to finish her/it in sacks for corpses.

809
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
He/she is well. He/she lets to go her, she doesn't have
anything to see with everything this.

810
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Do you want him to let to go her?
He/she shoots your weapon and I let to go her.

811
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That never she will pass.

812
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Already everything finished.

813
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
It lets to go her and it places your weapon.
He/she makes him/it already.

814
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I don't like that idea a lot.
You removed me something that I loved,

815
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and now I will remove you something that you love.
The decision is yours.

816
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
- This is your last opportunity.
- This time no, Charlie.

817
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Police, release the weapon.

818
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
- Are you well?
- Yes. I am well.

819
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Thank you Charlie.
I love you.

820
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
- She will be well.
- Will it take some time, and with you?

821
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
always, since
my family is well.

822
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Dad.

823
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:23,000
They will see the mammy.

824
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Thank you.

825
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Thank you Nolan.
Accomplished mission.

826
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
No there is my problem brother, I am happy
that you and Maggie are safe.

827
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:51,000
We see each other thereabout.

828
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
One month later,

829
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Charlie Snow was removed honorariamente
of the I exercise of the United States.

830
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
