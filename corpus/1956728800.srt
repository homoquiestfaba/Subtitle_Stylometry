00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:13,652
Hey! That was some
fancy footwork, Cooper.

183
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,153
Some people just got it.

184
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:18,122
Biggie, Mr. Dinkles,
you two were on fire!

185
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,957
Yeah, sorry about that,
Queen Poppy.

186
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,893
(squeaks)

187
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,995
I'm digging
that new anklet, Legsly.

188
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,331
Thanks, Poppy.

189
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,966
Kisses and donuts
and sprinkles!

190
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,469
Ah, what a Troll.

191
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:34,172
Tiny Diamond, welcome
to the family, little buddy.

192
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,206
Thanks, Aunt Poppy.

193
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,309
And thanks to this
silver-haired daddy of mine

194
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,010
for bringing me
into this world.

195
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,512
Oh.

196
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,481
I never knew my heart
could be so full.

197
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,283
Peace and love.
Bless up.

198
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,050
Tiny and Daddy out.

199
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,188
Oh. Okay, bye.

200
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,222
Hey, uh, Poppy,

201
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,925
there's something
I was hoping to ask you.

202
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,260
I-I mean,
I guess it's something

203
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:58,230
I want to tell you, more so.

204
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,498
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, but listen.

205
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,000
You could feel free
to respond to it,

206
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,437
uh, with an answer,
i-if you wanted.

207
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,004
Sure. What's up?

208
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:10,509
Uh, what's up is I, uh,

209
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,245
I-I-I-I-I-I...

210
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,383
I wanted to tell you that...

211
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,216
Uh...

212
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:19,487
(groans)

213
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,522
You're crushing it
at this queen thing.

214
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,424
Aw, Branch, thank you.

215
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,058
Being a good queen is

216
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,328
the most important thing
in the world to me.

217
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,095
Other than being your friend.

218
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,232
(echoing):
<i>Friend, friend, friend, friend,</i>

219
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,300
<i>friend, friend, friend.</i>

220
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,503
Uh, five it up?

221
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,006
Huh. That could've been better.
Let's try that again.

222
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,174
O-Okay, one more.

223
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:45,444
Huh. For some reason, we can't
seem to make a good connection.

224
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,546
- (Poppy chuckles, Branch sighs)
- (Fuzzbert babbling)

225
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,281
Oh, yes, Fuzzbert!

226
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,417
- Now, that's a good connection.
- (groans)

227
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,084
BIGGIE:
(screams) Poppy, help!

228
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:53,951
- Ooh.
- Poppy!

229
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,122
- (shrieking, gasping)
- (wild grunting)

230
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,590
Watch it, watch it!

231
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,559
- Biggie?
- TROLL: Oh, run!

232
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:02,394
- (Trolls clamoring)
- (Biggie screams)

233
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:03,362
Help!

234
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:06,265
I'm being harangued
by a monster! (gasps)

235
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,536
- Someone stop it! (shrieks)
- (wild grunting continues)

236
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,070
Gotcha! Ah! It's in my hair!
It's in my hair!

237
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,006
- Get it out, get it out, get it out!
- (Branch yells)

238
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,074
(shushing)

239
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,209
There you go.

240
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,779
- (eyes boinging)
- (purring)

241
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,314
There you go. Calm down.

242
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:23,582
Who's a good boy?

243
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,149
What is that thing?

244
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,217
It's creepy.

245
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,352
BOTH:
It's scary.

246
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,521
(auto-tuned):
And nasty.

247
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,958
- Hold me, Daddy.
- Oh.

248
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,430
"To Queen Poppy."

249
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,064
(Trolls gasp)

250
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,500
Oh, don't worry, everyone.

251
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:43,402
It looks like
it's just an invitation.

252
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:44,603
- Whew!
- (relieved murmuring, sighing)

253
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,238
Just an invitation.

254
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,539
- COOPER: I love invitations.
- (clears throat)

255
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,541
"Barb, the Queen of Rock,

256
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,645
"announces her One Nation
Under Rock World Tour.

257
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,347
"Bring your string
to the biggest party

00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:56,615
the world has ever seen."

259
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,083
- Queen of Rock?
- KING PEPPY: It's nothing!

260
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,520
It means nothing at all.
It's just junk mail.

261
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:02,421
You don't need
to worry about it.

262
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,121
I mean, quit looking at it,
everyone.

263
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,491
Forget what you saw!

264
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,058
(chewing noisily)

265
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,125
(Branch yells)

266

- (grunting)
- (shushing)

267
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,563
- There you go. There you go.
- (eyes boinging)

268
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,065
- Calm down. Calm down.
- (purring)

269
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,469
(quietly):
There you go.

270
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,070
Okay, I'm calm.

271
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,071
I'm calm.

272
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,241
Dad, what's going on?

273
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,477
Well, I have long feared
this day would come.

274
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,447
I was hoping to protect you
from this, Poppy.

275
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,281
Protect me?

276
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,182
I'm not a little kid
anymore, Dad.

277
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,286
I'm the queen now.

278
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,621
You're right.

279
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:40,459
The truth is we are not alone
in this world.

280
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:43,362
(eerie warbling)

281
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,162
- (warbling stops)
- (stammers, shushes)

282
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,566
There are other kinds
of Trolls.

283
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,434
- TROLL: What?
- Wow. That's...

284
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,502
Dad, that's great.

285
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,404
The more Trolls, the merrier.

286
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,138
You don't understand.

287
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,173
These other Trolls
aren't like us.

288
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,175
They're different.

289
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,578
Different how?

290
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,679
Different like Legsly?

291
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:02,314
I love being me.

292
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,582
- Or Fuzzbert? Or Smidge?
- (Fuzzbert babbling)

293
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,116
Or Skyscraper Troll?

294
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,885
(in unison):
Yeah, different like me?

295
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,554
No, it's not that.

296
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:11,623
They're different in ways
you can't even imagine.

297
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,125
- (vocalizing pop music)
- You see, we love music

298
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,461
with a hummable hook,
with an upbeat melody,

299
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,264
with a catchy rhythm that makes
you want to snap your fingers,

300
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,500
tap your toes
and wiggle your butt.

301
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,668
That's our music.

302
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,537
That's what makes us
Pop Trolls.

303
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,306
- Ooh.
- It is. -Yes.

304
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,608
But these other Trolls,
they sing different.

305
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,609
- (gasping)
- They dance different.

306
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:33,445
Why, some of them
can't even begin to grasp

307
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,147
the concept of Hammer Time.

308
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,417
("U Can't Touch This" playing)

309
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,718
You can't touch that!

310
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,919
(screaming)

311
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:43,288
(Trolls clamoring)

312
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,357
- (crying)
- (crying)

313
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,325
(screaming)

314
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,329
- ♪ Stop. ♪
- (music and clamoring stop)

315
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:52,698
How about we break down
to a smaller group?

316
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,702
(birds chirping)

317
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:00,372
It's a story as old as time.

318
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:01,573
(clears throat)

319
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,345
In the beginning,
there was silence.

320
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,380
(singsongy):
Boring.

321
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,316
KING PEPPY: <i>Until one day,
someone made a sound.</i>

322
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:12,651
- (plays note)
- (Trolls oohing)

323
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,721
<i>Our ancestors were
so inspired by the sound,</i>

324
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:18,490
- <i>they took six strings.</i>
- (melody plays)

325
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:22,761
<i>And those six strings had
the power to control all music.</i>

326
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,396
<i>They could play anything.</i>

327
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,298
(harp strumming)

328
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,266
- (different styles playing)
- <i>Techno, funk, classical,</i>

329
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,736
<i>country, hard rock and pop.</i>

330
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:33,538
<i>And every kind of music
in between.</i>

331
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
<i>There was something
for everyone.</i>

332
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,742
<i>It was one big party.</i>

333
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,377
TROLLS:
Yay!

334
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,778
KING PEPPY:
<i>But little by little,</i>

335
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,447
<i>Trolls became intolerant
of each other's music.</i>

336
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,715
- (Trolls arguing)
- TROLL: I want it!

337
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,717
- I want to listen to techno!
- No fair!

338
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,719
Hey, y'all, I want country.

339
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:50,221
KING PEPPY: <i>They fought
over what kind of music</i>

340
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:51,723
<i>the strings would play.</i>

341
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,426
<i>The elders realized
there was but one solution.</i>

342
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:56,561
TROLLS: Blah,
blah-blah-blah-blah. Agreed.

343
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:59,398
KING PEPPY:
<i>Each tribe would take a string</i>

344
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,402
- <i>and go their separate ways.</i>
- (Trolls chattering)

345
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:07,406
<i>Those six tribes have lived
in isolation ever since.</i>

346
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:10,242
<i>Techno, Country, Rock,</i>

347
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,244
<i>Classical, Funk,</i>

348
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:14,715
<i>and us, the Pop Trolls.</i>

349
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:18,450
Now Barb's announcement

the strings

- (chuckles): Yeah!

It's when all the Trolls
lived in harmony.

355

And what's more important
than living in harmony?

Well, I heard fighting.

357
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,298

00:35:57,884 --> 00:36:00,854
Step one:
escape from Lonesome Flats.

00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:05,757
(snorting, spitting noisily)

876
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:07,125
(sighs) Plan B it is.

877
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:09,027

It ain't right
to put you in jail

881
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:17,669
'cause your music's different.

882
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:18,770
It seems some folks round here

883
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:20,772

What's your name?

Name's Hickory.

892

Branch, this is Hickory.
Hickory, this is Branch.

893

but are you getting
a weird vibe from Hickory?

1019

(normal voice):
What?

1020
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:35,654
No. Why? Are you?

1021
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,221
I just... I don't know.

1022
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,490
- I don't trust him.

Well, yeah, but you don't

1024

Hey, I just want us to be safe.

1026
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,463
And you know what's not safe?

1027
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,031
Putting too much trust
into a complete stranger.

1028
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:49,133
Oh, I see.

It's not Hickory
you don't trust. It's me.

1030

Do you not think
I'm a good queen?

1031
00:41:54,508 --> 00:41:56,408
Wait, what?
I didn't say that.

1032
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,609
I thought we were friends,
Branch.

1033
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,678
I'm starting to think you don't
even know what that means.

1034
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
We <i>are</i> friends.

1035
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,914
And sometimes
that means speaking up

1036
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:05,451
if I think
you're making a mistake.

BRANCH:
Poppy,

1041
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:22,267
(distorted):
I can't feel my face.

1042
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:26,170
It's... it's like
I'm being paralyzed by its

1043
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,172
(echoes):
smoothness.

and that we're all the same
and that she's one of us!

1223
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,401
Poppy, I mean no disrespect,

1224
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:11,970
but king to queen,
anything but that.

1225
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:13,605
Why not?

1227
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:17,175
Let's tell 'em how it was,
Prince D.

1228
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:18,677
Sick.

1229
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,779
Long ago, our world was
without song or dance.

1230
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:22,881
Then the Trolls
found the strings,

1231
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:24,885
and life was one big party.

1232
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:30,555
Oh, yeah.
I-I've heard this story before.

1233
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:34,025
That is, until the Pop Trolls
tried to steal our strings.

1234
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:35,060
Steal your strings?

1235
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,495
That-That's not what it said
in our scrapbooks.

1236
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:38,630
Scrapbooks?

1237
00:50:38,632 --> 00:50:41,867
Those are cut out, glued
and glittered by the winners.

1238
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:43,768

KING QUINCY: And the Trolls
never lived in harmony again.

1299
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:46,891
So the Trolls live in isolation
because of what Pop did?

1300
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:49,928
Pop tried to destroy our music.

1301
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,697
Just like Barb is trying to do.

1302
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:53,999
I can make it right.

1303
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:55,900
History's just gonna
keep repeating itself

1304
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:58,770
until we make everyone realize
that we're all the same.

1305
00:52:58,772 --> 00:53:00,772
But we're not all the same.

1306
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:02,907
It's why all our strings
are different.

1307
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:05,076
Because they reflect
our different music.

1308
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:08,013
Denying our differences

1309
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:10,917
is denying the truth
of who we are.

1310
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:15,086

like that.

We have to get back down there.
There's still hope.

1338
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,994
- We can still fix this.
- Poppy, enough.

1339
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,930
I've listened to you
and I've done it your way,

1340
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:33,965
and now it's your turn
to listen.

1341
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,000
It's time to get back home.

1342

I'm not like you.
I can't just give up.

1343
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:39,737
Give up?

1344
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,673
I want to protect
our friends and family.

1345
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:45,244
I can't go home until I've
proven myself as a good queen.

1346
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:47,446
So that's what this is
really all about?

1347
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:49,013
Why are you so upset?

1348
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:50,882
Because your dad was right

1349
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:53,151
and Biggie was right
and Queen Essence was right.

1350
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:56,990
And I've been backing you up
even when you ignore them.

1351
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,960
But you never listen to me.

1352
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:03,830
Branch, what are you
talking about?

1353
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,865
You want to be a good queen?

Good queens actually listen.

is being my best friend

There's all this pressure
to be a great queen.

1576
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:24,583
And instead of real friends,
you're just surrounded by

what you want to hear.

You don't want
to unite the world.
