1
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,350
Freeze! Freeze!
You're under arrest.

2
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,380
David, we gotta go!

3
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,460
What are you doing?

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,200
- Get out!
- You said it was over.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,640
You promised me.

6
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,640
Freeze!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,770
Get the fuck back, man.

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,210
Throw the gun down!

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,340
Drop the gun!

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,320
Stop screaming.
Put it down!

11
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,070
Shit.

12
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,220
Enough!

13
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,250
Don't move!

14
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,160
Who are you?
Why did you attack me?

15
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,020
Are you hurt?

16
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,690
No.

17
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,370
- Do you know where we are?
- No.

18
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,400
Is that the only word
you know in English?

19
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,470
I was born in New Jersey.

20
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,070
You got any idea
how you got here?

21
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,510
- No. I just woke up.
- You just woke up?

22
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,980
You just woke up,
you decided to kill me?

23
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,810
Well, I didn't know
who you were.

24
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,880
What's your name?

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
- Jin.
- Jin?

26
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Jin, I'm David.

27
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,400
I let you up, Jin...

28
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,400
are you gonna be cool?

29
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,510
What is this place?

30
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,840
I don't know.

31
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,920
Last thing I remember, I was...

32
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,620
I was walking
down Beacon Street.

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,220
I live in Boston.

34
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,790
I was in New York.

35
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't think we're in any
of those two places right now.

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,760
I don't think so.

37
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,400
This metalwork, it looks like...

38
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,070
6th century.

39
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,580
You get a brochure on the way in?

40
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,600
I was gonna be an architect.

41
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,810
Where'd you learn
how to fight like that?

42
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,650
From the movies.

43
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,020
My daughters say the same thing...

44
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,690
- about cuss words.
- Shh. Are you hearing that?

45
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,470
I think I know what this place is.

46
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,340
It's an incinerator.

47
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,900
Do you think-- do you think
it's gonna ignite?

48
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,280
I don't know, but I don't wanna
stick around and find out.

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,510
Do you?

50
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,100
Are we in a dungeon
or something?

51
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,870
I don't suppose that means
we're anywhere near an exit.

52
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,710
No.

53
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,980
I mean, who does this?

54
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,380
Huh?

55
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,510
You sure you don't know
who might've done this?

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,510
No.

57
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,550
You lying to me, Jin?

58
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,790
Hey, don't bullshit me!

59
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,390
This is not a fucking game here!

60
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,460
You know something,
spit it out!

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,440
You have any enemies?
Anyone who would've done this to you?

62
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,710
There were these men.

63
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,010
They came in one night,
I was closing.

64
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,250
Robbed me.
That wasn't the first time.

65
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,780
Gave me no choice, you know?

66
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,190
I mean, a man's
gotta protect his--

67
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,210
his property, right?

68
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,320
I don't think they were even
gonna do anything that night.

69
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,920
It didn't matter, because I was
gonna do something.

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,790
I've been trying to forget
that night ever since.

71
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,300
If anyone's done this to me,
it's their friends.

72
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,400
- How long ago was this?
- I don't know.

73
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,140
It's-- it's hard to say.

74
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,770
A couple of weeks, maybe.

75
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,840
Whether or not these thugs
did this to you,

76
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
we gotta get out.

77
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't know, Jin.
I think we can rule out

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,570
the Jersey gangbangers
as possible masterminds on this.

79
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,870
Yeah, I think so, too.

80
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,040
- Think it's government?
- No.

81
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,310
Only government builds
something this ugly.

82
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,380
It ain't the government.

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,650
How old are your girls?

84
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,160
10 and 11.

85
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,160
Michelle and Anna.

86
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,920
They play for my wife
and I every Tuesday night.

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,530
The best concerts
I've ever been to.

88
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,270
What about you?
What do you do?

89
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,810
I was a cop.

90
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,830
I don't think...

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,600
we're alone.

92
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,340
Jin. J--

93
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,570
Just put the sword down.

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't shoot.

95
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,930
We don't know anything.

96
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,580
Jesus. You're a kid.

97
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,760
Back off or I cut him.

98
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,950
You hurt him and I bust up
your boyfriend!

99
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm not her boyfriend, asshole.

100
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,930
I'm glad we cleared that up.
Now drop the knife.

101
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,520
- Drop the sword.
- You first.

102
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,500
- Fuck off!
- It's gonna be like that?

103
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,660
Every step.

104
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,440
It's your turn.

105
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,450
Now Why'd you attack us?

106
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,320
Look at you guys. You look like
the fucking cleanup crew.

107
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,390
What the hell are
you two doing down here?

108
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,900
We're on our dream vacation.
How the fuck am I supposed to know

109
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,990
- what we're doing down here?
- A real smartass, aren't you?

110
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,400
Tyler, come here.
Get over here.

111
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,700
- You okay, kid?
- I'm fine.

112
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,900
When you bleed
to death in two hours?

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
Come here.

114
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,680
- So what are you, a doctor?
- Boy Scout.

115
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,680
It's not perfect,
but it'll stop the bleeding.

116
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,660
My name's Tyler.

117
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,060
David. This is Jin.

118
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,890
She's Emma.

119
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,070
Well, where are you headed?

120
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,440
We don't know.

121
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,740
Figure there's a way in,
there's gotta be a way out.

122
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah, okay.
Guess we'll see you around.

123
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,140
Take care of your leg, kid.

124
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,340
Okay, guys, look,
just wait, all right?

125
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,380
We're down here alone, okay?

126
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,080
We have no idea where we are,

127
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,890
we're just as lost as you, okay?

128
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,950
We just wanna get
the hell out of here.

129
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,550
What about you?

130
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,560
Just don't slow us down.

131
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,480
- Where'd you meet the kid?
- In a pile of corpses.

132
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,950
Jesus Christ.

133
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,090
They're not fucking around,
are they?

134
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,130
Never thought they were.

135
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,900
Who would do something like this?

136
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,880
You think
they beat her to death?

137
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,240
That chain on her neck--

138
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,770
it's direct pressure on the carotid,

139
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,910
it sends the heart
into cardiac arrest.

140
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
- They gonna kill us too?
- No.

141
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,150
It's not gonna happen.

142
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,420
This wheel mechanism
is connected

143
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,790
to these chains, to the ceiling.

144
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,600
But it looks like if you turn it,

145
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,660
it can tighten or loosen.

146
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,530
Now why, I have no idea.

147
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,830
What do you think
all these symbols mean?

148
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,570
They're signs
of the devil's students.

149
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,440
This place has been consecrated
for unholy teaching.

150
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,370
That's what they teach you
in Catholic school these days.

151
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,320
There's some writing here.

152
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,120
"Welcome to the end
of your lives.

153
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,320
For once you have
survived these halls,

154
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,460
you will no longer be
who you once were.

155
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,900
You have begun the first
of four levels of the gauntlet."

156
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,440
"Each has a test and a choice.

157
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,570
Like Gideon's escape...

158
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,170
there is one exit,

159
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,680
and one way of opening it.

160
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,280
Begin."

161
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,350
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

162
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,490
- Great, Emma, what'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

163
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,260
Fuck.

164
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,390
What the fuck is going on?!

165
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,670
Why are you doing this?

166
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,170
What, is this some rich bastard's
idea of entertainment?

167
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,570
- It's a science experiment.
- We are gonna die down here

168
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,170
- without any food and water.
- Look, it doesn't matter!

169
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,250
All that matters
is getting out of here.

170
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,440
It's a game.

171
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,950
They want us to play their game,

172
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,250
that's what we're gonna do.

173
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,990
I just want a smoke.

174
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,900
What do you think this is?

175
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,640
I think it's a blood trough.

176
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,840
A what?

177
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,580
It needs blood to work.

178
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,210
You sacrifice someone,

179
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,750
blood drips into these grooves,
turns the trough.

180
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,730
- Jesus.
- Hey, guys.

181
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,260
Come take a look at this.

182
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,790
Any guesses?

183
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,270
That's 6-6-6.
That's a satanic code right?

184
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,480
Nothing.

185
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,360
Just about a million
different possibilities.

186
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,900
What is that?

187
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,840
I don't know.

188
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,820
Father?

189
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,350
I won't forget.

190
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,530
7-10-7.

191
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,260
What?

192
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,170
7-10-7.

193
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,670
What is that,
your old locker combination?

194
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,140
It's the number of the dragon.

195
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,240
The devil.

196
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,810
Okay.

197
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,460
Now we're getting somewhere.

198
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,440
Shit! Fuck!

199
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,910
Oh shit. Wait, all right.

200
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,430
Stay still, Jin. I got you.

201
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm gonna lift you.

202
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,010
All right, it's moving.
It's moving.

203
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,020
All right, put your weight on me.
Tyler, I need you.

204
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,490
Tyler, I need your help. We gotta take
the pressure off his leg. Come here.

205
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,220
- No!
- Get your ass over here! I need you!

206
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,590
- Come on, move it!
- Help me!

207
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,720
Stay with me, man, okay?

208
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,520
Put your arm around him.
He's gonna lean on you, all right?

209
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,830
Okay, don't let him
fall over, okay?

210
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,600
Hang in there, Jin.
What's your wife's name?

211
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,300
- What's her name?
- What?

212
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,930
What's her name? What's your
wife's name? What's her name?

213
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,000
- Megan.
- Megan? Just think about Megan, okay?

214
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,410
And think about your
two beautiful girls, all right?

215
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,500
- All right. Tyler, you got him?
- I got him.

216
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,170
Okay. Emma!
I need your help.

217
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,110
- We gotta do this.
- What?

218
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,920
- You gotta help me.
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

219
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,050
Look, Jin is gonna bleed to death
if we don't help him.

220
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,550
- Now help me.
- I'm-- I'm not gonna bleed a dead body.

221
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
Look, I don't want to do it either.

222
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,790
I know you don't give
a shit about Jin, but I do.

223
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,890
- Now help me.
- This is so fucked up.

224
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,730
If you wanna save your own ass
and get outta here...

225
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,760
help me.

226
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,720
On three.
One, two, three.

227
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,310
Push. Push.

228
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,110
Stop. Stop.

229
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,820
Push it the other way.
Spin it the other way.

230
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,020
Spin it.

231
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,400
Damn it!

232
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,910
We killed her.

233
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,550
Did you hear me?
We fucking killed her.

234
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,490
They set us up.

235
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,590
Why would they
set us up to do this?

236
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,930
David, please.

237
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,630
Come on. Push.

238
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,240
Hold him still.

239
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,950
Now this is gonna hurt.

240
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,650
Come on.

241
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,340
- Who are you?
- Please don't hurt me.

242
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,040
- You a part of this?
- No, I'm not.

243
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,070
- I need help.
- How'd you get in here?

244
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,510
I don't remember.

245
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,580
I was thrown in a van and...

246
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,990
there were other voices.

247
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,790
They were almost chanting.

248
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,850
Then everything went dark. Then...

249
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,260
then I found myself here.

250
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,360
How many people are in this thing?

251
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,430
Yeah, and where are they now?

252
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,410
Look at you.
You're covered in blood.

253
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,210
Obviously, it's not yours.

254
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,010
They tried to kill me.
They went crazy.

255
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,380
Look at that girl.
They hung her up...

256
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,720
in the chains.

257
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,880
And I was lucky to escape
before they got to me.

258
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,120
I don't buy it, David.

259
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,360
She needs help.

260
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,990
Leave her, man.

261
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,730
Fair enough.

262
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,000
You can come,
but you stay in front.

263
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,170
What do you want us to do?
You want us to leave her behind?

264
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,010
How do you know that
she didn't spring that trap?

265
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,810
And now Jin is
probably gonna die

266
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,280
- because of--
- Shh.

267
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,010
Whatever.

268
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,590
Doesn't look good, man.

269
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,300
You gonna be all right?

270
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,840
I might lose a leg,
but other than that

271
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,500
I'm okay.

272
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,440
I just wanted to say

273
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,540
if you need help
with your leg...

274
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,740
I can help you out walking
the rest of the way.

275
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,090
All right.

276
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,660
I see you got some ink there.

277
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,100
You a big drinker or those
actually mean something?

278
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,660
You don't have to pretend
that you give a shit about me. Really.

279
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,860
I mean, we're all
stuck down here.

280
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,670
You think we can play
on the same team?

281
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,510
My battle scars.

282
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,710
What, you don't got any?

283
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,450
- Not a scratch.
- Oh yeah, you're so full of shit.

284
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,290
A girl, right?

285
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,290
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,350
Oh, that's right.
You went to Catholic school.

287
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,860
I forgot.

288
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,890
I bet you weren't there by choice.

289
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
I didn't really choose much
of anything in my life.

290
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,100
To be honest with you,
sometimes I wish I could just...

291
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,670
start over as somebody else.

292
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,120
My father's voice is what haunts me,
if you're really asking.

293
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,260
When's the last time you saw him?

294
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,890
When I was eight or maybe nine.

295
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,460
Dropped me off
at the runaway shelter...

296
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,170
then he walked away.

297
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,500
That was it.

298
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,070
Oh.

299
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,250
Smells awful.

300
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,240
Oh fuck.
You've gotta be kidding.

301
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,420
Let's keep moving.
Let's go.

302
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,260
This can't be the right way.

303
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,260
I don't think we have
a lot of options here, guys.

304
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,230
How can you walk through
that dead water?

305
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,100
Look, it's either we go this way

306
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,330
or we go back the way we came.

307
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,800
What if you're wrong?

308
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,630
Then we're wrong.

309
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,840
Come on, let's go.

310
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,280
You can relax. He's all right.

311
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,990
It looks like he knows
where we're going.

312
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,120
Well, he doesn't.

313
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,320
We're just as lost as you are.

314
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,990
Look...

315
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,530
my father has a lot of money.

316
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,500
If you were to rescue me,

317
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,200
he would reward you.

318
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,580
Is there anything--
anything- that I can do

319
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,140
to make you remember
how to get out?

320
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,620
No.

321
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,160
There isn't.

322
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,100
You sure I can't
drink this water?

323
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,800
Yeah, I'm sure.

324
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,080
I don't think we're
gonna get out of here.

325
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,230
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the...

326
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,980
Okay okay.

327
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,810
- What is it?
- Huh?

328
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,120
David.

329
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,820
Yeah.
What do you got?

330
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,420
Come here.
Take a look at this.

331
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,570
Okay, you remember
in the altar room

332
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,500
the stone that had
the combination dials on it.

333
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,570
It was much bigger and larger
than the others around it.

334
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,240
- Okay.
- Okay, now we've searched

335
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,140
every inch of the walls here

336
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,340
and there are no dials for this level.

337
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,010
- Yeah, saying there are some.
- You see, I think

338
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,880
it's on the floor,

339
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,220
which would
be impossible to find,

340
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,730
but if you look at the ceiling...

341
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,890
every tenth stone
is wider and larger.

342
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,400
It's part of the design.

343
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,590
- You said the floor.
- You see, the early stoneworkers

344
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,870
had different grooves
for the ceiling and the floor.

345
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,370
And in order to solve the debate,

346
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,530
they decided to mirror
the ceiling to the floor.

347
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,630
Okay, so we search
every tenth stone for the dials.

348
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,340
Right, but only in the center line.

349
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,850
Okay, let's get to work.

350
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,430
Oh!

351
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,930
Kim, who is that?

352
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,870
Uh... I don't know.

353
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,910
Is he one of the people
you were with?

354
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,080
No. I-I-- I don't know.

355
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,250
Is he one of the people
you were with?!

356
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,150
You know what? She's been shady
since the moment we met her.

357
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,350
Let's just ditch her
and get the fuck out of here!

358
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,520
Kim, you gotta
come clean with us, okay?

359
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

360
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,130
Let's get outta here.

361
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,900
Please.

362
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,530
Please.

363
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,070
You won't understand.

364
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,630
Try us.

365
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,850
There was this man.

366
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,450
His ugly fat ass.

367
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,020
He was the most disgusting freak
I've ever seen in my life.

368
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,390
Every girl's nightmare.

369
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,330
He showed up
to my class every night.

370
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,070
When I ask him to leave,
he wouldn't listen.

371
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,470
Hey! Go! Go! Eh!

372
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,540
He just stood there
and watch...

373
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,640
and watch.

374
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,740
One day he just
showed up from behind...

375
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,380
with his camera.

376
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,150
He was just-- he was...

377
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,090
He was-- I was just--

378
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,720
something inside-- I just--

379
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,560
I was just snap!

380
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,250
Am I being punished?

381
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,020
Whoever's doing this,
they're toying with us.

382
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,260
They want us to suffer.

383
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,540
One, two, three, four...

384
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,920
I'm sorry about earlier.

385
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,980
I was confused.

386
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,580
It's-- uh, it's all right.

387
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,420
Don't worry about it.

388
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,400
You don't look at me
like other men.

389
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,460
Well, um...

390
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,640
Where did you meet her?

391
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,610
- Online.
- Online?

392
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,740
- Yeah.
- You're kidding me. Online?

393
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,120
Look, you know, I can lie to you

394
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,920
and pretend that
I have this exciting

395
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,550
and original life and all that,

396
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,360
but... the truth is far from that.

397
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,690
I'm gonna be 30 next year,

398
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,220
and I still don't know
what I want to be,

399
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,000
except that I don't want
to be what I am now.

400
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,130
G-guys, I got it.
I think I got it.

401
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,700
- Really?
- Come here! I think this is it.

402
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,910
Yeah, that's it.

403
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,810
So how do we read it
to know where we're going?

404
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,340
Hmm?

405
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,120
What about a circular dam?

406
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,570
We're gonna need more.

407
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,520
In here.

408
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,020
Ooh.

409
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,660
Let me see. Let me see.

410
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,300
If we met out in the real world,

411
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,170
do you think we'd be friends?

412
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,610
More like a fling.

413
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,040
A fling?

414
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,410
Looks like there's some writing.

415
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,920
"Gideon looked and beheld death.

416
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,590
And the act of seven times 70..."

417
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,570
"...brought the harbringer of hell."

418
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,940
It's a riddle of some kind.

419
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,640
What do you think it means?

420
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,010
I don't know.
What's seven times 70?

421
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,200
- 490.
- Okay.

422
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,560
What is it?

423
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,430
It's a key of some kind.

424
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,100
Think it's for the exit?

425
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,110
So where's the door?

426
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,740
Everybody pick a corner,
search for anything--

427
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,440
something small like a keyhole,

428
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,010
something we missed.
Let's go.

429
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,570
Tyler.

430
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,840
- Tyler, what happened?
- Tyler, what just happened?

431
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,920
The the the--
the door just-- Tyler!

432
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,290
- Hey, Tyler, you all right?
- Guys, the water!

433
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,350
- Help, guys! Help!
- On three, okay? One...

434
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,300
Guys. help me!

435
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,960
Stay calm. We're gonna
get you out of here.

436
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
- Emma!
- It's not even moved an inch.

437
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,170
- Open the door!
- Come, look over here! Here!

438
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,580
Look, this way!

439
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,380
Guys, don't leave! Don't!

440
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,820
- Don't leave, please!
- Ty, it's okay. It's okay.

441
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,230
- Who are you?
- Morgan.

442
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,130
What the fuck you doing here?

443
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,640
I was out...

444
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,410
and from nowhere,
someone hit me.

445
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,930
I woke up here.

446
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,500
It's been days.

447
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,850
Please. Please help me.

448
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,720
Please help me.

449
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,920
Help me.

450
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,370
- They want us to swap.
- Swap? Swap what? What?

451
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,710
The girl for Tyler.
We unlock her,

452
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,680
we throw her in the crevice,
Tyler gets free.

453
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,510
Wait a minute, David.
How do you know this?

454
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,810
- Are you sure?
- No.

455
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,910
We have no time to waste.
Tyler's gonna die.

456
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,290
- We have to do something right now.
- No. No.

457
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,830
Emma?

458
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,330
I know-- I know why I'm here.

459
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,860
What are you talking about?

460
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,430
Oh, he always said
he was gonna do it.

461
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,500
He always said it.

462
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,010
The school thinks you're nothing more
than a stale piece of shit

463
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,040
- and you know that.
- What do you mean?

464
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,450
We make them know we exist.

465
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,280
I never believed him.

466
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,790
So why are you putting bullets in?
No no, Ron, we're scaring the shit

467
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,220
out of the football team,
then we're walking away, okay?

468
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,820
Listen, listen, you're in this.

469
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,690
There's no backing out
no matter what.

470
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,820
Okay, just shh. It's all right.
Everything's all right.

471
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,860
I knew what I had to do.

472
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,770
He deserved it.
He deserved it.

473
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,540
Listen, it's not your fault.

474
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,200
This is why I'm here.

475
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,780
This is what I deserve.

476
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,350
- What? What's going on?
- Come on, we gotta go.

477
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,620
Tyler, Tyler,
I'll be right back.

478
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,690
Emma.
I tried to stop him.

479
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,130
I told him.

480
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,690
I tried to stop him. I did.

481
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,930
Who is she, Emma?
Come on, you've got to talk to us!

482
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,300
I knew it wasn't right.
I knew it wasn't right.

483
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,310
Calvin didn't tell me
what was going on. I didn't know.

484
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,010
Please. Plea--

485
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,780
- You've got to believe me.
- Sh-sh-- shut up.

486
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,840
- Shut up.
- Please?

487
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,910
- I didn't know.
- Shut up!

488
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,420
- Please! Please!
- Shut up!

489
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,290
Do you understand?

490
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,690
Either she has to die
or Tyler's gonna die!

491
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,420
- We have no time.
- We have no choice.

492
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,730
Please.

493
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,930
Guys.

494
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,660
David.

495
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,440
- Give me the key.
- No.

496
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,500
- Do it, David.
- David.

497
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,030
No.

498
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,350
David. We got--
we gotta do this.

499
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,680
- Give me the key.
- No.

500
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,180
- David.
- Come on!

501
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,250
No! No no no!

502
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,120
Please! What are
you doing to me?

503
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,250
I don't wanna die!
Please! No!

504
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,290
No! No!

505
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,130
Please help me!
Help me, please!

506
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,630
Please!
I don't wanna die!

507
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,070
Please! I don't wanna die!

508
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,730
Emma! Emma!

509
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,370
Help! Please!

510
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,170
Emma, please help me.

511
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,540
Oh, Emma, please help me!

512
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,410
Please help me! Please help!

513
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,540
Please!

514
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,070
No! Help help!

515
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,180
Please, no no!

516
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,200
What happened? Wha...?

517
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,890
Oh man.

518
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,670
Jesus Christ.

519
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,180
Holy shit.

520
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,120
Who was Morgan?

521
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,080
I don't wanna talk about it.

522
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,040
You Okay?

523
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,770
Actually, I'm fine.

524
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,440
Well...

525
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,170
I did what had to be done.

526
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,240
The strange thing is...

527
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,440
I, uhm...

528
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,750
I don't feel any guilt.

529
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,600
I don't know what's happened to me.

530
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,440
Do you have any idea
what we did down there just now?

531
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,340
Yeah, but we're alive,

532
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,210
Tyler's alive and that
the price we had to pay.

533
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,620
Who was it?
Who'd you kill?

534
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,810
No one.

535
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,090
Somebody you knew well?

536
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,250
Was it a stranger?

537
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,660
- Fuck off.
- Emma, stop...

538
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,070
hiding from me.

539
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,200
You're a killer, Emma.

540
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,670
It's why you're here.

541
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,870
I've been playing shitty bars...

542
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,840
eight years.

543
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,650
And the only applause I get is

544
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,580
"Show me your tits."

545
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,180
Vice President of A&R...

546
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,620
he takes me into his little, uh--

547
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,320
his little fuck room.

548
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,830
All I had to do to get out was...

549
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,700
you know,
just shut off my feelings

550
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,140
for an hour and be done with it.

551
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,800
But I just can't.

552
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,910
And this guy isn't gonna
take that from me.

553
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,380
You know, when you ram
an ice pick

554
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,580
into a man's throat...

555
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,660
there's a lot of blood.
I mean there's a lot of fucking blood.

556
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,290
And that little innocent girl
that we just killed?

557
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,590
She put me in that room.

558
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,770
Get off of me.

559
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,500
And she left me there.

560
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,870
Do you think that Kim's right?

561
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,500
Do you think that...

562
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,070
this is our punishment?

563
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,010
I think we've all done things
we can't forgive ourselves for.

564
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,320
Guys, guys,
come here, come here.

565
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,530
What do you got?

566
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,970
"He was given the keys
to the nine gates

567
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,880
where he left those he held dear."

568
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,610
Nine gates, nine levels...

569
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,750
in hell.

570
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,350
What do each
of these levels mean?

571
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,790
Level one was for the unbaptized.

572
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,300
Level two for the lustful,

573
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,590
three for the gluttonous.

574
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,000
The worse the crime,
the higher the level.

575
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,630
So what crime fits us?

576
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,670
Murder.

577
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,380
Who goes to level nine?

578
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,950
Traitors.

579
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,900
Hey, you guys smell that?

580
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,040
I feel-- I feel dizzy.

581
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,380
What?

582
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,020
- There's something in the air.
- Yeah.

583
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,720
We gotta find a way out.
There's something in the air.

584
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,860
No no.

585
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,050
- No.
- Come on.

586
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,500
Don't leave her.
Don't leave her.

587
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,330
- God damn it, come on, Jin.
- No, David!

588
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,050
Where-- where's David?

589
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,630
How did the cage fall?

590
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,840
I must've pressed
a button or something.

591
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,790
So where do we go now?

592
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,710
Let's go home.

593
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:23,260
"The tear shed by the soldier

594
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,860
of the lamb"?

595
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,160
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

596
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,980
David.

597
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,660
How did you know
those numbers?

598
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,130
333.

599
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,040
He shed a tear for each one
of his soldiers that he killed.

600
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,010
David, what the fuck is going on?

601
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,600
David, who is in that painting?

602
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,040
Tell me.

603
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,250
Talk to me.
Tell me. Tell me.

604
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,750
Gideon.

605
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,490
He was the finest warrior
of the Israelites.

606
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,400
After a great battle,
he and his men were murdered

607
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,340
by the Midianites while they slept.

608
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,860
But instead of going to heaven,
they were all sent to hell.

609
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,470
You see,
unknown to each other,

610
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,600
they'd all wrongfully killed
throughout their battles.

611
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,770
Gideon made a deal with the devil...

612
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,750
who agreed to let one of them free.

613
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,850
Gideon felt assured
that his men would pick him.

614
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,950
But the devil...

615
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,160
had a different plan.

616
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,920
He gave each of them
a weapon and said,

617
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,490
"The last heart beating will be
the one allowed to leave."

618
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,300
Gideon slaughtered
his own soldiers.

619
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,070
His friends...

620
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,680
that he fought next to
his entire life.

621
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,750
Eventually he walked out of hell.

622
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,820
That's us.

623
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,390
I mean, we're all killers here.

624
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,930
How do you know that story?

625
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,710
My father used to tell it to me
when I was a kid.

626
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,880
So it comes down to this.

627
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,720
We can't kill each other.

628
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,820
All right, come on.
We're a team now.

629
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,260
If I have to shoot
a thousand people, I'll do it...

630
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,890
but not you guys.

631
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,200
Come on, we'll outsmart it.

632
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,260
- All right? We always do.
- No, we won't, Tyler.

633
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,110
Can't you see that? Huh?

634
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,740
I mean, they are getting exactly
what they want from us.

635
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,510
All of us.

636
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,820
We're the devil's students.

637
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,380
Now we're learning his lessons.

638
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,760
So that's it?

639
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,290
Hmm?

640
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,960
We're one fucking step away
from getting home

641
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,700
and we're stopping now?

642
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,110
No way.

643
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,900
Shh shh shh.

644
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,290
They're designed
to hear heartbeats.

645
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,190
When there's only one heart beating,
the doors'll open.

646
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,360
Are you sure that--

647
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,790
Maybe you read it wrong.

648
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,500
Maybe it's something else,
a different story.

649
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,140
Is there something
we're missing here, Jin?

650
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,740
It's-- it's Tuesday, isn't it?

651
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,280
What?

652
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,460
My daughters are playing.

653
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,140
Tyler, get out of here.
Get out of here!

654
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,430
Fuck!

655
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,110
Do you remember
what I told you, Jin?

656
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,550
I didn't know what I wanted to be?

657
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,720
You might be the only person
I've told that to,

658
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,150
and here we are.

659
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,850
In the middle of hell

660
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,290
I chose to open up
to a total stranger.

661
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,930
You were right
about this place, Jin.

662
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,230
And do you know
what I've learned

663
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:22,330
from this-- from this
beautiful experience?

664
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,670
What I want to be?

665
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,740
When I killed that man,

666
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:32,010
it was the best feeling
I've ever felt.

667
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,820
And then when I killed the others.

668
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,490
That's right, I lied.

669
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,660
I didn't run away. I killed them.

670
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,530
I killed them one by one!

671
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,060
All of them!

672
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,950
Then I waited for you guys to come,

673
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,650
and I was going to kill all of you too.

674
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,850
Then the curiosity took over.

675
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,820
I wanted to watch.

676
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,020
I wanted to watch how you guys
were gonna make it.

677
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:21,460
I was afraid in the first place...

678
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,530
what I was feeling.

679
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,310
But not anymore.

680
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,970
I'm a killer, Jin.

681
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,750
That is what I want to be.

682
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,920
That is what I truly am.

683
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,370
I'm sorry, Jin...

684
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,110
we have to say
goodbye this way.

685
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,910
I have no choice.

686
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,960
Will you stand and fight me?

687
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,430
I'm sorry, Kim.

688
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,710
What?

689
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,870
I was the one
that pulled the lever.

690
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,580
What did you say?

691
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,020
I just wanted to see
my kids again.

692
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,530
I won't fight you.

693
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,590
I won't.

694
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,540
I'm not gonna become
what they want.

695
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,930
Do you hear that?!

696
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,300
Jin.

697
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,380
Is Jin dead?

698
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,990
Throw me the sword, David.

699
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,450
- Tyler.
- Do it.

700
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,130
Is there another way
out of this, David?

701
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,100
Please tell me there is.

702
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,470
I don't know, Tyler.

703
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,830
- I need help, David.
- I'm trying.

704
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,560
I'm trying, buddy-

705
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,340
I'm sorry to spoil
the heart to heart.

706
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,840
- Okay okay.
- Okay?

707
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,670
David, what have you done?

708
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,360
David. David.

709
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,900
Emma.

710
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:55,300
Jesus Christ, you're all right.

711
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,030
Stay back.

712
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,710
No, you don't understand.

713
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,770
I believed you.

714
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,510
Emma, please.

715
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:12,850
Move.

716
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,320
- What?
- I said turn around and move.

717
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,650
- Emma.
- Now!

718
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,190
Get your hands up.

719
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,070
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Shut up.

720
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,540
Keep walking
and get your hands up.

721
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,900
Higher.

722
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,340
Stop.

723
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,790
I hope your singing career
works out.

724
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,120
I really do.

725
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,200
I can't do it.

726
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:10,470
I can't do it.

727
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,950
Why Tyler?

728
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,180
- He was just a kid.
- It was Kim.

729
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,780
I couldn't save Tyler.

730
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,620
I couldn't save Jin.

731
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,500
I'm not a killer, Emma.

732
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,100
Help me.

733
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,320
No!

734
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:43,230
Emma, come on.

735
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:03,250
Come on!

736
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,820
Come on!

737
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,790
You saved me?

738
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,560
I figured it was gonna be lonely.

739
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,840
- Who are you?
- This is the gauntlet.

740
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,820
It is our mission

741
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:41,520
to break the backs of pride.

742
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,060
It was built so you would know

743
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,620
what Gideon felt
when he walked out of hell.

744
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,760
He thought he was God's servant.

745
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,230
But on his journey,

746
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:56,630
he came to know his true calling.

747
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,670
Just as you will, David.

748
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,820
Father.

749
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,660
I had to be someone else
when you were a boy

750
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,030
to keep the secret.

751
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:29,860
Now you get to meet
your real father.

752
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:37,680
See, I've watched you
every step of the way.

753
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,410
You remembered.

754
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,570
You remembered
everything I taught you

755
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,640
- about how to get through.
- You killed those people.

756
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,750
You ruined their lives.

757
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,520
You turned us
into killers for a game?

758
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,260
David...

759
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,630
this is what
you were born to become.

760
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,660
Everyone in that gauntlet
was handpicked to test

761
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,040
your leadership,
your ingenuity

762
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,540
and your resolve.

763
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:11,140
We are the bringers
of God's wrath,

764
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,140
and you will be
our hands of death.

765
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,450
You will bring light
to the dark world.

766
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,050
You're home.

767
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,780
You're home, David.

768
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,730
David.

769
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,820
No.

770
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,330
And you know the rules
of the gauntlet.

771
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,170
You still have one final task.

772
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,840
David.

773
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,850
All I ever wanted to be
was what you wanted me to be.

774
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,820
Not what you're
asking me to be now.

775
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,290
Emma. Emma!

776
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,560
Kill me, my son.
Kill me.

777
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,040
Take my place in here.

778
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:18,970
Do it!

779
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:21,600
Do it. Do it.

780
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,850
Look at you.

781
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,370
Look at what you just did.

782
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:30,210
This is what you are.

783
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,620
Who will accept you?

784
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:35,090
You no longer fit in that world.

785
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,610
You've become something else.

786
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,590
You're right.

787
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:47,260
I have.
