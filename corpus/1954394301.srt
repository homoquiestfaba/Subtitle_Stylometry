1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,146
Try pineapple.
I'll have some of that...

2
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,181
that turkey jerky,
that smoked turkey?

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,650
It's excellent,
and it's quite tender.

4
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,517
Wake up, Tommy.

5
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,234
Lemme get a shot, Connie.

6
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,837
Last call was 15 minutes ago.
Oh, come on.

7
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,576
Get one for him too. Whatever he wants.
I'm tryin' to get outta here.

8
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,612
Connie!
Bill, you want one?

9
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,782
Nah.

10
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,518
Oh, that's pretty.

11
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,122
Thank you.

12
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,124
Hey, what's your name again?

13
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,063
Mike. Right. I'm Tommy.

14
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,745
Hey. Buddy?
Buddy? New guy.

15
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,482
Back door.
Front door's closed.

16
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,391
Whoa. I'll take it.

17
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,099
Okay, Bill, we're closin' now!

18
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,503
Everybody went home, Bill.

19
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,771
Bye-bye!
Everybody went home.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,375
Ahh.

21
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,686
Get me a three-quarter-inch
wrench, would you, Raymond?

22
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,271
Jesus Christ!

23
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,476
Your brother's here again.

24
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,846
You want me to go talk to him?
No, get me a cup of coffee.

25
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,645
<i>Just don't look at him.</i>

26
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,685
What is wrong with him? I don't know.
Let's just go.

27
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,821
He's been standin' out there
every day for a week almost.

28
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,158
Good. Let him. He'll get tired of it
eventually. Well,<i> I'm</i> tired of it.

29
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,729
Rob. I'm just gonna talk
to him, okay? Relax.

30
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,969
What the fuck, Tommy, huh?

31
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,472
What the fuck?
What do you want?

32
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,541
I just wanna know how it feels.

33
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,811
How what feels? How does
it feel to be a chump?

34
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,413
I don't know. You tell me.
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

35
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,416
You're bein' an asshole. At
least I know I'm an asshole.

36
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,353
- Question is, do you know it? <i>-Yeah, I
know you're an asshole. Everybody does.</i>

37
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,022
<i>No, no. Do you know you're an asshole?
That's the question.</i>

38
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,157
I'm an asshole? Right!
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,226
Hey, you're an even
bigger asshole than me,

40
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,695
and if you don't think you are,
you're a bigger asshole than that.

41
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,465
You know what I'm talkin' about, man.
Hey, don't...

42
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,134
Let go of my finger, man!
Ah! <i> Rob!</i>

43
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,136
Stop! Stop! I'll break it off.
I don't wanna hurt you.

44
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,138
Get in the car. Rob.
Rob. Take it easy!

45
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,141
Take it easy, man!
I'm warning you, man.

46
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,044
Jesus Christ!
Calm down.

47
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,266
Go, go, go, go, go!

48
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,425
Hey, Johnny!
Johnny!

49
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,628
Yo. Come here for a second, will ya?
Hurry up.

50
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,903
What's up? Sit in here and keep
your foot on the gas pedal.

51
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,272
I wanna run upstairs and change my T-shirt.
This stallin' out?

52
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,441
Take me two seconds. Yeah.
Take your foot off the gas.

53
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,443
Let me listen for one second.
It's gonna stall out.

54
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,845
I need to listen to the engine.
I won't be able to start it.

55
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,147
Just for one second.
Will you trust me?

56
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,150
Take your foot off.
Come on.

57
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,420
That's a serious problem
you got there. Yeah.

58
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,689
All right.
Good luck.

59
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,158
But you can't leave it there.
You're blockin' my driveway.

60
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,961
All right, all right.

61
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,111
<i>What'd you tell me</i>
<i>when you came in here?</i>

62
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,782
<i>- I know what I said.
</i> - You made me promise to cut you off after one drink.

63
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,851
Okay? One drink.
I already served you two.

64
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,286
I didn't make you promise.

65
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,288
Jackie, what'd he say
when he came in here?

66
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,791
He said he promised one drink
and then he's outta here.

67
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,993
You weren't even here
when I came in, Jackie.

68
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,596
You say the same thing
every time you come in.

69
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,798
What the fuck you listen to her for?
She don't know. She was here.

70
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,067
Hey, show some respect.
Bill, back me up on this.

71
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,069
Back yourself up.

72
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,972
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Just give me one.</i>

73
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,310
You're a weak man. That's why I drink it
straight. The ice cubes are too heavy.

74
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,447
Thank you.

75
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,117
Hold it. Ho, ho, ho, ho.
I'll tell you what.

76
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,254
I'll give you five bucks
if you don't drink the drink.

77
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,356
I'll do it. Don't get weird
on me, Victor, please.

78
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:48,226
I'm not gettin' weird on you. I'll give
you five bucks. See, you can't do it.

79
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,896
- Give him the drink, for Christ's sake.
- Hey, butt out!

80
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,098
<i>What the fuck am I gonna
do with five bucks?</i>

81
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,567
All right. I'll give you $10.
Ten dollars?

82
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,669
Yeah, if you don't drink the
drink and you walk outta here.

83
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,171
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>so insulted in my life!</i>

84
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,374
<i>Big money. Do it!</i>

85
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,709
Look at this.
Ten bucks.

86
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,845
Unbelievable.

87
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,980
Out, now. Yeah. You're leavin'.
Out. I'm leaving?

88
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,982
Go. Go ahead.

89
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,819
I'm a weak man, Vic!
You little chickenshit!

90
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,124
<i>See, I knew he couldn't do it.</i>

91
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,706
Can I help you? Yeah, I
was in here last week.

92
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:38,276
I left my number. Just wonderin'
if you found a mechanic yet.

93
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,580
No, not yet. Hey,
'cause I'm available.

94
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,115
I know you're probably still
lookin' at other possibilities,

95
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,185
but, uh, I could start anytime.

96
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,621
I remember you.
Where's your car?

97
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,891
My car? Yeah, when you drove
away from here last week,

98
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,893
your car stalled out
down the block.

99
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,995
It took you 25 minutes
to get it started.

100
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,432
Well, it's a piece of shit, but, uh,
I got it runnin' pretty good now.

101
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,502
So how come you're on foot?

102
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,504
Just felt like walkin'.

103
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,512
That's... That's...
That's my number.

104
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,582
If I'm not there, you can leave
a message with this guy Vic.

105
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,152
Thanks a lot.

106
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,214
Do you think I'm using you?

107
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,017
Oh, Theresa, please.
Do you?

108
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,053
No. I said
I was sorry.

109
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,055
How many times
do I have to say it?

110
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,524
Whose baby do you
think I'm carrying?

111
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:03,094
Tommy's, okay? Is that
what you want me to say?

112
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,864
Is that what you think I think? How many
times do we have to go through this?

113
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:10,068
Well, if that's what you
think... It's not what I think.

114
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,070
Look, I said I'm sorry.

115
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,510
He's drivin' me crazy.

116
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,712
Well, don't let him. Ignore him.
I know, I know.

117
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,781
That's what I do.

118
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,419
Yeah. You don't
even look at him.

119
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,156
It's like you're tryin'
to punish him or somethin'.

120
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,325
What do you think,
I'm playing games?

121
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,728
No, I don't think
you're playin' games,

122
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:40,732
but... you did go out
with him for eight years.

123
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,772
So what?

124
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,276
What do you mean,
"So what?"

125
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,013
What do you mean, what do I mean?
It's over. It's been over.

126
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,248
Yeah, well, you don't
have to be so fuckin' cold.

127
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,018
What do you want me to say,
I'm still in love with him?

128
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,020
Are you?

129
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,923
<i>No.</i>
<i>You idiot.</i>

130
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,593
Besides, if I wanted to be
with him, I would be with him.

131
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:12,497
And even if the baby was his,
I would still want you.

132
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,999
<i>What?</i>
Even if it was his baby?

133
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,337
- Meaning it could be.
- No, I was just saying that.

134
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,607
"I would still want you."
"Want." Not "love," want.

135
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,610
<i>What do you</i> want <i>with me?</i> Oh,
you are such an asshole.

136
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,278
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
Yeah.

137
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:32,016
Yeah? Yeah? Well... Hey, hey, hey.
I'm in there.

138
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,953
<i>Do me a favor and</i>
<i>tell me your name again.</i>

139
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,155
<i>Come on. I told you</i>
<i>twice already.</i>

140
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,091
<i>I know, I know. But,
you see, I wanna say...</i>

141
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,062
It's Christine. It's not Christine,
but it sounds like Christine.

142
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,097
What's this?

143
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,968
Look into my...

144
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,270
Crystal! Crystal. Yeah.

145
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,272
Oh, my God.
I'm losin' my mind.

146
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,274
Ah.
That's a nice name.

147
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,276
Yeah, you said that
the first time.

148
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,111
- I did?
- Rum and coke.

149
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,682
Yeah, you did. Well, I'll say it again.
It's a nice name.

150
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,786
<i>It's different. That's why I can't
remember it, 'cause it's unusual.</i>

151
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,788
<i>Yeah, yeah, it is.</i>

152
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,790
- Hi.
<i>- Is your last name "Meth"?</i>

153
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,058
No, it's not "Meth."
<i>No, I'm kiddin'.</i>

154
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,128
What are you doin'?
What am I doin'?

155
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,199
<i>My name is common, but
yours, I swear to God,</i>

156
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,501
Who's watchin' Anna? <i>I'm
never gonna forget it.</i>

157
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,604
- Oh, who's that?
<i>- Because now,</i>

158
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,374
now I got it
"embezzled" in my head.

159
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,376
Yeah. All right. All right?

160
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,378
Now I'll tell you another reason.
Why?

161
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:37,148
Because it's a pretty name, and
you're pretty like your name.

162
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,784
Thank you.

163
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,420
You're killin' me.
<i>Oh, stop.</i>

164
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,723
You're makin' me blush. Pretty
name for a pretty girl.

165
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,726
Gimme a kiss.

166
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,162
Forget it.

167
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,631
- <i> You gamble?</i>
- No, I don't.

168
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,667
Okay, good. I'm gonna make you a bet.
Connie!

169
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,669
Let me get two big
glasses of beer...

170
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,406
and a little shot glass of
beer here for Cleo... Crystal!

171
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,641
Not this stupid trick
again, Tommy.

172
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,245
What trick? Who do ya think you're
trickin' here, huh? <i>It's not a trick.</i>

173
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,113
<i>Be quiet, Connie.</i>
It's a trick.

174
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,749
It's a bet, all right?
It's a gentlemen's bet.

175
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,686
I bet you that I can drink
two big glasses of beer...

176
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:18,089
before you could drink
one little shot glass of beer.

177
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,894
But if I win,
I get to take you home.

178
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,929
If you win, you go home with me.

179
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,932
What kind of deal is that?
That don't make sense to me.

180
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,934
It's a<i> good</i> deal.
It's a good deal for me.

181
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,970
<i>I gotta see this.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

182
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,138
<i>You have to let me</i>
<i>finish one beer first.</i>

183
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,976
<i>You have to wait till I put my glass
down before... Let me get this straight.</i>

184
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,211
You're gonna drink one
full glass of beer. Right.

185
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,615
When you put the glass down, I'm
gonna drink this little, Yeah.

186
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,617
Eensy-weensy
glass of beer.

187
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,553
And you're gonna drink another glass of
beer, and whoever finishes first wins?

188
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,222
<i>But remember, you can't touch my
glass, and I can't touch yours.</i>

189
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,625
<i>Come on. Let's just do it already.
Wait. Hold it.</i>

190
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,628
<i>Connie, let me get</i>
<i>two shots of Wild Turkey.</i>

191
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,131
- Do you want me to leave?
<i>- Gotta warm up here.</i>

192
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,234
- I'm watching this.
- <i> One for you, one for me.</i>

193
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,403
Salute.
Salutey-booty.

194
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,942
- Whoo!
- Okay, here we go.

195
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,887
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

196
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,523
- You have to wait till I put
my glass down. - Well, come on.

197
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,794
Hey, wait a second. No!
You can't touch my glass.

198
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,796
Why not? That's not fair.
No, that's the deal.

199
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,965
- You can't touch my glass. I win.
- That's good.

200
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,134
- That's good.
<i>- That's not fair!</i>

201
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,569
<i>I know.</i>
Yeah.

202
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,206
I'm glad we could talk. <i>What trick? I
explained the rules fair and square. I win.</i>

203
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,343
- <i> No. You said it was a gentlemen's...</i>
- I'm not a gentleman.

204
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,545
Hey!
Hey, what...

205
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,750
I win, and you lose.

206
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,020
Yeah, that means
you go home with me.

207
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,023
We'll see about that. Think
you got it like that, huh?

208
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,039
Do me a favor? Yeah? Anything.

209
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,441
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.

210
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,745
Don't, don't sit with anybody
and don't talk to anybody.

211
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,014
No. And don't dance with
anybody else, okay?

212
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,316
I don't wanna lose you.
You won't.

213
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,318
All right?
Okay.

214
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,525
Mmm.
Want another drink?

215
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,128
I don't think so.
No.

216
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,697
You wanna sit down?
Uh, yeah. Okay.

217
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,799
Okay. Oh! Ooh! Okay.

218
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,335
Jesus Christ! You all right?
Yeah.

219
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,337
Okay.

220
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,709
Okay.

221
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,179
Sorry.
Okay.

222
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,249
I'm so embarrassed. It's okay.
It's okay.

223
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,251
They're not paying attention.
Ahh!

224
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,586
You all right? Okay. Okay.

225
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,022
Be right back.
I'll be okay.

226
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,725
Take me home after this?
Take you home?

227
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,727
Take me home.
Okay.

228
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,762
Okay. Hurry.

229
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,689
Oh, I'm hot. Hey, man,
you doin' blow in there?

230
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,127
What you fuckin' talkin' about?
You are, right?

231
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,063
Fuck you! I don't give a shit,
but don't let Connie catch you.

232
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,099
She'll 86 your ass right outta here.
Great. Yeah.

233
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,301
Oh, God.

234
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,144
I don't even know anybody
who does it anymore.

235
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,880
That's why I was surprised
when you... What?

236
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,416
Uh, you got good shit or what?
No, I...

237
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,885
I-I used to, but, uh...

238
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,354
Why, you want some? This shit sucks.
Does it?

239
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,125
I wouldn't mind just doin'
just a little blast,

240
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,927
'cause, uh, I got
somethin' goin' right here.

241
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,929
Aw, why not?

242
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,766
Sure hope nobody
comes in that door.

243
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,305
Hey. Freddie, how ya doin'?
Hey, man.

244
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,374
You done or what?
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,782
Freddie!
Yeah.

246
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,785
Later.

247
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,572
<i></i> Crystal?

248
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,642
Wanna wake up?

249
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,311
Yoo-hoo. Hey.

250
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,613
Come on. You wanna wake up? No.

251
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,083
Hmm?
Sorry.

252
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,125
Crystal, come on.
Come on.

253
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,794
Up-p-p-p-p.
Hey, what are you doin'?

254
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,830
Just gettin' her up. Just put her
back down and let her sleep.

255
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,470
Hey, hey, what are you doin'?
I need her car keys.

256
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,707
She can't drive, all right? She came
with me. She doesn't have a car.

257
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,809
I'll take her home. No, you're
not gonna take her home.

258
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,811
I think maybe you should
go home by yourself now.

259
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,813
No, she wants
to go home with me.

260
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,982
What's with everybody over here?
He's goin' through her bag.

261
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,451
Just... Connie, just... It's okay.
You wanna have a drink?

262
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,553
No, I don't want a drink.
Leave her alone!

263
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,689
Let her sleep, please!
What is wrong with you?

264
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,691
She's tryin' to sleep.
Tommy. What?

265
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,860
Leave her alone. Just relax. Sit down.
All right. You relax.

266
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,832
All right.
Nosy.

267
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,223
All right. Now you stay here, Anna.
Don't move.

268
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,828
Anna! Anna!
Get over here right now.

269
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,863
Get over here.

270
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,965
No, no!
I don't wanna go!

271
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:11,469
Oh, God! Please don't
do this to me, honey!

272
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,138
No, no! I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

273
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,076
Oh, man.

274
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:30,348
All right. All right.
Wait a minute. Quiet.

275
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,850

276
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,920
<i>Silence!</i>
<i>What do I wanna hear?</i>

277
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,922

All right. You ready?
Let's hear the Uncle Al song.

279
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,804
Uncle Al loves you too,
and he loves your mothers.

280
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,675

281
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,144
<i>Tommy!</i>

<i>Tommy!</i>

284
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,485
Tommy.

285
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,790
- What's up, Raymond?
- You sleepin'?

286
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,826
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:26,096
<i>Been tryin' to call you.</i>
<i>Did you hear about Uncle Al?</i>

288
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,865
No. What?

289
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,101
He had a heart attack
in his ice cream truck.

290
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,240
I'll be right down.

291
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,290

Yeah, it's smaller.
Yeah.

303
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,143
Hi, Tommy. Hey, Sandy.
Oh, your father.

304
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,379
God, I'm so sorry.

305
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,915
Hey.
Who's this?

00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,651
George.
George. Yeah.

307
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,786
Haven't seen you since the wedding.
Yeah.

308
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:59,189
The wedding. Yeah. He wasn't
at our wedding, George.

309
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,359
Oh, your wedding.
Yeah. No, I, uh...

310
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,862
I, uh, don't know what happened.

311
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,997
Sorry.
It's all right.

Tony.
Tommy's here.

313
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,370
I got two eyes, Josie.
Hey, Dad.

314
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,973
Doesn't he look good?
I think he looks good.

315
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,842
He looks better now, that's for sure.
Oh, please.

316
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,844
For Christ's sake,
your brother is dead.

317
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,582
Couldn't we have one day without an
argument? Just one day, I'm asking you!

318
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,617
All right. Get off my back.
I'm not on your back!

319
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,919
I'm just asking... Ma! Get
off my back, will ya?

320
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,921
Please.

321
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,592
I'm goin' in.

322

She give you any money?
No, and I didn't ask.

00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,268
Well, don't ask me either.
I'm not.

324
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,837
I can't keep giving you
handouts forever.

325
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:50,140
Did I ask you for anything?
I came here to see Uncle Al.

326
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,142
I didn't come here to get anything
from you. Don't yell at me.

327
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,179
I'm not yellin' at ya.
What do you... Okay, okay.

328
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,348
Okay.

329
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,790
Thanks.

330
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,097
Keep the pack. I got
a carton in the car.

331
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,700
Hey.

332
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,937
For weeks I said
he didn't look good.

333
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,041
Nobody listens to me.

334
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:02,546
<i>I just don't understand why he carried
on the way that he did if he knew.</i>

335
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:06,083
If he knew that... You know how many people
tried to change your father, Sandy?

336
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,285
It couldn't be done.

337
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:13,223
I couldn't change him. You couldn't change
him. Your mother couldn't change him.

338
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,694
My mother couldn't change him.
Nobody could change him.

339
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,831
Sandy, you want more coffee?
No, thanks, Aunt Josie.

340
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,468
I couldn't change him. Your
brother couldn't change him.

341
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,204
I was, uh... I was sorry
to hear about you.

342
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:31,141
About me? Yeah. Uh, Matt
said that you lost your job?

343
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,244
Oh, that.
Yeah. Well...

344
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,246
Whatever.
Yeah.

345
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,782
Well, you know, good
mechanic's not easy to find.

346
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,952
Shouldn't be too hard for you to get
picked up by another place, right?

347
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,855
Yeah. I haven't really been lookin'.
Just takin' it slow.

348
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,057
Ya know.
Good.

349
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,861
So... You know, if you're just lookin'
for a job just for the summer,

350
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,731
you should take over Al's truck.

351
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,167
Really? Yeah, Sandy said he
made out really good on that.

352
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,403
Uh...

353
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:03,841
Drivin' an ice cream truck. I don't really
see myself drivin' an ice cream truck.

354
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,243
Hey, Sandy.
How ya doin'?

355
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:11,181
- You saw him recently, huh?
- Your father?

356
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,484
Yeah, there was a poker game at
his house last Saturday night.

357
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,220
You see? I never
played poker with him.

358
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,890
He would never ask me. No, no, no.
I was just passing by.

359
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,359
The light was on,
so I, ya know, went in.

360
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,829
We should go downstairs soon.
Yeah, you're right.

361
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,466
You know what he said to me?

362
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:33,537
He told me to stay after the game
and have one last drink with him.

363
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,206
That's what he said. One last drink.
Really?

364
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,043
Did he say anything about me?

365
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,382
Well, yeah. I mean,
we talked for a while.

366
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,384
I mean, uh... I'll bet it
was hard for him, Matt,

367
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,555
because, uh, ya know, I mean, he
felt like he was a failure to you.

368
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,758
He made me feel like a
failure, you know? It's...

369
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,261
Like not even a fail... Like nothin'.
Like I was nothin'.

370
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,265
No, but you know why? Because he felt
bad about the kind of father he was.

371
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:06,103
So he had to make you feel bad. And then
that probably made him feel even worse.

372
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,106
That's why he hated me. <i> Come on.
He didn't hate you.</i>

373
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,341
<i>He didn't say he</i>
<i>hated you, Matthew.</i>

374
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,544
H-How could
he hate you?

375
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,413
I mean, who knows? M-Maybe
he thought you hated him.

376
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,415
You think so?

377
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,251
<i>No. Hey, come on.</i>
<i>Don't listen to me.</i>

378
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,489
I'm just... Hey, deep down,
he knew how you felt.

379
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,358
Ya know? Just like, uh, you
know how he felt about you.

380
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,595
But along the way, things
got fucked-up, ya know?

381
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,032
But so what? I mean,
everybody's fucked-up.

382
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,501
Ya know? But nobody wants
anybody else to think they are,

383
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,437
but everybody knows
they are anyway, so...

384
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,946
The thing I'm tryin'
to say, Matthew, is that, uh,

385
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:53,617
I think, in his own way,
your father really loved you.

386
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,686
<i>It's... It's</i>
<i>that simple.</i>

387
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,802
Uh, we should really get
back downstairs. <i>Yeah.</i>

388
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,675
<i>Fuck. I just did</i>
<i>your line, man.</i>

389
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,677
I'm sorry. No, hey, man.
You deserve it.

390
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,279
It's all right.

391
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,958
Hey, Bill, did... Did
you ever kill anybody?

392
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,496
What kind of an asshole
question is that?

393
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,865
I mean in, uh, Korea.

394
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,768
What career?

395
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,937
- No.
- <i> Hey, Tommy.</i>

396
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:50,440
We're gonna get some food. You wanna come?
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>

397
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:55,345
Listen, uh, Rob said if you come to the
station again he's gonna call the cops.

398
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,381
Did I come by today?
<i>No, but...</i>

399
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,850
you're comin' by
like every other day.

400
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,252
<i>So what? Anyway, what
are you, his messenger?</i>

401
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,254
<i>Look, I'm just tellin' ya.
</i> Now<i> you're</i> tellin' me.

402
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,024
<i>You're gonna call the cops now?
</i> Forget it.

403
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,726
<i>Remember somethin'. You wouldn't be
workin' there if it wasn't for me.</i>

404
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,330
<i>Am I supposed to quit</i>
<i>because you got fired?</i>

405
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,099
<i>No, but you could take my side for once.
You're my fuckin' brother.</i>

406
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,969
It was your own fault
you got fired.

407
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,004
<i>Oh, really? Who told
him about the money?</i>

408
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,941
Hey, he asked me. What was I
gonna do, tell him I took it?

409
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,843
No, but you could keep
your mouth shut.

410
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,781
<i>Why are you pissed at me? Every
time I talk to you lately...</i>

411
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,883
<i>Then don't talk to me, okay?</i>
<i>That's simple.</i>

412
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,387
If my best friend
stole my girlfriend...

413
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:41,291
and fucked her and knocked her up and...
fired me,

414
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,594
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I would do, man.</i>

415
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,531
Look, I asked ya. Now I'm
not gonna ask ya again.

416
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,566
Just move, all right?
What are you asking me?

417
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,736
- I said would you just...
- Hey, hey, hey, Matthew. Sit down.

418
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,138
- Just move, all right?
- <i>Raymond, sit him down, will ya?</i>

419
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,341
You big pussy. Hey! I said move!

420
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,643
You guys!
Hey!

421
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,312
- Not on that clean floor!
- Christ!

422
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,084
Come on! Oh, get
f... Get off him!

423
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,286
<i>- Matthew, come on!</i>
- <i> Get off me!</i>

424
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,822
<i>Matthew, go!</i>
<i>Go! Come on, man!</i>

425
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,526
Now calm down!
Calm down, all right?

426
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,795
What is that guy doin'?
Just calm down.

427
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:22,399
Get him outta here! I asked him
about five times all fuckin' night!

428
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,568
Everything's all right. You
want a drink on the house?

429
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,239
If I were you, I'd shoot him.

430
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,343
Who?
Your ex-boss.

431
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,812
What's his name?
Rob?

432
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:38,315
Rob?
Rob's his name?

433
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,283
What?
Rob?

434
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,488
He steals your girlfriend
and that's his name?

435
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,844
<i>So where's the fuckin'
after-hours clubs around here?</i>

436
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,917
Not here, man. Forget about it.
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

437
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:17,487
<i>Really? I really don't
feel like goin' home.</i>

438
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,625
Well, don't you have to, like,
work in the morning or anything?

439
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,594
<i>Oh, man!</i> What do you do, anyway?

440
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,198
What do you do?
You're a mechanic?

441
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:32,135
Yeah.

442
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:37,507
Yeah, I been lookin' around, but if anybody
calls Rob for a reference, I'm screwed.

443
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,376
Is the guy a scumbag or what?

444
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,745
Oh, he's pissed off at me.

445
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:45,315
<i>He's</i> pissed off at me.

446
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,651
'Cause the kid's yours or what?

447
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,154
Well, she's got him thinkin'
otherwise, but... Nah.

448
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:54,324
I mean, yeah, but there's this
other thing that happened...

449
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:57,227
right before he let me go.

450
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,230
What?
I borrowed money from him,

451
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:03,500
and, uh, I was
gonna put it back...

452
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,702
<i>You were gonna put it back?</i>

453
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,941
- Well, he didn't know I took it.
- Hold on, man.

454
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:14,478
You took money from the station?

455
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,013
<i>Yeah. I mean, it was a
Friday night, and, uh,</i>

456
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,150
I mean, he wasn't there, and so
I just borrowed this money.

457
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,253
I was gonna put it back.
<i>How much?</i>

458
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,623
<i>Fifteen hundred.</i>
Fifteen hundred bucks?

459
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,925
<i>Yeah. But I went</i>
<i>to Atlantic City...</i>

460
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,761
that weekend, and then, I don't
know, I just lost it all.

461
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,031
The first time that ever happened to me.
Where am I goin'?

462
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,802
Uh, three more lights
and you can make a right.

463
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,274
How 'bout here?
Where? Here?

464
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,776
<i>Yeah, man, I'm not</i>
<i>too far from...</i>

465
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,250
<i>Mind if I take another beer?</i>

466
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,588
See ya.

467
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,799
Fuckin' loser.

468
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,407
How you feelin' today? I'm
okay, but I'm a little tired.

469
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,809
Hmm. Do you want
my pancakes?

470
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,412
Mm-mmm.
I'm feeling fat.

471
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,414
Oh, I-I like you fat.

472
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,653
<i>I don't have to go today.
I can stay with you.</i>

473
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:32,289
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>You pitching today?</i>

474
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,192
<i>Yeah. Why?</i> Well, maybe if you
don't go, your team will win.

475
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,828
- Ah! Ha-ha-ha!
- You said I was fat!

476
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,865
<i>No, no. You said you were fat.
I said I liked you fat.</i>

477
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:46,436
- I said I was feeling fat. - Don't start
with me, okay? I'm not in the mood.

478
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:50,273
<i>I'm not in the mood today. Everything
I say is wrong.</i> I'm not starting.

479
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,510
God, Mr. Sensitive.

480
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,112
Is that a crime?

481
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,114
No.

482
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,287
What are you doin'?

483
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,490
I like you like that.

484
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,594
Yeah? You're so fat.

485
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:14,064
Stop. What do you got
in there, a Buick?

486
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,466
What is it?
Uh!

487
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:19,002
Rob. Come over here, will ya?
<i>We're ready for the cake.</i>

488
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,005
Bring that camera. Get a
shot of this beautiful face.

489
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,074
Really close.

490
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:27,077
What are you doin',
you moron? Not me!

491
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,347
Sandy. It's her birthday.
She's 22 years old today.

492
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,882
<i>Twenty-five, Dad.</i>

493
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:35,418
<i>Twenty-five.</i>
<i>What do you mean 25?</i>

494
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,587
I'm only 42 years old.

495
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,323
Right!

496
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,659
Right, and your name
is Pinocchio.

497
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,028
Oh, really? My name is what?
Pinocchio.

498
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,163
<i>Pinocchio.</i>
<i>Your nose is growing.</i>

499
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,266
Is it?
Uh-huh.

500
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,534
Can you see it growing?
I see it.

501
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,637
Look at it closely.
Uh-huh. I'm looking.

502
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,973
Then come over here and maybe you'll
get something else that grows, baby!

503
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,542
You are sick!
You are sick!

504
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,611
You're a bad boy!

505
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,613
<i>Don't be gross!</i>
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

506
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,448
It was him.
It wasn't me.

507
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,718
Here comes the birthday cake.
Here comes the birthday cake!

508
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:20,597
Can you guys liven this up a little?
I wanna sell it to channel "J".

509
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,599
Oh, yeah? You want me
to whip it out?

510
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,868
Don't, Tommy, don't!

511
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,537
Sure. Just let me get out
the microscopic lens here.

512
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,639
Ooh! Ah-ooh!

513
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,708
Them's fightin' words.
Put up your dukes.

514
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,710
<i>Raymond, attend me.</i>
Yes.

515
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,813
Kick him in the nuts.

516
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,215
I'm gonna kick your ass!

517
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,084
Prepare to die.

518
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,486
Yeow!

519
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,122
Hi-hi-hi!
Oh!

520
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,091
Ha-ha!

521
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,764
Hey-ah!

522
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,741
Oh, he killed me!

523
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,743
He killed me!
Oh, my baby!

524
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,112
Oh, God! He needs mouth-to-mouth.
Oh, yes, I do.

525
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,849
<i>Good idea. Mmm!</i>

526
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,851
Wait.
More, more, more!

527
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,886
Oh, geez!
I thought it was you!

528
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,389
I... Oh...
Darling! Oh!

529
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,391
She was saving my life.
You don't understand.

530
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,661
And who's gonna save you from me?
I... He is.

531
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,498
Help me, please. He hasn't told you yet.
We're together now.

532
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,500
I thought she was you!

533
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:34,137
- He didn't know it was her.
<i>- You're in big trouble.</i>

534
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,439
Here.

535
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,942
Don't get mad. Okay?

536
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,517
Vic. I knew you were comin'.

537
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,652
Pitcher of beer, man.

538
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,988
Hey, Billy.

539
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,990
Come home.

540
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,292
Why? I don't wanna
live there anymore.

541
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,829
Are we gonna talk about this?
There's<i> nothing</i> to talk about.

542
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,831
I get<i> no</i> support from you!

543
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,069
Oh, no. Just a roof over your
head, clothes on your back.

544
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,506
Food on the table.
Oh, God, I hate you!

545
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,711
What?

546
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,846
Victor. You got my 10 bucks?

547
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,882
'Cause if you don't,
take a walk.

548
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,950
I got your 10 bucks.

549
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,455
Victor!
Gimme a Wild Turkey.

550
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,668
Hey, Tommy.

551
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,870
What?

552
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,239
Sorry about Al.

553
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,011
Yeah, me too.

554
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
Hey, Vic.
Give Tommy a beer.

555
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,416
Do I have to? You
buyin' me a beer?

556
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,085
Yeah, I'm buyin' you a beer.
Wait, wait. H-Hold it.

557
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,121
Not, not, not that swill.

558
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,723
If he's buyin', I'll take
a bottled beer. Imported.

559
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,793
<i>What are you,</i>
<i>Mr. International?</i>

560
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,863
Payback.
Still hurts.

561
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,166
Should've bent it back further.

562
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,736
Thank you.

563
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,074
See ya later.

564
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,018
Hey! What the fuck?

565
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,960
Didn't you see me there?
Sorry, man.

566
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,395
Hey, Tommy. What's up? Fuckin'
gave me a heart attack!

567
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,331
You all right?
Yeah.

568
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,467
Hmm. Got a new fuckin'
problem, that guy.

569
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:47,437
<i>No, put the car in neutral</i>
<i>and turn it off.</i>

570
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,138
<i>I put the car in neutral</i>
<i>and turned it off.</i>

571
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,141
If you'd done that, James, it
wouldn't have jumped fuckin' forward.

572
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,143
Can we get two Budweisers?

573
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:57,413
<i>You 21?</i>
I'm 22.

574
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,482
You got I.D.?

575
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:06,155
He's 22. Can't serve
him without I.D.

576
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:08,391
<i>He shouldn't even</i>
<i>be in here without I.D.</i>

577
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,496
Okay, uh... He's with me, all right?
He won't drink.

578
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,201
What's the problem?

579
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,203
<i>Throw 'em both out.</i>

580
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:27,677
<i>Mr. Hyde!</i>
<i>So this is where you hide.</i>

581
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,513
No, he's Dr. Jekyll today.
Look at him. Grungy.

582
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,782
<i>I like it.</i> James,
you're pushin' it, man.

583
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,486
What, uh... I didn't even recognize you
sittin' there. You stop takin' baths?

584
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:40,123
That's funny, man. Funny. <i>Damn!
You know, it's bad enough...</i>

585
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:44,294
we gotta be workin' on a Sunday, and
then we run into our fuckin' boss, huh?

586
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,933
<i>Yeah, you look like you're
workin' your ass off.</i>

587
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,469
Look. Gimme a shot of bourbon
with that beer. It's on him.

588
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:58,007
<i>All right. Him too.</i>
<i>He's... He's 22.</i>

589
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,144
Thank you. What, you
own this place too?

590
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,580
Nah, he just lives here.

591
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:07,817
<i>I thought you were on vacation.</i>

592
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,656
You're livin' here now, huh?

593
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,159
You don't like your new house?
No, I like my house fine.

594
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,861
How 'bout Marie?
How she like it?

595
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,099
Well... See? See? I

596
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:27,103
What? I told ya you weren't
gonna like it out here.

597
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:30,406
Six months, you and Marie be at each
other's throats. Now it's been what?

598
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,575
Half of that?
I fuckin' told ya.

599
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,577
You never said nothin' to me.

600
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,579
I shouldn't have had to tell ya.

601
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:39,315
Marie's a city girl. So are you.
No, I hate the fuckin' city.

602
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,151
Oh, right. And this is
so much better, huh?

603
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,554
Got yourself a little
lawn you can piss on.

604
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:47,190
So what?
This Wonder Bread town.

605
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,326
Everybody looks alike, run around
like they all happy and shit...

606
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,595
when they're really
fuckin' miserable.

607
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:55,565
Just look around ya.
It's bullshit.

608

00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:11,080
Aw, shit.
What happened?

611
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,750
James hit him in the ass. James?

612
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,253
I'm teachin' him how to drive stick.
You need more drivers.

613
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,255
Fuckin' guys!

614

00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,265
Yeah.
You own that truck?

617
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:33,069
He owns like five trucks.
You own five trucks?

618
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,071
Yeah.

619
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:40,443
I could use some work, man.
I'm available.

620
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:44,514
I got a mechanic I use

00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:47,450
No, I mean as a mover.

00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,786
I'm stronger than I look, man.

00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:53,756
Uh... Oh... Well, I got
a full crew. I mean, I...

624
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:58,194
Come on, man. Ya don't gotta be a fuckin'
genius to move furniture, do ya?

625
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:01,164
You gotta have a brain.

626
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,011
Come on.
Just wait a minute.

627
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,113
Just wait one second.

628
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,452
Christ! Bill,

00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,454
Slow down.
Slow down, all right?

630
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,570

You wanna go get some breakfast?

Don't you ever stop?

635
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,764
No.

636
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,466
I'll see you tomorrow, Tommy.
You'll be all right.

637
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:13,636
Get some sleep.

638
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,177

00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,463
We don't want any.
Come on!

00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:44,467
We don't want any! Hey!
Get away from the truck!

646
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:46,969
Back up, man. You come on.
Come on.

647
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:53,910
Hey, you fuck!
Get away from the truck!

648
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,031
Where's Uncle Al?

649
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,766
He... He's not here anymore.

650
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,801
When's he comin' back?

651
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,637
He's not. He died.

652
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,406
Died?

653
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,810
<i>Who are you?</i>
I'm Tommy.

654
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:30,446
Uncle Tommy?
<i>Nah.</i>

655
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,116
Just Tommy.
You want somethin'?

656
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,706
Hey.

657
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:59,642
<i>Oh. Hey, Deb.</i>

658
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,645
I need some gum.
<i>Help yourself.</i>

659
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,253
I heard you were doin' this
now, but I couldn't believe it.

660
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,955
I haven't seen you in how long?
This is how you treat me?

661
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:16,025
I'm mad at you.
<i>What for?</i>

662
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,028
What happened between you
and my Aunt Theresa?

663
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,063
Why don't you ask her, not me?

664
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:23,666
She's smart.

665
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,701
'Cause she hooked up with Rob?
<i>He's smart too.</i>

666
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,971
He doesn't cheat on her.

667
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,341
- How old are you now?
- Fourteen.

668
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,611
- You're only 14?
- Seventeen, stupid!

669
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,148
- <i> When you gonna be 18?</i>
- <i> Why, you gonna ask me out?</i>

670
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,151
I might.
I'm a free man now.

671
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,822
- You're an old man now. - Yeah?
You wanna get out here?

672
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,925
Stop! Stop the truck. <i>What?</i>

673
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,761
<i>Oh.</i>

674
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,631
Hey, Lisa, what do you want? Can I
have a banana cream pie, please?

675
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,934
<i>Banana cream pie?</i>

676
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:03,439
<i>Uh, we don't have...</i>
<i>Uh, you like fudge bars?</i>

677
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:05,441
Just give her a fudge bar.

678
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,512
It's dead up there.
You should turn here.

679
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,856
Forget this block.
Make a left up there.

680
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,959
That's how Al used to do it.

681
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,333
Stop. Don't.

682
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,535
It gives me a headache.
Stop, please.

683
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:47,783
Hey, this is your street.
Yeah, you can drop me off.

684
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,919
You're not gonna go all the way with me?
No, I can't.

685
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,421
I have to eat. You
should take a break too.

686
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,757
Nobody's gonna be out
again till 7:00 anyway.

687
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,928
I was gonna go home. How
late did my uncle stay out?

688
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,931
9:30, 10:00.
That late?

689
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Man, you need training.

690
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,842
<i>Nice.</i>
<i>Very nice.</i>

691
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,979
Get in the house
and help your mother.

692
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,187
<i>Hey, Jerry.</i> You tryin' to
corrupt my daughter or what?

693
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,591
I'm sorry. I thought
she was allowed.

694
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:32,828
Aw, fuck it. You hungry?
You want something to eat?

695
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,830
Yeah.

696
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,041
This is excellent, Patty. Yeah,
this is good grub, Patty.

697
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,576
You wanna grab us
a couple more beers, please?

698
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:50,379
Thanks.
Hey, Slappy.

699
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:54,183
<i>You all right over there?</i> It's
good to see you again, Tommy.

700
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,585
Just because you don't go out
with my sister no more...

701
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,088
doesn't mean you can't
stop by once in a while.

702
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:02,091
No, I know. I will. I mean it.
I missed ya.

703
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,094
I missed you too.

704
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:08,898
The only reason I went out with Theresa to
begin with was so I could be close to you.

705
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:12,034
Oh, stop it.

706
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,103
<i>It's true.</i>

707
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:17,406
You know, uh, I used to have
a big crush on you.

708
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:20,709
Please.

709
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:23,612
Sorry, Jer.

710
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,015
That's all right. You two
wanna go upstairs? Go ahead.

711
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:28,517
Jerry!
<i>What?</i>

712
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,187
It was a joke. He made
a joke, so I made a joke.

713
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,590
<i>Yeah, but his joke was funny.</i>

714
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:38,594
The only reason I married Patty was
so I could get close to Theresa.

715
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,629
<i>- That's sick!</i>
- <i> What?</i>

716
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:44,100
Aunt Theresa was only 14 when
you and Mom got married. <i>So?</i>

717
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,202
She didn't look 14.

718
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,237
<i>Jerry!</i>

719
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,240
<i>What, not funny?</i>
No.

720
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:54,243
Tommy, you want some more roast beef?
Debbie doesn't eat meat.

721
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:55,744
No?

722
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,746
<i>She's a veggie.</i>
I am not.

723
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,349
<i>What do you mean you're not?</i> I
never said I was vegetarian.

724
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,418
I just don't eat meat
every night. It's gross.

725
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,587
What about chicken? <i>You know
what they do to chickens?</i>

726
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,890
<i>They keep 'em cramped together in little
cages and they peck each other's eyes out.</i>

727
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:11,594
Hey. What did I say about talkin'
about that shit at the table?

728
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:14,230
- She asked me. -<i> I don't
care what they do to 'em.</i>

729
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,265
I don't wanna hear about it
while I'm eatin'.

730
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:19,969
- Tommy, would you have some more?
- No, really, I'm fine.

731
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:22,071
We should go.

732
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:30,112
Hey. You're gonna get me
in trouble again.

733
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,582
Thanks a lot for helpin' me.
Sure.

734
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,051
It was fun. You need
some help tomorrow?

735
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,121
You want to? Yeah,
if you want me to.

736
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,991
Yeah, why not? All right.
See ya tomorrow.

737
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,860
It was fun.
Yep.

738
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,862
Bye.
Bye.

739
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,771
Don't he look like you?
He doesn't look like me.

740
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,340
He's got a mustache.
He's got tights on.

741
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,776
You could have a mustache.

742
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,212
We could get you... I ain't wearin'
no tights. No, thank you.

743
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:05,247
Anyhow, this is all fixed.

744
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,550
<i>Are you jealous?</i>
<i>Jealous of this guy...</i>

745
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,552
<i>with the tights</i>
<i>and the mustache?</i>

746
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,620
<i>He looks like one</i>
<i>of the village people.</i>

747
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,622
<i>Hey, Stan, where's your glasses?</i>

748
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,726
Billy, Stan got new glasses.
Show him your glasses.

749
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,362
He don't like 'em.
Get ready, Bill.

750
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,303
- You look like an idiot!
<i>- Go fuck, Billy!</i>

751
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,306
What'd you say that for? He looks
like Kissinger with the glasses.

752
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,308
I ain't wearin' 'em no more.

753
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,310
<i>Now look what you did.</i>
<i>I'm gonna squint.</i>

754
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,278
<i>Ha! He's gonna squint.</i>

755
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,801
You think he wants anything? I
don't think he's comin' back out.

756
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:21,156
Had a dream about you last night.
Really?

757
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:23,192
Yeah.
You're a jerk.

758
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,661
- What did I do?
<i>- Tell him what you want, honey.</i>

759
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:33,569
Hi. All right, big guy.
What do you want?

760
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:36,372
Blue cotton candy.
He loves that stuff.

761
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,308
Hey.
How ya doin'?

762
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,310
Hi.

763
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,714
- <i> What do you say?</i>
- Thank you.

764
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,951
Okay, thanks. Oh. I'm so sorry.
Hold on. Oh, 75 cents.

765
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,520
Here you go.
Keep the change. Okay.

766
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,995
You know her?
<i>Not really.</i>

767
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:02,364
Do you?
<i>Yeah, she's weird.</i>

768
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:05,034
- Why?
- I don't know.

769
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,970
<i>What's her name again?
</i> How should I know?

770
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:10,706
<i>- You just said you knew her.</i>
- What, do you like her?

771
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,841
What do you care?

772
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,484
<i>Watch it, watch it.</i>
Look out, look out.

773
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,556
Honey, these will stay here.

774
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,695
Why did I even bring
all this stuff?

775
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,730
<i>Here.</i>

776
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,865
<i>My ice cream really made a mess.</i>

777
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,968
Yeah. Can I get a bite?
You already had one.

778
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,539
All right.

779
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:45,574
Let me sit down.

780
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,976
Can I get a bite of yours?

781
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,145
Why didn't you just get one?
I don't want one.

782
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:54,249
I just want a bite. You always take
the whole sandwich, so don't eat it.

783
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,352
Don't let him eat it.
Hey, you pig!

784
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,987
Come on.
I wasn't gonna.

785
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,056
You were too.
I'm not...

786
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,295
Too big? You want me
to put it back?

787
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:09,231
That is really
disgusting! Ugh!

788
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,534
You don't want it now? Not after
you had your whole mouth on it.

789
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,404
Oh, yeah. Throw it away.
It's putrid, disgusting.

790
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:22,311
Great.
What are you doin'?

791
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,914
Let me have a cigarette. You
gonna smoke in front of her?

792
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:34,690
You miss Brownie? That's
why I brought him. Mm-hmm.

793
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:37,626
- Thank you.
- Ruff! Ruff!

794
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:43,332
I wanna move to the city,
or else upstate. No.

795
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,667
Where's she gonna go
to school in the city?

796
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,470
Huh? You gonna follow her
to class every day?

797
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:51,874
Sit with her so some idiot doesn't blow
her head off? We'll figure it out.

798
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,843
I don't wanna move, Mom. We're just
talkin' about it, sweetie, all right?

799
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,012
No, we're not. We're
not talkin' about it?

800
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:00,516
No. We're not movin'.
Upstate?

801
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,253
I could commute two, three fuckin'
hours every day to go to work? No way.

802
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:08,524
You don't go to work every day.
You go to a bar every day.

803
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,527
I'm on vacation. Huh! Great.
Some vacation.

804
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,463
You ever heard of Disneyland?
Are we going to Disneyland?

805
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,465
No, no, no.
We're not.

806
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:20,102
Fuck! You shut up! Hey!

807
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,038
You don't tell me to shut up.
I tell<i> you</i> to shut up.

808
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,208
Hey! Mike! What? Yeah, hey.

809
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,144
Let's go inside, babe.

810
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:31,146
Come on. Let me know
when you wanna talk.

811
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:33,148
Anna, gimme a kiss.

812
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:34,917
Hi, Mom.
You're back.

813
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:36,752
How was the movie?
It was all right.

814
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,387
Is he staying?
No.

815
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:52,634
Connie. Can I
get a beer?

816
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,871
What are you looking at?

817
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,609
Are you looking at my tan line?

818
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,981
Hey, Bill.
Did you eat?

819
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:10,586
Did you see the Chinese I left for you?
The noodles? Yeah?

820
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,855
You see my tan?
I got a tan.

821
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,023
I do look tan, right?

822
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,593
Don't I? Yeah, you look...
Yeah, you look great.

823
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,261
I don't look tan.
What?

824
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:24,166
What? I saw you today with
somebody in your ice cream truck.

825
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,502
That's Debbie.
It's Theresa's niece.

826
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,671
Ooh. Nice.
How old is she?

827
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,874
There's nothin' goin' on, Conn.

828
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:35,277
I just asked how old she is.
She's 17. Why?

829
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:37,479
I mean, I'm...
I don't... I don't...

830
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,516
I don't come here, I mean, much.

831
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,784
I didn't.
You know, but...

832
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,821
You look like you do.

833
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,525
Excuse me, hon. You're
gonna have to leave.

834
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,960
You have no I.D.
and you're not 21.

835
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,097
I am too. I told you,
my purse was stolen.

836
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,866
She's... She's telling you
the truth. I swear it.

837
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,868
You're gonna have to leave too.

838
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:03,405
Why? Why? I-I'm 21. I
showed you my proof.

839
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:06,041
You lied about your friend here.

840
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,410
- I'm not lying.
<i>- We're waitin' for my boyfriend.</i>

841
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:11,013
He'll tell you how old I am.
Who's your boyfriend?

842
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,348
Tommy Basilio.
Tommy!

843
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:24,626
<i>Eww! Don't lick it</i>
<i>so much.</i>

844
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,162
<i>You too, huh?</i>
What?

845
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:30,566
- <i> Think I'm disgusting?</i>
- <i> I didn't say that.</i>

846
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,735
- <i> Is this good pot?
- </i> -<i> Oh, like you would know the difference.</i>

847
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,238
I don't. That's why I'm asking.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

848
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:41,109
It is good.

849
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:45,547
I get too stoned if it's good.
Oh, it's okay.

850
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:49,284
It's just nice. You're not
gonna get wasted or anything.

851
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:52,187
It won't get you too high... <i> But
you gotta inhale it, though.</i>

852
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,590
- Or messed up.
<i>- Oh, really.</i>

853
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:57,025
- Well, she doesn't inhale her cigarettes.
- Get outta here.

854
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,328
<i>You don't.</i> He's right.
You don't.

855
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,130
So what?

856
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,367
That was really beautiful.

857
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:09,304
"That was really
beautiful."

858
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:12,741
Wow. I wasn't
laughin' at ya.

859
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,711
<i>You were.</i>
I guess I was, huh?

860
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:19,915
<i>No, with total</i>
<i>respect and wonder.</i>

861
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,784
<i>Ooh.
Oh, that was very...</i>

862
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:25,554
deep, heavy shit, Mike.

863
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:31,259
I'm serious.
I know.

864
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:34,496
- Yeah?
- Fuck you.

865
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:37,032
What?
I'm serious.

866
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,235
Me too. Yeah? About what?

867
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,106
About what? Yeah. What
are you serious about?

868
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,008
Anything at all. <i> What
are you talkin' about?</i>

869
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:49,011
Anything. Would you give me something
that you're serious about?

870
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,346
Oh, that's good.

871
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,548
Anything that you're serious about.
What's the matter with you?

872
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,550
<i>Leave him alone!</i>
Just shut up.

873
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,854
I'm askin' him. Don't
tell me to shut up!

874
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,289
You should shut up! Why don't you shut up?
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

875
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,927
<i>Kelly, I am so sorry</i>
<i>that I said shut up.</i>

876
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,464
Seriously?

877
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,466
- She's good.
- <i> I know.</i>

878
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:13,535
So that deserves somethin'.

879
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,705
Voilà!

880
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,707
Ahhh!

881
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,842
<i>You?</i>

882
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:23,278
Uh, I don't want any.

883
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:27,883
More for us. Uh, nah,
that's all right.

884
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:34,056
<i>- Amazing.
- Well, I'm gonna go look around.</i>

885
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:35,657
<i>Hold on.</i>

886
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,530
Do it. I don't care.

887
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,532
<i>I don't want any.</i>

888
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,908
Sure.

889
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,043
Might as well.

890
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:59,981
Come on. Dance with me.
It'll be fun.

891
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,350
Come on.
No, I don't wanna dance.

892
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:05,754
Oh!

893
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,659
Ooh!

894
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,412
Sorry.

895
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:42,657
Shut up. Shut up!

896
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:48,096
Oh! What? Everybody's gotta go.
Everybody's gotta go.

897
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,098
Now, now, now!

898
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,100
Out! Out! Out! Hey, don't push.
Come on.

899
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,470
Stop pushing us! Go on!
Thanks... for comin'.

900
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,539
Good-bye.

901
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,979
Marie?

902
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,649
Hi.

903
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:11,186
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
So sorry.

904
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,524
I know, I know. Me...

905
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:18,527
Would you get outta here!
Get! I forgot my keys.

906
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:25,901
Yeah. I know,
I just... I...

907
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,770
Shit!
Will you get out!

908
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,906
Go... what...

909
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,643
No, nobody.

910
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,645
Noth-Nothing.

911
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:40,515
Where's Kelly?
She went to the park.

912
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:44,286
I thought you were supposed to
stay over her house tonight.

913
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,288
I'm really stoned.

914
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,290
You want me to take you home?

915
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,625
No, I'm too stoned.

916
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,894
Hey, Deb.
What?

917
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:55,797
Are you stoned? Eee-ooh-ooh.
Shut up.

918
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:58,934
Whatever it takes.

919
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,936
Yes.

920
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,372
Will you just come home?

921
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,408
Please?

922
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,453
It's hot. Careful.

923
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,359
Is it instant?
Yeah.

924
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:26,428
No, thanks.

925
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,332
Ay-yi!

926
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,434
How ya feelin'?
Pretty beat.

927
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:36,638
You wanna lay down?
I'll fall asleep.

928
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:39,641
So what? You're supposed to
be at Kelly's house anyway.

929
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,643
If you fall asleep, I'll take
you home in the morning.

930
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:46,514
You sure? Yeah. Why don't you take the bed?
I'll sleep on the couch.

931
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,218
Do I have to go now? No,
we can go to bed later.

932
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,787
I mean...
You know what I mean.

933
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:06,468
<i>Nine, 10 bottles of gin
</i> So, tell me about Mike.

934
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,603
Mike?

935
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,613
That guy's some kind of a wacko.

936
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,782
<i>Why?</i>

937
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,685
I don't know. There's
somethin' wrong with that guy.

938
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:26,922
If I had a wife and kid, I
wouldn't be doin' what he's doin'.

939
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,925
<i>What does he do?</i>

940
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:33,094
Hangs out at the bar all the time.
He does shitty drugs.

941
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,430
<i>That's what you do.</i>

942
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,532
Yeah, but I'm not him.

943
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,303
<i>So you think if you and Theresa were married
and the kid was yours, you'd be different?</i>

944
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,605
Wait.
Where'd that come from?

945
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:46,975
<i>You said it.</i> I said if
I had a wife and kid.

946
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,110
<i>I didn't say with who.</i>

947
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,447
Well, what I meant about Mike was
what does he do for a living?

948
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:54,516
<i>I don't know. He like
owns some trucks.</i>

949
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:57,619
<i>He's got a moving company. He's
not really a friend of mine.</i>

950
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,621
Do you have any friends?

951
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:05,994
What do you mean,
do I have any friends?

952
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,997
- Yeah. -<i> You used to hang
out with my dad a lot, huh?</i>

953
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:12,033
<i>Well, he kinda had his own crew.</i>

954
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:15,170
- Your father knew some real sickos.
- Like himself.

955
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:18,773
<i>Hey, Jerry's all right.</i>
<i>Saved my life once.</i>

956
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,609
What, he was gonna kill you,
but he changed his mind?

957
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,611
No.

958
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:27,549
One time...

959
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,884
One time this guy
had me by the throat.

960
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,886
This big guy.
<i>Where?</i>

961
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,888
At the Trees.

962
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,291
I think I spilled my drink
on him or somethin'.

963
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,561
<i>So Jerry picks up one of
those big glass ashtrays?</i>

964
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,931
<i>And he whacks it down
on the guy's head.</i>

965
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,966
He scares me sometimes.

966
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:49,904
<i>So you used to get</i>
<i>in a lot of fights?</i>

967
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:52,374
Me? No.

968
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:55,543
I mean, my friends did
all the time, but, uh...

969
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,613
I was pretty useless when it came to
fights. They kept me around for laughs.

970
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,883
Yeah, I remember
when you used to be funny.

971
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,954
You remember
when I used to be funny?

972
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:09,524
Yeah, you and Rob would do<i> The Wizard of
Oz</i> for me when I was little, remember?

973
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:12,794
Yeah.
<i>The Munchkin Song?</i>

974
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:15,597
<i>Do it.</i>
Get outta here.

975
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,066
<i>Come on. Please?</i> No way.

976
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,536
Just a little bit?

977
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:35,717
<i>Do the Cowardly Lion.</i> No, forget it.
That's it. No more.

978
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:38,853
Oh! You used to be good
at imitations.

979
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:44,759
<i>Yeah, I coulda been somebody.</i>

980
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:49,097
Instead of an ice cream man, which
is what I am. Let's face it.

981
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,101
<i>Who's that?</i>
What?

982
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:56,371
Was that Jerry Lewis?
<i>Jerry Lewis?</i>

983
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,240
You thought that was
Jerry Lewis?

984
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:01,242
That's it.

985
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,812
You're goin' home.
Come on.

986
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,814
Where's your shoes?

987
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,350
Hey! What,
you wanna wrestle?

988
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,653
No.
Come on. I'll show you how.

989
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,089
I know how.
I'll whup your ass, Basilio.

990
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:16,458
Oh, you think so?
Oh, yeah.

991
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:19,027
Let's see.
Hey, you can't hit!

992
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,096
Why not?

993
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,366
Ow! Jesus!
Ow! Hey!

994
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,703
Ow! God!

995
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,839
Ow! I don't wanna
wrestle anymore.

996
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:34,042
Okay, okay.

997
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,984
What do you wanna do?

998
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:44,986
I don't know.

999
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,893
You wanna watch TV? No.

1000
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:56,764
You want me to take you home?

1001
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,833
No.

1002
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:43,611
Is this good here? I'd drive
you further, but, uh...

1003
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,947
No, this is fine.

1004
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:47,949
All right.
I should go.

1005
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:51,152
Maybe I'll see ya later?
Yeah, I don't know.

1006
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:54,022
What's the matter? I don't know.
I kinda feel weird.

1007
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,157
Don't you?
Why?

1008
01:09:56,226 --> 01:10:00,094
I mean, we just... We just
had some fun, that's all.

1009
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,230
Yeah.

1010
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,232
It's all right.

1011
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:08,536
See ya, Tommy.
Bye.

1012
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:12,840
Hey.
Don't forget your bag.

1013
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,376
Thanks.

1014
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:34,229
Oh, Christ!

1015
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:46,474
- You seen Debbie? - Hey,
Jerry, what are you doin'?

1016
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,910
<i>Lookin' for Debbie. What
are you doin' around here?</i>

1017
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:52,847
- You're lookin' for Debbie?
- That's what I just said, Tommy.

1018
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,583
She slept over a friend's house
last night, but she snuck out.

1019
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,719
<i>Girl's mother calls</i>
<i>about an hour ago...</i>

1020
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:00,421
<i>saying her daughter got busted in the
park, and Debbie wasn't with her.</i>

1021
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:03,424
- No? - No! And I'm
fuckin' pissed!

1022
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:07,362
<i>You at the Trees last night?</i>

1023
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,998
Uh, last night? No.

1024
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,300
I mean, uh, no.

1025
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,769
Why? I thought maybe
they were barhoppin'.

1026
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:18,006
- The girl got caught with a
phony I.D. on her. - Huh.

1027
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:24,312
Well, what are you doin'
out so early, Tommy?

1028
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:28,916
Just, uh, goin' to restock the truck. I gotta
get there early before there's a line.

1029
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,555
Yeah. Uh, okay, Tommy. Lemme...
Lemme let you go, all right?

1030
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:38,059
All right, Jer. Well, uh, let me
know if she's all right, all right?

1031
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:42,263
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:50,338
Fuck!

1033
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,423
She's home.
Where was she?

1034
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,925
I don't know yet. Will you let
me handle this? That's bullshit.

1035
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,761
She's gotta learn.
Jerry, I am warning you.

1036
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,498
Hey. I'm goin' upstairs to talk to her.
That's all, all right?

1037
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:21,636
I'm just askin' you a question.
Where were you?

1038
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,405
Fuckin' leave me alone!
What did you say to me?

1039
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,441
Hey!

1040
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,378
You slam this door
on me? Huh?

1041
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:33,848
You don't ever slam
the door in my house!

1042
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,132
Hello.
Hi, it's me.

1043
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:55,636
- Theresa?
- No, Debbie.

1044
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,472
Oh.

1045
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,474
What's up?

1046
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:03,311
My Dad threw a shit fit this morning.
Fuckin' wailed on me.

1047
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,614
- He what?
- He went nuts...

1048
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,617
'cause I wouldn't tell him
where I was last night.

1049
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,224
Tommy?
Yeah, I'm here.

1050
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,564
- Can I come over?
- Uh...

1051
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:28,202
Well, where's, uh...
Where's Jerry?

1052
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:31,038
He went out. I don't wanna
be here when he gets back.

1053
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:34,008
Well, I was just about
to take the truck out.

1054
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:37,011
- Can I come with you?
- Oh.

1055
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,181
I don't... I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1056
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,217
Why not?

1057
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:46,053
It... It...
It's just not.

1058
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,897
What do you think we should do?

1059
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,166
What do you mean?

1060
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:02,270
With my dad. Can you talk to
him, tell him I was with you?

1061
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:05,406
Ooh.
I don't know, Deb.

1062
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:07,775
You don't think
we should tell him?

1063
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:11,078
I, uh...

1064
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:14,549
I... I... I...

1065
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,584
I can't think straight
right now.

1066
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,925
Deb?
What?

1067
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:27,228
You okay? Did, uh...

1068
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,897
How bad did he...
did he...

1069
01:14:43,413 --> 01:14:46,080
Okay, Billy, easy does it.
Take a little sip. Drink this.

1070
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,216
That's enough. Put it down.
Pass?

1071
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,218
Relax. You better? I'm fine.

1072
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,220
Billy, listen.
You don't look so hot.

1073
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:54,222
Go upstairs and lay down.

1074
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,291
Here, wipe his nose.
Come on, Stan.

1075
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,595
Here, Bill. All right.
You all right, Billy?

1076
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:04,031
How ya doin', Vic?
You work last night?

1077
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,167
No, Connie did.

1078
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:08,169
She workin' tonight?

1079
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:10,204
She's supposed
to be here at 4:00.

1080
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,042
Gimme another one, will ya?

1081
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:18,212
While you're at it, give Billy one.
We almost had him there for a minute.

1082
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:21,048
Yeah, we almost did have him. That's why
I don't want to give him another one.

1083
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:23,017
Fuckin' guy don't stop.

1084
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,323
Hey, Deb.
Oh, hey, Tommy.

1085
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,160
This is my friend Puck.
Puck, Tommy.

1086
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,162
Tommy man.
How ya doin'?

1087
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,164
What's goin' on?

1088
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:13,634
Do you remember me? I'm Kevin
Kelly's little brother.

1089
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,804
Eddie. What do
they call you now?

1090
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:19,307
Puck.

1091
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:23,244
You play guitar?
<i>Yeah, she's good.</i>

1092
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:25,413
Let's go.

1093
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:27,415
See ya.

1094
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,853
You movin' out?
Yep.

1095
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,456
Hey, Tommy man. Can we get a
couple ice creams for the road?

1096
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:38,225
We don't have time, Eddie.
Let's just go.

1097
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:41,028
Look, would you just
wait a minute, please?

1098
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,097
Where you movin' to?

1099
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:47,068
I'm movin' in with my cousin Vickie
in the city for a while. All right?

1100
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:51,372
- I can give you a ride. - And
what, sell ice creams on the way?

1101
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,375
Really, dude, it's cool.
I don't mind takin' her.

1102
01:16:54,444 --> 01:16:57,378
Where's your cousin live?
263 East 10th Street.

1103
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:01,983
What?
Hey, Deb.

1104
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,819
Are you all right?

1105
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,424
Can we go? We're goin'.
We're goin'.

1106
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:16,731
Hey, Tommy,
I'll see you later, bro.

1107
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:37,084
- Who else was here last night?
- I told ya, nobody.

1108
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,086
This guy, uh...

1109
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,690
Tommy, from the bar.

1110
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,693
- What were you guys doin'?
- Hangin' out.

1111
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,834
<i>Ya know, can't I</i>
<i>have people over?</i>

1112
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:57,304
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>it was just you and him.</i>

1113
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:06,847
Ya know, I really don't
wanna talk about this anymore.

1114
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,849
Do we have to?

1115
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,819
I'm really glad you're home.
I really am.

1116
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,255
Really.

1117
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:17,091
So can we just...

1118
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,493
Can we just stop, please?

1119
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,034
You want some ice cream?

1120
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:31,238
<i>Go to second! Third base!
Third base!</i>

1121
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,182
Here you go. Who gets the change?
Me.

1122
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,017
All right, Mommy.

1123
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,188
Anyway, I come back outside.
The other girl left.

1124
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,790
Debbie didn't want to go home,
so she ends up at my place.

1125
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:52,593
- At your place?
- Yeah, which is not cool.

1126
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:54,829
Hey.
Can I help ya?

1127
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,997
Oh, this is Marie, my wife.

1128
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,400
Oh, hi.

1129
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:01,802
I'm Tommy.

1130
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:04,572
Tommy. You're the Tommy
who was over last night.

1131
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,908
Uh, yeah.

1132
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:11,512
We were just, uh... The bar got kinda
crowded, so we were hangin' out.

1133
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,547
Oh.
<i>Hope that's okay.</i>

1134
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,550
Oh, yeah. Sure. <i>You
got a nice place.</i>

1135
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:18,552
Thanks.
Thanks.

1136
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:21,422
<i>Uh, how much?</i>
Uh, five.

1137
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:25,726
<i>So I guess I'm supposed to ask if there
was anyone else over there with you.</i>

1138
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,728
Like girls, maybe?

1139
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,867
Uh... No. No. It was
just me and Mike.

1140
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:36,303
Huh. That was
a joke, Tommy.

1141
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:38,739
Oh.

1142
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,808
Let's go. <i>Yeah, there was about
five or six girls there.</i>

1143
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:43,677
<i>Oh, really?</i>
Yeah. Naked girls.

1144
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:47,114
<i>Naked girls? Sounds like fun.
Sorry I missed it.</i>

1146
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:51,285
Oh, shit.

1147
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:54,088
She was with you last night,

1148
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,056
Hey, Jerry.
Jerry, take it easy.

1149
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,726

1150
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,861

Jerry, come on, man!

1154
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,774
- <i> I fuckin' trusted you!</i>
- <i> Get off the field!</i>

1155
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,644
- Get off the field!
- <i> What happened last night, Michael?</i>

1156
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,446
Would you give me a fuckin' break?
What? What?

1157
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:25,619
I wish you'd just tell me
the truth for once!

1158
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,422
Ahhh!

1159
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,424
<i>Hey, hey...</i>
<i>Hey, fuck you!</i>

1160
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,861

01:20:36,766 --> 01:20:39,300
Jerry! Come on, man.

1163
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:42,036
I swear to God,

1164
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:44,371
You're fuckin' dead!
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1165
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,373
Get the fuck outta here! <i>Nothin' happened!
I swear to God!</i>

1166
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:49,510
Ow, Jerry!
<i>You're fuckin' dead, Tommy!</i>

1167
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:52,446

1168
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,915
- Jerry! Get him away from me, will ya?

1169
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,951
- Shut the fuck up!

1170
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,953
<i>You're fuckin' dead!</i>
Come on, man.

1171
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,355
Kiss your fuckin' truck
good-bye, Tommy.

1172
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:06,927
<i>Hey, Jerry, come on, man.</i>

1173
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,529
Jerry!

1174
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,966
Oh, man! You like that, Tommy?
Huh?

1175
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,368
That's my truck!
Hey, Jerry!

1176
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:20,174
Come on, man! I'm sorry, all right?
I should've told ya, okay?

1177
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:23,244
But, please... You like that, Tommy?
Huh? Huh?

1178
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,981
She's 17 years old!
I... I swe... Ah!

1179
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:57,611
Fuck you, Tommy.

1180
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,396
You didn't try anything
with Debbie, did ya?

1181
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,468
Oh, Tommy. She's like 17.
I know.

1182
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,604
I know, Raymond, but I...

1183
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:26,674
I swear to God,
nothin' happened.

1184
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:30,978
She... You know, she ended up
stayin' over and, I don't know...

1185
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:35,115
We... Nothin' happened. We just ended up
makin' out like a couple of high school kids.

1186
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:38,285
She is a high school kid.
I know. I was there.

1187
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,277
Hey.

1188
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,479
Hi. I heard
you were here.

1189
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,583
Who told you?
Your mother?

1190
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,585
What happened?

1191
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:15,990
I... I'll tell ya
some other time.

1192
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,992
How you doin'?

1193
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,894
I'm all right.
You look good.

1194
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,630
You just missed the baby.
No, I saw the baby.

1195
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,632
You did?
Yeah.

1196
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,634
Isn't he beautiful?

1197
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:31,772
He's so little.
He's a little old man.

1198
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,843
Can't they take
some of the wrinkles out?

1199
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:38,345
Cut it out. You gave birth to Mr.
Magoo.

1200
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:42,850
No, he's... he's...
he's amazing.

1201
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:47,654
What are you gonna name him?

1202
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:50,557
Um, we didn't decide yet.

1203
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:03,604
<i>Um... I know</i>
<i>when we were goin' out...</i>

1204
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:06,740
I was a jerk a lot, and, uh,

1205
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,044
I treated you like...

1206
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,212
Like shit?

1207
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,582
Yeah.

1208
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,584
<i>Yeah?</i>

1209
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,587
Well.

1210
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:22,589
I'm sorry.

1211
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:29,029
<i>I was really fucked-up</i>
<i>back then.</i>

1212
01:24:29,098 --> 01:24:32,366
Oh, and you've really straightened
yourself out now, right?

1213
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:35,536
I would if I had a kid.

1214
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:39,139
I mean, if we had a kid.

1215
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:42,342
Tommy.
<i>I would.</i>

1216
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,613
I mean, things...

1217
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:50,851
It was just so much better
when we were together.

1218
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,554
You just told me
how fucked-up you were.

1219
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,890
I know, but now I'm even worse.

1220
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:00,961
I don't know what I'm doin'.
I just, uh...

1221
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,868
I just feel like...
I don't know what I feel.

1222
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,437
I don't...
I don't feel anything.

1223
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,542
Except lost.

1224
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:22,116
Look, I was stupid to think that
I was gonna change you, right?

1225
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:25,986
<i>No, I know. I gotta do that
myself and all that shit, but...</i>

1226
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:29,156
if I had a reason...

1227
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:34,895
Look, I don't care
if the baby's not mine.

1228
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:38,465
<i>I don't.</i>
Tommy, stop.

1229
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:46,273
<i>I'm really tired.</i>

1230
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,812
Well, you mind if I just
sit here for a while?

1231
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:56,383
Um, Rob is gonna be back
any minute, so...

1232
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,428
Okay.

1233
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:21,575
I'm sorry.

1234
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:28,649
Yeah, I know.

1235
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,856
What?

1236
01:26:35,925 --> 01:26:38,859
You're drinking
the whole bottle, Vic.

1237
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:41,862
<i>This is my last one.</i>
<i>Then I'm gonna go.</i>

1238
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:48,135
Oh, geez!

1239
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,871
Thought you were Bill.

1240
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,907
What happened to you? Yuck!
Nothin' happened to me.

1241
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:56,009
Just gimme a Wild
Turkey and a beer.

1242
01:26:56,078 --> 01:26:58,378
Don't talk to me
that way, Tommy!

1243
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:02,382
I'm sorry. Can I just get my
drink and a beer, please?

1244
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:11,825
You know, your friend Jerry
was in here this afternoon...

1245
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:15,229
askin' if I saw you
and his daughter last night.

1246
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:17,497
Hope I didn't say
the wrong thing.

1247
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:20,701
Oh, like what? "I think Tommy's
boppin' your daughter, Jer"?

1248
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:24,738
I only told him what I saw. He
must've drew his own conclusions.

1249
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27,741
<i>Looks like he drew a conclusion</i>
<i>on your head.</i>

1250
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,846
"Conclusion on your head."
Yeah, real funny, Connie.

1251
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:36,083
<i>Hey. You're sittin'</i>
<i>in Billy's seat.</i>

1252
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:38,819
What is this?
So what?

1253
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:40,854
No respect.

1254
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,856
<i>Where is he, anyway?</i>

1255
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:47,661
- He's in the hospital. - He's in
the hospital? Wh-Wh-What happened?

1256
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,731
<i>He just stopped</i>
<i>breathing. Yeah.</i>

1257
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:53,200
Poof. Just like that.
Stopped.

1258
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:56,637
It's true. Wasn't like he
had an attack or nothin'.

1259
01:27:56,705 --> 01:28:01,041
He just fell off the stool
like all the air went outta him.

1260
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,076
Well...

1261
01:28:03,145 --> 01:28:06,146
Shouldn't... Shouldn't somebody
be with him? <i>Yeah, I'm gonna go.</i>

1262
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:08,215
I'm gonna go in a few minutes.

1263
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:11,585
<i>Come on.
You've been sayin' that for an hour.</i>

1264
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:14,121
By the time you get there,
he'll be dead already.

1265
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:16,657
<i>Hey, I'll go when I feel
like it, all right?</i>

1266
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:18,792
<i>When I'm ready, then I'll go.</i>

1267
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:21,128
<i>He's gonna be all right.</i>

1268
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,264
Oh, come on. Don't talk
like an idiot, Stan.

1269
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:28,101
Don't call me an idiot, Jackie!
Well, then don't talk like one.

1270
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,704
<i>Listen. He's gonna be fine.</i>

1271
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:33,807
<i>They just have to clean out</i>
<i>his system is all.</i>

1272
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:37,044
<i>What the hell are you talkin'
about, cleanin' out his system?</i>

1273
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:40,247
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>shut up, Jackie?</i>

1274
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,517
Gimme a quarter, Conn,
for the box.

1275
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:45,719
You're not gonna play
that song again.

1276
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:48,388
Just be quiet.
