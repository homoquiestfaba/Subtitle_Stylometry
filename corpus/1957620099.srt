00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,740
You're a man.

175
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,221
Have been... for years.

176
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:49,093
I'm sorry, it's just that
I was expecting a--

177
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:52,793
all the other applicants
have been female.

178
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,795
Sit down, please.

179
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,537
Well, at least
you won't forget my face.

180
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,021
Well, your
test scores indicate

181
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:07,590
your skills are excellent,
Mr. Dante.

182
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:11,072
As a matter of fact,
you might be overqualified.

183
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:15,424
Would you mind telling me
why you want to be
a secretary?

184
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,601
I like doing
what I'm good at.

185
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,605
And you feel you have
the proper temperament
for this kind of work?

186
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,740
Look, Miss Morgan,
let me be honest with you.

187
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,267
I'm a very talented guy,
if I do say so myself.

188
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,053
I appreciate your honesty,
Mr. Dante.

189
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,055
I'm sure you'll
appreciate mine, too.

190
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,144
You see, 
in the last year,

191
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,059
I've had three
excellent secretaries,

192
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:45,497
all of whom were
healthy, energetic,
and hard working.

193
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,457
And one by one,
they all left

194
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,242
because they chose
to get married

195
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,506
rather than pursue 
their careers.

196
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,683
Now, I have
a very successful,

197
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,641
demanding law practice here,

198
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,470
and I feel like I'm running
a finishing school.

199
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,560
I really need someone
who wants to be
a secretary.

200
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,170
Well, you have him.

201
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,129
I don't want 
to get married.

202
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,784
I'm not even dating
anyone right now.

203
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,352
I don't want a wife.
I want a job.

204
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,877
Well, I appreciate
your coming in,

205
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,008
but I have several other 
applicants to see.

206
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,444
I am better than they are.

207
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:22,012
Well, perhaps,
but I think to be fair--

208
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,666
To be fair, 
you'll give me 
the chance.

209
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,537
Let me make
a deal with you.

210
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,366
Give me two weeks
to prove myself,

211
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,544
and I guarantee
you'll wonder how you
ever did without me.

212
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:35,199
And if I don't?

213
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,853
Well, then, I'm gone--

214
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,028
out the door,
no questions asked.

215
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:42,598
- Two weeks.
- One week.

216
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,733
- You won't be sorry.
- I hope not, Mr. Dante.

217
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:49,300
- When can you start?
- Oh, I just did.

218
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,476
Please call me Alex.

219
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,262
All right, Alex.
We have an awful lot
of work to do

220
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,393
since I've been
without someone.

221
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,874
What should I call you?

222
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,441
I beg your pardon?

223
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,618
What should I call you?

224
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,490
You should call me
Miss Morgan.

225
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,406
Oh. Sure.

226
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,627
Miss Morgan, sure.

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,716
What I'd like you to do,
first of all, Alex,

228
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,589
is acquaint yourself
with the account of
the Sherman Brothers.

229
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:21,202
Miss Morgan,
your mother's here.

230
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,771
- Brenda? Oh, hi, darling.
- Oh, Mother, hi.

231
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,729
- Careful, this is dripping.
- All right, I got it.

232
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,427
Oh, you've been
shopping, I see.

233
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,299
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

234
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,866
Are you gonna 
stay for lunch?

235
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,868
No, no.
I can only stay a minute,
and I, um...

236
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:38,480
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my new secretary
Alex Dante.

237
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,308
This is my mother 
Edith Pierce.

238
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,440
- Alex: Nice to meet you. 
- Nice meeting you, Alex.

239
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,877
Listen, why don't
you ask Debbie,

240
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,530
who is the receptionist,
where those files are?

241
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,228
- All right.
- Thanks.

242
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:53,408
Hmm. Male secretary?

243
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:56,019
- Men type faster.
- Huh?

244
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,587
- Shorter nails.
- Ah.

245
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,546
What happened to Jane?

246
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,635
She moved to Alaska.

247
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,247
Alaska?
Alaska is loaded
with eligible men.

248
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,379
I bet she won't
be single long.

249
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,207
Probably not.

250
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,993
Well, Frank is going
to pick me up here

251
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,646
and then we're gonna
go to a matinee,

252
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,998
but, uh, first, I--

253
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,043
I wanted to give you this.

254
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,132
Oh, thank you.

255
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,395
How sweet.

256
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,223
Why are you wearing
your hair like that?

257
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,573
It was raining out,
Mother.

258
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,066
You don't like it,
do you?

259
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,157
Well, I don't think
it's really me.

260
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:53,555
Well, I should
have known better.

261
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,818
I just thought
maybe you'd like
something different,

262
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:58,168
something with
a little pizazz.

263
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,605
Mother, have I ever 
done anything,

264
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,564
have I ever said anything,

265
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,827
that indicated to you
in any way, shape, or form

266
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,961
that I was interested
in pizazz?

267
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:11,529
Darling, I don't wanna
hurt your feelings.

268
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,401
I mean,
you know how proud
I am of you.

269
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,839
I think you are brilliant
I think you are beautiful.

270
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,710
It's just that
I don't understand,

271
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,061
with all your success 
and all the people you know,

272
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:24,368
you have never 
gotten married.

273
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,980
Maybe I've just never
met my dream man.

274
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,026
There are no dream men,
Brenda, there are
only dreams.

275
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,899
Would you cross-stitch that
on a sampler for me?

276
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,204
I'd like to hang that
above my phone.

277
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,860
Okay. I give up.
I give up!

278
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,558
I always say
the wrong thing.

279
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,473
Well, at least
you're consistent.

280
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:45,476
- [ knock on door ]
 - Hi. Anybody home?

281
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,478
Come on in, Frank.

282
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:48,740
Your wife was 
just telling me

283
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,612
what's wrong 
with my life.

284
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:54,224
Oh, really?
That's so unlike her.

285
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,705
- I hate to rush you--
- I know, I know.

286
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,402
Darling, I don't wanna
argue with you.

287
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,969
I just want you
to be happy.

288
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,145
I am happy, Mother.

289
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,886
Won't you just
let me be happy?

290
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,846
Yeah, you have my word.
The subject is closed.

291
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,330
Um, who sent you
the flowers?

292
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,770
My dentist.

293
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,077
Perfect checkup.

294
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,601
- Bye.
- Bye.

295
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,603
Frank: 
Bye, love.

296
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,826
Oh, Miss Morgan,
these are ready
for you to sign.

297
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,828
- They're all ready?
- Yeah.

298
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,309
Have you checked
for errors?

299
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,354
Ready to go.

300
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:40,575
Oh. They actually
look very good.

301
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,794
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

302
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,448
Now, if there
isn't anything else--

303
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,843
Actually, Alex,
there's one thing.

304
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,586
Um, do you own a suit?

305
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,676
- A suit?
- Yeah, a real suit.

306
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,374
You know, something dark,
something conservative.

307
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,379
No, I don't.
Is it that important?

308
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,556
Well, we maintain a very
businesslike image here,

309
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,993
and proper clothes--

310
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,691
Make the proper man, right?

311
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,520
Well, they certainly do
make good impressions,

312
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:17,090
and good impressions,
particularly first ones,
are very important.

313
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,267
I'll see what
I can come up with.

314
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,182
I'd appreciate that.

315
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,798
- [ knock on door ]
- Hi, Brenda?

316
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,713
Oh, hi, come on in.

317
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,761
Um, do you have change
for a 50?

318
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,415
I have to take a cab.

319
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,463
I'm not sure.
Let me take a look.

320
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,160
Where you going?

321
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,771
There's a new band
playing at the Palladium.

322
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,860
Rodney, it's 10:30.

323
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,427
Where are your parents?

324
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,517
Well, Mom's in Denmark
and Dad's in Argentina.

325
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,476
Or maybe it's
the other way around.

326
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,521
Well, I'm sure they don't
want you running around

327
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,393
all over at this
time of night.

328
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:04,137
Brenda, I'm not a child.
I'm a bachelor.

329
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,704
- There's a difference?
- There's a big difference.

330
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,880
Do you realize
that if I got hit by
a truck tomorrow,

331
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,621
I could die a virgin?

332
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,493
So would a lot of
other people your age.

333
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,365
Yeah, don't bet on it.

334
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,498
You're in the 10th grade,
Rodney.

335
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,065
Hey, why don't you
come with me?

336
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,328
Senior citizens
are half price.

337
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:24,418
Thanks, but, uh,

338
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,550
I haven't finished
my homework.

Okay, well, next time
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,525
Oh, hi.
I thought you'd left
for the weekend.

345
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:47,528
Well, before I go,
I wanted to ask you,

346
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,051
what do you think?

347
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,011
You haven't said
anything about my suit.

348
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,362
Ah.

349
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,364
Well, it's an improvement.

350
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:01,107
But I'm afraid the boots
are gonna have to go, Alex.

351
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:06,286
Well, I do a lot of walking.
In fact, I walk to work.

352
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,724
You can ruin your feet
if you don't have
the right kind of shoes.

353
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,682
Well, fine,
wear them for walking.

354
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,728
Just get another
pair of shoes to keep
here at the office.

355
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,557
You know, real shoes.

356
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,822
Is something wrong?

357
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:23,303
Uh, you're missing
a button.

358
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:26,567
[ gasps ]
Oh, no.

359
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,613
Oh, Lord, I hope
I haven't lost it.

360
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,054
- Oh, here it is.
- Where?

361
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,926
Oh, great.
I'll have Debbie
sew it on.

362
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,624
- She's gone.
- Really?

363
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,279
I'll do it.

364
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,325
You can sew?

365
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,283
I'm really good
with my hands.

366
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,982
Well,
I'm sure you are.

367
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,291
In my family,

368
00:17:55,335 --> 00:18:00,557
the boys also had to learn
how to cook and sew.

369
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,993
And the girls had to learn

370
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:06,694
how to change a flat
and build a fire.

371
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:11,002
That's very enlightened.

372
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,135
Well, can you change a flat?

373
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,746
No, but I can
build a fire.

374
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,271
I'll bet you can.

375
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:30,152
You really should
learn how to change a flat.

376
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:33,286
You never know
when you'll be driving down
some deserted road

377
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,679
and... trouble.

378
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:39,509
I have, um, AAA.

379
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,685
That won't do you much good
if there's no phone.

380
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,819
I have a car phone.

381
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:49,650
Well, you do think
of everything.

382
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,565
I try to.

383
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,223
Okay.

384
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,749
Well, now all I need
is scissors.

385
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,143
Well, I think there's one
in the drawer here.

386
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,319
Let me just get it
real quick with me teeth.

387
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,190
Look who I found
roaming around the--

388
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,887
Oh.

389
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,107
Oh. Excuse me.

390
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,674
Brian, what are you
doing here?

391
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,502
I was sewing on
her button, sir.

392
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:18,026
Oh, of course.

393
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:22,596
Brian, this is
my secretary Alex.

394
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,688
Well, I'm just about
set to go.

395
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,691
Can't wait to get out
in that fresh country air.

396
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:35,391
We're going away for
a very romantic weekend.

397
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,438
Thank you for sewing
on my button, Alex.

398
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,004
You're welcome.

399
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:42,529
Bye.

400
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:47,229
Bye, everyone. Bye!
Have a nice weekend.

401
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,013
Bye, everyone! Bye!

402
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,236
Woman: 
I just can't believe it.

403
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,151
Everything 
was going so well.

404
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,109
I just can't believe 
he went back to his wife.

405
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,024
Brenda: 
Sheila, they all go back 
to their wives.

406
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,896
It's in their 
job description.

407
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,028
Sheila: 
But he said how boring 
and helpless she is.

408
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,466
I know he was crazy
about me.

409
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,903
Brenda:
Well, of course he was.

410
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,122
Look, men are
attracted to us

411
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,124
because we're independent
and assertive

412
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,301
and capable
and successful.

413
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,173
And the minute
we get comfortable
in the relationship,

414
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,436
the bastards drop us,
because we're independent

415
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
and assertive and capable
and successful.

416
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,615
- I know you warned me.
- Sheila, may I
 speak frankly?

417
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,662
- I'm not sure.
- You have terrible
 taste in men.

418
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:30,316
I mean,
you could be in a room

419
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,361
full of Fortune 500
executives,

420
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:35,321
and end up going home
with a bodyguard
named Guido.

421
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,323
I'm open-minded.

422
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,542
I believe in giving
everybody a chance.

423
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:40,935
Besides,
I keep remembering

424
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:43,329
something my
Aunt Millie said.

425
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,808
Which was?

426
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,985
Well, she was so terrific

427
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,945
and beautiful and talented,

428
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,991
and I could never understand
why she never got married.

429
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,733
So, one day I asked her.

430
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:59,040
- And you know
 what she said?
- What?

431
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,782
She said...

432
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,525
"Because the last time
someone asked me,

433
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,049
I didn't know
that was gonna be

434
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:13,315
the last time
someone asked me."

435
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,535
Oh, honey.

436
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,496
You wanna go shopping?

437
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:26,241
I just spent $600
on my lunch hour.

438
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,113
And I have
a blind date tonight.

439
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,899
Sheila!
Come on, not again.

440
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,554
Well, he's supposed
to be very nice.
A film producer.

441
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:37,208
His name is Charles Hasberg.
Maybe you've heard of him?

442
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,298
No, I haven't,
but do me a favor.

443
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,170
Don't sign any contracts
until you've talked
to your lawyer.

444
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,869
- How's that for service?
- Mmm!

445
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,871
Oh, Alex.

446
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,396
We have beautiful
bone china cups

447
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:54,095
that are much nicer
to drink from
than Styrofoam.

448
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,706
Besides, these aren't
biodegradable.

449
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,839
Well, I didn't know
it made a difference.

450
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,754
- I'll get you a fresh cup.
- No, don't bother right now.

451
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,843
What I really need
is that Actel report.

452
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,975
Would you bring it in
as soon as it's ready?

453
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,500
Here it is,
right in front of you.

454
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:11,242
I cross-referenced
the arguments with
the statistical charts,

455
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,767
so I think 
that ought to help.

456
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,772
Huh.

457
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,165
This is excellent, Alex.
Excellent.

458
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,780
Good.

459
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:29,565
Um...

460
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:33,090
do you realize that my
trial period is up today?

461
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,005
No, I...

462
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,271
Alex, are you wearing
an earring?

463
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:44,972
Yes, I'm wearing
an earring.

464
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,191
Would you mind
not wearing an earring?

465
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:50,151
To the office, I mean?
What you do on your own time
is your business,

466
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,283
but if you're going to be
greeting clients--

467
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:56,244
Oh, then I got the job?

468
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:59,595
Have payroll put you
on the health plan.

469
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,597
Good. Good.

470
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:04,426
I hope you're not going to
lose your enthusiasm.

471
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,863
Miss Morgan,
you're about to learn

472
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:10,084
that I have
many qualities,

473
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:13,609
and enthusiasm...

474
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:14,871
is just one of them.

475
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,395
Yes!

476
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,754
Oh, no.

477
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:30,321
Ah. Oh.

478
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,239
Listen, Brenda--

479
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:39,548
- Hey, you got something
 on your dress.
- I know.

480
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,334
- Sherman Brothers needs you
 in London on Thursday.
- Fine.

481
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:45,598
The ship's captain 
is meeting with 
the board of directors.

482
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,164
You can get all
the depositions then

483
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,775
and have time to prepare
for the hearing.

484
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,298
It will be 
a lot of paperwork,

485
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,605
so you better 
take your secretary.

486
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,128
Alex?

487
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:57,479
He is your secretary,
isn't he?

488
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:00,351
I can be ready
in ten minutes.

489
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:06,227
[ bells tolling ]

490
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,382
- Sorry.
- To avoid jet lag,
 don't nap.

491
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,907
Stay up all day and then
go to bed early tonight.

492
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,214
We've got a meeting
tomorrow morning at 8:30.

493
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:40,130
[ sighs ]

494
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,963
This place is too much. Ha!

495
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,096
We have such
a tight schedule.

496
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,881
I'm afraid there
won't be much time
for sight-seeing.

497
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,898
You have a reservation
for Brenda Morgan

498
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,553
and Alex Dante.

499
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,427
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow morning

500
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,648
in the dining room
at 8:30, okay?

501
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:22,651
- Oh, uh, Miss Morgan?
- Yes?

502
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:26,263
You're gonna be great.
Don't worry about anything.

503
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:30,050
Yeah, me against
twelve guys in wigs.

504
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,140
Sounds about even.

505
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,713
Well,
as my esteemed colleague

506
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,237
Miss Morgan must realize,

507
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,282
the question of liability
in this case

508
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,936
is not quite so simple

509
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,635
as in the child's tale
of Henny Penny.

510
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,159
When she was hit
on the head by an apple,

511
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:55,641
no one suggested 
that the entire orchard 
be cut down

512
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:58,513
to prevent it
from happening again.

513
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,428
I thank you.

514
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,475
Miss Morgan?

515
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,394
My Lord,
might I suggest that

516
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,875
had Henny Penny
had a good lawyer

517
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,660
who had advised her
of her rights,

518
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,445
she'd own
that orchard today.

519
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,665
Now, before
I begin my remarks,

520
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,102
I'd like to refresh
the court's memory

521
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:25,148
about the damages
suffered by my client

522
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:28,282
as illustrated in these 
documents and photographs

523
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,197
submitted for evidence.

524
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:36,246
You were fantastic.
I can't wait for
the summation on Monday.

525
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,118
I'm sorry you've got
to stay over the weekend.

526
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,773
What, are you kidding?
I got a free weekend
in London.

527
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,601
I should take you out
and celebrate,

528
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,472
unless you're too tired.

529
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:46,692
- I don't get tired.
- Good. Neither do I.

530
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,783
- Hi.
- Ready?

531
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,829
- [ phone rings ] 
- Just a second.

532
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:57,267
Hello?

533
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,748
Brian, hi.

534
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,664
I'm glad you got my message.

535
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,579
Oh, I'm sorry.

536
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:09,366
How can you be angry
when I just said I'm sorry?

537
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,982
Do you think
I want to spend
the entire weekend

538
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,461
locked up
in my room working?

539
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,556
Look,
I'll make it up to you
when I get home.

540
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,124
I promise,
I'll be worth waiting for.

541
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,432
Okay?

542
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,783
Okay.

543
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,480
Bye-bye.

544
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,316
- The beer is warm, too.
- Oh, good.

545
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,146
Oh, and after this,
I heard about a club that
sounds like a lot of fun.

546
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,322
- You a music lover?
- Oh, sure.

547
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,237
Good. Cheers.

548
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,685
- [ music playing ] 
- [ chattering ]

549
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,865
[ chatter continues ]

550
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:16,042
Wow! This is great!

551
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,588
So, what are you
doing tomorrow?

552
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,330
Working on the case
all day.

553
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,854
I heard there's a really
great flea market
at Portobello Road.

554
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:15,117
- Have you ever been?
- Oh, years ago.

555
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,380
Great, you can be my guide.

556
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:20,035
Oh, I can't, really.
I've got a lot of
reading to do, and...

557
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:25,998
Well, now that I've
singlehandedly rescued
the British economy,

558
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,608
what are we doing
tomorrow?

559
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,218
I wanna be
out of here by 7:00

560
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,829
because
of the changing
of the guard.

561
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,831
Oh, Miss Morgan,
there are some flowers
here for you.

562
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,921
- Oh, thanks.
- I got them.

563
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,705
Wow.

564
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:45,800
I guess you and
Dr. Anderson are
quite the item, huh?

565
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,325
Well, you know
how hard it is
to find a good dentist.

566
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,198
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

567
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,808
Sharp.

568
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,957
[ no audible dialogue ]

569
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,313
You cold?

570
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:21,618
No.

571
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,533
Here.

572
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,929
Put this on.

573
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,844
Thank you.

574
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,635
Did you ask Debbie
to send that telex?

575
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,246
- Yes, I did.
- Good.

576
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,074
I told you.

577
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,727
She said she'd send them
first thing tomorrow morning,

578
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,816
- so till then...
- Yeah?

579
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,688
why don't you forget
about the office?

580
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:50,821
I mean, look at that.

581
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:54,303
I think it's nice
that you and Debbie
get along so well.

582
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:57,959
It's rare that
a man and a woman
work well side by side.

583
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:01,441
And I think it's really nice
for her to get more insight

584
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:04,574
into her male-female
relationships.

585
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:07,969
You know,
you being a man and all,

586
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,189
you know what men want.

587
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,234
Oh, that's easy.

588
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,107
- It is?
- Yeah.

589
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,804
Man wants
what woman wants.

590
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,503
And what's that?

591
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:24,420
They want someone
to talk to,

592
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:28,598
to have a good time with,

593
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:30,600
hold, but have freedom,

594
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:33,212
and someone
to come home to.

595
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,390
I wish it was that easy.

596
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:40,219
Well, what do you think
a man wants?

597
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,354
Well, I think men want--

598
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,750
some men want--

599
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,492
well, they want to dominate.

600
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,321
They're into male dominance.

601
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,454
Aren't some women
into female dominance?

602
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:02,110
Well, maybe some are,
but not as many,

603
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:05,592
not statistically speaking.

604
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,816
Is Dr. Anderson
into male dominance?

605
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,609
I think Dr. Anderson is--

606
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:27,135
is... into male dominance.

607
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,138
But then, I think he thinks

608
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:33,533
I'm into female dominance.

609
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:37,145
- And you're not?
- No, I'm not.

610
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,540
- I only want--
- Someone to talk to

611
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,368
and have a good time with.

612
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,198
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

613
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,678
It's what I want.

614
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,290
Is it?

615
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,643
Well, we better
get out of here.

616
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,297
It looks like the sky's
gonna fall on us.

617
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,172
The final arguments
won't take long tomorrow,

618
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:08,611
so we should be
to the airport
in plenty of time.

619
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:11,092
I hate to say
good-bye to London.

620
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,097
Another lovely day.

621
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:19,492
It sure was, wasn't it?

622
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,277
Yeah.

623
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,153
Oh, I hope I have my key.

624
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,416
Hang on,
I'll take this from you.

625
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,071
Thanks.
I know I brought it.

626
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,380
Oh, there it is.

627
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,384
Okay.

628
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,303
- I'll take those.
- All right.

629
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,479
- Okay?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,266
You're forgetting something.

631
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,398
- What?
- My jacket.

632
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:03,623
I'm glad it was able
to keep you warm.

633
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,233
Don't want you
to catch cold.

634
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,627
If you catch cold,
that's all we need.

635
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,414
It's why I always
take my vitamins.

636
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:23,033
- Um, good night, yeah.
- Good night.

637
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:32,782
Don't even
think about it.

638
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,014
- Man: Good morning.
 - [ chattering ]

639
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,540
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

640
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,849
Alex: 
Good morning.

641
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:58,591
Hi.

642
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:01,724
You look great.

643
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,205
Thank you.

644
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:07,165
I need those notes
on London right away.

645
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,864
Uh, they're on your desk.

646
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,606
Oh, well, let's be sure
Mr. Billingsly

647
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:16,435
and the other partners
get copies.

648
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,872
- They already do.
- Good.

649
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,918
And take these receipts,
add your own,

650
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,572
and make sure 
accounting gets those.

651
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,139
All right.

652
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,186
Remember,
the pub was on me.

653
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,582
- Mr. Billingsly.
- Alex.

654
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,803
George, I need to
go over London with you.

655
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,501
Oh, uh,
Dr. Anderson called

656
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,155
and he said he'd be
picking you up at 6:30.

657
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,722
Great.

658
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:45,246
Oh, tell him I'll go
by his office.

659
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,683
Right.

660
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,729
How does she do it?

661
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,470
She spends the weekend
with Alex,

662
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,602
and she's got the doctor
waiting for her.

663
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,518
God, I'd be
satisfied with one.

664
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,956
I don't think
she's ever satisfied.

665
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,483
- Brian?
- Brian: Be right out.

666
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,227
- Hi. Right on time.
- Hi.

667
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,229
- Did you miss me?
- Of course.

668
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,666
Yeah, I reserved
a corner booth,
so we better hurry.

669
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,885
- We should talk first.
- We can talk later.

670
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,974
No, Brenda,
this is important.

671
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,889
Sit down, please.

672
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,987
Well, what do you
want to talk about?

673
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,295
Well...

674
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,340
you know, I was--

675
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,341
I was really ticked off

676
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,299
when you phoned
from Europe.

677
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,170
I know. I couldn't
help it, Brian.

678
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:41,563
No, I'm not
blaming you, Brenda.

679
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,043
That's why
I sent you the flowers.

680
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,306
And they were lovely,
they really were.

681
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,177
I know how demanding
your job can be.

682
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:49,745
It's just that--

683
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,487
well, anyway,
I decided to stay
in town for the weekend

684
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,576
and do some errands,
you know?

685
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,665
Get a new dish strainer,

686
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,972
finally put up
that new tie rack.

687
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,499
And then at
the hardware store,
I met a woman.

688
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,414
She was--

689
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,198
well, I--

690
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,723
I was attracted to her.

691
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:13,595
I can understand
your being attracted
to someone else, Brian.

692
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,597
I've been attracted
to other people.

693
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,990
No, it wasn't
just that, Brenda.

694
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,776
It was something else.
It was more.

695
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,213
She had a light switch
that she wanted to fix

696
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,606
and I said
I would help her,

697
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,609
so I went to her house
and met her son.

698
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,090
- She has a child?
- Yeah.

699
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:34,660
Great kid.
Eleven years old
and all boy.

700
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,401
He's got a nasty overbite,

701
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:39,795
but I think I can fix that
with a retainer.

702
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,536
Anyway, 
we sat around and talked

703
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,059
and got to know each other,

704
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,453
and we sent out for
a pastrami sandwiches.

705
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,542
You know, with those
really big pickles?

706
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,979
Brian, what are you saying?

707
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:53,156
Well, what I'm saying is,

708
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,246
I realized how much
I want that.

709
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,988
You know,
a home, a family,

710
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:02,731
the warmth and security
of sharing my life
with someone.

711
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:08,389
What I'm trying to say is,

712
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:12,001
well, this might sound crazy,
but I want her to marry me.

713
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,916
Marry you? Brian, I--

714
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,920
you want her to marry you?

715
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:22,447
I was crazy about you, Brenda.
I still am, I guess.

716
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,058
But it never would have
worked out between us.

717
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:26,842
I think you put it best
when you said

718
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,671
I'd get tired of caviar
every night.

719
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,847
You're too much for me,
Brenda.

720
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,067
I'm really just
a simple kind of guy,

721
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,811
- and Marylou...
- Marylou?

722
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,856
Marylou needs me,

723
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,728
and you don't need anybody,

724
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,686
and I need to be needed.

725
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,690
And little Joey needs
a father and a retainer.

726
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,258
I want you to meet them,
Brenda,

727
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,434
and you'll understand
why I'm so happy,

728
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:56,481
and you'll
be happy for me--
for all of us.

729
00:39:56,524 --> 00:40:00,267
I just want everybody
to be happy.

730
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,182
[ phone rings ]

731
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,318
What kind of herbal teas
do you have?

732
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:11,278
Mint, rose hip, chamomile,
and lemon verbena.

733
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:15,108
I'll have a double
vodka martini,

734
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:16,849
straight up.

735
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,553
Am I glad you're
sitting down,

736
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:27,337
because what
I have to say

737
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,165
would knock you
off your feet.

738
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,520
What?

739
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:37,478
Charles proposed.

740
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,611
- We're getting married.
- You're what?

741
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,440
You heard right.
Married.

742
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,659
I'm getting married.

743
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:47,140
I thought you said
he was gonna dump you.

744
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,534
Well, I thought so, too,
but then he took me

745
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,362
to this crazy little diner
with a great jukebox,

746
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:56,149
and he had the waitress
serenade me, and then--

747
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:00,501
My God.

748
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,765
I told Charles
it was too extravagant,
but he insisted.

749
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:07,029
Well, isn't this
a little sudden?

750
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:09,728
Charles said,
"When you strike gold,

751
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,208
you should stop digging."

752
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,821
- He's so perfect.
- This is great, just...

753
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:24,917
...great.
It really is great, Sheila.

754
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,006
I'm so happy for you.

755
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,703
Now, we're gonna
do it right away.

756
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,357
We don't want to wait
any longer than necessary.

757
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,707
Well, we have to find 
someplace to do it,

758
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,013
and then I've got
to invite everybody

759
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,928
and get his kids home
from school.

760
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,538
- He has children?
- Oh, widowed years ago.

761
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,540
The kids are away 
at school.

762
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,150
We're gonna call them
tonight and tell them.

763
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,239
Oh, God,
my head is spinning.

764
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:45,154
I've got to make a list
of everything to do--

765
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,897
music, flowers, a dress.

766
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:51,770
Oh, and I almost forgot
the most important thing.

767
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:54,076
- You.
- Me?

768
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,861
We want you to be
our bridesmaid.

769
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,691
I'm gonna
call my mother.

770
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,172
Of course,
what would a wedding be

771
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:06,175
without me
to give away the bride?

772
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,481
Or the groom.

773
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:14,009
That's me,
the world's oldest
living bridesmaid.

774
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,539
I'll have another one.

775
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,472
I'm gonna double-check
these figures.

776
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:43,735
Okay.

777
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,217
Want some more coffee?

778
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:52,004
No, thank you.

779
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:53,788
Okay.

780
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:56,356
Hey, how about
something to eat?

781
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:04,451
This is saving my life.

782
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,323
I wish you'd said
something earlier.

783
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,456
I mean,
the least I can do
is buy you dinner.

784
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,807
- It's Saturday night.
- They're all the same to me.

785
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,898
I hope you didn't have
to change any plans.

786
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:19,640
None that couldn't
be changed.

787
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,642
You didn't have a date
or anything?

788
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:25,907
Nope. All yours.

789
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,780
Well, I appreciate
your coming in.

790
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:32,871
I don't mind.
I like my work.

791
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,264
I can tell.

792
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:36,657
You know,
when I first hired you,

793
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,354
I was really afraid that

794
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:39,878
you were going
to be uncomfortable

795
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:43,272
being the only
male secretary.

796
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,187
I'll be honest with you,
I don't give much credence

797
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,799
to that
masculine-feminine stuff.

798
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:54,457
It's all a bunch
of hype created by--

799
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,156
Men who are
afraid of women?

800
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,334
Or women
that are afraid
of themselves.

801
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,993
I don't know how
we're ever gonna get
all this work done.

802
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,736
Oh, yeah.

803
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,347
Work.

804
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,393
- You want some more coffee?
- No, thank you.

805
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:23,095
Look, we're both
pretty fried.

806
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:25,706
Why don't
we come in tomorrow?

807
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,100
I can't.
My friend Sheila's
getting married.

808
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:32,234
You mean, you're gonna
go with Dr. Anderson?

809
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,282
No.

810
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,980
I mean, he hasn't been
calling very much lately.

811
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:42,810
I was wondering
if you had...

812
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,682
broken up.

813
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:49,991
There wasn't really
much to break up.

814
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:52,298
If you want my opinion,

815
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:53,995
I thought he was
kind of a wimp.

816
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,302
You did?

817
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:59,174
Yeah, I did.

818
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:01,089
He's not your type.

819
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:06,747
What is my type?

820
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,750
I don't know.
You'll know
when you meet him.

821
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,755
I hope so.

822
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,757
Look, why don't--

823
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,107
why don't I just take
all this work home?

824
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,501
All it needs is to
be organized, right?

825
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:23,764
I can't ask you to do that.

826
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:25,548
I'm volunteering.

827
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:31,946
I'll consider it
a personal favor,

828
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,341
if you don't mind
getting personal.

829
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:38,866
No, I don't.

830
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:45,568
So, you go to your
friend's wedding
and enjoy yourself,

831
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,788
and who knows,

832
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:50,269
you might catch
the bouquet.

833
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:07,808
We'll be gone three weeks,

834
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,896
and we're gonna take
the kids with us,

835
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,158
so we can all get
to know each other.

836
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,159
Then we're coming home
for the real honeymoon,

837
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,508
right, darling?

838
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,598
There's Brenda.

839
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:17,775
She looks better than ever.

840
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,646
She sure does.

841
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,006
Oh! Better watch out.
Your face is gonna
freeze like that.

842
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,008
Hey, cheer up,
sweetheart.

843
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:36,315
You look more
like a pallbearer
than a bridesmaid.

844
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:38,404
I know, but I'm losing
my best friend.

845
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:42,364
It's silly, but I feel
so left behind

846
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,410
and left over
and left out.

847
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,281
Don't feel bad,
you'll be next.

848
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,283
There's another
Charles out there
just ready--

849
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,632
Ah, ah, ah!
The question is,

850
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:51,852
is Miss America
ready for him?

851
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:53,898
What is that
supposed to mean?

852
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,770
Honey, it's not as if
you never have been
asked to be married.

853
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,425
Half the men in this room
have been after you
at one time or another,

854
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,427
but you would never
give them the time of day.

855
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,647
What I don't understand
is why you feel left out?

856
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:08,956
- You always did the leaving.
- That's not true.

857
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,698
I think you were
a little hard on her, dear.

858
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:14,657
Mm. I always
say the wrong thing.

859
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,921
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

860
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:42,903
You must be
"something blue."

861
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,557
Nice to meet you.

862
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,777
- I'm "something old."
- I think I'm drunk.

863
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,779
Take deep breaths.

864
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,781
Will it make me sober?

865
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,566
It will either
make you sober
or make you faint.

866
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:55,916
Anything would be
an improvement.

867
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,787
You gonna throw up?

868
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,659
I already did.

869
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:02,575
Come on,
pull yourself together.

870
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:04,272
This is
your wedding night.

871
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:05,708
You haven't even gotten
to the good part yet.

872
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,710
I'm scared.

873
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,277
You've done it all before.

874
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:10,844
Don't worry.
It'll come back to you.

875
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,629
I mean really scared,
Brenda.

876
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:16,502
I've been married
for three and a half hours

877
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:21,507
and I feel
different already.

878
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,943
Well, of course
you feel different.

879
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,511
That was the whole idea,
wasn't it?

880
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:28,122
I guess, but...

881
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,733
I can't explain it.

882
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:35,782
It's such a responsibility.
It's overwhelming.

883
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,958
You know...

884
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:41,048
I don't even have a dog,

885
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,486
and now I have a husband.

886
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,621
Oh, Brenda,
you're my best friend
and I love you.

887
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,975
You do love Charles
though, don't you?

888
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:59,937
God, I adore him.
Worship him.

889
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,940
I'm crazy about him.

890
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:05,246
But still I wonder,

891
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:10,295
can we ever love a man
like we love each other?

892
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:13,254
I hope so, Sheila.

893
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:15,953
I want to.

894
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:18,390
I don't know.

895
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,436
I suppose if it really
happens, if you really
feel that spark,

896
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,526
then you just go
with your instincts.

897
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,528
Listen to me,
I sound like June Cleaver.

898
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:31,229
I don't know
what the hell
I'm talking about.

899
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,361
I feel better.

900
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:36,451
Let's go back before
Charles thinks
I chickened out.

901
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,976
Sheila, as your
very best friend,

902
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,108
could I tell you
one last thing?

903
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:43,110
Sure, what?

904
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,113
Your nose is running
and it looks disgusting.

905
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,082
Come on, honey,
time to throw the bouquet.

I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

912
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,854
Good.

913
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:18,814
Listen, I was wondering
about that report.

914
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:21,643
Really?

915
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,776
That's great.

916
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,430
Because I--

917
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:27,606
I wanted to
go over it tomorrow.

918
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:32,611
Well, actually, I...

919
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:34,700
just happen to be
in your neighborhood.

920
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,754

- Hi.

00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:48,670
- Come on in.

Alex, this place is lovely.

Well, you're
the first person

924
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:00,682
that's ever said
that about it.

925
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:02,423
Can I get you
something to drink?

926
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:05,339
Oh, thank you.
That would be lovely.

- Beer?
- Thanks.

928
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:21,921
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

929
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:32,192
It really is
a charming place.

930
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,934
What's in there?

931
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:39,721
Oh, uh, something I do.

932
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,072
Come on, let me show you.

933
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:49,296
Alex.

934
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,777
I had no idea
you were an artist.

935
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,303
A lot of people
would agree with that.

936
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:57,696
But don't worry
about being polite

937
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,915
because I know
that this stuff's

938
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,701
probably not
up your alley.

939
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:05,704
Well, I certainly respect
the creative process

940
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:09,011
and personal achievement.

941
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,057
There's an
interesting theory

942
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,146
about the ability
to appreciate works of art--

943
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,236

the objective.

By the way, I'm also

Uh-huh.

You're out of moisturizer.

I'll put that
on the top of my list.

Don't bother the chef.

None for me, thanks.

00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,401
- I'll just
 have some coffee.
- You sure?

963
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,707
You'll deprive yourself

Mmm. They are good...
and spicy.

00:57:56,603 --> 00:58:02,348
Your, um, sculptures
are very unusual.

They'll grow on you,
I think.

00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,266
I think they already have.

you look so cute

I've traded a few.
Does that count?

00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:26,285
What about the galleries?

00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:29,462

but I'll make
the rounds again.

about a one-man show

That's what I like to do.

and healthier than drugs.

you wanted cream or sugar

If anyone sees us together,

they might get 
the wrong idea...

I really like the slip
you're wearing.

to take it off you...

- Fine, Miss Morgan. You?
- Fine, fine.

- It.
- Oh, come on.

I'll have my girl
call your... secretary,

1204
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,324
and we'll see you
Saturday night for sure.

1205
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,935
Right, Mike.
Bye-bye.

1206
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,807
What's Saturday night?

1207
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,679
Oh, just this stupid
formal dinner.

1208
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:34,899
You don't have to go.
It'll be real boring.

1209
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:38,250
- You know, lawyers,
 lawyers' wives.
- Lawyers' lovers.

1210
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,078
Well, I don't think
they'll be bringing
their lovers

1211
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:41,732
if they're bringing
their wives.

1212
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:44,256
Brenda.

1213
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,824
We can't keep avoiding this.

1214
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:49,000
I think it's time
for my coming out party.

1215
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:59,532
I have a feeling
this is gonna be
a lot of fun.

1216
01:12:01,926 --> 01:12:05,712
Hmm.

1217
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:08,846
I told you so.

1218
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:11,588
I think we need
to drink-- a lot.

1219
01:12:11,631 --> 01:12:12,980
I'll be back.

1220
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:21,424
George, hi.

1221
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,295
Sewing on a button, huh?

1222
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,862
Really, Brenda,

1223
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:26,820
I thought we could
talk about these things.

1224
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:30,563
George, we have never
talked about these things.

1225
01:12:30,607 --> 01:12:33,610
Hey, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

1226
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,176
Don't I look happy?

1227
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:39,398
- Mr. Billingsly.
- Thank you.

1228
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,705
- Hi, Alex.
- How you doing?

1229
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:45,404
- Nice to see you.
- It's good to be here, sir.

1230
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,059
Well, yes, uh,

1231
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:51,192
I have some guests to see.

1232
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:54,108
Why don't
the two of you mingle?

1233
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:57,547
Oh, we love to mingle.
Yeah.

1234
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,549
Well, he's taking it
kind of hard.

1235
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,377
I told you this
was a mistake.

1236
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,509
- Hey, relax.
- I am totally relaxed.

1237
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:06,686
Brenda, I was hoping
you were gonna be here.

1238
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,210
I'm Mel Brookman.
I don't believe we've met.

1239
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,430
Alex Dante.

1240
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,476
I need some free advice.

1241
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:16,609
Parker Construction
wants me to handle
that negligence mess.

1242
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:19,133
I wouldn't touch that, Mel.

1243
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:21,048
Well, what do you think,
Alex?

1244
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:24,922
Well, I agree with Brenda.

1245
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:27,490
Well, actually,
I'm not a lawyer,
really, so...

1246
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,013
Oh, what business are you in?

1247
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,798
- Um...
- He's in the, um,

1248
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:33,844
secretarial business.

1249
01:13:33,887 --> 01:13:36,368
Really?
I'm sure we've used
some of your girls.

1250
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,109
We have temps in
all the time.

1251
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:40,503
- I doubt it.
- You know, Mel,

1252
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:43,201
the more I think about
that Parker case,
the worse it seems.

1253
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:45,943
I have a feeling
that they're gonna
declare bankruptcy

1254
01:13:45,986 --> 01:13:47,553
and you'll be left
without a penny.

1255
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,555
That's all I had to hear.
Thanks, Brenda.

1256
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:51,470
- Nice meeting you, Alex.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1257
01:13:51,514 --> 01:13:54,647
Bye, Mel.

1258
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:57,955
Well, I admire your
amateur ventriloquism.

1259
01:13:57,998 --> 01:13:59,173
I can speak for myself.

1260
01:13:59,217 --> 01:14:01,175
Every time you speak
for yourself,

1261
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,308
you call everybody "sir."

1262
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,531
Hey, if you're
having a problem--

1263
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:12,578
I'm not having
a problem, Alex.
I'm simply hungry.

1264
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:16,539
I'm going to have
something to eat.

1265
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:19,585
Good. I'll mingle.

1266
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:26,113
Brenda!

1267
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:28,768
Mary, hi.
I love your dress.

1268
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,944
George tells me you
brought your secretary.

1269
01:14:30,988 --> 01:14:32,555
I think that's the most 
wonderful thing 
I've ever heard.

1270
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:36,210
Well, I just thought
he ought to meet
all the clients.

1271
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:38,778
He's very bright,
has great potential.

1272
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:41,520
Oh, then,
it's strictly business?

1273
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:43,914
I guess I jumped to
the wrong conclusion.

1274
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,438
I guess you did.

1275
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,570
Bye-bye.

1276
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:49,136
Brenda.

1277
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,773
- Hey, Brenda
- Mike.

1278
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:19,079
- Hi, Doris. 
 I love your dress.
 - Thank you.

1279
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:22,343
Alex was just telling us
what it's like to be
dating his boss.

1280
01:15:22,387 --> 01:15:25,825
This is such a great story.
You two should write a book.

1281
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:28,611
Well, I was just saying
how great it is.

1282
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,613
We're both professionals,
we have our own jobs,

1283
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:33,572
and yet our private life
is our own.

1284
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,487
Doris: 
That is so healthy.

1285
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,708
Really, Brenda,
you two are so healthy.

1286
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:41,754
Actually, I'm not
feeling very well.

1287
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:44,452
- Are you sick?
- Mm-hmm. Sick.

1288
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:46,846
Alex: Well, I guess 
we should be going?

1289
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,632
- Mm-hmm. Bye.
- See you again.

1290
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:51,547
- Good seeing you again.
- Take care.

1291
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,508
- What hurts?
- What hurts what?

1292
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,467
You said you were sick.
What is it, your stomach
or your head?

1293
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:01,600
Both.
They both hurt very much.

1294
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,471
There's nothing wrong
with you, is there?

1295
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:04,995
- What are you talking about?
- It's me, isn't it?

1296
01:16:05,038 --> 01:16:06,823
- Come on, Alex.
- Look at yourself.

1297
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:08,825
You're embarrassed.
You're ashamed
to be here with me.

1298
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:11,784
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

1299
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,481
Then why are we leaving
a perfectly good party

1300
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:14,918
with perfectly good people?

1301
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:16,920
- I have a headache.
- No, you don't.

1302
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:18,922
Look, I brought you
to this party.

1303
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:20,880
- It's only fair--
- So, you could
 call the shots.

1304
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,448
We both knew
this was gonna be
a difficult situation.

1305
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:24,841
It wasn't difficult.
You made it difficult.

1306
01:16:24,884 --> 01:16:26,494
Me? You're the one
who went around

1307
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:28,061
calling everyone "sir"

1308
01:16:28,105 --> 01:16:29,628
and telling everyone
you were my secretary.

1309
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,630
Why didn't you just
say you were an artist?

1310
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:33,501
Because besides
being an artist,
I am a secretary,

1311
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,242
and you seem to be
the only one that has
a problem with that.

1312
01:16:35,286 --> 01:16:37,984
- Me?
- This must be
 driving you crazy.

1313
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:39,856
I mean,
behind closed doors,
that's one thing,

1314
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,075
but out in public,
to actually be seen

1315
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:44,164
with someone as low
on the success ladder
as me--

1316
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,646
- Oh, please, Alex.
- You almost had me fooled.

1317
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,517
I mean, I really believed
that you were gonna

1318
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:51,519
treat me with respect,
as an equal,

1319
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:53,304
but you always wanted
to have the upper hand.

1320
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,306
What are you
talking about?

1321
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,873
I have tried to be fair
and open minded.

1322
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,657
But you just couldn't
be discreet enough

1323
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,312
to protect our privacy,
could you?

1324
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,270
Why did you have to go
and ruin everything?

1325
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:05,882
Me? Me?

1326
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,666
I knew this would happen.
I knew it wouldn't work out.

1327
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:08,928
You knew
it wouldn't work out,

1328
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:09,973
and so you wouldn't
let it work out.

1329
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,322
That way you covered
your butt.

1330
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:12,671
You didn't have to
risk anything, or--

1331
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:14,107
This whole relationship

1332
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:16,109
has been ridiculous
from the very beginning.

1333
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:18,068
- I don't know why
 I even bothered.
- Oh, I do.

1334
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,330
You wanted to control me

1335
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:20,853
like you do
everyone else around you.

1336
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:23,290
As long as I stay 
in my place

1337
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,683
and as long as you 
have control,

1338
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,424
then everything's fine.

1339
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:28,339
You've built walls
around you, Brenda,

1340
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:29,862
and I am tired of trying
to tear them down.

1341
01:17:29,906 --> 01:17:31,559
Don't you
talk to me like that.

1342
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:32,909
You're just young
and inexperienced.

1343
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:34,519
Don't tell me what I am!
I know what I am,

1344
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:35,738
and I know
what you've become.

1345
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,348
And I don't have 
any respect

1346
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:40,307
for that hard-driving 
executive crap!

1347
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:47,053
You may be older than I am,

1348
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:49,360
but, lady,
you got a lot to learn.

1349
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:54,234
Good-bye, Brenda.

1350
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:23,568
I suppose her highness
is at lunch?

1351
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:26,614
She's in her office.
She canceled it.

1352
01:18:26,658 --> 01:18:29,182
She's probably still worried
about those three pounds.

1353
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:31,402
Debbie: 
She told me to give you 
your severance pay.

1354
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,056
Alex: 
Tell her she can keep it,

1355
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,885
give it to the charity 
of her choice--

1356
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:39,236
the Society for the Prevention 
of Improper Attire.

1357
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,762
Okay.

1358
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:45,590
Oh.

1359
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,635
Tell her she can
keep these, too.

1360
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,986
I'm tired of trying
to fill them.

1361
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,121
- Bye.
- Bye.

1362
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:14,445
It's not a blind date,
it's Charles' cousin.

1363
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:17,230
I don't know, Sheila.
I don't think I'm ready.

1364
01:19:17,274 --> 01:19:19,798
Of course, you are.
It's just what you need.

1365
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:21,844
No, tell Charles thanks,
but I'm--

1366
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,847
- I've already said yes.
- [ sighs ]

1367
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,327
Well, is this guy
in the movie business, too?

1368
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,808
No, he's a doctor.

1369
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:34,030
- Doctor?
- Mother, all doctors
 aren't perfect.

1370
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:36,554
Haven't you ever heard
of malpractice insurance?

1371
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:38,469
What kind of a doctor?

1372
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:40,558
A cardiovascular surgeon.

1373
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:45,606
A cardiovascular surgeon!

1374
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:49,567
You must be Brenda.

1375
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:52,265
Yes...

1376
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:54,180
even when I don't
want to be.

1377
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:56,835
The apartment
needs a few touches,

1378
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:59,446
but I can walk
to the hospital

1379
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,014
and I've got my boat
at the 23rd Street marina.

1380
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:04,277
Sounds like you're all set.

1381
01:20:04,321 --> 01:20:07,846
Well, just about.

1382
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,456
I'm sure
I'll feel more at home

1383
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,850
once I start going to
the theater and the opera.

1384
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:15,114
Brenda is an opera freak.
Aren't you?

1385
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,855
Hmm?

1386
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,206
Mm!

1387
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,470
Freak.

1388
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:25,255
Edith: 
I think he's wonderful.

1389
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:26,865
Brenda: 
I'm glad you like him.

1390
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:28,475
Edith: 
He obviously adores you.

1391
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:29,694
Brenda: 
He's very good to me.

1392
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:31,696
Edith: 
He has a yacht?

1393
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:34,307
Brenda: 
It's not a yacht, Mother. 
It's a boat.

1394
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:36,092
Edith: 
Did you know Frank 
and I love boating?

1395
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:38,355
Brenda: 
What a coincidence.

1396
01:20:38,398 --> 01:20:40,705
Edith: 
So, you two are becoming 
quite an item.

1397
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:43,360
Brenda: Relax. 
It's totally casual.

1398
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:46,189
Edith: 
At your age, 
nothing is casual.

1399
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:48,234
How's the sex?

1400
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,106
Brenda:  
It's none of your business.

1401
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:53,892
Edith: 
Honey, you can tell me. 
I'm your mother.

1402
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,894
Brenda: 
How's the sex with Frank?

1403
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:58,941
- Edith: It's great. 
- Brenda: Congratulations.

1404
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,420
Edith: 
You didn't answer 
my question.

1405
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:23,922
Darling,
you look absolutely
ravishing tonight.

1406
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:26,316
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1407
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:29,319
Thank you for being
so beautiful, so charming,

1408
01:21:29,362 --> 01:21:32,191
so perfectly delightful.

1409
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:36,935
These last few weeks
with you have been
the best of my life.

1410
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:39,546
It has been nice.

1411
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,461
We're good together.

1412
01:21:41,505 --> 01:21:45,770
We're solid, stable,
and decisive.

1413
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:46,902
Do you feel it, too?

1414
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:55,127
Yes, I guess
I just never thought of it
quite that way.

1415
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:58,522
Well, that's the way
I want you to feel.

1416
01:21:58,565 --> 01:22:00,437
I want you to--

1417
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:15,756
No, no, no.
Bring the '72.

1418
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:18,629
Certainly, sir.

1419
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:23,590
You are an amazing
woman, Brenda.

1420
01:22:23,634 --> 01:22:27,377
You're everything
I've searched for.

1421
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,118
Will you marry me?

1422
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:34,775
Okay.

1423
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,910
I am famished.

1424
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,434
What about you?

1425
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,830
Woman: 
It's a rock! A major rock!

1426
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:47,005
It's bigger
than Princess Di's!

1427
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:48,398
It's bigger
than Fergie's.

1428
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:50,617
I'm so jealous,
I can't stand it!

1429
01:22:50,661 --> 01:22:53,011
- Good morning, ladies.
- Miss Morgan's engaged!

1430
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:55,013
- She's marrying a doctor.
- Check out the jewelry.

1431
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:56,667
Isn't it romantic?

1432
01:22:56,710 --> 01:23:00,845
That's wonderful news,
Brenda.

1433
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:03,413
- Oh!
- Congratulations.

1434
01:23:03,456 --> 01:23:04,588
Who's the lucky man?

1435
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:06,633
Oh, just some guy I met.

1436
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:08,331
- I've got some more
 great news.
- What?

1437
01:23:08,374 --> 01:23:10,202
- We won.
- Won what?

1438
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:13,423
Sherman Brothers!
We beat the whole bloody
British government.

1439
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:15,642
Congratulations, partner.

1440
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:18,428
- You're a genius.
- It wasn't all me.

1441
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:21,170
I certainly
couldn't have done it
without Alex.

1442
01:23:25,478 --> 01:23:27,872
- I've got some work to do.
- Yeah, me, too.

1443
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:30,135
[ murmuring ]

1444
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:59,295
Oh, darling,
isn't it perfect?

1445
01:23:59,338 --> 01:24:01,601
You know, I have been
wanting to throw you
an engagement party

1446
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:03,429
since you were a little girl.

1447
01:24:03,473 --> 01:24:05,214
And here we are.

1448
01:24:05,257 --> 01:24:08,434
Oh, this must be
the most wonderful night
of your life.

1449
01:24:08,478 --> 01:24:10,436
- Mother?
- Huh?

1450
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,134
Can we talk
in the kitchen?

1451
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:18,227
Nobody has touched the mousse.
I don't understand it.

1452
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,445
Don't worry
about the mousse.

1453
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:21,230
I'll eat it
for breakfast.

1454
01:24:21,273 --> 01:24:22,448
Maybe it's because
the crackers are
in the other room.

1455
01:24:22,492 --> 01:24:24,363
Mother, I need you.
Come on.

1456
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:37,681
All right, sweetheart,
what is it?

1457
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:40,640
I probably should have
mentioned this before,

1458
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:44,688
but I can't marry Roger.

1459
01:24:44,731 --> 01:24:46,690
Sweetheart,
I know just how you feel.

1460
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:49,258
No, I don't think you do.

1461
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:50,911
Honey, it is nerves.

1462
01:24:50,955 --> 01:24:53,523
You have been single
a long time,

1463
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:55,090
and it's just normal
to get the jitters.

1464
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:56,482
I mean, I had them myself.

1465
01:24:56,526 --> 01:24:59,920
Roger just isn't
my type, Mother.

1466
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:02,749
- Well, you can do worse.
- He's not a bad person
 or anything,

1467
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:05,578
he's just not--

1468
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:08,015
not like Alex.

1469
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,719
Alex? Who's Alex?

1470
01:25:15,762 --> 01:25:17,938
Well, you know, Alex,
from my office.

1471
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:20,506
Your secretary?

1472
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:24,858
- Former.
- What's Alex like?

1473
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:28,514
Well, he was
just easy-going,

1474
01:25:28,558 --> 01:25:32,257
and down to Earth,
and fun to be with.

1475
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:36,131
[ clears throat ]

1476
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:37,741
How was the sex?

1477
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:40,222
Oh, Mother,

1478
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:42,659
it was unbelievable.

1479
01:25:42,702 --> 01:25:46,141
Oh, sweetheart.

1480
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:47,751
I didn't realize
that you two...

1481
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:50,014
Well, we weren't.

1482
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:51,189
And then we did,

1483
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:54,323
- and then we stopped.
- Why?

1484
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:56,325
Well, we had
this stupid fight

1485
01:25:56,368 --> 01:25:58,979
in front of almost
the entire Bar Association.

1486
01:25:59,023 --> 01:26:03,245
I was totally obnoxious,
and he was furious, and--

1487
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:04,637
oh, it was awful.

1488
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:10,165
I guess I just
don't understand men.

1489
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,649
Well, I'm afraid I do.

1490
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:25,005
Do you love him?

1491
01:26:27,617 --> 01:26:30,054
I do.

1492
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,186
I guess?

1493
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:32,187
I think.

1494
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,798
I-- I do.

1495
01:26:34,841 --> 01:26:37,192
Sweetheart,
when I met your father,

1496
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:39,106
I didn't know anything
about love.

1497
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:41,544
I wanted to be a good wife.

1498
01:26:41,587 --> 01:26:45,243
There's nothing
I wouldn't have done for him,
and I have no regrets.

1499
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:48,203
We had some good years.
We had some wonderful times.

1500
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:53,251
- We-- we had you.
- But still you
 weren't happy?

1501
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,819
Happy?

1502
01:26:55,862 --> 01:26:59,039
I was miserable.
We both were.

1503
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:03,479
There just wasn't enough
to build a life on.

1504
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:09,354
There was no spark,
no chemistry, no passion.

1505
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:11,617
But doesn't passion fade?

1506
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:14,229
Oh, sweetheart,
of course, it doesn't fade.

1507
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:16,274
It grows!

1508
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:18,842
I just thank God
that I found Frank

1509
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:20,452
and that I got
a second chance,

1510
01:27:20,496 --> 01:27:23,803
because marriage
with the right man
is heaven on Earth.

1511
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:27,285
And to the wrong man, it's--

1512
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:31,811
It's only me.

1513
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:38,470
Mm.

1514
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:40,690
I think I ought to go

1515
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:43,519
and see if everybody's 
going to have 
enough to drink.

1516
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,654
Come on, darling.
Everybody's asking for you.

1517
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:53,050
Uh, Roger, there's something
I think we should talk about.

1518
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,095
Not now, sweetheart.
We have to get back--

1519
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:58,708
This can't wait.
I have something
to tell you.

1520
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:00,536
Not now, dear.
We have to--

1521
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:02,929
Damn it, Roger!
Listen to me.

1522
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:06,063
Brenda, what is it?

1523
01:28:06,106 --> 01:28:07,543
You're becoming hysterical.

1524
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:10,067
No, I'm not hysterical.

1525
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:12,069
Actually, I feel good,

1526
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:15,942
because I think
I've finally figured out
what's been wrong.

1527
01:28:15,986 --> 01:28:19,990
- And what is that?
- Us.

1528
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:26,170
Darling, would you
like a nice sedative?

Roger...

1530
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:31,088
I think we should
call the wedding off.

1531
01:28:31,131 --> 01:28:33,873
Call it off?
What are you talking about?

1532
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:37,224
I'm talking about us
not marrying each other.

1533
01:28:37,268 --> 01:28:40,271
You know, breaking up,
throwing in the towel,

1534
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,405
getting out while
the getting's good?

1535
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:48,366
- You're serious?

Look, I'm sorry I didn't
realize this sooner.

1537
01:28:52,544 --> 01:28:55,242
I never meant to lead you on.

1538

But we're the perfect couple.

No, we're not.

You're half
of the perfect couple,

Trust me,
I'd make you miserable.

1543

This is a beautiful ring,
but it just doesn't fit me.

I can't believe this.

1545
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:25,360
Good-bye sounds
awfully final.

1546
01:29:26,535 --> 01:29:28,406
Maybe we could be friends.

1547
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:32,715
I don't think
that's possible.

No black. Too severe.

1554

All my life,
I've tried to be perfect.

- Honey, don't cry.

Alex hates me, too.

No, I don't.

Even you don't

But?

1576

But I want to
apologize anyway

1577
01:31:24,653 --> 01:31:27,046
because you were right
about a lot of things,

things that I never
faced before.

And I want to thank you
for making me realize

that I was trying
to control you,
which was wrong,

01:31:35,402 --> 01:31:37,840
even though I didn't know
I was doing anything wrong.

1582
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:40,407
I mean,
I was just frightened
of being your boss,

01:31:40,451 --> 01:31:43,280
of being more powerful
than you, of being older.

1584

But even though
I was older,
you were wiser.

Of course,
if I could change you,
I still wouldn't want to.

1586
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:50,592
It's just that before
I could accept you,
I had to accept myself,

1587
01:31:50,635 --> 01:31:51,810
which has made me
