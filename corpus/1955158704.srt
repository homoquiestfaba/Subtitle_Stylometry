190
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,836
Fendi? Gucci? Kors?

191
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,813
I'm not with any house.

192
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,109
Oh! A ball virgin!

193

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,608

The natural Way's for fools.

363
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,006
This bitch thinks she
got a uterus or something.

364
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,104
So are you gonna like have
an operation or something'?

365
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,609
Now why would
I need two pussies?

366
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,976
[all chuckling]

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,604
But mark my words...

368
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:02,941
I am gonna
pop out some kids

369
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,878
and have a family of my own,
you'll see.

370
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,705
You planning on shooting
those fools out of your ass'?

371
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,838
Who cares, as long as
I get my pain meds'?

372
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,107
What it do'?

373
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,610
If I had a quarter for every
time you all said "What it do?"

374
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,476
Honey, it ain't
just an expression.

375
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,037
"What it do?"
It's a way of life.

376
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,842
Something tells me
you've seen "The Lion King"

377
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,607
one too many times.

378
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,737
You heard that!

379
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,975
- You tired'?
- Yeah.

380
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,402
He staying over'?

381
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,503
Yeah.

382
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,672
He can't stay here, Princess.
There ain't no room.

383
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,338
Besides, you know
what Queef would say.

384
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,869
She'd go,
"There ain't no stray men--"

385
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,107
There ain't no stray men
allowed in my house.

386
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,835
Is that what I'd say'?

387
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:39,937
Uh...

388
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,006
Princess, may I have
a word with you'?

389
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,707
Your guest
can wait outside.

390
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,711
Outside'?

391
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,007
Mmm hmm. Go on.

392
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,838
Look at my face!

393
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,813
Does it look like
I'm in any mood'?

394
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,943
Go on.
Kitchen, girl!

395
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,378
[claps hands]

396
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,836
Ea t, girl.
Seem' your bones again.

397
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,038
<i>Now, you ready
for my question?</i>

398
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,444
Yes, mother.

399
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,538
Did you get
your tens tonight'?

400
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,807
<i>I'm sorry'?</i>

401
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,608
Did you get your tens'?

402
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,443
Why you go asking me that when
you already know the answer?

403
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,447
Don't make mother
ask you again.

404
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,447
- No.
- No, what'?

405
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,878
- No, Mother.
- And?

406
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,402
And what'?

407
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,571
The correct answer is,

408
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,409
"No, mother, I didn't
get my tens tonight,

409
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,969
<i>because I was kee-keeing
with my Judys,</i>

410
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,411
and chasing the mens."

411
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,344
You're just jealous because
you don't even remember

412
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:32,778
what it's like to walk.

413
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,440
It's OK;
the body forgets.

414
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,105
Don't comfort me, girl.
Answer me.

415
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,710
I wasn't chasing no mens.

416
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,440
- Really?
- No lying,

417
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,344
You had a man
lying in your bed

418
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,971
and you lying
to my face right now.

419
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,911
Seems like a lot of
lying going on.

420
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,708
You got this all wrong.

421
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,110
Excuse me'?

422
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,436
She was just recruiting me...

423
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,707
Miss Queef.

424
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,376
Ma'am.

425
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,380
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me'?

426
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
I was glistening.

427
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,374
Glistening'?

428
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,811
Gay listening.

429
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,710
You know, when you're
talking to one man

430
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,440
and you see another
over his shoulder,

431
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,946
but you're not really
paying attention

432
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,412
to what the first one
has to say.

433
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,673
Glistening.

434
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,543
Didn't I tell him
to wait outside?

435
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:17,568
It's my fault.

436
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,580
Just wanted to try
and clear this mess up...

437
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,370
- Miss Queef.
- Miss Queef'?

438
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,380
What are you'?
Some Koreatown grocer'?

439
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,401
Miss Queef'?

440
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,106
It's Queef Latina
when I'm all up in it,

441
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,971
or Franklin or Mother
at other times.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,911
But never ever Miss Queef!

443
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,379
Besides...
glistening here!

444
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,003
- I'm sorry.
- I should say so.

445
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,569
You ain't you got
no place to stay'?

446
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,840
No Ma'am.
My Mom--

447
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,676
Oh save it with
"my mom" stories.

448
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,735
We all got one.

449
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,576
I do not trust this man.

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,843
He's harmless,
and hot, mind you.

451
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,341
What do you want
with my daughter?

452
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:53,472
- Your daughter'?
- It's just a figure of speech.

453
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,480
Oh, OK, I thought
you was saying, like,

454
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,444
you was married or--

455
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,707
I ask the questions here.

456
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,110
Oh, just tell him.

457
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,538
Well, I am married,
if it's any business of yours.

458
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,573
No ring?

459
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,346
It's pending.

460
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,846
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

461
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,847
Let him stay!
He can sleep on the couch.

462
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,778
This house is for
serious walkers only.

463
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,905
Not for some
candy-assed, Sex Siren wannabe.

464
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,641
You think he can
walk Sex Siren'?

465
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,702
Hmmmph.

466
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,974
Frankly, I think
that's all he can do.

467
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,911
Well, give him a chance.

468
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,537
You want a roof
over your head'?

469
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,875
You have to earn it.

470
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,346
- He's only got his car.
- Then the car it is!

471
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,505
It's cool.

472
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,910
Go on!

473
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,412
I'm sorry to disturb you.

474
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,573
That's right.

475
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,107
Eat.

476
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000

What time is it'?

516
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,978
Do I look like a clock'?

517
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,643
Visitation's almost up.
Who you here to see'?

518
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,010
Caldwell Jones.

519
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,676
Caldwell Jones'?

520
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,577
Heh, heh, heh...

521
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,011
What's that supposed to mean'?

522
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,104
I'm just surprised that someone
actually came to see him

523
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,835
that ain't got
an esquire after their name.

524
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,471
I'm here every week.

525
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,104
Well, I'll be good goddamned.

526
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,835
Now how could
I have missed you'?

527
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:49,076
Caldwell Jones is the sweetest
person you'll ever meet.

528
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,774
Besides, if we all
followed our heads

529
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,974
instead of our hearts,
you'd be plum out of a job.

530
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,838
You're late.

531
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,106
Ain't never been a ball
that started on time...

532
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,778
<i>You know what I'm sewn"?</i>

533
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,105
So what's the T, babydoll'?

534
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,539
No!

535
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,979
Ain't gonna be none
of that babydoll shit, OK'?

536
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,978
Everything OK'?

537
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,445
Yeah.

538
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm gettin' out

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,045
NCAA, huh'?

721
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:10,673
Yeah, Nigga Challenged

722
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,077

723
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,975
Carter, right'?

724
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,538
Bad Brad.

725
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,547
L-low much you get from me'?

726
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,079
L-low much
did you get from me'?

727
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,704
- You first.
- No, you first.

728
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,706
Same time.

729
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:33,873
(both)
Forty dollars.

730
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:37,380
Well, I guess we're even.

731
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,106
- I guess.
- Here's your wallet.

732
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,446
Here's your little purse.

733
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,437
What's the goo goo
ga ga, bitches'?

734
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,105
This meeting is
now called to order.

735
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,701
Duke!

736
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:55,704
NOW!

737
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,440
OK, listen up.

738
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:02,810
What is he doing here'?

739
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,403
Let him stay.

740
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:05,810
I didn't ask you.

741
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:07,973
I wanna walk Sex Siren.

742
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,104
Really?

743
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,607
You think it's that simple'?

744
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:13,114
You think you can waltz
right in here and bleed talent?

745
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:16,007
You besmirch all the names
that came before you.

746
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,445
Oh, Mother,
don't be so dramatic.

747
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,605
It's like you're living
in a movie

748
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,408
where you get to say
all the best lines.

749
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:22,572
IAM living in a movie

750
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,102
where I get to say
all the best lines!

751
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,437
And don't think for a minute

752
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,878
I didn't plan
for the word "besmirch"

753
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,380
to come screaming
and rolling off my tongue.

754
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,380
Come on!

755
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,936
I just wanna get
drunk off his junk!

756
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,447
I mean,
look at his bubble butt!

757
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,413
I wouldn't know
about such things.

758
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,574
My sweet husband is coming
home in two weeks, y'all.

759
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,841
And this guy...um...

760
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,073
- Brad.
- Brad here.

761
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,910
If he's so for real,
why isn't he walking for me'?

762
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:49,608
Mother has no time
for conversation.

763
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:50,703
Get it started!

764
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,647
Mmm hmm...

765
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,045
He's got the Dayum factor.

766
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,343
Back off! He is mine!

767
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,972
Are you for real'?

768
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,411
It's not good, right'?

769
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:05,038
Let's put it this way.

770
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:08,480
Willie Ninja would be
headspinning in his grave.

771
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,843
God rest his soul.

772
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:10,971
Um hmm.

773
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,369
Teach me then.

774
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,107
I'm here to learn
from the best.

775
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,836
Aren't you the smooth one'?

776
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,404
What makes you think
you are worth my time'?

777
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,071
I did not win 17 titles,

778
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,511
36 exemplary ribbons,

779
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:25,410
and a mention

780
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:27,072

781
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,876
Fan off your pussies, ladies.

782
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,574
We have two weeks
until the Imperial Mini Ball

783
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,671
and I want to see
trophies on that mantel.

784
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,705
Somebody get me an oil can
because my lady is rusty.

785
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,938
I wanna see someone
from Eminence

786
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,571

787
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,477

And Open To All
Runway With A Gaga Twist.

791
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:59,076
We all know which category
has my name on it...

792
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,841
Motherfuckin' Face.

793
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,540
[fingers snapping]

794
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,945
There's still shopping, sewing,
and bedazzling to be done,

795
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,880
and we are going into this ball
with honor and respect.

796
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,935
Are we clear'?

797
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,446
(all)
Yes, Mother.

798
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,572
Good. Any questions'?

<i>Emma.</i>

800
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:18,438
So, what happens if I
go into labor during the ball'?

801

[laughter]

802
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,078
If that happens, honey,

803
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,841
get me a tent,
because that means

804
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,505
frogs have come down
from the sky

805
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:26,774
and I need protective shelter.

806
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,370
[laughter]

807
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,407
Any other questions'?

808
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,772
Yes'?

809
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,575
Why y'all have
your meetings here'?

810
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,840
Excuse me'?

811
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,107
You can't bowl, <i>so...</i>

812
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,708
Why you all come here'?

813
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,474
Listen, Mr. Man Candy.

814
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,741
You need to look at
the world with a different eye.

815
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:50,043
Here you may see
a humble bowling alley.

816
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,478
But not us.

00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:30,446
Uh huh. Yeah.

1077
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,504
And you're a man with needs.

1078
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:33,978
And I like to help the needy.

1079
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,569
No sex. Remember'?

1080
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,102
I promised.

1081
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,971
Of course.

1082
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,980
No sex...

1083
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,943
Just a little tension release.

1084
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:48,469
You know...

1085
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,037
think of it as a, uh...

1086
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,479
a lap dance...

1087
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,979
with benefits.

1088
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:03,972
We won't talk about this
when we're done.

1089
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,105
We won't talk about it now.

1090
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:09,013
Just shut up,
and let me do this.

1091
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:19,004
That Brad ain't
nothing but trouble.

1092
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:20,672
I can sense these things, OK'?

1093
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,702
This coming from someone
who got themself a man

1094
00:53:22,734 --> 00:53:25,044
who does time after time
after time'?

1095
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:26,774
- Oh! She tried it?
- She tried it.

1096
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,541
Maybe I'm just
dangerously in love.

1097
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,342
Maybe you're just
dangerously a fool.

1098
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,435
[moans]

1099
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:38,902
Princess'?

1100
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,410
Princess, open this
damn door now!

1101
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,978
[knocking]

1102
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,502
<i>Don't make me ask you again!</i>

1103
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:52,774
Break it down!

1104
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,801
Do what'?

1105
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,834
Break it down!

1106
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:56,935
Ugh...

1107
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:00,445
Again!

1108
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,102
I hurt my shoulder.

1109
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:03,574
Giving birth
will hurt more.

1110
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,635
Push!

1111
00:54:05,434 --> 00:54:06,412
Push!

1112
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:08,012
Damn!

1113
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,402
Girl, we've been
hollering for you.

1114
00:54:11,434 --> 00:54:12,777
We're just
getting ready in here.

1115
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,575
What'd you have
the door locked for'?

1116
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,004
Move!

1117
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:27,677
You promised me!

1118
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,373
I swear we ain't do nothing.

1119
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,970
I can smell her all over you.

1120
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,604
She ain't you!

1121
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:33,874
Ain't that what you said'?

1122
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,504
She ain't you!

1123
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:36,877
You're a loser!

1124
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:39,008
I should have let you jump.

1125
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:41,840
You're probably right.

1126
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:44,438
The House of Eminence
isn't a place for trash.

1127
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:46,674
Good, because this trash
was tired

1128
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,702
of feeding the roaches
around here anyway.

1129
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:50,108
Going somewhere'?

1130
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,335
We're leaving.

1131
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,506
See how you do
without the best of the best.

1132
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:55,445
See how you do without
a roof over your head.

1133
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:56,673
And we'll be just fine.

1134
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,735
Princess, Queef...

1135
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,838
Let's just all work this out.
Girl, you can't leave.

1136
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,471
Princess, we need you.

1137
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,571
We do'?
I don't recall saying that shit.

1138
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,908
You know what your problem is'?

1139
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,379
You don't let people be human.

1140
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,708
And you know what your
motherfucking problem is'?

1141
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:08,712
You're not much of one.

1142
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:09,837
Fuck you, bitch!
We're leaving.

1143
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,710
No!
Queef, tell her you're sorry.

1144
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:13,042
Just tell her that you're upset.

1145
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:15,069
Mama, we can't lose her.

1146
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,512
This is my house!
We do what I say!

1147
00:55:17,534 --> 00:55:19,036
You brought all this upon us.

1148
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,671
You ain't been nothing
but bad news

1149
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,441
ever since you brought your
sorry black ass up in here.

1150
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:23,571
Get outta my house!

1151
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,806
<i>Oman Brad.</i>

1152
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,105
Don't be sad, girl.

1153
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,835
When you're chopped,
you're chopped.

1154
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,539
Let's go, Brad.

1155
00:55:49,634 --> 00:55:51,671
So where we gonna go now'?

1156
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,646
Don't you worry about that.

1157
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,704
Princess always has
a backup plan.

1158
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,906
Come on now.

1159
00:56:08,934 --> 00:56:11,107
Get your boots back, ladies.

1160
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,779

Girl, I feel you.

1168
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,438
Now don't you spend another
second thinking about him.

1169
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:41,378
He's bullshit, you're Beluga.

and her crazy baby stories.

1822
01:30:41,367 --> 01:30:42,903

You come into my world,

1830
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:02,944
turn it upside down,

1831
01:31:02,967 --> 01:31:05,038
And now you think you can
just come back into my house

1832
01:31:05,067 --> 01:31:06,478

1833
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,572

So, are we gonna

1859
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,002
Am I hearing an apology?

1860
01:32:16,034 --> 01:32:18,640
About as close as you're
ever gonna get to one, yeah.

1861
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:20,841

01:32:23,567 --> 01:32:25,945
Now, more importantly,
how do I look?

01:32:28,034 --> 01:32:29,707
Are we off to see the Wiz?

1865
01:32:30,434 --> 01:32:32,641
If I only had a heart...

1866
01:32:32,667 --> 01:32:34,374
