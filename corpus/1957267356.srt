It's the oldest profession

It's illegal.

140
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,585

Mom, come play.

142
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,326
You'd rather wait tables

00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,361
Good luck raising your kids
on that,

144

They get what they want
whenever they want it.

157
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,456
But there's one thing
they always want

158
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,324
that we don't
have to give them.

159
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,260
We can make them pay for it.

160
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,231
Make the system work for us.

If anyone ever asks you

[Letty] If he asks
too many questions...

00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,774
that you were
a hard-working man.

368
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,309
What the hell is wrong with you?

369
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,511
You have two great kids!

370
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,346
And you want to come into
your wife's place of employment

371
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,813
with a gun

372
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,848
and accuse her of doing
something inappropriate?

373
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,351
Are you stupid? Are you?

374
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,584
No.

375
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,585
Are you crazy?

376
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,853
No! I just wasn't...

377
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,721
...Thinking!
Yes, that's right.

378
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,755
You weren't thinking,
but that's okay,

379
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,790
'cause I'm gonna think
for the both of us, okay?

380
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:21,027
Now, give me the gun
before you ruin your life.

381
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,762
Come on, I don't have
all day, all right?

382
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:23,830
So give me the gun
before I call the cops

383
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,732
and tell them that
Hector Mendoza's a psychopath

384
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,368
- and he...
- I'm not a psychopath.

385
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,902
Don't make me
count to three, okay?

386
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,136
- [Hector sobbing]
- One...

387
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,005
[Hector sobs]

388
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,606
Two...

389
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,808
[Anna shrieks]

390
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,812
Chill out! Chill out!

391
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,848
Chill! You all right?

392
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,985
[Letty] What the hell
were you thinking?

393
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:46,686
It's not that big of a deal.

394
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,755
What are you talking about?

395
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,757
Calling the cops
is a huge deal!

396
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,624
Tina never
should have done that.

397
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,726
She's fired.

398
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,628
Whoa! Can we just think
about this rationally?

399
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,530
There were gunshots.

400
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,864
What the hell
was she supposed to do?

401
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,333
Not call the cops!

402
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,468
Now we're on their radar.

403
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,371
I got a whole department
wanting massages for 25% off.

404
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,840
That's the last thing we need!

405
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,311
Why'd you even open the door
in the first place?

406
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,912
I thought he was a customer
and we needed the money.

407
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,747
We always need the money

408
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,149
because you refuse to update

409
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,684
and modernize
your business practices.

410
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,719
Just because you read a book

411
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,788
doesn't mean you know
how to run a business, Anna.

412
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,922
It's common sense. Okay?

413
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,158
If we charged a premium,

414
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,026
we would have
higher-quality clients,

415
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,161
the girls would work less,

416
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,763
and we wouldn't have to hustle
for every single dime.

417
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,731
I mean, Enema Man?

418
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,967
One point Anna.

419
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,736
Look, I've run
the numbers, okay?

420
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,738
Work smarter not harder.

421
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,441
We could do so much
for ourselves,

422
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:43,810
for the girls,
for everyone,

423
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,879
if we just make a few changes.

424
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:46,447
I like this.
Two points Anna.

425
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,882
Goodnight, Arthur.

426
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,351
Yep. Goodnight.

427
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,319
Good luck.

428
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,826
So you think
you can do better?

429
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,428
I think
the girls can do better.

430
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,197
And I think you can do better.

431
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,374
I like my place.

432
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,442
[Anna sighs]

433
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,478
I can afford my place.

434
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,713
It's people like you

435
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,250
who think too big
and aim too high

436
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:24,451
that end up in prison.

437
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,486
Don't fire Tina.

438
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,986
It's already done.

439
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,255
Well, then, if she goes,

440
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,923
I go.

441
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,161
Fine.

442
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,366
Fine.

443
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,372
[Anna] <i>I was at rock bottom.</i>

444
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,241
<i>No money, no job,</i>

445
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>and was about to be
thrown out on the street</i>

446
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,809
<i>with my kids.</i>

447
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,445
So what do we do now?

448
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,181
We could be secretaries.

449
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,816
Yeah.

450
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,952
I'd let you come stay with us,

451
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,954
but me and the kids are back
living with my mother.

452
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,425
Look.

453
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,925
Letty won't tell you this,

454
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:06,627
but in the six months
that you worked there,

455
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,962
things have never run smoother...

456
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,163
except that last part.

457
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,131
- Really?
- Art said so every day.

458
00:17:14,235 --> 00:17:15,202
Milo! Celeste!

460
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,406
Why don't you open
your own business?

461
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,441
Seriously?

462
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,376
Why not?

463
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:22,809
I'd come work for you.

464
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,081
Think about it.

465
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,219
See you around.

466
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,287
Yeah.

467
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,288

[Anna]
<i>And that's when I decided</i>

470
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,492
<i>I had to take a leap.</i>

471
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,393
<i>I had nothing to lose.</i>

Hey, Art? It's me.

475

I have a crazy idea.

476
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,573
Well, kids.

477
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,309
What do you think?

478
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,310
It's gross.

479
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,411
Smells like poop.

480
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,912
No, John Christopher.
This smells like potential.

481
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,181
I see it.

482
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,150
Oh, by the way, you're it.

Never.

Well, I left home when I was 15

is living well.

doesn't mean I'm stupid.

00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,845
Getting close, anyway.

725
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:25,879
How'd you know?

726
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:28,014
Just a feeling.

727
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,450
Too many hung-up calls.

728
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,786
Cars I didn't recognize,
driving by too slow.

729
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,521
Too often.

730
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,624
That's partly why
I couldn't branch out.

731
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,726
Didn't know
if I was being watched.

732
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,094
Well, why didn't you
say anything?

733
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:44,798
Mm. My business, my problem.

734
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,000
[chuckles]

735
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,638
Well, I mean,
if you need some extra cash,

736
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,173
you can, uh, you can always
come work for me.

737
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,141
You can't afford me.

738
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,176
[laughs]

739
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,911
I'll think about it.

740
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:00,447
[chuckling]

741
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,917
[Anna] <i>And just like that,
my team was complete.</i>

742
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:12,926
There you go, sweetheart.

743
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,094
Hey, Mom.

744
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,896
Hi, beautiful girl.

745
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,530
[Anna]
<i>Welcome to my double life.</i>

746
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,532
<i>On the weekdays,</i>

747
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:20,800
<i>my children
were off to school by 7:00.</i>

748
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,937
<i>My daughter rode horses
and my son played soccer.</i>

749
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,873
<i>As for my business,
I ran it like a Fortune 500.</i>

750
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,975
<i>I ran it
clean, honest, and fair.</i>

751
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,344
<i>I shut my phone off
on Friday night</i>

752
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:33,146
<i>and never worked a weekend
unless there was a problem.</i>

753
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,215
[Anna shrieks]

754
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:34,881
<i>I even opened a nail salon
as a front</i>

755
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,217
<i>to keep things legal...</i>

756
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,817
<i>well, legal-ish.</i>

757
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:38,952
<i>And to give my kids
something to say</i>

758
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,888
<i>when people asked
what I did for a living.</i>

759
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,491
<i>Vicky and Tina were
my first paying customers.</i>

760
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:46,826
[laughing and shrieking]

761
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,932
All right, so,
I'm gonna be at your game,

762
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,801
but Ms. Robbie's gonna
give you a ride there, okay?

763
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:55,735
Okay.

764
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,571
I love you.
Hey! Learn something today.

765
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,174
Bye, honey.

766
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,677
I owe you so much.
Thank you.

767
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,913
Oh. And here are some snacks
for half-time.

768
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,048
Perfect.

769
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,549
Oh. How many raffle tickets
did you want this year?

770
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,085
Uh... a thousand.

771
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:14,221
Anything for
the Eastside Eagles, right?

772
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:15,256
Yeah.

773
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:17,624
All right, thank you, honey.

774
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:18,858
- I appreciate it.
- See ya.

775
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,527
Bye.

776
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,228
[gasps as brakes screech]

777
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,730
Oh! So sorry.

778
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,100
[school bell rings]

779
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,203
[Anna] <i>Once or twice a month,</i>

780
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:31,171
<i>I'd go into the city
to do business.</i>

781
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,206
<i>I never knew what to expect,</i>

782
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,341
<i>but, honestly,</i>

783
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:34,641
<i>I stopped being surprised
a long time ago.</i>

784
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:36,609
That's him.

785
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:41,481
Go get him, girls.

786
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,886

<i>Alias: Amber Alert.</i>

790
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:57,497
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

791
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,266
What's going on?
Who are you guys?

792
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,836
- Tell me you've been naughty!
- Let's go.

[Adam groaning, muffled]

794
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:05,605
Someone's been naughty!

795
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,841
And he has a bad peepee.

796
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:08,508
[muffled]
I have a bad peepee.

797
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,311
[Anna] <i>There was no sex.</i>

798
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:12,112
<i>Just the thrill
of getting abducted</i>

799

<i>and slapped around</i>

800
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,881

802
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:19,986
Tell me you've been naughty!
[groaning] Oh, ho, ho!

803
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,021
How bad?

804
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:21,788
Oh! Real bad!

805
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,124
- Here it is!
- You've got this!

806
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,924
Whoo!

Let's support each other
out there!

Mom! You're, like, so late.

809
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,829
I know. I'm sorry.
What did I miss?

810
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,197
Well, John Christopher scored.

811
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,233
- Yes!
- Yeah.

812
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,067
[Anna] Come on, honey!

813
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,003
What are these?

814
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,038
College, mom.

815
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,607
Mr. Colson says we have
to start thinking early.

816

[Ms. Robbie]
That reminds me.

Yeah.

818

- Oh, thank you.
- By the way...

820
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,679
the other moms are convinced
you just buy them up yourself.

821
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:49,582
Not true.
I never cheat!

822
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,818

fair and square.

Here. Let me put it on.

851
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,423
You started working for me
five years ago today.

852
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:05,024
You were my first girl
to ever book a job

853
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:08,295
and you are still
my number-one girl.

854
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,132
To you.

855
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:13,300
To us.

You think?

People whisper about it.

875
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:55,942
I'm not judging.

876
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:56,477
It just seems so...

[sighs]

878
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:01,415
Everyone that you talk to

879
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:02,749
is so fancy.

880
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:03,816
- Where're you from?
- Spokane.

881
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,019
You're a terrible waitress.

882
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:06,819
[laughs]

883
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:08,355
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

884
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,225
What do you want
in life, Spokane?

885
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,026
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

886
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,894
Well, you know what I do,

887
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:16,162
so let me work for you.

888
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:17,797
Me?

889
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,300
[scoffs] Really?

890
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,501
I... [laughs]

891
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,236
No.

892
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,770
I couldn't.

893
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:24,837
Squeamish? Shy?

894
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:26,273
- No. No.
- Drugs?

895
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:27,241
Boyfriend?

896
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:28,875
No.

897
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:29,876
You're perfect.

898
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,078
There's a few things

899
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,913
your mother probably
never told you, Spokane.

900
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:37,451
Being young and beautiful
is a privilege.

901
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:37,984
It doesn't last long,

902
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,520
but if you're smart,

903
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:41,854
you can cash in

Good, I think.

Hi.

00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,414
Is that one yours?

1100
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,416
- Yeah.
- She looks comfortable.

1101

How long did that take?

1102

Five years? Six, maybe.

I promised her
I'd get Emma into it.

My kid has no interest

She wants to play the violin.

What, she can't do both?

1109
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,267

Hey, you okay?

Oh, well, now she hates horses.
Lovely.

1134
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:03,957
It's a good thing
it's just a sprained ankle.

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,958
Mm.

is "head hunting"?

00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:59,606
<i>King Lear's</i>
always been my favorite.

1442
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,040
And I got room service.

1443
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:02,709
All the room service.

1444
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,043
Strawberries?

1445
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:05,712
I want my money back.

1446
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:08,348
Were you bad, Bob?
Did you disobey Mistress?

1447
00:54:08,382 --> 00:54:09,716
He was nine minutes late.

1448
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,287
Mistress was displeased.

1449
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,854
He had to be punished.

1450
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:15,589
I'm not paying for this!

1451
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:17,089
You're absolutely right.

1452
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,261
You're paying double.

1453
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:22,094
You broke the rules,

1454
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,231
you were disrespectful
to Mistress,

1455
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:26,032
and you got me out of
my kid's Sweet 16 party.

1456
00:54:26,065 --> 00:54:30,737
You know how often a Sweet 16
happens in a kid's life, Bob?

1457
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,138
Once.

1458
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:35,007
Exactly. So double, plus tip.

1459
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:36,210
And I don't care
if she leaves you

1460
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:37,511
tied up like this
till morning.

1461
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,616
Do we understand each other?

1462
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:44,183
Mm-hmm.

1463
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:44,918
Apologize to your mistress.

1464
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:47,287
[muffled]
I'm sorry, Mistress.

1465
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:48,020
And you're also buying
100 raffle tickets

1466
00:54:48,054 --> 00:54:49,756
to support the Eastside Eagles.

1467
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,791
Are we clear?

1468
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,593
Mm-hmm.

1469
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:55,262
He's all yours, Lola.

1470
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:07,274
[tires screeching]

1471
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:09,676
Mom?

1472
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,078
Why aren't you in bed?

1473
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:13,145
Why are you sneaking around?

1474
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,081
What's up with you lately?

1475
00:55:15,114 --> 00:55:16,817
You just had an amazing
Sweet 16 party.

1476
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,151
You missed
the last half of it.

1477
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:20,821
I had an emergency at work.

1478
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:23,189
- With "head-hunting"?
- Yes.

1479
00:55:23,223 --> 00:55:24,658
What was it?

1480
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:28,094
A client wasn't happy
and didn't want to pay.

1481
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:29,830
That couldn't wait
until Monday?

1482
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:31,331
That's the business.

1483
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:32,332
What do you want me to do?

1484
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:34,468
It just paid for your party
now, didn't it?

1485
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:34,968
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Mom?

1486
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:38,137
Mia, what is this?

1487
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,706
Why can't you just say no?

1488
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,609
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

1489
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:44,176
Go to bed.

1490
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,182
[sighing]

1491
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:54,421
- Here you go.
- Hey.

1492
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:58,859
[bill counter clacking]

1493
00:55:58,892 --> 00:56:01,762
Have you gotten
any dropped calls recently?

1494
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:02,663
-A few. Why?

1495
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,431
- So have I.
- Me too.

1496
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:06,366
It's not good, Anna.

1497
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,367
[Art] And it's not just that.

1498
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:09,201
It's the girls, too...
Jasmine, Trish, Lucy.

1499
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:11,137
Word on the street

1500
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,606
is they're getting poached.

1501
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:13,574
By who?

1502
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:14,875
Don't know.
Someone who's new to the game.

1503
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:16,510
And they're not only
taking the girls,

1504
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:17,344
they're taking the clients,

1505
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,580
and they're marking
their territory.

1506
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:20,581
I think it's...

1507
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,450
What?

1508
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:24,484
Time.

1509
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:26,118
Might be time to get out, Anna.

1510
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:27,254
No!

1511
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,256
No! Why are you even
talking like that?

1512
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,691
How many times
do I have to say it?

1513
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:32,893
No amount of money
is worth your freedom,

1514
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:34,126
and listen to your gut.

1515
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,062
When things get weird,

1516
00:56:35,094 --> 00:56:37,196
it's the universe telling you
it's time.

1517
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:41,568
No.

1518
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:43,904
No, I'm not
gonna be intimidated.

1519
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:45,272
What kind of message
does that send?

1520
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:46,306
That you're smart.

1521
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,474
That I'm scared!

1522
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:48,909
If I have to dangle someone else
out the window, I will.

1523
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:51,678
- Anna.
- We are business as usual.

1524
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:54,180
Letty, go into the city
and start asking around.

1525
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:54,915
See what you can find out
about whoever's messing

1526
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:57,451
with my bottom line.

1527
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:59,286
Arthur, if you're spooked,
we can reroute websites,

1528
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,887
start another LLC,
and pause deposits.

1529
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:03,523
Happy?

1530
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:05,759
Okay.

1531
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,269
[Anna] <i>I was losing her.</i>

1532
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:17,604
<i>I could feel it.</i>

1533
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,306
<i>Kids know
when you're lying to them,</i>

1534
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:22,676
<i>and if they can't trust you,
they resent you.</i>

1535
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:25,278
Put that away.

1536
00:57:25,312 --> 00:57:27,714
I want to talk to you
about something.

1537
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:29,616
You know that,
ever since Dad died,

1538
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,318
I work very hard

1539
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:33,152
to provide for you
and your brother, right?

1540
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:35,789
And I love you both
so much.

1541
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:39,826
How would you feel
if I told you that I...

1542
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:44,231
That you...?

1543
00:57:44,264 --> 00:57:47,868
[sighs]

1544
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:49,569
...Have a boyfriend.

1545
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,704
That's it?

1546
00:57:51,872 --> 00:57:53,340
That's it.

1547
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:55,242
Are you sure
there's nothing else?

1548
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,444
That's it, kiddo.

1549
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,846
I'd be happy for you, Mom.

1550
00:58:02,015 --> 00:58:04,951
[♪♪]

1551
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,954
[phone rings]

1552
00:58:07,988 --> 00:58:10,323
This is Anna.

1553
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,325
[line hangs up]

1554
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,461
[dial tone buzzing]

1555
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:18,932
[Anna sighs]

1556
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:21,468
[phone rings]

1557
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:22,201
[snaps] Who is this?

1558
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:24,237
Anna. It's me.
Are you okay?

1559
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,640
Yeah. Yeah,
I just got a little spooked.

1560
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,909
I have good news and bad news.

1561
00:58:28,942 --> 00:58:31,912
The good news is, I found out
who's poaching your girls.

1562
00:58:31,945 --> 00:58:32,446
Who is it?

1563
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:34,948
That's the bad news.

1564
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:36,483
It's Vicky.

1565
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:41,288
[Anna] <i>That's when
I realized Letty was right.</i>

1566
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:43,356
<i>I'd made a mistake.</i>

1567
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,391
<i>Gone too far.</i>

1568
00:58:44,424 --> 00:58:46,760
<i>I had to be smarter.</i>

1569
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,697
Anna?

1570
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,933
You did good.

1571
00:58:52,966 --> 00:58:53,967
I'll take care of it.

1572
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,801
<i>I don't want</i>

1573
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,636
any part
of your "taking care" of it.

1574
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,940
Anna, now might be
a really good time

1575
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:00,941
to consider getting...

1576
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:02,309
<i>We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

1577
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:04,911
[car tires screeching]

1578
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,916
[engine rumbles]

1579
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,021
Who are you?

1580
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,923
Who sent you?

1581
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:18,658
You think you can scare me?

1582
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:19,426
You think you can
show up at my house?

1583
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:21,027
Mom?

1584
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,963
What the hell?

1585
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:24,798
[groans and sighs]

1586
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:27,601
Are you drunk?

1587
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,702
No.

1588
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:32,272
Get outta here before I call
the cops, you little creep.

1589
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,943
Inside. Now.

1590
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,015
Since when do you drink?

1591
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:43,784
I had a wine cooler.

1592
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:44,351
Big deal.

1593
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:46,353
And who was that guy?

1594
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:48,088
A boy who's my friend.

1595
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,623
So now you have
a secret boyfriend?

1596
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:51,324
It's better than
a secret life.

1597
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:52,492
What's that supposed to mean?

1598
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,427
You think I'm stupid?

1599
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:57,631
You don't just run a salon.

1600
00:59:57,664 --> 00:59:59,099
Marty's dad's a head-hunter,

1601
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,500
and he has an office

1602
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:02,736
and normal business hours

1603
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,572
and doesn't always
pay for things in hundreds.

1604
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,975
I know
what you do for a living.

1605
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:12,712
What is it
that you think I do?

1606
01:00:12,746 --> 01:00:13,446
Ask away.

1607
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,749
20 questions. Go.

1608
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,384
- Are you a millionaire?
- Yes.

1609
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,785
Are you paid in cash?

1610
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:19,352
Yes.

1611
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,454
Is what you do legal?

1612
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:23,824
No.

1613
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,892
If someone found out,
could you go to jail?

1614
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,861
Don't lie.

1615
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,731
Yes.

1616
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:33,333
Are you a drug dealer?

1617
01:00:33,366 --> 01:00:35,101
What?

1618
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,804
Listen to me, Mia.

01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:43,450
Not everyone grew up upstate
with both their parents

1973
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:45,852
and graduated high school
and got to go to college.

1974
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:48,588
Some of us got kicked out
and were on the streets at 15.

1975
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:51,291
Some of us had to make a living
the best way we knew how

1976
01:14:51,324 --> 01:14:52,759
to provide for ourselves
and our kids

1977
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:54,728
after our husbands
crash into a median

1978
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:56,463
and get thrown
through a windshield.

1979
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:57,196
Whoa.
Where is this coming from?

was $2 million in seed money.</i>

1984

<i>And the best part?
Totally legal.</i>

1985

<i>If I played my cards right,</i>

1986
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:16,349
<i>Mia would never know
I broke my promise.</i>

1987
01:15:16,383 --> 01:15:17,751
<i>I called Arthur</i>

1988
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:19,486
<i>and he arranged for us to meet
with a pair of investors.</i>

1989
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:21,621
My business has always been

1990
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:23,356
about catering
to the most exclusive clients.

1991
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,492
As Arthur can tell you,

1992
01:15:25,525 --> 01:15:27,661
I turned a profit
with my first business

1993
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:28,795
within the first two months,

1994
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:31,031
and I expect
I can do even better here.

1995
01:15:31,064 --> 01:15:32,999
We like it.

1996
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,635

1997

They better be legit, Arthur.

1998
01:15:42,743 --> 01:15:44,044
- They are.
- Well, you need to be sure

1999
01:15:44,077 --> 01:15:45,278

want to be knee-deep

2000
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:46,613
in Russian hooker drug money.

2001
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,949
My kids are counting on me
not to keep messing up.

2002
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:50,317
I know that.
You don't think I know that?

2003
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,786
Your kids
are like my kids, Anna.

2004
01:15:54,454 --> 01:15:55,589
Look. Look.

2005
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:56,156

Nothing. No.

You don't have counsel,

at least 24 hours

a public defender.

01:23:11,057 --> 01:23:12,825
<i>I was all over the local news,</i>

2148
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:14,194
<i>and the moment
I stepped outside,</i>

2149
01:23:14,228 --> 01:23:15,695
<i>there were a dozen reporters
trying to get my picture.</i>

2150
01:23:17,931 --> 01:23:20,099
<i>So I couldn't leave the house.</i>

2151
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,168
<i>Letty came
to get John Christopher,</i>

2152
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:25,472
<i>and, finally,
it was just Mia and me.</i>

2153
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:28,875
Where are you going?

2154
01:23:28,908 --> 01:23:30,511
I'm going to stay with Letty.

2155
01:23:30,544 --> 01:23:31,911
What do you care?

2156
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:33,813
I care
because I'm your mother.

2157
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:36,383
I don't have a mother.

2158
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:37,951
How could you say that?

2159
01:23:37,984 --> 01:23:39,320
You said you were out.

2160
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,255
I was! I-I tried.

2161
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:41,955
You lied.

2162
01:23:41,988 --> 01:23:43,756
Maybe you shouldn't have been

2163
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,792
a frigging madam
in the first place.

2164
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:48,728
What's wrong with you?

2165
01:23:50,431 --> 01:23:52,131
I did my best, Mia.

2166
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:56,002
It wasn't good enough.

2167
01:23:56,035 --> 01:23:58,137
You ruined everything...

2168
01:23:58,171 --> 01:23:59,806
this house, riding lessons.

2169
01:23:59,839 --> 01:24:03,477
My Sweet 16!

2170
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,844
But who cares?

2171
01:24:04,877 --> 01:24:06,846
None of that matters.

2172
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:09,849
We could've been living
in a box somewhere

2173
01:24:09,882 --> 01:24:12,785
and that would've been
better than all this.

2174
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:15,289
At least we would have
all been together.

2175
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,793
Now everything's gone.

2176
01:24:20,827 --> 01:24:22,329
Mia, I did my best.

2177
01:24:22,363 --> 01:24:24,231
And it's your fault!

2178
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:28,469
And I'm never
speaking to you again.

2179
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:30,437
Mia?

2180
01:24:30,471 --> 01:24:32,273
[Mia sobs]

2181
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:43,783
[sobbing]

2182
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,392
[Anna] <i>This is what
a breakdown looks like.</i>

2183
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:53,227
<i>I didn't know
where I was going.</i>

2184
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,562
<i>I just knew
I had to go somewhere,</i>

2185
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:57,398
<i>to start over.</i>

2186
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:57,797
[sniffling]

2187
01:25:03,637 --> 01:25:05,472
<i>I drove all night,</i>

2188
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:08,575
<i>and then, there it was,
a pig rescue farm.</i>

2189
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:15,114
<i>I spent 14 months
at a rescue pig farm</i>

2190
01:25:15,148 --> 01:25:16,849
<i>as a live-in volunteer,
off the grid in Pennsylvania.</i>

2191
01:25:16,883 --> 01:25:20,387
<i>Who would have even thought
to look for me there?</i>

2192
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:23,089
<i>That's where
I got my sanity back.</i>

2193
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,362
<i>And every day,
I called my daughter.</i>

2194
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:29,563
Mia?

2195
01:25:29,596 --> 01:25:31,097
Mia, are you there?

2196
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,098
<i>She never answered</i>

2197
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:34,401
<i>until that one day
when she did.</i>

2198
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:35,402
[Anna] <i>That's okay,</i>

2199
01:25:35,436 --> 01:25:39,005
you don't have to talk,
but if you'll, uh...

2200
01:25:39,038 --> 01:25:40,173
you'll just listen.

2201
01:25:40,207 --> 01:25:43,577
<i>Look, I know "sorry"
isn't a big enough word.</i>

2202
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,945
I won't even bother saying it.

2203
01:25:48,047 --> 01:25:48,649
I just... I want you to know

2204
01:25:48,682 --> 01:25:51,884
I love you so much

2205
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:53,186
and I am...

2206
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,356
I am so proud of you.

2207
01:25:56,523 --> 01:25:58,091
<i>So...</i>

2208
01:25:58,124 --> 01:25:59,660
<i>my phone will always be on.</i>

2209
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:02,663
If you call, day or night,

2210
01:26:02,696 --> 01:26:05,399
I swear I will pick it up.

2211
01:26:09,035 --> 01:26:11,871
Maybe one day
you can forgive me.

2212
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,543
I miss you, kiddo.
