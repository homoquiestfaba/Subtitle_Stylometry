185
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,869
Everything's okay.

186
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,288
I was trying to get
to New Orleans,

187
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,542
but I got no money.

189

I don't know.

191
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,555
Maybe you' all might be able
to help me out.

Come on, quick!

198
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,828
Right, calm down.

199
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,290
I'm just here
for the money, okay?

200
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,963
Not that you don't look tasty
in them nightgowns,

201
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,256
-I ain't here for that.
-[gun clicks]

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,052
Other girls around here? Hm?

203
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,556
It can't just be you two.

204
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,477
All alone in this big,
old dormitory.

205

-All right.

I know your friend, all right?
We're travelin' buddies.

215
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,857

-[Barbara] We're rolling?
-[ma] Yep, you're up.

238
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,180
This is Barbara BiIIings,
with WLAI.

239
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,933
It is an awful sight
and just a heinous crime.

240
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,935
Eight nursing students
were found this morning,

241
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,478
in this dormitory behind me.

242
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,982
Each apparently raped
and murdered by various methods,

243
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,526
-from stabbing to strangulation.
-[woman cries bitterly]

244
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,279
Come on. Keep rolling.
Don't stop.

245
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,030
We are not answering
any questions…

246
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,866
I just want to ask you a few.

247
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,701
She's been sequestered, will
not answer any questions.

248
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,785
Do you know who it was?

249
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,745
-M' am, do you know who it was?
-Miss, please back off.

250
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,747
-[crying continues]
-Get them. Get them!

251
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,086
[car engine starts]

252
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,676

[female footsteps]

254
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,237
Mrs. Billings, please.
I can't let you inside.

255
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,407
Captain, come on.
I just want to see for myself.

256
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,536
-There are no cameras.
-Not this one. Please.

257
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,498
[reporter] Any comments?
Captain Dunning, any comments?

258
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,585
Whitaker, it’s about time
you showed up.

259
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,046
I was working
the six other cases

260
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,297
you piled on me this week.

261
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,299
[Barbara whispers]

262
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,301
-[Dunning] It's not good, sir.
-Come on…

263
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,929
Mrs. BiIIings, please!

264
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,847
If you don't clear
the crime scene,

265
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,183
I'm gonna have to consider you
a suspect!

266
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,143
-Please.
-All right.

267
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,565
You might want to brace yourself
before we go inside.

268
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,027
After 30 years
of investigating crime scenes,

269
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,237
you think
I need to prepare myself?

270
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,656
This is particularly nasty.

271
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,033
All right.
Why don't you fill me in?

272
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,746
I count eight bodies.

273
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,415
-Eight bodies?
-Yeah.

274
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,793
All young girls,

275
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,753
and they were all…

276
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,756
… stabbed, strangled and raped.

277
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,092
Please tell me that no one
has infected the interior.

278
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,135
No, we've been able
to hold down forensics.

279
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,013
Only myself and Harper
and have been inside.

280
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,684
Appreciate that, Joe.
A survivors?

281
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,310
Yes, one.

282
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,230
A woman namedd Sondra Azano.

283
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,899
She was able to hide
under the bed

284
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,360
during the entire attack,
all night long.

285
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,238
[Whitaker] Heavens.
Did you get a statement?

286
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,575
No. She was too historical
for anything specific.

287
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,870
She did say
it was only one suspect.

288
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,040
Unless there's anything else,
I'll start m investigation.

289
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:08,589
Yeah, well, considering I have
race riots in South Chicago,

290
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,800
I got a democratic convention
coming in next week,

291
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,137
I would appreciate it
if you find this freak

292
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,848
quickly and quietly.

293
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,143
-You ready?
-Yeah.

294
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,312
Here we go.

295
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,610
[Whitaker] Oh.

301
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,764
I know. I know. I'm Sorry.

302
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,557
Sorry.

303
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,437
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,650
I ain't never done anything like
that to nobody

305
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,819
in all my life, I swear to God.

306
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,866
I'm sorry it had to be you.

307
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,247
[woman cries despondently]

308
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,335
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,090
[ominous music intensifies]

310
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,013
I'll do one for ya.

311
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,016
I'll make it quick.

312
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,185
-[woman gasping]
-Okay?

313
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:50,315
Well then, yes,
just say a prayer

314
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,152
This is your last mark.

315
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,866
[ominous music intensifies]

[dramatic music continues]

321
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,957
You're a sick son of a bitch,
Richard Speck.

322

[dark dramatic music]

323
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,389
Just have another fucking pee.

[Dunning sighs]

327
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,573
Gruesome.

328
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,327
Yeah. Honestly.

329
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:31,500
I've never seen anything
like it … ever.

330
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,002
These women had families,

331
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,881
friends, boyfriends…

332
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,425
lives.

333
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,137
They were gonna go
out in the world

334
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,472
and do extraordinary things.

335
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,686
And some sick bastard comes
and takes it all away from them.

336
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,814
We gotta get this guy, Joe.

337
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:00,320
And maybe…
maybe the loved ones will…

338
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,200
be able to find
some sort of peace in that.

339
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,372
What kind of animal does this?

340
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,918
Jack.

341
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,633
We've got some more bodies
down the hall.

342
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,308
God bless you, sweetheart.

343
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,650
Brace yourselves.

[sudden ominous music]

345
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,123
Who would do such a thing?

[heavy solemn music]

347
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,384
Jack.

348
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,262
There's more.

[door shuts]

351
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,404
I can't stand the odor.

352
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,244
[heavy ominous music]

353
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,095
[ominous music continues]

354
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,446
All right.

355
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,251
-Is that it?
-Yeah..

356
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,599
They've all been stabbed
multiple times.

357
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,311
Judging by the angle
of the wounds,

358
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,689
our guy was right-handed.

359
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,482
[Whitaker] Tied them all up.

360
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,984
[girls whimpering]

361
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,360
Took them away one by one,

362
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,488
-and he killed them.
-I ain't gonna hurt you.

363
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,783
What do you say?
What do you know?

364
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,951
What's happening? Any theories?

365
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,120
No rhyme, no reason.

366
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,164
Jack. Jack.

367
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,125
We gotta get an all-points
bulletin out on this guy.

368
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:04,630
Jack, let me make something
absolutely crystal clear, okay?

369
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,549
You have to catch this bastard
before the word creeps out

370
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,885
that there's a mass murderer
floating around Chicago.

371
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,887
Or all hell's gonna break loose.

372
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,889
The city's already
teetering on the edge

373
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,808
I got Mayor Daly up my ass'
if things get any worse.

374
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,811
Captain, I don't give a crap
what Mayor Daley thinks.

375
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,355
What we have here this city,

376
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,565
can affect us
in a whole different way.

377
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,734
Jack, you got three days.

378
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,486
After that, I'm gonna have to
pull the plug,

379
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,695
and bury this investigation.

380
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,490
-Joe, come on.
-Politicians, writers,

381
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,450
I can't add a mass murderer
to the mix.

382
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:34,952
You're not gonna close
this case, Joe.

383
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,453
Three days, Jack.

384
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,205
-The case isn't going away, Joe.
-Three days!

385
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:42,292
Three days. Just make it
your priority, please!

386
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,294
Excuse me.

387
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,510
Did the vic calm down enough
to give us a description?

388
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,845
She has, sir.

389
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,763
She described him
as wearing all black,

390
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:58,350
tall-approximately 6’ 3”,
blond hair, and uh…

391
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,769
and most importantly,
a severely acne-scarred face.

392
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,813
That's good Harper.
That's real good.

393
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,148
Thankfully, we have something
we can work with.

394
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,818
Have an artist work up a sketch.

395
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:13,574
I saw hand prints on the necks
of the victims in there.

396
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,201
See if the forensics
can pull a print.

397
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,288
Start questioning
the student at the college.

398
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,623
Someone has to have seen
this bastard.

399
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,586
Listen up, guys.

400
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,005
We've got a mass murderer
on the loose.

401
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,550
We have to catch this animal
before he strikes again.

402
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:33,760
In all my years,

403
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,681
I never saw anything,
like the scene inside that dorm.

404
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,811
I suggest, you take a walk
through in there.

405
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,772
See what another human being
is capable of.

406
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,776
And burn the images
of those girls into your brains,

407
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,863
so that you have as much
to motive you as I do.

408
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,158
-All right?
-Yes sir.

409
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,242
All right.

410
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:58,869
[suspenseful music]

411
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,580
Go see what the devil can do.

412
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,083
I'm gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

413
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:07,794
[suspenseful music intensifies]

414
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,802
[suspenseful music continues]

415
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,697
[rhythmic electric guitar music]

416
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,788
Do you have a light,
by any chance?

417
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,457
My match is worked for shit.

418
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,251
Yes, sir.

419
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,295
Yeah, I found this cigarette
over from Bali.

420
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,256
I [indistinct] this shit.

421
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,342
-Lucky you.
-Mm-hm.

422
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,387
Can't believe someone would

423
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,806
throw away a perfectly good
cigarette like that.

424
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,225
Maybe there is a reason for it.

425
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,272
You know what?
I think you may be right.

426
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,774
Harry.

427
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:16,822
Could I get a real cigarette
a shot of whiskey, and a pickle?

428
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:21,118
-Could I have a soda, please.
-Coming right up.

429
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,997
-Want some whiskey in it?
-No.

430
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,958
-Here's yours.
-Oh.

431
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,127
Thank you.

432
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,632
Do you have a light?

433
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,719
[soft electric music]

434
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:50,314
You look like one of those …
airplane waitresses.

435
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,569
-I am a stewardess, yes.
- Get the fuck out of here!!

436
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,697
You're a real stewardess?

437
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,408
Harry, she's a real life
stewardess.

438
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,492
I heard.

439
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,286
Wow!

440
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:05,954
Oh…

441
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,665
-Pickle.
-[chuckles]

442
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,836
What's it like being up there,
in the air with the birds?

443
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,797
It's really great once your ears
stop popping.

444
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:22,346
-Your ears pop? That's weird.
-Thats the pressure.

445
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,306
Hey, I'm under
a lot of pressure.

446
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,600
I guess my ears
should be popping all the time.

447
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,063
Yeah, this is my dinner.

448
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,067
A pickle and some peanuts.

449
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,779
That's like pregnancy food.
Just needs some ice-cream.

450
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,698
Do you want to get pregnant?

451
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,954
Not until I have my MRS degree.

452
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,040
What the hell is that?

453
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,251
Married.

454
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,169
[Richard chuckles]

455
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,508
Ah, you are one of them
goody two shoes.

456
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,638
What do you like better?

457
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,599
A little baby peanut,

458
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,102
or a big old pickle?

459
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,062
I don't like either.

460
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,314
Oh, I love them both.

461
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,947
I bet your panties
would look nice wet.

462
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,450
You can skip the soda.

463
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,417
I'm sorry, Harry.

464
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,544
What the hell's
the matter with you?

465
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,881
-If I can figure that out…
-[laughs mockingly]

466
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,966
… I can save my soul.

467
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,390
-[phone rings]
-[light suspenseful music]

468
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,030
Jack, we just got a report
from a liquor store owner.

469
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,868
Jack, I know
this case is horrible,

470
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,704
but I've never seen you
so personally by it.

471
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,665
I knew one of them, Joe.

472
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,418
Geez, I'm sorry, Jack.
I had no idea.

473
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,922
It turned out to be the daughter
of an old college buddy I had.

474
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,090
[heavy dramatic music]

475
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,641
[phone rings]

476
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,063
So, uh…

477
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:38,732
did you tell his parents?

478
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,234
Yeah.

479
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,029
The hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

480
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,116
I don't know anymore, Joe.

481
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:49,826
I'm kinda lost.

482
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,162
I don't recognize this place
anymore, I mean…

483
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,957
I mean, is it us?

484
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,251
Are we getting soft
in our old age?

485
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,671
It is a new generation.

486
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:05,425
Ever since World War Two,
people no longer value life.

487
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,179
I don't know, Joe.

488
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:11,807
I hope it is not that.

489
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,852
I just think
this guy is a scumbag,

490
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:19,523
made just like Jack the Ripper
and the Boston Strangler.

491
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,568
You were saying something
when you came in.

492
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,571
Yeah, the newbie, Harper,

493
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,241
he interviewed the owner
of the liquor store.

494
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,536
Just today, he said
a guy fitting our description

495
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,455
came in complaining about
being double booked

496
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,125
in the Marine Merchants'
Union Hall.

497
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,002
I figured
you want to get right on it.

498
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,087
[Whitaker laughs] Yeah.

499
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,549
Go get him, Jack.
Go get that son of a--

500
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:47,718
[ominous music]

501
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,058
[door shuts]

502
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:57,853
[soft jazz music]

503
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,815
-[chuckles]
-Detective Jack Whitaker.

504
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,735
I advise you
to get off the phone, ma'am.

505
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,320
-I'm going to have to--
-Now!

506
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,324
Yes. I'll talk to you later.

507
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,494
Is this how you treat
your union members?

508
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,038
No sir, I was just--

509
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,040
I don't care
what you were "just".

510
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,416
All right. Now listen up.

511
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,044
I've been back and forth
across this town for three days

512
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,505
and I am tired, damn tired.

513
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,256
Now I'm here on a whim,

514
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,467
so don't waste my time
with lies, you got that?

515
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,970
Tell me how this business works.

516
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,681
Well,

517
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,391
shipping companies let us know

518
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,185
when there's a job
available on the boats..

519
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:41,063
We contact the next
union member on the list,

520
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,649
After that, we show them
to the correct docks.

521
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,360
You ever double book your jobs?

522
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:49,780
-Well--
-Hey look.

523
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,908
I’m not the labor board.
I’m not going to report you.

524
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,037
Well, these men
are not reliable.

525
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,706
Often times we call them
but they don't show up,

526
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,667
And to protect ourselves,

527
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,753
sometimes we'll book two members
for the same job.

528
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,172
Very often, I can find
the other man a job.

529
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:08,549
Has it happened recently?

530
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,261
Yes, it happened
a few nights ago.

531
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,096
A man was very upset with me.

532
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,682
He said he drove all the way
from Dallas to find a job.

533
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,017
-I told him the job was taken.
-Dallas?

534
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,311
Yes, sir.

535
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,023
I told him that if he waited,
I'd find him another job,

536
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,568
but he didn't believe me.
He screamed and yelled at me.

537
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:29,653
In fact, I was so disturbed
with this man,

538
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,864
I tore up his paperwork
and threw it away.

539
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,075
Trust me, I understand
how difficult it can be,

540
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,078
but they all know the game.
They know it's a crap shoot.

541
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,331
Did he look something like this?

542
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,252
There are some similarities.

543
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,421
Do you still have your papers?

544
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,423
I threw it
in yesterday's garbage.

545
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,508
Where's yesterday's garbage?

546
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,510
Out back.

547
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,762
Great. I'll meet you out back.

548
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,598
How do I go?
I go around the side here?

549
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,058
-Yeah.
-Right.

550
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,103

[dog barking]

553
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,742
It's right there. Right there.

554
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,994
-This it?
-Yeah..

555
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,914
-Is that the guy?
-That's him.

556
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:24,166
You may have just
cracked this case.

557
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,170
Hey, you gonna help me
clean this up? Hey!

558
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,713
The union don't cover this.

559
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,840
[kicks trash]

560
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,386
Joe, I found the son of a bitch.

561
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,517
Speck.
Richard Speck is his name.

562
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,684
Speck?

563
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,144
[phone rings]

564
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,813
-How do you he's our guy?
-I got his union papers.

565
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,066
He matches
the description perfectly.

566
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,859
I spoke with Ms. Azano.
She’s positive.

567
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,613
Look Jack,
your three days are up.

568
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,199
I gotta pull some
detectives from the case.

569
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,909
-You're not serious?
-No, I'm dead serious.

570
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:02,746
I’m not about to lose my job
wasting time over one creep.

571
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,499
I need more help now I know
his name, Joe, not less.

572
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,878
Mayor Daly is on my ass
about these damn race riots.

573
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,964
You're obsessing over one guy.

574
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:15,008
I could have 10 000 people
dead in the streets.

575
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,552
I'm obsessing?

576
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,179
I'm doing my job.

577
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,722
But just let the dust settle.

578
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,226
This shit will rise to the top.

579
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:25,686
No, he won't.

580
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,646
He’ll be back in Texas
before we know it.

581
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:29,231
And you know
we're not gonna get any help

582
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,733
-from those lone rangers.
-I gotta pull Bruschy and Harper

583
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:32,818
from the case.

584
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:35,988
-Sorry.
-Fine, Joe.

585
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,198
I don't need any help.

586
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,160
Work with me, Jack, please/

[playful gangster music]

588
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,500
[Richard] Now, that's what
I call a Scotch.

589
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:53,630
Let's play. Let's see
if you do better than last time.

590
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,550
Gotta eat these peanuts first.

591
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,052
Peanuts make you strong.

592
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:01,513
Watch here. Okay.

593
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,516
Ready to blast off.

594
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,726
[loud clang]

595
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:06,977
Ah, do you see that?

596
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,062
Oh, yeah!

597
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:13,609
Dave! Three on a break!

598
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,653
Might as well sit down, paint
your toenails, pumpkin belly,

599
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,946
I'm gonna be here for a minute.

600
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,740
You talk to anyone
else like that

601
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,408
they take you outside
and give you a whipping.

602
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,328
No, they wouldn't.
I'd introduce them

603
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,537
to my girlfriend Mary.

604
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,874
Mary? Who the hell is Mary?

605
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,584
Oh, you ain't met Mary, huh?

606
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:31,752
Let's see what we got.

607
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,712
Any of you
met my girlfriend Mary?

608
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,132
-No, I don't think I have.
-You wanna meet Mary?

609
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,593
Doesn't sound like
I gotta choice.

610
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,887
You always have a choice.

611
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,431
Choice is…

612
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,059
… life or death.

613
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,394
Are you ready for this?

614
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,105
All right.

Sharp, ain't she?

Yes, she takes care
of all the business.

621
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,340
Kept me nice and safe in 'Nam.

622
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:22,386
Vietnam? I didn't know
you were in 'Nam, Rich.

623
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,347
Yeah, that's where I got
this tattoo right here.

-Where'd your buddy go?
-My who?

00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,337
The guy you were playing with.
Where did he go?

642
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,797
I think he went out
to relieve himself or something.

643
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,841
Come on. Hey.

was standing out front.

You know Fat Bill?
Standing out there,

sweating like a stuck pig.

653
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:33,809
So I stopped by.
Started chatting with him,

654
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,395
He goes on and on about his…

655
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:40,649
his wife will just do
whatever he tells her to do.

656
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,317
I mean…

657
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:46,989
… he went on about some things
I won't repeat in front of you.

658
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,158

"That's part of a woman's
duty right there.

You don't make love to me.

664

Because you won't let me!

You are too uptight!

666
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,927

This is exactly
what I'm talking about, Richard!

670

It's exactly… you make me feel
like I'm nobody,

671
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,483
Like I don't mean nothing.

672
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,527
You mean nothing.

make sure,

you do whatever your husband
wants you to do.

Richard, no.

He's gonna watch.

Go. Give me a peanut.

Tell Daddy
you don't treat me well.

715
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,337
You won't tell your daddy
nothing, because if you do,

716

I'll tear your arms off
and watch you bleed to death.

This ain't right, Richard.

719
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,930
It's not right for a husband
to treat his wife like this.

720
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,100
Guess I ain't your husband
no more, huh?

721
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,643
I'll be your daddy.

722
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,563
And you have to do
everything I say,

723
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,982
because you're
only 16 years old.

724

-Pick up the peanuts!
-Okay.

729

Those peanuts
are from Gorman, Texas.

730
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:44,208
Those are the best peanuts
in the United States of America.

731
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,667
You pick every single one
of them up,

732
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:48,045
you dust them off,
because I wanna eat them.

733
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,007
Yes. Just stop yelling.

734
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,091
Why?

735
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,220
It's not like there's anyone

-Oh, Richard!
-Just kidding.

739
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:17,783
There is a little baby one.
Go ahead, grab that one.

740
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:21,161
Well, okay.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

741
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,705
Why don't you bring
me my peanuts?

742
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,957
I don't trust you
with them no more.

743
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,500
Do you understand me?

744
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:28,752

What are you looking at?
Your wife?

748

No, I ain't looking for my wife.

749

What are you looking for?

750
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,248
I'm looking for
the three little pigs.

I'll ya. I don't care.

757
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:29,354
Tell me, if you want to.
I don't care if you want to--

I'm not a psychiatrist

Why are the cops after you?

783

[woman screams in agony]

886
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,511
[dark suspenseful music]

887
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:31,401
Why are you doing this?
We are just student nurses.

888
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:35,072
-Anet, let it go.
-No, I will not let it go!

889
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,323
-Stop it!
-No!

890
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,789
[suspenseful music continues]

891
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,420
Student nurses.

892
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:54,967
Guess I just uh…

893
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:57,928
let you all go.

894
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,514
Please let us go. Please.

895
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,936
I bet you,

896
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:10,107
I finish this next one,

897
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:13,819
before my cigarette
burns the table

898
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,240
[suspenseful ominous music]

899
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:24,997
Hey!

900
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,708
Don't touch!

901
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:31,211
[Anet yells]

902
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:40,429
Be right back.

903
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:43,640
[women cry hysterically]

904
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,103
[Anet moans]

905
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:55,360
[telephone dialing sounds]

906
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,907
Yes. This is the front desk
of the Raleigh hotel.

907
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,868
I want to report a man
threatening a woman with a gun.

908
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:05,412
Yes, m' am.

909
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:07,956
That's 648 North Dearborn.

910
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,000
Room 1001.

911
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:12,586
Thank you.

912
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,797
They'll be here shortly.

913
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,383
I suggest you get outta here
before the cops show up.

914
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,428
I think it's a good idea.

915
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,899
[feint arguing]

916
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,406
Mr. Anderson, are you there?

917
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,076
Hello. Chicago Police.

918
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:50,374
Just catching up on some sleep.
What's the problem again?

919
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:53,627
-Rough night?
-Every night is a rough night.

920
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,213
Mr. Anderson, you do know
it's illegal

921
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,881
to carry a firearm
in the state of Illinois

922
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,091
without the proper papers?

923
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,217
We simply need to get in there

924
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:01,844
to make sure
the license is up to date.

925
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,387
May we come in?

926
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,889
Ah, I mean
I don't have a license.

927
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:08,308
Y'all can come on in.
I ain't got no license for it.

928
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,810
I'm gonna tell you that.

929
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:12,688
[Richard sighs]

930
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:16,608
-Mind giving me the weapon?
-Oh. yeah. Right here.

931
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:18,068
Behind the mattress.

932
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:20,696
It's loaded.

933
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:25,826
You don't have the proper
paper work for that?

934
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,203
No. No, no, sir.

935
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:33,333
I got that just five days ago
at a pawn shop around here.

936
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,753
Like I said, I work down
at the boat docks late at night

937
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:38,881
I got mugged
two and a half weeks ago.

938
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,633
I just keep it around
for protection.

939
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,468
Why don't you go ahead
and provide us

940
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:44,595
with some identification?

941
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,806
Oh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

942
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:52,936
There you go.

943
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,275
It says here your name
is Richard F. Speck.

944
00:55:58,692 --> 00:55:59,693
Yeah.

945
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:01,862
You checked in
as a Mr. Anderson.

946
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,242
Got an explanation for that?

947
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:13,123
Like I said,
it ain't safe around here.

948
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,335
Okay. Give us a second.

949
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,379
What do you wanna do
with this guy?

950
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,465
[calm guitar music]

951
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:23,634
I'm just going to take the gun.

952
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:25,719
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

953
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:26,887
All right.

954
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,639
Listen here, Mr. Speck.

955
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:31,266
We understand your
safety concerns, and uh…

956
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,144
Unfortunately, your piece
needs to be properly registered,

957
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,395
so we're gonna have to
confiscate it,

958
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,481
but we're not gonna deal
with any formalities,

959
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:39,233
which is a citation,

960
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,401
You seem like a hardworking man.

961
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,569
We appreciate that.

962
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,404
We've just trying to get guns
of the streets.

963
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,783
Sure. It didn't cost
me that much.

964
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,618
I don't care. Y'all can keep it.

965
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:51,870
I'm glad I can help you out.

966
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:54,373
Who knows where that gun
really came from, I guess.

967
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,832
It's from a pawn shop.

968
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:58,335
You have a nice night now,
Mr. Speck.

969
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:00,504
Sure. You too.

970
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,800
[calm harmonica music]

971

[elevator bell]

972
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,892
Thanks for the call,
but the guy is harmless.

973
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,478
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not gonna arrest the guy?

974
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,231
No. We questioned him.
He's a hard working boat worker.

975
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,108
-What? But--\
-It's okay.

976
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:30,784
[traffic sounds]

977
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:36,540
There were a couple of cops
here tonight,

978
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,125
asking about one of your guests?

979
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,835
-Yes.
-What room is he in?

980
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,378
There's no point, officer.

981
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,755
He's long gone.

982
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:45,340
He left about an hour ago.

983
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,217
I already cleaned his room.

984
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,223
I don't suppose he said
where he was going?

985
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,517
I didn't even see him leave.

986
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,311
All right.

987
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:00,314
Thanks.

988
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:05,944
[traffic sounds]

989
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:15,245
[door slams shut]

990
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:17,998
[phone rings]

991
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,668
Sir, I've called at least
25 Speck families,

992
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,128
and none of them know a Richard.

993
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,381
All right, Dave,
but by my account,

994
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,968
there were 30 Speck families
in the greater Dallas area.

995
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:32,638
That would leave five.
You have five more to call.

996
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:33,889
Sir--
-You got five more to call.

997
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:34,973
Go call them.

998
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:36,767
Come on, get out of here!

999
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,980
-Dave.
-Yeah.

1000
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,360
[sighs]

1001
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:49,112
Did any of the people
you spoke with hesitate?

1002
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,614
They all seemed
a little bit bothered

1003
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:51,990
that we're calling them so late.

1004
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:53,659
That's not
what I'm talking about.

1005
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:55,577
Did any of them sound like
they knew something

1006
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:56,995
but didn't wanna say?

1007
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:01,124
-There might have been one.
-All right.

1008
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:02,876
Show me which one.

1009
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,634
Here. This one.

1010
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,178
All right.
Sit down and pay attention.

1011
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:20,477
[telephone dialing sound]

1012
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,066
Hello.
This is Detective Jack Whitaker,

Chicago Police Criminal Unit.

1014
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,863
Yes sir, I understand it's late.
I'm sorry.

1015
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,281
Yes.

1016
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,701
We have reason to believe
you might know Richard F. Speck.

1017
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,788
I know my assistant called you
and gave you the--

1018
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:44,501
-He hung up?
-Yeah.

1019
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,628
Yeah, he did.

1020
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,422
[phone clanks]

1021
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:49,798
[Whitaker chuckles]

[woman gasps]

1024
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:04,730
I'm just gonna
leave you here, okay?

1025
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:05,856
All right?

1026
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:08,734
[woman shrieks]

[woman screaming]

1028
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:15,699
All good.

1029
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:17,618
-No!
-It's all right.

1030
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:22,623
Come. Do not bite me.

1031
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:24,416
[screaming continues]

1032
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,377
Everything is fine.

1033
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:29,922
[screaming continues]

1034
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,641
No, no, no, don't!

1035
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,643
I'm going to leave you here.

1036
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:45,145
I'm going to leave you here.

1037
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,481
[dark ominous music]

1038
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:49,691
[woman screams and cries]

1039
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,276
[Richard] Shh.

1040
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,322
That's it.

1041
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,033
Just relax, all right?

1042
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,203
-It won't take long.
-Oh no…

1043
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:04,748
No!

1044
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,170
[screaming in terror]

1045
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:16,176

[footsteps]

1050
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,581
[coughing]

1051
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:47,791
[siren wails faintly]

1052
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:53,297
Why would you want to go on

1053
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,965
do something like that
to yourself?

1054
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,010
-It doesn't matter.
-Sure it sure matters.

1055
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,805
When a man decides the Earth
ain't right no more,

1056
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:02,931
it matters.

1057
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,643
I just seen a lot of dying.

1058
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:10,147
I figured if I died too,
it wouldn't be a big deal.

1059
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,025
Just didn't think
it would take this goddamn long.

1060
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:16,236
Nobody said
it was gonna be easy.

1061
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:18,614
Cutting is easy.

1062
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,866
It's this dying part
that's a son of a bitch.

1063
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:25,287
I'm tired.
It's what I need, sleep.

1064
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,915
A nice, long, permanent rest.

1065
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:29,958
Tired?

1066
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,877
I've been running for 40 years.

1067
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,213
You can't be a day over 25.

1068

[grunts]

1069
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:37,674
Hell, hobo.

1070
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:40,552
Age ain't got nothing
to do with it.

1071
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:44,932
[speaks incoherently]

1072
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,226
I've lived a lot of life.

1073
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:49,811
I had to keep on moving.

1074
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,523
You ought to just
keep it on moving.

1075
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:55,275
You know, you give us hobos
a bad name.

1076
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,153
You ain't no real drifter
like me, son.

1077
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,073
No, you are too mean.

1078
01:03:01,823 --> 01:03:04,076
We drifters, we ain't mean.

1079
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:08,664
But you, you got the
Devil inside you, son,

1080
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,332
the Devil himself.

1081
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:15,045
Oh, yeah, he's up in there
somewhere, doing a waltz.

1082
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,756
Don't think you're going
to Heaven, son,

1083
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,049
'cause you ain't.

1084
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:21,552
You're going straight back
to where you came.

1085
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:23,929
The hell zone.

1086
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:25,222
Go to hell, boy.

1087
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,892
No, on second thought,

1088
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,352
hell's too good for you.

1089
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:33,939
That's true.

1090
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:36,441
In fact,

1091
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,070
my mama squirted me
out of her vagina

1092
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,614
straight into
the seven gates itself.

1093
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,117
Burnt my little tooshie..

1094
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:47,786
[evil chuckle]

1095
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,039
Good night, hobo.

1096
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,208
Really?
That's really what you think?

1097
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,252
Yeah, of course.

1098
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:58,547
Ernie Banks never said
to just play two. It's a myth.

1099
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,756
No, he did.

1100
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,968
He did. The very first game
of the season in 1964.

1101
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:05,762
It is fiction.
It's not even true.

1102
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:08,098
You're saying that,
because you're a White Sox fan.

1103
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,017
What can you care
about the Cubs?

1104
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:15,564
It seems that the dead
have decided to rise.

1105
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:18,400
What, you afraid of the lights?

1106
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,195
Should've taken a leave.

1107
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:24,031
Streets are a lot better
without losers like him.

1108
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:31,330
All right, pal, here you go.
Someone should be along.

[sinister music continues]

1128
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:28,822
Nurse Boyd, those
crazy paramedics

1129
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:30,532
have my patient
turned around on this gurney.

1130
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:31,783
I need you to help me lift,
all right?

1131
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:34,369
We're gonna do it on three.
One, two, lift.

1132
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:38,040
Good, good. Swing his legs.
Swing his legs around.

1133
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,209
Here we go.

1134
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:41,627
I'm sorry, sir.

1135
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:43,420
Here we go.

1136
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,465
All right, let's swing
this gurney around, Nurse Boyd.

1137
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:49,968
I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry.
It's all right.

1138
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:51,845
All right.

1139
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:55,140
Well, sir.

1140
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:57,601
I'm Doctor Wilkins.

1141
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,562
Looks like
you've had a rough night.

1142
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,985
-Water.
-I have to finish checking you,

1143
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,196
and we can hydrate it.

1144
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,283
Is he coherent enough
to give me his information?

1145
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,410
He's coherent enough
to ask for water.

1146
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,538
Sure you can give him your name.

1147
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,998
Sir, can you state
your name, please?

1148
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:23,919
I thought I killed you.

1149
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:28,841
I killed you.

1150
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:33,136
-Nurse Boyd.
-Doctor.

1151
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,016
-What?
-Look at this.

1152
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:40,102
Would you look at this?

1153
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:41,895
I thought I recognized him.

1154
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,481
It says right here that he has
a tattoo on his right arm

1155
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:45,899
that says "Born to raise hell".

1156

Oh, my God.

1158
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:01,081
Did you offer
those poor girls water?

1159
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,541
Hm?

1160
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,043
You sick son of a bitch.

1161
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:08,589
I should let you bleed to death,
but I'm not gonna do that.

1162
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,757
It'd be too easy.

1163
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:13,552
Suicide.

1164
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:18,348
No. We're gonna make sure
you live for a long time,

1165
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:20,225
in jail.

1166

Nurse Boyd,

1167
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:25,522
I need you to get me
the arm and leg restraints.

1168
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:26,940
Yes, sir.

He said he just wants money.

1172
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,534
Relax.
It will all be over soon, okay?

1173
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:41,580
How do you know? He just walked
in here and tied us up.

1174
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:44,416
You don't do that
if you're gonna rob somebody.

1175

What if the fingerprint experts
can't identify him?

1235
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:59,254

systematically kill
all of my friends,

1237

I hid under a bed,
until I knew he was gone.

1239
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:12,184
And now I can't live
with myself,

1240
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:14,603
unless I know
I've done something,

1241
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:17,105
to put the devil back in hell
where he belongs.

1242
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:19,983
I understand, Sondra.

1243
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:22,486
We just want to make sure
you don't get hurt any further.

1244
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,072
It can't get any worse,
Mr. Whitaker.

1245
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:27,991
It can't get any worse.

1246
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:31,370
Nurse Boyd and I
are gonna be with you.

1247
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,665
Will he be conscious?

1248
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:38,377
Yes, he's aware
of his surroundings.

1249
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,254
Good.

1250
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:43,882
Because I want to look him
right in the eye,

1251
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:48,303
and let the devil know
there is a warrior on his midst.

1252
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,098
Where can I go change?

1253
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,493
[muffled talking]

1254
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,413
You're going to feel
a little pressure

1255
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:15,622
when I put this on.

1256
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:17,791
I feel the pressure.

1257
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,795
There ain't pressure.

1258
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:27,134
Oh, I got a pressure.

1259
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,598
I'm going to pee on myself.

1260
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:34,349
You don't want to see that.

1261
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,481
Take a deep breath in for me,
Mr. Speck.

1262
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:44,902
-Hell no.
-Take a deep breath, Mr. Speck.

1263
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:46,320
Oh.

1264
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,949
Go on, give me a bedpan,
will you?

1265
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,954
Bring me a goddamn bedpan, gook!

1266
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:59,208
-Go!
-Hey, hey, Sondra.

1267
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:02,002
-Sondra.
-[Sondra crying] It's him!

1268
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:03,879
It's him, he's in there!

1269
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:05,923
He killed all of them!

1270
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,717
[Dunning] It's okay, Sondra,
It's all right.

1271
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,094
[Dunning] It's okay.
We got him now.

1272
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,721
He's not gonna hurt
anybody no more.

1273
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:14,389
Breathe, breathe.

1274
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,227
You are a bitch!

1275
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:23,815
Well, Jack …

1276
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:25,859
You got your man.

1277
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:27,653
Yeah.

1278
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:30,364
I got a word
we're just gonna hand him over.

1279
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:35,827
We all use a good old-fashioned
Chicago hassle with him.

1280
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,329
[tense music]

1281
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:40,082
Nah, we're already
at the hospital.

1282
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,210
[tense music intensifies]

1283
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:04,648
[Richard chokes]

1284
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:07,985
Help! Nurse! Help me nurse!

1285
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:10,863
[choking continues]

1286
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:12,739
Fucker!

1287
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:15,909
[loud slaps]

1288
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:19,121
You're going to be fine,
Richard.

1289
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:20,747
[coughs]

1290
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:23,917
Fucker.

1291
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:28,172
[gags] Fucker!

1292
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:30,507
[gagging continues]

1293
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:37,222
Go on, fight me, you fucker!
Fight me fair, you fucker!

1294
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:40,058
You come back and fight me fair!

1295
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,144
You pig, motherfucker!

1296
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:44,980
If you want to fight,
come and fight!

1297
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:46,857
You fight me fair!

1298
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,902
Come back
and fight me fucking fair!

1299
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:53,405
You fight me fair!

1300
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:56,241
I'll take you!
Fight me fucking fair!

1301
01:16:56,825 --> 01:17:00,120
You fight me fair,
you motherfucker!

1302
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:02,873
Come back here, and fight me!

1303
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:05,792
Fight with me! Fight with me!

1304
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:07,503
[uncontrollable fit]

1305
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,130
[dark suspenseful music]

1306
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,053
[soft chatter]

1307
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:19,014
All rise!

1308
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:22,142
The Honorable Judge Petrone
is now entering the courtroom.

1309
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:27,231
Please be seated.

1310
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:36,990
Well, now that we have all
filled our stomachs,

1311
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,116
some more than others,

1312
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:40,953
we can continue with the order
of the business for the day.

1313
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:44,456
Mr. Stevens, I believe the cross
and rebuttal are complete?

1314
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:45,749
And the previous witness,

1315
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:47,501
and that it is your turn,

1316
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,753
call a new witness
if you'd like to do so.

1317
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:53,048
I'd like to call to the stand,
Miss Sondra Azano.

1318
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,716
You may, Mr. Stevens.

1319
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:56,844
She's waiting in the hallway.
I'll go get her.

1320
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:04,184
[traffic sounds]

1321
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:14,194
[tense harp music]

1322
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:20,826
[tense music intensifies]

1323
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,085
Miss Azano,

1324
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:32,129
please raise your right hand
and put your left hand

1325
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:33,255
on the Bible.

1326
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:36,425
You so solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

1327
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:38,594
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1328
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,346
-Yes, I do.
-You may be seated.

1329
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:43,640
The witness has been sworn in.

1330
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:46,852
Miss Azano,

1331
01:18:47,436 --> 01:18:50,022
please make sure that you answer
all questions clearly

1332
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,607
so that it can be heard.

1333
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:54,026
Please attempt to answer
only the questions

1334
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:55,402
you have been asked.

1335
01:18:55,485 --> 01:18:57,696
The court is not interested
in your opinion on the matter,

1336
01:18:58,197 --> 01:18:59,323
Only your answer,

1337
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,116
as it pertains
to what the prosecution

1338
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,076
or defence attorneys
have asked you.

1339
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,829
-Do you understand?
-Yes, I understand.

1340
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:09,416
Mr. Stevens, you can proceed
with your witness.

1341
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,876
Thank you, Your Honor.

1342
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:14,713
Miss Azano, could you spell
your name for the court?

1343
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,131
My name is spelled,

1344
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:23,430
S-O-N-D-R-A,

1345
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:27,893
A-Z-A-N-O.

1346
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:29,186
[tense music]

1347
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:30,437
Thank you, Miss. Azano.

1348
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:33,232
First of all,
on behalf of the people,

1349
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,484
I'd like to thank you
for participating here today.

1350
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:37,528
As you know, a man ison trail,

1351
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,071
and he's accused,

1352
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:40,364
of brutally murdering
eight women--

1353
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:41,532
Objection, Your Honor!

1354
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:43,825
Mr. Stevens cannot use the word
"brutal" in describing…

1355
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:46,286
Sustained. Mr. Stevens,

1356
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:50,290
there's no need to judiciously
add content to the record,

1357
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:52,209
thereby tainting the jury.

1358
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:56,588
Members of the jury,
we are depending on your ability

1359
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:00,801
to erase such comments
as Mr. Steven's from you mind.

1360
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,179
I have complete faith
and confidence

1361
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,014
in your ability
to analyze the facts.

1362
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,308
The use of the obvious word

1363
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:09,977
shall be stricken
from the record.

1364
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:14,606
Please make every effort
to strike it from you memory.

1365
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,944
Mr. Stevens, you may continue.

1366
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:21,780
Miss Azano,

1367
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:26,159
is the man,
who faces murder charges,

1368
01:20:26,243 --> 01:20:28,203
from the State of Illinois,

1369
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:29,872
in this courtroom today?

1370
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:34,418
Yes, he is in this courtroom.

1371
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:35,836
Thank you, Miss. Azano.

1372
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,671
Would you be so kind,

1373
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,341
as to please identify him,
by describing what he's wearing?

1374
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,053
Miss Azano?

1375
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,347
Miss Azano, there's no need to…

1376
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:49,975
-Miss. Azano. - -Judge?

1377
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:51,894
[defence attorney]
You're gonna allow this?

1378
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,562
[judge] Order in the court!

1379
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,940
This is the man
who killed my friends!

1380
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:58,192
Objection, Your Honor!
Objection!

1381
01:20:58,275 --> 01:20:59,902
Obviously Mr. Stevens
counts on the witness

1382
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,904
on gaining the most drama
out of the moment!

1383
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,572
[Mr. Stevens] Your Honor,
I did not council anybody.

1384
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:04,907
[gavel banging loudly]

1385
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:10,120
-[violent arguing]
-[gavel banging louder]

1386
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:18,921
[tower clock tolls]

1387
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:29,765
[faint chatter and whistling]

1388
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:39,024
Richard Speck, it's time
for your parole hearing.

1389
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,818
Come on, Speck. Let's go.

1390
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:43,278
Stand up
and bring your hands forward.

1391
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:46,365
You know, they say these uh…

1392
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:49,326
supposed to strike anywhere.

1393
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,869
But they don't work on paper.

1394
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:56,625
You can tell the parole board,

1395
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,670
any family members
that came to see me,

1396
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:05,634
they can kiss my ass.

1397
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,098
For the record, Mr. Speck,

1398
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,141
are you telling me that you're
turning down your right

1399
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:14,309
to a parole hearing?

1400
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,020
Hell, yeah.
That's what I'm telling you.

1401
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:18,272
I ain't gonna have nothing to do

1402
01:22:18,355 --> 01:22:20,774
with that trails did justice.
Shit.

1403
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:23,902
No, I'm happy right here,
in my home away from home,

1404
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,822
Unless you want to join me.

1405
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:30,075
Mr. Speck, the record
has been duly noted.

1406
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,160
I will tell the parole board
of your decision

1407
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:34,121
not to participate
in today's hearing.

1408
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,247
Go on and do that.

1409
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,958
Take them skippy boots
on down the hall.

1410
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:45,924
I might have to move to
Washington DC.

1411
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:47,926
They got a hell of a
crime rate there.

1412
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,721
That might be just the time
for a guy like me.

1413
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:52,973
[door alarm buzzes]

1414
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,267
[inmates chatting and whistling]

1415
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,609
[inmates mocking and whistling]

1416
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:22,920
[chattering continues]

1417
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:35,307
Sorry for the interruption,
Richard.

1418
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:37,392
I had to take that call.

1419
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,940
-Say, doc.
-Yes, Richard?

1420
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:46,193
Mind if I bum
one of them cigarettes?

1421
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,487
It's been a while.

1422
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,581
[match lights]

1423
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:01,875
Let there be light.

1424
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,419
And there was.

1425
01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:07,631
Are you afraid of me, doc?

1426
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:09,424
No, I'm not afraid of you,
Richard.

1427
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:10,509
Why should I be?

1428
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:12,886
You think
I killed all them girls?

1429
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,389
Yes, I think
you killed all those people.

1430
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:19,017
I also think you were in a state
of heightened anxiety,

1431
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,061
brought on by a myriad
of occurrences

1432
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,312
just before the event.

1433
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:25,274
You had a divorce.
You lost yet another job,

1434
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,901
you moved to another city,
etcetera, etcetera.

1435
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:30,487
You think if you went
through all that,

1436
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:31,738
you'd kill someone?

1437
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:33,574
No, I don't think so.

1438
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:35,951
So what makes you think I would?

1439
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,371
It's a good question, Richard.

1440
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,960
I think your brain chemistry

1441
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:47,337
has a tendency
to be more volatile

1442
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,714
than the common man.

1443
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:50,048
Mm.

1444
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:55,095
So you don't think
I'm a common man, then?

1445
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:58,390
I think you have your moments
of commonness.

1446
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:01,685
And at those moments,
you're pushed over the edge.

1447
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,443
Did you kill those nurses,
Richard?

1448
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:19,453
Must have.
Everybody think I did.

1449
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,165
It's a good beginning, Richard.

1450
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,667
Accepting responsibility
for your actions

1451
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:27,628
is the first step
on the road to recovery.

1452
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,546
[scoffs softly]

1453
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:34,760
No… no, no, no.

1454
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,347
You got it all wrong, doc.

1455
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:43,393
I ain't interested
in recovering.

1456
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:48,524
I am inhuman.

1457
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:52,194
I'm not a … a man …

1458
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:53,987
… or a woman.

1459
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:57,741
I just do what I please.

1460
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:05,040
Richard, do you realize
that you are going to be

1461
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,000
in this jail
for the rest of your life?

1462
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:10,254
[breathes loudly]

1463
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:14,174
Don't make no difference.

1464
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:19,513
[tense string music]

1465
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:57,885
Hell.

1466
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:02,139
If they know how much fun
I'm having in here,

1467
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:03,557
they'd let me loose.

1468
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:07,686
[inmate] Richard, why don't you
turn off the camera

1469
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:08,896
so we can have fun?

1470
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:10,647
We are going to have fun,

1471
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:12,858
but I want everyone out there
in La La land to see

1472
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:15,110
how I run this here cell block.

1473
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,238
I want everybody out there
to know that this,

1474
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:20,741
this cell block is mine,
you see.

1475
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:23,035
I got all the control
around here.

1476
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:25,621
I run the show
around here, okay?

1477
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:28,582
This is my bitch, right here,
Tyrone.

1478
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:30,209
-[chuckles]
-You know.

1479
01:27:30,751 --> 01:27:33,212
I tell you what.
I think our cameraman …

1480
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,130
I think Bobby back there,

1481
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:38,759
I think Bobby back there,
needs a little line of cocaine.

1482
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:41,803
What do you say, Bobby?
Do you want some cocaine?

1483
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:45,224
Yeah, you wanna take that?
Go ahead.

1484
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,644
-[Bobby sniffs cocaine]
-[chuckles menacingly]

1485
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:54,608
That's how we do things
up here, boy,

1486
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:56,860
That's how we do things up here.

1487
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,738
Better mind your manners,
gonna get a spanking.

1488
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:02,449
-Ain't that right, Tyrone?
-Yes.

1489
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,535
I'm in the mood
for a little spanking.

1490
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:07,079
Damn straight. I heard that.

1491
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:08,789
I heard that.

1492
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:11,667
People don't think
chocolate and vanilla

1493
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,210
mix up in prison.

1494
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:16,463
Hell, boy. We got the best
chocolate milk you ever had.

1495
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,340
[chuckles]

1496
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:20,342
I melt in your mouth,
not in your hands.

1497
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,302
[chuckles]

1498
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:26,181
Now, that's comedy.

1499
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,475
That's comedy, boy.

1500
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:30,894
This kid. Shit.

1501
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:38,318
Richie. Why don't you turn off
the camera for some fun?

1502
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:41,655
No, I want everybody
out there to see

1503
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:43,365
how I run this here cell block.

1504
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:44,616
I want everyone to see

1505
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,619
that Richard F. Speck
has all the control.

1506
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,255
