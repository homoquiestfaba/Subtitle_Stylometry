1
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,864
Game three of the 1985 series
is just underway...

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,697
Kansas City trailing by one.

3
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,635
The first pitch by Rosenthal...

4
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,502
is hit on the ground
towards second base!

5
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,707
Wexler's got it!
Fires to first...

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,438
and we've quickly got one out.

7
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,039
In 1985, his average
was two-fifty for the season.

8
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,395
Mom?

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,565
Hi, darling.

10
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,771
This is for your tea party.

11
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:54,973
Thank you.

12
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,864
Go on and play now, girls.
Mama's got work to do.

13
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,401
Ivy, go take your sister
upstairs.

14
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,865
Come on, Violet.

15
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,437
Let's go get Joy.

16
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,918
Would you like any tea,
Madeline?

17
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,422
Careful, it's hot, very hot.

18
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,755
There you go.

19
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,961
And a cookie.

20
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,192
-Can you play, Joy?
-Mm-hmm. Come on.

21
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,037
Oh, goodie, tea.

22
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,247
You pour some more tea, Violet.

23
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,837
Your daddy's home, Joy.

24
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,299
There's gonna be fireworks.

25
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,211
Catherine?

26
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,227
Honey?

27
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,307
-Who the fuck are you?
-Don't!

28
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,470
I don't want
to fight you, all right?

29
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,005
Just get the hell out!

30
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,018
Becca?

31
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,610
Go.

32
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,350
Baby, let me get you
some ice for that.

33
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,558
Ivan, wait!

34
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,866
You don't understand!

35
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,565
Ivan, please,
would you listen to me?

36
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,972
How many others, Rebecca?

37
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,875
Grocery boy? The mailman?
How many?

38
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,936
And in my house!

39
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,810
You think this is easy,
sneaking around your wife...

40
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,977
and pretending
there's nothing between us?

41
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,588
You're home.

42
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,825
How long...

43
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,265
have you been sleeping
with my husband right here...

44
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,435
in my own house?

45
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,936
Ivan, tell her to get out.

46
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,213
Ivan, tell her.

47
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,417
Where are you going?

48
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,115
Whore.

49
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,419
I am not a whore.

50
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,323
Then what are you?

51
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,350
He told me what you're like
between the sheets.

52
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,329
Is it any wonder
he needs a woman?

53
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,853
It's happening again.

54
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,928
Oh, no.

55
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,903
I'm giving you twenty minutes
to get out of this house.

56
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,106
And if you're not gone...

57
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,575
I will call the police
and have you removed.

58
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,976
Violet, take Madeline.

59
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,548
I'll try to write to you.

60
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,332
Thanks.

61
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,218
May I help you?

62
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,954
Is this still
the Greers' residence?

63
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,719
Yes, it is.

64
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,162
I'm here to see Joy.

65
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,964
May I tell her who's calling?

66
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,678
Violet?

67
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,156
I can't believe it's you.

68
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,927
Thank you, Mrs. B.

69
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,599
It's hard to believe
it's been eleven years.

70
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,273
Daddy refuses to believe
I'm not ten years old anymore.

71
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,087
I just moved back here
from Arizona.

72
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,285
I thought maybe I'd get
a waitressing job part-time...

73
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,765
and maybe start some summer
classes at the junior college.

74
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,231
That's wonderful.

75
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,031
It makes me long
to be twenty again.

76
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,428
Being twenty is hard.

77
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,135
Not as hard as being eight...

78
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,772
but then, life wasn't meant
to be easy, was it?

79
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,817
Have you found an apartment?

80
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,879
Not yet, but I put my name up
on the board at school.

81
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,480
Why not stay here?

82
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,959
I--I couldn't.

83
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,895
But we have so much room.
It's not a problem.

84
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,963
Joy, can I have a word with you
in the kitchen, please?

85
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,233
Come here, you crap.

86
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,948
Joy, having Violet stay here
is out of the question.

87
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,042
-Why?
-Well, for many reasons.

88
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,248
It's been a long time.
Things have changed.

89
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,018
Dad, Violet was my best friend.

90
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,424
When she and lvy were here,
it was like having sisters.

91
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,829
Seeing her today
was like nothing had changed.

92
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,423
I know that, sweetheart,
but where is she going to sleep?

93
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,794
We have an extra bedroom.

94
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,668
That was
your mother's room, Joy.

95
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,166
I know that.

96
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,939
What do you think, Mrs. B?

97
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,979
Maybe the girl
could use a helping hand...

98
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,784
if you know what I mean.

99
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,471
I promised you
we'd be home again.

100
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,065
Welcome home, Madeline.

101
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,758
Seventy-six, seventy-seven...

102
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,729
seventy-eight, seventy-nine...

103
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,391
eighty, eighty-one...

104
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,400
eighty-two, eighty-three...

105
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,766
eighty-four, eighty-five...

106
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,464
eighty-six, eighty-seven...

107
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,996
eighty-eight, eighty-nine...

108
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,508
ninety, ninety-one...

109
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,976
ninety-two, ninety-three...

110
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,381
ninety-four, ninety-five...

111
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,015
Just a minute.

112
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,354
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, one hundred.

113
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,358
Oh, my gosh.

114
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,866
I'm supposed to be in training.

115
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,942
You must be good.

116
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,649
I'm proud of you.

117
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,460
Who is this?

118
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,260
Michael.

119
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,733
-We're going to get married.
-Married?

120
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,762
In the fall.

121
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,239
Daddy wants us to wait...

122
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,300
but Michael wants me to apply
for a transfer to Yale...

123
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,573
so we can be together next year.

124
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,775
Yale? Is that far away?

125
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,248
Connecticut, silly.

126
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,749
Michael will be home from school
next week.

127
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,277
I can't wait for you
to meet him.

128
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,450
He's very good-looking.

129
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,161
Remember when we were little...

130
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,527
and we used to dress up
like we were brides?

131
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,826
You made a veil
out of a petticoat.

132
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,066
And you made one out of
a whole roll of toilet paper.

133
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,309
What about your dad?

134
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,285
What's he going to do
when you get married?

135
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,082
I don't know.

136
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,953
Sometimes I'm afraid
he'll end up alone.

137
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,189
He doesn't date?

138
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,164
There's a woman named Gwen
he talks about.

139
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,532
Mrs. B and I keep hoping he'll
find the time to ask her out.

140
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,437
It wouldn't bother you
if he got serious or anything?

141
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,000
Why should it?
He's been alone a long time.

142
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,102
He deserves to be
with someone nice.

143
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,245
But I don't think
he'll ever get over my mother.

144
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,315
You've probably noticed
how her room is still the same.

145
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,824
After all these years...

146
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,019
Dad still can't bring himself
to change it.

147
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,460
You must really miss her, too.

148
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,656
I do.

149
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,299
A lot.
I really need her sometimes.

150
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,892
Connecticut?

151
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,143
No, thank you, Mrs. B.

152
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,712
How's Yale this year, Michael?

153
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,115
Good, sir.

154
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,419
I'm developing
some important relationships.

155
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,786
Good.

156
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,757
Michael's fourth in his class
this year.

157
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,987
That's very impressive
for freshman year.

158
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,255
It's very impressive
for any year.

159
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,389
We're looking forward to you
at the bank this summer.

160
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,558
See you on Monday?

161
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,864
Absolutely.
I'm looking forward to it.

162
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,565
Good. You've got the house
to yourselves tonight...

163
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,800
-because I've--
-Got a meeting.

164
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,569
That's right.

165
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,236
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night.

166
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,608
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Michael.

167
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,810
It's party time.

168
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,785
Michael, you should've been
at the club for drinks.

169
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,517
There's some new blood.

170
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,185
All in good time, my brother.
All in good time.

171
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,887
Scott, what's up?

172
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,287
How's Princeton?

173
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,456
A bitch.

174
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,159
The classes or the girls?

175
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,862
To uncompromising women.

176
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,994
Hear, hear.

177
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,164
So, I hear you're tearing up
the courts.

178
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,572
Got my last Division One
Tournament on Friday.

179
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,372
-Then hello lvy League.
-lf I win.

180
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,409
No ifs. You're in your prime.
Jaimie, am I right?

181
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,043
We have lived on that court
for the past two months.

182
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,019
If she could eat and sleep
out there...

183
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,885
that's where we'd be right now.

184
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,617
You're Violet, right?

185
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,484
What are you doing this summer?

186
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,996
She's taking classes
at the junior college.

187
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,896
Ooh!
The junior college.

188
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,526
My maid took
English classes there.

189
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,128
Is it a tough school
to get into?

190
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:50,005
Oh, no. They'll accept
just about anybody...

191
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,840
as long as your welfare check
doesn't bounce.

192
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,247
No, thanks.

193
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,586
No. I have to go to work.

194
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,254
Right now?

195
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,557
Yeah.

196
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,456
I drew the late shift tonight.

197
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,467
You know,
new kid on the block and all.

198
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,462
Well...

199
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,798
See ya.

200
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,175
Oh, baby!

201
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,343
You guys leave her alone.
She's had it pretty tough.

202
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,979
What was she doing here
in the first place?

203
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,251
Her mother was their maid.

204
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,520
She was my best friend.

205
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,876
Stop it!

206
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,642
Damn it, Joy,
what's the matter now?

207
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,380
I told you.
I have a lot on my mind.

208
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,411
I have an early practice
tomorrow.

209
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,150
I'm just not in the mood.

210
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,287
If your mother
was this uptight...

211
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,126
no wonder your dad
fooled around.

212
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,457
How dare you say that to me.

213
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,326
I confided in you about that.

214
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,736
I can't believe
you would throw it in my face.

215
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,605
Look, I'm sorry.

216
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,615
How about I come by after
your practice tomorrow, OK?

217
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,212
Oh, my God!

218
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,217
You think it was Daddy?

219
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,017
You scared me half to death.

220
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,279
That's some...

221
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,906
some outfit there.

222
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,416
Where did you say
you worked again?

223
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,149
Denny's.

224
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,847
In Hollywood.

225
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,220
It's under new management.

226
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,026
I--I guess I've never eaten
there before.

227
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,726
Would you like to?

228
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,431
You should see
the look on your face.

229
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,702
Look, it's kinda late.
I gotta go.

230
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,175
Come on. It's a joke.

231
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,418
Look, l...

232
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,683
I think we got off
to a bad start.

233
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,739
I see we have a little
unfinished business.

234
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,325
Stock market's up...

235
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,924
and I see
we're a major stockholder.

236
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,566
Just a minute!

237
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,674
Come in.

238
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,523
I wanted to apologize
for my friends tonight.

239
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,459
They can be pretty
annoying sometimes.

240
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,894
Don't worry about it.
It didn't bother me.

241
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,093
Well, it bothered me.
I'm sorry.

242
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,101
Can I talk to you
about something?

243
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,362
Sure.

244
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,574
You never get...
urges or anything?

245
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,104
I do. A lot.

246
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,647
But when it comes down to it,
I just...

247
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,210
get tense.

248
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,689
I don't even want him inside me.

249
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,256
I've never had an orgasm
with him.

250
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,425
I've never even had an orgasm.

251
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,799
I think my mother
was the same way.

252
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,600
I mean, she did sleep
in this room most of the time.

253
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,804
What if I'm just like her?

254
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,402
The first time
I was with a guy...

255
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,445
I was thirteen.

256
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,112
I was known
as the school slut...

257
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,815
by the time I was fourteen.

258
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,823
But then I got smart.

259
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,051
I stopped going to school.

260
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,606
Excuse me.
Where did you get that?

261
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,576
This? Why?

262
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,271
It doesn't belong to you.

263
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,038
Now, how would you know that?

264
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,016
Because it belonged
to Mrs. Greer!

265
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:24,181
She's not using it, is she?

266
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,896
More coffee, Mr. Greer?

267
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,629
No. No, thank you, Mrs. B.

268
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,842
"Dearest Joy...

269
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,941
"I've kicked. I'm clean.

270
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:03,010
"I'm ready to make amends for
all the hurt I've laid on you.

271
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,248
"Love, Michael."

272
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,053
So...

273
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,754
old Michael had
a little drug problem, did he?

274
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,910
That honking for you?

275
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,849
Yeah, it's Jaimie. We've got
a practice doubles match.

276
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,112
When will you be back?

277
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,983
Probably late.

278
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,817
I was hoping we could spend
the day together.

279
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,449
I've gotta practice.
Last Division One Tournament...

280
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,823
is the day after tomorrow.
I gotta win.

281
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,226
You don't gotta win, Joy.

282
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,254
Yes, I do.

283
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,426
You know,
you're really hard on yourself.

284
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,266
You don't have to be perfect
all the time.

285
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,501
If I were, I wouldn't work
twice as hard as everyone else.

286
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,438
Jaimie and I will be
practicing here this afternoon.

287
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,879
You should come watch.

288
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,050
Oh, goody.

289
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,096
What are you doing?

290
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,493
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed...

291
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,732
I am the housekeeper here.
This is what I do.

292
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,139
I would appreciate it if,
from now on...

293
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,837
you'd let me know when
you're going to come in my room.

294
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,257
Larry's been a naughty boy.

295
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,238
My time is your time.

296
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,800
Where do you want to meet?

297
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:09,974
What are you in the mood for?

298
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,482
That'll cost extra, you know.

299
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,756
Really?
They didn't tell me that.

300
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,885
I can't believe that happened.

301
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,954
-That's crazy.
-I need to play a real set.

302
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,157
In a minute, OK?

303
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,531
You're supposed to be
my training partner.

304
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,399
All right, I'm coming.

305
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,961
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

306
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,905
Anything. Just hurry up.

307
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,839
Listen, I have to go, OK?

308
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,936
No, really. I have to go.

309
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,639
You guys look like you could use
something cold to drink.

310
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,370
Excellent!

311
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,844
Throw it in the blender.
Add a little ice...

312
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,814
and you got yourselves
something tropical.

313
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,547
A little extra kick never hurt.

314
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,316
I suppose not.

315
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,468
What did you put
in those drinks?

316
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,535
The teeniest shot of rum.

317
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,783
I swear--the teeniest!

318
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,843
Play to win, ladies.

319
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,744
I don't believe it.

320
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,977
Come on, Joy.
Joy, sit up.

321
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,150
Hey, there.

322
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,453
What's goin' on?

323
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,930
They're both drunk.

324
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,123
That's weird.

325
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,192
When's Mr. Greer get home?

326
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,863
Probably any minute.
Why?

327
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,702
Are you kidding?
He's a total fascist.

328
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,606
If he sees Joy like this,
he'll freak.

329
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,201
Come on.
Help me get her upstairs.

330
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,642
We'll just tell him
she's got a headache.

331
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,581
Yeah.
That won't be a lie.

332
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,947
We'll have to come back for her.

333
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,148
Michael, I'm gonna be sick.

334
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,088
Oh, God, just hang on, OK?

335
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,255
Wait.
Hold it a second.

336
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,160
Are you crazy?

337
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,067
Oh, man.

338
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,472
Mr. Greer, how goes it?

339
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,640
Where's Joy?

340
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,217
She went upstairs
with a headache.

341
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,345
She was on the court all day,
and I guess she overdid it.

342
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,481
-I'd better look in on her.
-No. I'll do it.

343
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,752
All right, Michael.
Thank you.

344
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,824
Man.

345
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,801
Get the lights.

346
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,243
That's good.

347
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,629
I just don't understand
what Joy was thinking.

348
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,600
She knows she needs every second
of practice she can get.

349
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,931
This could screw up everything.

350
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,437
-Maybe that's what she wants.
-What?

351
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,101
Never mind.
It's not my place.

352
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,609
Did she say something to you?

353
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,969
Well, the way she talks...

354
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,379
it sounds like she thinks things
are moving a little too fast.

355
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,816
Getting married,
moving to Connecticut--

356
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,376
But we already decided.

357
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,686
She thinks maybe you're pushing
a little too hard.

358
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,628
She thinks maybe you guys should
try dating other people.

359
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,688
What are you talking about?

360
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,893
Are you saying she's been
seeing other people...

361
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,902
while I've been away
or something?

362
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,633
Shit!

363
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,162
Who is it?

364
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,038
I can't believe it.

365
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,600
I can't believe
she's cheated on me...

366
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,475
after I've been faithful
this whole time.

367
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,105
Except for last night.

368
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,745
Listen...

369
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,045
you just stay away from me,
all right?

370
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,839
You didn't have any dinner.

371
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,079
Thank you so much, Violet.
That's so sweet.

372
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,780
What is this stuff?

373
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,722
It's nothing--spreadsheets.

374
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,454
No wonder your eyes hurt.

375
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,922
Is all this stuff
really part of your job?

376
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,023
I'm afraid so, Violet.
Keeps me out of trouble, though.

377
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,557
Maybe a little trouble
isn't such a bad thing.

378
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,899
Excuse me?

379
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,896
It just seems to me
like you're avoiding something.

380
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,476
Joy told me that you've...

381
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,878
never really gotten
over Catherine's death.

382
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,577
You know...

383
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,143
there's nothing wrong
with having feelings, Ivan.

384
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,781
I can call you Ivan?

385
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,789
If you feel something...

386
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,919
go with it. You know?

387
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,956
I mean...

388
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,833
don't be afraid
to follow where it leads.

389
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,930
Otherwise...

390
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,331
what would be the point
of living?

391
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,672
Spreadsheets?

392
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,810
Well...

393
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,577
don't work too hard.

394
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,280
Good night.

395
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,837
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,116
Where are you going?

397
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,023
Wait, don't leave yet.

398
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,993
Joy'll be right back.

399
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,120
Oh, my God!

400
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,613
Do you always swim in the nude?

401
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,017
Did you enjoy that?

402
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,412
Not as much as you did, I bet.

403
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,322
Actually, l...

404
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,494
didn't even know
you were still here.

405
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,592
I'm not leaving until l
straighten things out with Joy.

406
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,326
Have you decided
what you're going to say to her?

407
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,895
Not exactly.

408
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,967
Maybe this will help.

409
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,311
I don't do that anymore.
I made a promise to Joy.

410
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,216
Aren't you a good boy?

411
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,357
I just thought it might help.

412
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,360
I'll bet you've promised
yourself all sorts of things...

413
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,955
where Joy is concerned...

414
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,626
but promises were meant
to be broken, Michael.

415
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,497
Look, this did not happen.

416
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,841
Play to win, Michael.

417
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,773
You know...

418
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,503
my old mother used to say...

419
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:10,206
that house guests and fish...

420
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,307
start to smell
after about three days.

421
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,051
And what is that
supposed to mean?

422
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,747
Oh, nothing.

423
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,315
You know,
I was wondering...the "B."

424
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,053
Short for "bitch"?

425
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,936
I feel like I've been
hit by a truck.

426
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,131
Drink this.

427
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,841
Does my dad know?

428
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,815
Actually, he thinks you went
to bed early with a headache.

429
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,818
I can't believe Jaimie...

430
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,513
getting me drunk
and then splitting like that.

431
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,886
I'm so angry at her.

432
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,187
She seemed
a little upset herself.

433
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,749
I'd like to strangle her.

434
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,353
I have exactly twenty-one hours
until the tournament...

435
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,261
and I can't even see straight.

436
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,664
Well, I'll keep
the coffee coming.

437
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,134
Michael left his jacket
in my den, and this fell out.

438
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,902
I can't allow this
in my business...

439
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,739
and I will not allow it
in my family.

440
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,938
Do you understand me, Joy?

441
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,482
It's gotta be a mistake.

442
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,485
The only mistake
is me allowing you to date him.

443
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,545
Shouldn't we give him
a chance to explain himself?

444
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,385
I know you'll do
the right thing.

445
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,868
He promised me never again.
He lied to me.

446
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,403
Nothing's more important
than the truth, Joy.

447
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,607
But I guess you can't
expect that from a druggie.

448
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,311
He's not a druggie.
He's just...

449
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,650
He's under
a lot of pressure, and...

450
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,315
What am I gonna do?

451
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,322
Listen...

452
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,392
Everything's gonna be OK.

453
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,560
Everything's gonna be just fine.

454
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,037
I promise.

455
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,076
Jaimie doesn't want
to see me anymore.

456
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,378
And she doesn't want
to be partners, either.

457
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,842
I'm not surprised.

458
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,113
I knew from the minute
I met her...

459
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,280
she was only into you
for what she could get.

460
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,051
You think so?

461
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,026
She's nothing but
a social climber.

462
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,657
It's Michael.

463
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,997
I'll go down and talk to him.

464
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,627
Thanks.

465
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,437
I want to talk to her about it.

466
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,709
Michael, you're really starting
to hurt my feelings.

467
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,908
What are you talking about?

468
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,909
You can't keep pretending
we're not sleeping together.

469
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,617
I mean, I thought we had
something special going.

470
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,587
You told her about last night,
didn't you?

471
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,530
-You bitch.
-I didn't tell her anything.

472
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,568
I didn't have to.
You did this all by yourself.

473
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,756
His pupils were totally dilated.

474
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,553
He wasn't making any sense.

475
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,626
He thinks the reason you won't
talk to him is because of me.

476
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,527
It's just like him
to blame everyone but himself.

477
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,801
Don't help him, Joy.

478
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,999
Fuck him.

479
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,101
All right.

480
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,770
I have to stop
making excuses for him.

481
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,905
I have to be tough.

482
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,973
He has to take responsibility.

483
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,922
Michael just doesn't give up,
does he?

484
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,861
They're not from Michael.

485
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,268
They're for Gwen,
your dad's date for tonight.

486
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,966
He finally asked her out?

487
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,439
Yes, he did.

488
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,576
How do I look, Mrs. B?

489
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,520
Mr. Greer,
in my humble opinion...

490
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,988
you are beyond handsome.

491
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,490
Thank you, Mrs. B.

492
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,059
Could you get the flowers
for me?

493
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,827
Hi, honey.

494
00:53:58,868 --> 00:53:59,960
Hey, Dad.

495
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,803
Wow. Very handsome.

496
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,400
Thanks.
Where are you off to?

497
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,603
Meeting my coach to practice...

498
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,169
one last time
before the big tournament.

499
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,704
Honey, with everything
happening around us...

500
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,649
I realize I haven't been
that supportive of you...

501
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,152
but I want you to know
there's no doubt in my mind...

502
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,449
you're going to win
that tournament.

503
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,017
Thanks, Dad. I just hope
I don't let you down.

504
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,685
You're a Greer. We deliver.

505
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,719
-Here you go!
-Mrs. B, thank you.

506
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,162
All right.

507
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,063
You got some lint
right on your shoulder.

508
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,863
Let me get my brush.

509
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:35,701
That's gonna have to stay.
I've got to get out of here.

510
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,172
Come on, Joy, Let's go.

511
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,148
-Hello?
-Hi, this is Gwen Randall.

512
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,653
-Is this Ivan's daughter?
-Yes, it is.

513
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,747
Listen, Joy.
Has your dad left yet?

514
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,983
Shoot.
Can you get a message to him?

515
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,494
Absolutely.

516
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,587
Could you have him meet me
outside the courthouse...

517
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,599
and not at my office?
In front of the kiosk.

518
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,430
-You've got it.
-Thanks, Joy.

519
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,992
No problem. Thanks.

520
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,025
Hello,
this is the Greer residence.

521
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,623
Will you please leave a message
after the tone?

522
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,599
Ivan, what happened?

523
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,195
I stood outside the courthouse
for nearly an hour.

524
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,070
To say I'm pissed off
would be an understatement.

525
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,405
In fact, do me a favor...

526
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,876
and lose my number.

527
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:10,993
I love champagne.

528
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,877
Violet, you're not legal.

529
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,277
I won't tell if you won't.

530
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,716
Why are you so dressed up?

531
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:29,912
Party.

532
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,616
You're home early.

533
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,256
She didn't like them?

534
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,228
Actually, she stood me up.

535
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:43,096
-I'm sorry.
-I'll live.

536
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,364
You know, in all my life...

537
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,268
I don't think
I've ever gotten flowers.

538
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,280
I just wanted to feel pretty
tonight.

539
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,254
Maybe dance a little.

540
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,324
Laugh.

541
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,890
Feel good.

542
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,394
I know that must seem silly.
I know.

543
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,042
Dance with me?

544
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,820
I'm not much of a dancer,
Violet.

545
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:39,844
It's all right.

546
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:17,991
We can't do this, Violet.

547
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,127
I want you to feel good, too.

548
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,068
Shouldn't you be wearing
your glasses, Mr. Greer?

549
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,542
I cannot do this with you,
Violet.

550
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,020
Don't make me go.

551
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,586
Don't do this to me.

552
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,681
I will win. I will win.

553
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,876
Please let me win.

554
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,628
Joy, you're gonna have
to speak to me sooner or later.

555
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,326
Michael,
I want you to leave me alone.

556
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,698
That's not fair.

557
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,032
Fair?

558
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,304
God, you are driving me crazy...

559
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,034
and I've got the tournament
this morning.

560
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,939
I know.
I want to be there for you.

561
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,175
I love you, Joy.

562
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,471
I don't know, Michael.

563
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,058
All right, we'll talk.

564
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,326
After the tournament,
I'll meet you...

565
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,829
at the coffee-house on campus.

566
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,493
I gotta go.

567
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,528
Good luck.

568
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:02,731
Thanks.

569
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,508
Greer residence.

570
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,540
Hello, Gwen!

571
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,452
No. His daughter's in a tennis
tournament this morning...

572
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,819
but I'm sure he'll be
in his office later on.

573
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,256
Can I take a message?

574
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,321
You did?
How many messages did you leave?

575
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:29,724
I see.

576
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,064
Well, I can guarantee you...

577
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,662
that he never received
any of your messages...

578
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,372
but I'm pretty sure who did.

579
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,340
Going somewhere?

580
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,612
I don't know what you think
you're up to, little girl...

581
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,119
but I'm gonna put a stop to it
right now.

582
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,053
I don't think so.

583
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,125
You bitch.

584
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,603
I got a call from Greer telling
me not to report to my job...

585
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,971
because they found
another intern.

586
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,306
You set me up, you got me high,
and you seduced me.

587
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,836
If that's what
you need to believe...

588
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,676
so you can live with yourself...

589
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,147
it's OK with me.

590
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,173
You're setting them up
just like you set me up.

591
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,015
They're my family.

592
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,283
I would never do anything
to hurt them.

593
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,086
They're not your family!
Your family's dead.

594
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,194
Yeah. That's right.
I did a little checking.

595
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,356
That junior college
never even heard of you.

596
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,662
Then I find out your sister lvy
threw herself out of a window.

597
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,692
-Shut up.
-Let's not forget your mother.

598
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:41,725
I said shut up!

599
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,898
I bet you don't even work
at Denny's, do you?

600
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,777
Now what?

601
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,479
I'm gonna tell Joy
who she's really living with.

602
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,246
You're gonna tell her
you're fucking me?

603
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,310
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

604
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,323
That'll be
an interesting approach for you.

605
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,688
Think she'll buy it?

606
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,722
I don't think it's gonna be
too hard to convince her.

607
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,491
Look, I'm going to meet her
at two o'clock.

608
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,056
That'll give you enough time
to get out.

609
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,068
Well, she won't be there.

610
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,467
She never planned to meet you.

611
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,597
-You're such a liar.
-Really?

612
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,733
Then why did she tell
your good buddy Scott...

613
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,437
to pick her up at the house
at one thirty?

614
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:29,844
Fuck you.

615
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,568
You're gonna be so sorry.

616
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,939
Curiosity killed the cat.

617
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,606
Right now, Joy's sitting
somewhere waiting for you.

618
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,307
Guess you let her down again,
Michael.

619
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,490
Do you know what kind of people
like pain?

620
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,827
Let's see, there's doctors...

621
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:01,996
and lawyers...

622
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,505
I even have a judge
for a client.

623
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,438
But you know, it's not the pain
that gets them off.

624
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,945
It's the feeling of someone else
being in control.

625
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,685
I'm in control now, Michael.

626
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,651
You know,
this whole thing with Joy...

627
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,721
was really just about
Daddy's bank...

628
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,925
wasn't it?

629
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:37,372
I got a really big chuckle
out of your pathetic rambling.

630
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,069
Kiss-kiss.

631
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,418
You really should have
kept your promise to Joy.

632
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,557
Stayed away from the drugs.

633
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,487
This is the shit
that killed you.

634
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,995
I guarantee...

635
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,771
you've never felt
anything like this before.

636
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,584
Bye-bye, Michael.

637
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,146
You all right?

638
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:01,384
I played like I never held
a racquet before in my life.

639
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,085
I just...I couldn't
concentrate, you know?

640
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,088
It's Michael's fault.

641
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,491
He totally distracted you.

642
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,557
He didn't even show up.

643
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,569
He didn't call again, did he?

644
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,195
Come by?

645
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:17,728
I've been here all day.

646
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,170
I wanted to teach Michael
a lesson...

647
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,769
not make him go away.

648
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,109
Made a mess of everything.

649
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,747
You don't see it.
It's not you.

650
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,584
It's them.

651
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,492
But I want them to love me.

652
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,395
You think they care?
Well, they never will.

653
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,260
They'll just use you
and throw you away.

654
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,703
It's the same
for both of us, Joy.

655
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,908
We're the same in so many ways.

656
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,971
Sometimes...

657
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,976
I just wish the rest
of the world would fade away.

658
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,183
Where did you get those?

659
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,051
Those are my mother's.

660
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,282
I just came across them.

661
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,488
I didn't think you'd mind
if I borrowed them.

662
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,862
They were in her jewelry box
in the back of her closet.

663
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,867
Please put them back.

664
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,199
Fine.

665
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:23,501
It's not that big of a deal.

666
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,769
Yes, it is, Violet.

667
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,242
I think things are getting
a little too tense around here.

668
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,404
What are you trying to say?

669
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,846
I think maybe...

670
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,213
it would be a good idea...

671
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,048
if you started thinking about
another place to live.

672
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,676
Don't worry, baby.

673
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,114
I'll fix it.

674
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:16,984
I promise.

675
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,113
Oh, my God, he was here.

676
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,220
She lied to me.

677
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,408
I...

678
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,570
I brought these for Joy.

679
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:12,409
I know she's feeling upset
about...

680
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,574
Losing the tournament.

681
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,049
Well, I'm sure she'll love them.

682
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,689
I talked to Gwen today.

683
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,161
You pretended you were Joy,
didn't you?

684
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,856
You didn't give me her messages.

685
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,213
I didn't give you
the messages...

686
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,618
because I was jealous.

687
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,688
Joy was wrong.

688
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:58,818
About what?

689
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,657
It wasn't Catherine
I couldn't get over.

690
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:04,730
It was your mother.

691
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,895
God, you look so much like her.

692
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,375
I told you, I just can't do this
with you, Violet.

693
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,143
But you already have...

694
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,953
only I'm not gonna let you
turn away from me...

695
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,478
Like you did her.

696
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,736
No. This is his father.

697
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,264
Mr. Beckett.
I was just looking for Michael.

698
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,436
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

699
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:23,842
What?

700
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,437
Michael's been found dead.

701
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,410
What?

702
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,940
They're not sure yet,
but it seems like...

703
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,418
he might have been murdered.

704
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,860
Daddy?

705
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,635
Oh, my God!

706
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,014
Untie me.

707
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,057
Joy, please don't leave.

708
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:17,895
Oh, God.

709
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,191
Stop it, Violet.

710
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:26,601
Ivan, everything's gonna
be all right.

711
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,039
I should never have
taken advantage of you, Violet.

712
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,716
You've got to go,
and you've got to go now.

713
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:42,917
Go?

714
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:46,994
You fucked me...

715
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,996
and now you're throwing me out?

716
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,458
Just like my mother.

717
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,063
You promised
to take care of her...

718
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,100
and that she would be
provided for.

719
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,412
I told you I wouldn't let you
turn away from me.

720
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,177
I meant it.

721
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,594
Just get out.

722
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,367
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

723
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:13,909
Help me.

724
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,959
Mrs. B, I need to come in.

725
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,094
The breaker box
is in your closet.

726
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,052
Daddy.

727
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,334
Oh, my God.

728
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,953
-Where's my father?
-He's gone.

729
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,187
What have you done with him?

730
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,761
He did it to himself.

731
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,388
What are you talking about?

732
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:13,093
Here. Put this on.

733
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:15,896
I don't think I want to.

734
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,962
I want you to.

735
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,031
Besides...

736
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,803
you can't go like that.

737
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,708
Go? Go where?

738
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,407
We're going together...

739
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,312
but we have to be dressed up...

740
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:32,513
so, here, put it on.

741
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:35,682
All right.

742
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,361
You're really
freaking me out, Violet.

743
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,563
Now, sit...

744
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:51,629
and I'll pour tea.

745
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:53,402
I don't want to sit, Violet.

746
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,767
I'm very scared.

747
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,210
Don't be scared.

748
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,742
I told you
I'll take care of everything...

749
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,546
and I will...

750
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:06,416
but you have to trust me.

751
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:11,357
Now...sit down.

752
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,224
Where's my father?

753
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,627
You killed Michael, didn't you?

754
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:25,367
You're so lucky I'm your sister.

755
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,174
Who else would have gone
to all the trouble for you?

756
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,007
They didn't want us
to be together...

757
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,441
but now they can't stop us.

758
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:37,284
We'll be together forever.

759
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:38,546
What do you mean?

760
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:39,814
Here.

761
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:41,946
Hold this.

762
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,820
Take it!

763
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:58,070
Now...

764
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,138
all you have to do is drink.

765
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,601
You'll drink first...

766
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:10,249
and then I'll hold you
until you fall asleep.

767
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,583
I'll have to hold you tight...

768
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,111
to stop you
from thrashing around so much.

769
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,280
Then I'll drink.

770
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,584
And I'll lay down beside you...

771
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,189
and hold your hand.

772
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,965
Now...drink.

773
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:39,841
You bitch!

774
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:56,159
I tried to make it easier
for you...

775
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,431
but I guess
we'll have to do it your way.

776
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:24,825
Help!

777
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:38,997
-Help!
-Grab my hand.
