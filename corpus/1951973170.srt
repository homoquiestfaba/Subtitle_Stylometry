You know how everyone always complains
about how dangerous and dirty city is the

7
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,920
and how much and would like to return
the good old days when there was so a.

8
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,520
It seems that they have no good old days.

9
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Always has been a hell is this time.

10
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Something that you buy at the Post, you know?

19
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
But I do not think it is pretty good.

20
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,560
That is good news for you.

21
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,400

Hey, Calm down, kids.

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,280
This thing with this butcher ...
It should focus on work for the showing?

259
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,720
Ohh...God!

270
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,680
Well, it's not chance.

271
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,920
Someone attack them.

272
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,920
And never find bodies,
because they lead here.
