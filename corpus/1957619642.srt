INCREASE IN TICKET SALES

00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,611
NOT JUST THAT.

166
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,750
PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE WHAT
THEY HAVE UNTIL YOU TAKE IT
AWAY.

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,120
WHAT ARE YOU
   SUGGESTING?

168
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,224
FUEL THE RUMORS THAT THE TEAM IS
ON THE MOVE. DRIVE UP THE PRICE.

169
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,227
WE GET HARRIS BY
   FRIDAY, RIGHT?

170
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,932
NOT A PROBLEM.

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,604
(Airplane engine)

172
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,578
(Pilot) GRAB THE STICK WILL YOU?

173
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,047
WHAT'RE YOU DOING? 
   THANK YOU.

174
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,117
I DROPPED MY CIGAR.

175
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,655
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU FLEW
ALL THE TIME.

176
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,625
YA. JET ENGINES, SAFETY BELTS,
WINE AND CHEESE.

177
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,995
(Bloof!) WHAT WAS THAT?

178
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,598
WIND SHEAR. IT'S OK.

179
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,533
IT MIGHT MAKE YOU A LITTLE
AIRSICK.

180
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,035
AND YOU ONLY OCCASIONALLY
LOSE CONTROL OF THE
AIRCRAFT.

181
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,805
WELL, HOW DO YOU SEE THEM TO
AVOID THEM?

182
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,341
YOU DRIVE.

183
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,110
(Louder engine noise)

184
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,850
WATCH OUT GETTING OUT OF
   THE PLANE.

185
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,399
(Pilot) ASPIRIN?

186
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,868
YES, PLEASE.

187
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,338
BAIT SHOP... 2 K.

188
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,642
RIGHT. HOW ABOUT A RENTAL CAR?

189
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,378
BAIT SHOP... 2 K.

190
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,353
BAIT SHOP... 2 K.

191
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,092
(Woman) UM, NICE ONE. C'MON.

192
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:37,730
AHH. NICE ONE. AHH. GOODNESS.

193
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,634
AH, GOOD MORNING.

194
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,072
(Robbie) I'M LOOKING FOR A MR.
CODY HARRIS.

195
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,907
I UNDERSTAND HE LIVES AROUND
HERE.

196
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,809
JUST OUTSIDE OF
 TOWN.

197
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,278
THERE'S A TOWN?
   YOU'RE LOOKING
   AT IT.

198
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,315
I WAS TOLD I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
RENT A CAR HERE?

199
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,884
YOU'RE LOOKING AT 'EM.

200
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,825
TAKE CREDIT CARDS? (Woman
chuckles & laughs)

201
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,117
(Bloof!)

202
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,920
HEY! GET OFF! COME ON BOYS.

203
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,522
I'M SORRY. YOU LOST?

204
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,992
NOT IF ONE OF YOU IS
 CODY HARRIS.

205
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,761
AGENT OR LAWYER?

206
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,863
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

207
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,532
NEVER MIND. I'M SORRY.

208
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,903
THIS IS JOSEPH, DOG OF MANY
COLORS.

209
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:56,442
AND THAT'S ABBY... ABEDNEGO.
SURVIVED A FOREST FIRE LAST
SUMMER.

210
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,045
AND YOU'RE...
   ROBERTA... ROBBIE.

211
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,180
SURVIVED THE PLANE
 TRIP HERE.

212
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,317
I'VE BEEN RETAINED BY THE
 VANCOUVER BLADES TO SECURE
 YOUR SERVICES.

213
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:08,354
LAWYER. YOU'RE TRESPASSING.

214
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,823
WAIT. DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR
   THE OFFER?

215
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,558
I'M NOT IN THAT LINE OF WORK
ANYMORE!

216
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,627
I THINK YOU OWE ME AT LEAST 10
MINUTES!

217
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,928
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE
   RUDE...

218
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,363
TOO LATE.

219
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,403
I MOVED UP HERE TO GET
   AWAY FROM LAWYERS AND
   AGENTS OK?

220
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,005
SO THANKS, BUT NO
   THANKS...

221
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,541
LISTEN MISTER HARRIS... DROP
IT!!

222
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,877
I TRAVELED 400 MILES IN A TIN
CAN WITH WINGS

223
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,579
TO HAVE EVERYTHING I OWN EITHER
COVERED IN SALIVA OR...

224
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,949
I'M GOING ON A HIKE. I'LL GIVE
YOU 5 MINUTES WHEN I GET BACK.

225
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,352
I'D LOVE A HIKE!

226
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,989
WE'LL SEE.

227
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,097
(Splashing)

228
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,933
(Robbie) IT WOULD BE A 5-YEAR
CONTRACT!

229
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,739
(Splash)

230
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,344
NAH. I'M FINE. GO AHEAD.

231
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,781
(Robbie) SO, I'M GUARANTEEING
$4,000,000, A PERCENTAGE AND
MARKETING.

232
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,783
THE PRICE HAS GONE UP.

233
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,186
SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

234
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,687
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
 ABOUT,

235
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,556
I'D STILL BE ON THE ICE
 RIGHT NOW.

236
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,025
WELL... WHAT DO YOU WANT?

237
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,628
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

238
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,531
YOU HATE ALL WOMEN OR IS IT JUST
ME?

239
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,433
JUST YOU.

240
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,838
I LIKE HIM SO MUCH!

241
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,609
YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH SOME OF
THIS STUFF?

242
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,678
SURE!

243
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,150
WHAT'RE YOU DOING. YOU CAN'T DO
THAT. THIS IS MY LIFE!

244
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,485
WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS
 THAT?

245
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,220
MINE!

246
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,155
TRUST ME.

247
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,023
THE SQUIRRELS ARE
   PRETTY HONEST.

248
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,795
BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST
   ABEDNEGO.

249
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,897
WOOF WOOF!

250
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,937
AHH!

251
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,874
YOU DO THIS A LOT?

252
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,175
GIVES ME PERSPECTIVE.

253
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,544
IS THAT WHY YOU WALKED AWAY?

254
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,013
NOSEY TOO, HUH?

255
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,386
SORRY.

256
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,490
I WAS MARRIED... AND DIVORCED.

257
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,528
SHE LEFT ME, AND A LARGE PART OF
ME WENT WITH HER.

258
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:32,198
I DON'T BLAME HER THOUGH. I'VE
DONE THINGS I WASN'T TOO PROUD
OF.

259
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,501
BUT AROUND THAT TIME ANOTHER
PLAYER STARTED TALKING TO ME
ABOUT GOD.

260
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,337
HOW I COULD HAVE A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP... WITH GOD.

261
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,773
SO I BECAME A CHRISTIAN.

262
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,878
OH. WELL THAT EXPLAINS THE
  FRIENDLY WELCOME.

263
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,749
SORRY.

264
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,819
WHY WOULD GOD WANT YOU TO
 GIVE UP WHAT YOU DO BEST?

265
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,821
IT WASN'T THE HOCKEY.

266
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:59,559
IT WAS THE MONEY, THE CARS...
THE MONEY.

267
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,262
THINGS WE ALL FACE EVERY
  DAY.

268
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,332
UNLESS, OF COURSE, WE'RE
  HIDING OUT ON A MOUNTAIN
  SOMEPLACE.

269
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,435
I WALKED AWAY TO FIND OUT WHAT
GOD REALLY WANTED FOR ME.

270
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,871
MAYBE GOD WANTED HOCKEY
  FOR YOU.

271
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,640
NOT THE WAY I PLAYED IT.

272
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,676
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO WIN,
   SOMEBODY'S GOT TO LOSE.

273
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,711
YOU PLAY TO WIN.

274
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,580
TO WIN WHAT?

275
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,815
CHAMPIONSHIPS. THE STANLEY CUP.

276
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,185
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

277
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,756
THE SAME. I WANT THE
   "TROPHIES", THE MONEY, THE
   CARS...

278
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,825
THE MONEY... AND STUFF.

279
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,393
THAT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY?

280
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,230

Y'KNOW, I GREW UP ON A RIVER
JUST LIKE THIS.

336
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,424
LITTLE NORTH FROM HERE.

337
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,393
CALLED "JACK STONE CREEK."

338
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,829
JACK STONE CREEK.

339
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,331
IT WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE
WINTERTIME.

340
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,836
AND, FOR 3 MONTHS MY FATHER AND
I HAD OUR OWN PRIVATE ICE RINK.

341
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:45,778
BUT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS HOW
YOU REMEMBER IT, IS IT?

342
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,049
I WAS LUCKY TO SEE MY DAD ONCE
EVERY 3 MONTHS.

343
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,119
MILITARY.

344
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,291
SO, WHAT'D I SAY THAT FINALLY
WON YOU OVER?

345
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,197
YOU DIDN'T FAIL BY COMING UP
HERE.

346
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,967
WELL, THAT'S GOT "NO"
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

347
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,140
ROBBIE, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR
BEING SO HARD ON YOU BEFORE.

348
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,943
HEY LOOK, I'M SPEAKING WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. I'D LIKE YOU TO BE THERE.

349
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,247
MAYBE THIS WAS ALL FOR A REASON.

350
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,584
THAT'S SWEET.
BUT I THINK I'LL PASS.

351
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,855
YOU KNOW, FOR A MOMENT UP THERE
ON THAT MOUNTAIN,

352
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,458
I ALMOST SAW IN YOU THAT LITTLE
GIRL.

353
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,460
LITTLE PERSON...

354
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,262
LITTLE PERSON.

355
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:40,366
GOD WANTS US TO COME TO HIM.
LIKE LITTLE PERSONS.

356
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:46,205
NO MONEY, CARS... ANY OF THAT
EXTRA STUFF.

357
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,508
JUST SIMPLE.

358
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,780
WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM JACK STONE
CREEK, CODY.

359
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,621
(Sighs)

360
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,127
COFFEE. BLACK. SET UP AN IV.

361
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,828
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN? HAROLD'S
 BEEN...

362
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,330
I KNOW... WHO'S THAT?

363
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,199
KNUTSON. EMINENT
   DOMAIN.

364
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,533
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

365
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,335
HE'S BEEN SITTING OUTSIDE
YOUR OFFICE FOR 2 DAYS.

366
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,070
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO PUT
A FREEWAY THROUGH HIS HOUSE.

367
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,039
NO NEW CLIENTS! GIVE HIM TO
TOBIN.

368
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,779
THIS IS MY DEAL. I'LL FIX IT.

369
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,915
THE INVESTORS BACKED
 OUT. THERE IS NO DEAL.

370
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:33,052
LET ME TALK TO WINANS. I'LL
SMOOTH IT OVER.

371
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:37,189
DO YOU HAVE CODY
 HARRIS?

372
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,726
YES...
   WELL

373
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,864
AND NO. HE'S IN TOWN TONIGHT.

374
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,833
AND SPIVAK AND I ARE MEETING
WITH HIM.

375
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,369
(Operator) Steve Stark, line 4.

376
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:56,909
OK. LAST CHANCE,
 ROBBIE.

377
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,683
THE ICE QUEEN!

378
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,218
(Spivak) HEY, HEY KIDS! COME ON.

379
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,588
C'MON ZACK. CARLY, OUT. DADDY'S
IN A HURRY.

380
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,124
(Carly) DON'T SPANK ME!

381
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,059
SORRY.

382
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,400
YOU KNOW ROBBS, YOU GOT A REP
FOR DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
CLOSE A DEAL,

383
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,603
BUT GOING TO A BILLY GRAHAM
CRUSADE...

384
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,505
THIS WILL MAKE YOU A LEGEND.

385
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:36,949
(Cody) I NEVER HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORWARD AT A
CRUSADE LIKE THIS,

386
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,686
BUT I WISH I HAD.

387
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,089
MANY OF YOU HAVE COME FROM GREAT
DISTANCES TO BE WITH US TONIGHT.

388
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,660
I BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF USE IS
HERE BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS
LEAD US.

389
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,029
EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE?

390
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,131
I'M STRICTLY A "C AND E" GUY...
CHRISTMAS AND EASTER.

391
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,900
WHEN BILLY GIVES YOU THE
INVITATION

392
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,202
TO GIVE YOUR HEART TO CHRIST,

393
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,739
REALLY CONSIDER WHOSE TEAM
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR.

394
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,043
GOD'S LOVE IS THE GREATEST POWER
IN THE UNIVERSE.

395
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,879
IT CHANGED HISTORY.

396
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,182
IT CHANGED ME.

397
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:15,120
AND NOTHING... NOTHING CAN
OVERCOME IT.

398
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,758
(Applause)... THANK YOU.

399
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,937
(Billy Graham) IT WAS NOT HUMAN
WEAKNESS THAT KEPT HIM ON THE
CROSS.

400
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:37,042
JESUS SAID, "I LAY DOWN MY LIFE
THAT I MIGHT TAKE IT AGAIN.

401
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,412
NO MAN TAKES IT FROM ME, BUT I
LAY IT DOWN OF MYSELF.

402
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,782
I HAVE POWER TO LAY IT DOWN, AND
I HAVE POWER TO TAKE IT UP."

403
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,518
HE HAD NEVER COMMITTED A SIN.

404
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,787
HE'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

405
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,590
HE'D NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING
EVIL.

406
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,327
HE WAS JUST A LITTLE OVER 30
YEARS OF AGE.

407
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,064
AND THERE HE WAS, HANGING.

408
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,266
IN YOUR PLACE AND MINE.

409
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,370
AND HE COULD LOOK FORWARD
THROUGH THE CENTURIES AND SEE
YOU.

410
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,073
HE SEES YOU, HE SAW YOU THEN, AS
YOU SIT HERE TONIGHT.

411
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,043
HE KNOWS YOUR HEART, HE CAN READ
YOUR MIND.

412
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,512
HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

413
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:19,218
AND HE SAYS "I LOVE YOU. I LOVE
YOU."

414
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:24,523
FROM THE CROSS THERE'S ONE WORD
THAT COMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN -
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

415
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,992
HE LOVES YOU.

416
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,496
AND HE'S WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU
OF ALL YOUR SINS.

417
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:38,670
SIN IS A FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO
GOD'S ETHICAL AND MORAL
STANDARDS.

418
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,742
AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "ALL
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS SIN."

419
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,346
SO WE'RE SINNERS BY NATURE,
WE'RE BORN

420
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:50,516
WITH THAT SEED WITHIN US, AND
THEN WE'RE SINNERS BY CHOICE.

421
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,485
YOU CHOOSE TO SIN, ON YOUR OWN.

422
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,188
AND THEN YOU'RE SINNERS BY
PRACTICE.

423
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,458
WE SIN EVERY DAY.

424
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:03,061
EITHER SINS OF OMISSION OR SINS
OF COMMISSION.

425
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,831
YOU HAVE TO REPENT OF SIN.

426
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,300
THAT MEANS YOU SAY TO GOD, "I'M
SORRY I'VE SINNED.

427
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,437
I'M WILLING TO CHANGE MY WAY OF
LIFE.

428
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:15,407
I CAN'T DO IT MYSELF, I'VE TRIED
AND I'VE FAILED."

429
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,045
BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL COME
AND HELP YOU TO CHANGE.
(Applause)

430
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,682
GOD WILL HELP YOU TO CHANGE AND
THAT'S REPENTANCE.

431
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:29,254
YES, THAT VOID IN YOUR LIFE CAN
BE FILLED TONIGHT BY CHRIST.

432
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:34,259
HE CAN FORGIVE THE PAST,
RECONCILE YOU WITH YOUR HUSBAND
OR YOUR WIFE

433
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,029
OR YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR FRIENDS
OF BUSINESS.

434
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:42,501
GIVE YOU A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION
IF YOU WILL RECEIVE HIM.

435
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,237
AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO
THAT RIGHT NOW.

436
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,873
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP
OUT OF YOUR SEAT,

437
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:52,044
COME AND STAND IN FRONT OF THE
PLATFORM AND ALL AROUND...

438
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,948
AND BY COMING, YOU'RE GOING TO
SAY,

439
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:01,053
"I DO TURN FROM MY SIN AS BEST I
CAN WITH GOD'S HELP.

440
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:07,259
I WANT TO COMMIT MYSELF TO HIM,
AFRESH AND ANEW.

441
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,296
I WANT TO REALLY KNOW CHRIST.

442
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,999
I WANT TO LEAVE HERE WITH
CERTAINTY IN MY HEART.

443
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,135
WE GOTTA FIND OUT WHEN
  THEY'RE BRINGING THE
  POPCORN HERE...

444
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,906
(Billy Graham) YOU GET UP AND
COME RIGHT NOW.

445
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,641
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE COULD GET
A 3RD OF THESE PEOPLE

446
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,911
TO COME SEE HARRIS PLAY INSTEAD
OF PREACH?

447
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:31,216
WE COULD CLEAN UP... SPIVAK?

448
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,652
(Billy Graham) SO START NOW, IF
YOU COME FROM THE TOP,

449
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,654
BUT DON'T LET DISTANCE KEEP YOU
FROM CHRIST

450
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,956
BECAUSE YOU MAY NEVER HAVE
ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS.

451
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:43,295
TO BE BORN AGAIN MEANS TO BE
BORN FROM ABOVE.

452
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:47,266
THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD COMES IN
AND GIVES YOU A NEW HEART.

453
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,668
YOU SEE, YOUR OLD NATURE IS NO
GOOD.

454
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,171
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEW NATURE.

455
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,641
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEW HEART.

456
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,442
"A NEW HEART ALSO WILL I GIVE
YOU

457
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,680
AND A NEW SPIRIT WILL ACT QUICK
WITHIN YOU," SAYS EZEKIEL 36.

458
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,019
WHEN YOU COME TO HIM TO PRAY,
MAKE IT SIMPLE.

459
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,355
SAY, "LORD, I LOVE YOU." THAT'S
A PRAYER.

460
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,560
SAY, "OH GOD, I CONFESS MY
SINS." THAT'S A PRAYER.

461
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,431
AND THEN YOU CAN START TELLING
HIM ALL ABOUT YOUR NEEDS

462
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,935
AND YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR
RELATIONSHIPS,

463
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:26,104
AND HE KNOWS IT ALREADY - HE
WANTS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT

464
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,975
SO YOU'RE DEPENDING ON HIM TO
HELP YOU.

465
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,418
(Car engine)

466
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,421
WASN'T SURE YOU'D SHOW. LATE
NIGHT?

467
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,122
IT'S THE LAST THING I
  THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.

468
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,458
YA, WELL, THAT MAKES 2 OF US.

469
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,294
(Swak)

470
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,865
BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU
GET OLDER WHY YOU'D WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE CHURCH -

471
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,768
THE EMOTIONAL CRUTCH AND ALL...

472
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,605
SPARE THE PLATITUDES, ROBBIE. I
KNOW WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT.

473
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,473
IT SCARES ME TO DEATH TOO.

474
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,175
(Swak)

475
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,581
I THOUGHT THAT GRAHAM HAD
   SOME INTERESTING THINGS
   TO SAY.

476
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,850
NO, REALLY I DID.

477
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,086
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW
   UP TO HEAR SOME GUY QUOTE
   THE BIBLE,

478
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,088
HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT
   SOMETHING TO SAY.

479
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,957
YEAH, THAT... SOMETHING AMAZING
HAPPENED TO ME.

480
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:23,595
I MEAN THERE WAS LIKE... DR.
GRAHAM CALLED IT... PEACE.

481
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,564
I FELT THIS FORGIVENESS I NEVER
FELT...

482
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,633
FORGIVENESS? WHAT'VE YOU
   EVER DONE WRONG?

483
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,801
CHEAT AT SCRABBLE?

484
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,070
(Spivak) IT GOES BEYOND WHAT
I'VE DONE WRONG.

485
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,172
IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS FELT WAS
MISSING IN MY LIFE.

486
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,142
LAST NIGHT, IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

487
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,611
TIME WILL TELL.

488
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,081
LOOK, I BUY THAT THERE'S SOME
GOD, OR WHATEVER,

489
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,083
WHO MADE THE UNIVERSE,

490
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,721
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MY OWN
LIFE... I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR ME.

491
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,557
I'VE MADE MYSELF WHAT I
   AM.

492
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,660
SURE YOU WANT THAT
RESPONSIBILITY?

493
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,463
THE TRUTH IS... I WISH I COULD
GO GET WHAT YOU GOT

494
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,998
AND HAVE WHAT CODY HAS.

495
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,035
I WISH IT WAS AS SIMPLE, FOR ME.
BUT IT'S JUST NOT.

496
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,137
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COMPLICATE
IT?

497
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,571
IF I DIDN'T COMPLICATE IT,

498
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,842
I'D REALIZE I HAD NOTHING.

499
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,310
(Swak)

500
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,948
BUT THEN AGAIN, I'LL HIT A
BEAUTY SHOT LIKE THAT ONE,

501
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,986
AND I'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THE
MEANING OF LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE

502
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:25,123
AND JUST FOCUS ON WINNING,
BEATING THE OTHER GUY,

503
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,159
CLOSING THE DEAL.

504
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,195
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHAT DID OUR
DEAR CODY SAY?

505
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,230
SAID HE WAS
PRAYING ABOUT IT.

506
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,665
GREAT!

507
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,073
WE COULD TRY IT.

508
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:45,377
PRAY? YOU ARE NUTS,
   AREN'T YOU?

509
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,612
PRAY THAT CODY WOULD DO THE
RIGHT THING.

510
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,915
YOU CAN DO THAT?

511
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,351
(Phone rings) COMPLETELY INSANE.

512
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:59,391
HELLO?... UM HUM. YES! GREAT
NEWS, JULIE!

513
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,695
CODY HARRIS IS IN.

514
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,098
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PRAY!

515
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,436
WINANS CALLED FOR THE FOURTH
TIME AT 9:15.

516
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,438
HE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU
IMMEDIATELY.

517
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,508
AND THIS WAS JUST DELIVERED TO
MR. SPIVAK FROM A CODY HARRIS.

518
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,643
OPEN IT. SHOW ME
 CONTRACTS.

519
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,882
THAT'S A CONTRACT.

520
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,485
MS. STEELE? MR. HARRIS IS
   WAITING FOR YOU IN YOUR
   OFFICE.

521
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,856
(Knocking)

522
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,491
(Robbie) EXCUSE ME, MISS STEELE?

523
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,360
JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
LIKE IN THE HOT SEAT.

524
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,295
NICE JERSEY. DOES IT FIT?

525
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,997
YEAH, FITS JUST FINE.

526
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,399
GOTTA FIND A WAY TO GET MY NAME
AND NUMBER ON THE BACK THOUGH.

527
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,335
I'LL SEW IT ON MYSELF.

528
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:47,005
LISTEN, BEFORE WE SIGN
 CONTRACTS, A COUPLE OF
 THINGS...

529
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,640
OH BOY. HERE WE GO!

530
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,609
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT
YOU READ IN THE PAPERS.

531
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,611
THE TEAM IS STAYING IN TOWN.

532
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,614
GOOD. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT KIND
OF PLAYER YOU'RE GETTING.

533
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,685
I'VE MADE A
COMMITMENT TO JESUS CHRIST.

534
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,155
I WON'T PLAY
MY OLD GAME ANYMORE.

535
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,657
I WON'T PLAY DIRTY.

536
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,893
YOU'RE SAYING?

537
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,694
YOU DID YOUR RESEARCH.

538
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,063
I TOOK A LOT OF GUYS OUT OF THE
GAME FOR AWHILE.

539
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,000
BROKEN NOSES... BROKEN TIBIAS,
THAT KIND OF THING.

540
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,636
SEE, I THOUGHT IT WAS OK THEN
BECAUSE IT WAS MY BUSINESS.

541
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:21,373
I GET THE ANALOGY. BUT I HAVEN'T
BROKEN ANY TIBIAS LATELY,

542
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,141
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

543
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,177
YEAH, MAYBE NOT.

544
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:28,547
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU AND I ARE AN
AWFUL LOT ALIKE...

545
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,983
TO DO WHAT YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO
PUT YOUR BLINDERS ON.

546
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,287
SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE GONNA RUN
INTO SOMETHING PAINFUL.

547
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:39,024
WE'LL SIGN CONTRACTS LATER.
PRESS CONFERENCE AT NOON.

548
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:42,828
HEY, THEN YOU BETTER GET STARTED
WORKING ON THIS.

549
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,031
GET OUT OF MY CHAIR!

550
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,899
HA, HA, HA!

551
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,370
(Fans cheering)

552
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,481
HE HASN'T LOST MUCH?

553
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,150
A LITTLE SPEED MAYBE. BUT,

554
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,720
I CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF
 GUYS ON ONE HAND THAT CAN
 DO BETTER.

555
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,527
(Boom, splat)

556
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:30,709
(Loud cheering)

557
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,378
SO HOW'D YOU GET HIM BACK,
 ROBBIE?

558
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,147
HE LOVES THE GAME. I JUST HAD TO
REMIND HIM.

559
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:41,119
WELL, HE'S A BIG DRAW. NEXT
COUPLE OF GAMES WILL TELL.

560
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,155
COUPLE OF GAMES? A FULL SEASON
WITH THIS GUY,

561
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,325
AND YOU'LL START THINKING ABOUT
BUILDING A BIGGER VENU

562
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:53,064
BUT THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
 GENTLEMEN.

563

I WONDER IF IT'S A
   SURPRISE TO THE LOCAL
   FANS?

601
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,373
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A BIG CHANGE
FOR THIS TEAM.

602
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,543
I THINK CODY HARRIS IS CERTAINLY
PART OF IT, BUT, UH...

603
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,146
BUT, IT'S A TEAM SPORT,
   ISN'T IT, RYAN?

604
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,548
YEAH, IT IS. YOU GOT TO WONDER
TOO, UP THERE IN THE OWNER'S
BOX.

605
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,851
I MEAN, THAT PLAYS A PART TOO,
AND

606
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,454
ROBERTA STEELE IS APPARENTLY THE
LADY WHO HAS DONE IT.

607
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,023
THEY CALL HER "THE
   TERMINATOR" RYAN.

608
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,259
I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT
COLIN.

609
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,361
JUST TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT ONE
GUY ON THE TEAM

610
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,230
THAT CAN PUT THE PUCK IN THE
NET.

611
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,165
IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE NOT
ONLY TO THE TEAM

612
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,801
BUT TO THIS GREAT CROWD THAT'S
HERE TONIGHT.

613
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,270
(Colin) CODY HARRIS WITH THE
PUCK.

614
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,306
OH, A WICKED SLASH FROM MONROE
THERE!

615
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,176
THEY'VE GOT EACH OTHER IN A
STRANGLE HOLD.

616
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,110
A COUPLE OF PUNCHES...

617
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,964
WAIT A MINUTE, HARRIS, HARRIS IS
SKATING AWAY.

618
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,469
MUNRO IS... OH, A WICKED PUNCH
FROM BEHIND!

619
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,771
CLOCKED CODY HARRIS.

620
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,908
(Ryan) THAT SUCKER PUNCH HAS GOT
TO GET OUT OF THE GAME.

621
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,076
JUST CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN IN
THE GAME OF HOCKEY.

622
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,878
(Colin) THAT'S NOT A NICE
INCIDENT AT ALL.

623
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,914
THE LINESMEN ARE SEPARATING THEM
NOW.

624
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,049
TAKING THEM AWAY TO THE PENALTY
BOXES.

625
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,552
THE PENALTIES SHOULD SHAKE DOWN
HERE IMMEDIATELY.

626
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,420
SEE WHO GETS THE EXTRA
MINUTES...

627
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,589
(Ryan) YOU KNOW COLIN, MUNRO'S
GOT TO GET SOME EXTRA MINUTES
FOR THAT.

628
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,258
YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT IN THE
GAME OF HOCKEY. THAT'S JUST NO
GOOD.

629
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,626
(Colin) YOU GOT TO WONDER
THOUGH.

630
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,495
CERTAINLY, THESE 2 HAVE SQUARED
OFF BEFORE

631
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,431
AND A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH
HERE FOR CODY HARRIS.

632
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,667
I WONDER, IS THE LIFESTYLE
GETTING IN THE WAY?

633
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,136
(Colin) WELL. POSSIBLY. YOU
KNOW, DISCIPLINE'S A PART OF THE
GAME.

634
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,371
I MEAN THE COACH WANTS YOU TO BE
DISCIPLINED,

635
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,707
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU NEED
TO RESPOND.

636
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,143
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
IT AFFECTS HIS GAME.

637
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,712
EXACTLY! CAN HE SCORE
   WITH THIS NEW ATTITUDE?

638
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,881
HE'S CERTAINLY NOT THE
   BAD BOY OF HOCKEY

639
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,417
THESE FANS HAVE COME TO
   KNOW AND LOVE.

640
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,554
(Robbie) YOU SHOULDA' FINISHED
HIM OFF!

641
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:22,527
WE PAY YOU GOOD MONEY TO
   HIT PEOPLE!

642
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,868
YEAH, WELL... DO UNTO
   OTHERS BEFORE THEY DO
   UNTO YOU!!

643
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,575
THE VENUE HOLDS 14,500.

644
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,877
TONIGHT WE CAME IN AT JUST OVER
14,000.

645
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,248
THAT'S A 28% INCREASE OVER 3
GAMES.

646
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,583
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

647
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,119
ACTUALLY, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
SAID WOULD HAPPEN.

648
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,955
FIRST BONAFIDE OFFER
   GENTLEMEN.

649
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,524
I WANT A DEAL.

650
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,261
WE SIGNED CODY TO CLOSE, AND MY
CLIENT WANTS TO SELL.

651
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,330
IF A TOWN THIS FIRED UP FOR A
HOCKEY TEAM

652
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,499
CAN'T GET TOGETHER THE
$100,000,000,

653
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,202
THEN I GUESS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.

654
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,537
$100,000,000?

655
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,306
THAT'D BE A MISTAKE. THE FANS
ARE LOOKING...

656
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,041
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FANS,
GENTLEMEN.

657
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,410
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE A HANDSHAKE
TO THE BANK.

658
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,114
SO GET BACK TO ME. FRIDAY BY 4.

659

663
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,904
(Swock, swock)

664
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:49,213
SO THIS IS THE MYSTERIOUS
POST-GAME RITUAL?

665
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,755
I GUESS I'M ALWAYS SORT OF
INTRUDING, HUH?

666
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,756
(Swock)

667
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,263
THIS IS NICE.

668
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,065
(Swock)

669
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:13,705
I REALLY LOVE THIS OLD
 PLACE.

670
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:18,109
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
 I CAME BACK.

671
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,645
ANY OTHERS?

672
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:24,916
SOMETHING YOU SAID
 ABOUT... HIDING OUT.

673
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:30,688
SORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, EARLIER.

674
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,623
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

675
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,594
YOU'RE PAYING MONEY FOR A
  BRAWLER. AND I'M HIDING
  OUT.

676
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,396
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

677
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,766
I'M SORRY, ROBB'S. IT JUST
  AIN'T WORKIN' OUT.

678
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:47,538
SO THE GOING GETS TOUGH, AND THE
TOUGH CLIMB BACK UP THEIR
MOUNTAIN?

679
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,107
I THOUGHT IT COULD
 WORK...

680
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,042
YA - AS LONG AS THERE WEREN'T
ANY RISKS? RIGHT?

681
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,144
WELL, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

682
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,847
YOU'RE UNDER CONTRACT.

683
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,817
CONTRACT? WOW.

684
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,520
THAT'S THE WAY YOU STILL
   THINK ABOUT ME?

685
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,124
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
   EXPECTED ANY MORE OUT OF
   YOU.

686
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,893
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

687
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:13,164
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT NO
 MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PRETEND
 TO CARE,

688
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,200
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKIN' OUT
 FOR NUMBER ONE.

689
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,670
I CARE ABOUT THIS TEAM. AND I
DON'T THINK IT SETS A VERY GOOD
EXAMPLE RUNNING AWAY.

690
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,973
I DON'T THINK PUNCHING SOME
GUY'S TEETH OUT

691
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,008
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION IS ALL
THAT GREAT EITHER!

692
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,377
ALRIGHT SO YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

693
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,047
YOU TELL ME YOUR GOD IS
FORGIVING. WELL, IS HE?

694
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,284
OH, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT GOD NOW?

695
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,486
ALL I KNOW ABOUT GOD IS WHAT
I'VE LEARNED FROM WATCHING YOU.

696
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,922
WHATEVER HE DID IN YOUR LIFE,
IT'S REAL.

697
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,425
EVEN I CAN SEE THAT.

698
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,261
SO CUT YOURSELF A BREAK.

699
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,863
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE... LEAVE.

700
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:50,968
BUT JUST KNOW THIS. I DO CARE
ABOUT THIS TEAM.

701
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,971
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU.

702
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,879
WOW. THERE SHE IS AGAIN.

703
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,614
WHAT?

704
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,850
THAT LITTLE GIRL I SAW BACK UP
ON THE MOUNTAIN.

705
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,252
LITTLE PERSON!

706
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,655
I SEE HER EVERY NOW AND
THEN,

707
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:15,059
SHE'S HIDING BEHIND SOME
BUSINESSWOMAN AND HER BRIEFCASE,

708
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,629
CELLULAR PHONE. YOU KNOW
WHAT?

709
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,199
I THINK I EVEN CAUGHT HER
TONIGHT DOING THE BLADE
DANCE.

710
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,168
I GUESS YOU MUST HAVE HIT YOUR
HEAD HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

711
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,103
NO, NO. COME ON. ADMIT IT!

712
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,673
YOU WERE OUT THERE DOIN'
  THE BLADE DANCE.

713
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,741
NO, YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

714
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,477
I THINK YOU WERE.

715
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,345
NO... I THINK YOU'VE GOT ALL THE
STEPS RIGHT

716
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,613
OK, YOU LEAD NOW, ALL
  RIGHT?

717
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,415
NO, I LEAVE.

718
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,085
WATCH YOUR STEP.

719
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,721
YEAH. TAKE CARE OF THAT CUT
FACE, BOY.

720
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,727
(Phone rings)

721
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,896
IT'S ME. Rob... Spivak. How
was the game?

722
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:54,599
WHICH ONE?  What's that mean?

723
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,335
I GAVE THE LOCAL BOYS AN
ULTIMATUM.

724
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:00,438
Guess it worked. I can be back
in the office in 20...

725
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,206
NO MEETINGS UNTIL FRIDAY.

726
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,808
Nobody told Winans that.

727
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,277
He was at the office when I left
2 hours ago.

728
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:09,347
TOM. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL
YOU BACK LATER.

729
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,857
SORRY I'M SO LATE, I DIDN'T
 REALIZE WE WERE HAVING A
 MEETING.

730
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,460
HI. ROBERTA STEELE.
   JOHN GARRISON,

731
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,666
ROBBIE, NEVILLE FLEMING, WESLEY
LANE, THIS IS TRAVIS NOE, YOU
KNOW MERRIL...

732
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,969
WE'VE MET.
AND WAYNE
WILSON.    NICE TO MEET YOU.

733
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,938
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE WE
 TAKING ON A NEW CLIENT?

734
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:40,411
PETE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MERRIL
AND OUR GUESTS ON AHEAD TO THE
RESTAURANT,

735
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,979
AND I'LL JOIN YOU SHORTLY.

736
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,181
SURE THING! THIS
 WAY GENTLEMEN.

737
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,859
ROBBS, YOU'RE
 WELCOME TO TAGALONG
 IF YOU WANT.

738
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:06,070
WELL... THIS WAS
 SUPPOSED TO BE A
 SURPRISE.

739
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,506
OH, BUT IT IS.

740
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,581
WHAT'S THIS?

741
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,282
OPEN IT.

742
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:30,194
JUST A LITTLE TOKEN OF MY
APPRECIATION.

743
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,965
YOU HAVE EXCEEDED ALL MY
EXPECTATIONS.

744
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,701
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

745
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:40,605
A LITTLE THANK YOU. IT WAS YOUR
IDEA ACTUALLY.

746
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,741
WHAT WAS MY IDEA?

747
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,910
MOVING THE TEAM.

748
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,880
YOU JUST MET THE NEW OWNERS OF
THE MINNESOTA BLADES.

749
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,885
THIS WAS YOUR STRATEGY
   FROM THE START.

750
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,288
IT WAS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC. A
PLOY.

751
00:45:57,288 --> 00:46:00,658
LOOK, THIS DEAL BENEFITS ALL OF
US.

752
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:06,664
AND BELIEVE ME, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
LEFT OUT.

753
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:09,333
BUT, THIS IS WAY TOO SOON...

754
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,435
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR TO THE
TEAM... OR THE TOWN...

755
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,773
FAIR? WE DIDN'T WANT FAIR - WE
WANTED TO WIN.

756
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,610
THIS DEAL MAKES YOU ONE OF THE
WINNERS,

757
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,714
NOT TO MENTION, ONE VERY WEALTHY
WOMAN.

758
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,883
HAROLD, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TALK TO WINANS ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE

759
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,185
I'M NOT SURE I CAN GO ALONG WITH
IT.

760
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:34,925
GO ALONG WITH IT?
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

761
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,162
WHEN THIS MOVE HAPPENS,
AND IT WILL HAPPEN,

762
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:43,267
YOU WILL TAKE THE CREDIT ALONG
WITH THE BLAME.

763
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:48,639
YOU THINK MERRIL WINANS THOUGHT
TWICE ABOUT THIS DEAL?

764
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,275
YOU THINK HE'S A BIG FAN OF
YOURS?

765
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,412
YOU NEARLY BLEW THIS FOR ALL OF
US.

766
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:57,415
HE TOLERATES YOU.

767
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:00,184
BUT HE DOES NOT RESPECT YOU.

768
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:04,355
HE WILL MOVE THIS TEAM,
AND WHEN HE DOES,

769
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:08,259
YOU'LL HAVE FINALLY MADE A NAME
FOR YOURSELF.

770
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:12,229
YOU'LL BE THE MOST HATED WOMAN
IN CANADA.

WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON
   TELLING ME?

789
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,549
OR WAS THAT WHAT THE
   OTHER NIGHT WAS ALL
   ABOUT?

790
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,851
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.

I DIDN'T KNOW.

794
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:51,061
BLOOM'S NOT EVEN
   MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE.

795
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,063
BUT YOU'RE ALL OVER IT.

796
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,533
THEY MUST BE SINGING YOUR
   PRAISES DOWN IN THE
   STATES.

797
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,235
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

798
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:05,209
THEN PROVE IT.
PUT A STOP TO IT.

799
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:09,980
IT'S UN-STOPPABLE! I'VE MADE
CERTAIN OF THAT.

HAVE NOTHING!

805
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,833
I'VE HAD TO FIGHT EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY UP.

806
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,035
AND NOW THAT I CAN FINALLY SEE
THE TOP,

00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:16,674
AND HE KNOWS IT ALREADY. HE
WANTS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT

829
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,944
SO YOU'RE DEPENDING ON HIM TO
HELP YOU.

830
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:34,892
PLEASE, GOD, PLEASE JESUS...

831
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,264
IF YOU'RE A SAVIOR...

832
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,801
I REALLY NEED A SAVIOR...

833
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,506
(Lawn mower engine)

834
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,447
UH OH.

835
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,720
HI MOM.

836
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,290
SHE'S HERE!

837
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,624
WHO'S HERE?

838
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,361
THE TERMINATOR!

839
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:14,765
ROBBS?

840
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,433
I'M SORRY, I KNOW IT'S SATURDAY.

841
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,602
BUT I NEED YOU TO GET THE
INVESTORS TOGETHER.

842
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,238
MEET US AT THIS ADDRESS?

843
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,713
(Robbie) I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU
ALL FOR COMING ON SUCH SHORT
NOTICE.

844
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,016
I'M SURE YOU'VE READ THE PAPER.

845
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:33,884
I OWN THE PAPER!

846
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,653
GENTLEMEN, LET'S GIVE MS. STEEL
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HERSELF.

847
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,390
I STAND TO LOSE A QUARTER OF A
MILLION DOLLARS

848
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,925
IN DEVELOPMENT FEES IF THIS
BLOWS UP.

849
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,995
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T OFFER YOU
MORE THAN AN APOLOGY.

850
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,931
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

851
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:52,202
THE TRUTH IS... I DON'T THINK I
CAN STOP THIS.

852
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,105
IF MINNESOTA WANTS TO MOVE THE
TEAM, THE TEAM WILL MOVE.

853
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:59,476
I TRULY REGRET THE CULPABILITY I
BEAR IN THIS.

854
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,280
OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT!

855
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,282
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD US YOU DIDN'T
KNOW.

856
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,151
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BLOOM PLANNED
TO MOVE THE TEAM.

857
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,353
I DID KNOW HE WANTED TO UP THE
ANTE.

858
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,522
IT WAS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT
HAPPENED.

859
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:16,160
YOU TREATED ME AS A FELLOW
WORKER, YOU TRUSTED ME,

860
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,629
AND I DECEIVED YOU...

861
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:23,934
FOR THAT, I AM PROFOUNDLY SORRY.

862
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:29,540
SO, THAT'S IT? IT'S OVER?

863
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,443
SO WE'RE JUST
 GIVING UP?

864
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,013
OK. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY
LAWYER.

865
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:42,886
WELL, THERE GOES A LITTLE PIECE
OF CANADA.

866
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,494
A LITTLE PIECE OF CANADA...

867
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,899
HE'S EXTREMELY BUSY.
 MORNING, NANCY.

868
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,168
MS. STEELE, YOU CAN'T GO IN
THERE!

869
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:03,207
ROBERTA! WE'RE
HAVING A CONFERENCE.

870
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,342
I DIDN'T COME TO TALK TO YOU
HAROLD, I CAME TO TALK TO MR.
WINANS.

871
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,411
I SAID WE'RE HAVING
A CONFERENCE...
   HERE HARRY.    READ THIS.

872
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,712
WHAT IS THIS?

873
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,980
IT'S A REQUEST FOR AN
 INJUNCTION

874
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,482
PREVENTING A MOVE UNTIL THE
COURT CAN DETERMINE

875
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,851
THE ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS TO
THE COMMUNITY.

876
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,652
NOW, MR. WINANS...

877
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,489
I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL ABOUT
THE OFFER FROM THE STATES.

878
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,224
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

879
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,826
NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK I'VE
  JUST REGAINED IT.

880
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,862
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

881
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,964
I'VE ALREADY GIVEN MY WORD TO
MINNESOTA.

882
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:29,433
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT
THAT'S WORTH.

883
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:33,403
NOW, MR. WINANS, I'M GIVING YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT
THING,

884
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:37,441
TO SAVE MONEY, AND TO SAVE FACE.

885
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,210
SAVE FACE?

886
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,613
THIS DEAL. IT'S NO GOOD.

887
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,615
I WANT YOU TO RECONSIDER FOR THE
FOLLOWING REASONS.

888
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,851
#1: THE BLADES BELONGS IN
VANCOUVER.

889
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,020
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS
 TOWN.

890
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,089
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS
 MONEY.

891
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:54,057
2: YOU'LL LOSE MONEY.

892
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:57,394
CITIZENS HAVE ALREADY ORGANIZED
TO BOYCOTT YOUR BUSINESSES AND
PICKET YOUR OFFICES.

893
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:02,199
ROBERTA, THIS IS A DONE DEAL.

894
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:06,036
NOW GO STAND OUTSIDE THE DOOR
UNTIL I CALL FOR YOU. GO ON.

895
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,505
BOYS, WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
TO THE COMMISSARY

896
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,741
AND HAVE A COFFEE FOR A
MOMENT.

897
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,443
GO AHEAD GUYS. GO ON.

898
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:18,849
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO
KNOW ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN.

899
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:21,685
EMINENT DOMAIN?

900
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,554
A LITTLE CASE I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON.

901
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:26,023
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT IT HARRY.

902
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:31,695
WELL... UNDER CANADIAN AND
INTERNATIONAL LAW, A SOVEREIGN
POWER...

903
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:35,065
IN THIS CASE, THE CITY OF
VANCOUVER...

904
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,467
IS ENTITLED TO POSSESSION OF
PROPERTY...

905
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,003
IN THIS INSTANCE, THE BLADES...

906
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:44,374
IF ITS LOSS IS DEEMED
DETRIMENTAL

907
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,411
TO... TO THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC.

908
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,546
WELL, THAT'S FINE, HARRY, BUT
JUST ONE THING -

909
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,749
THE BLADES AREN'T A PIECE OF
REAL ESTATE.

910
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,484
AND I QUOTE,

911
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,788
"BUYING THE BLADES IS LIKE
OWNING A LITTLE PIECE OF
CANADA."

912
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:03,093
CAN SHE DO THAT?

913
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,629
ROBBIE, YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR.

914
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:09,466
I'D BE FORCED TO SELL THE TEAM
TO THE CITY?

915
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,702
AT "FAIR" MARKET PRICE,

916
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,304
LESS ANY BACK RENT YOU OWE ON
THAT LEASE AT THE COLISEUM.

917
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,373
WHY?

918
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,609
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

919
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,811
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
ISN'T RIGHT.

920
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,880
IT MAY BE LEGAL, BUT IT'S
NOT ETHICAL.

921
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,783
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE!!

922
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:30,320
THERE HAS TO BE.

923
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,258
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR INVITING A
WOMAN INTO THE FIRM.

924
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,196
HAVE A NICE DAY, GENTLEMEN.

925
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,078
I LOVE THIS.

926
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,014
NOW I SEE WHY YOU LOVE
 THE MOUNTAINS.

927
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,751
EASIER TO FILTER OUT THE
   NOISE AND HEAR GOD'S
   VOICE.

928
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,754
(Car horn) 
 THEN AGAIN,

929
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,823
WHY RISK WIND SHEARS WHEN
YOU GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD
PARK

930
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:09,092
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM
THE OFFICE?

931
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,363
HOW'S THE READING COMING?

932
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,299
I CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FIRST
CHAPTER.

933
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:17,768
EVERY VERSE IS...

934
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,977
SO... YOU'RE NOT OUT
   JOB HUNTING?

935
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,346
NAH. I THINK I'M GOING TO TOUGH
IT OUT.

936
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:33,083
BESIDES, I THINK BLOOM MAY BE
LOOKING AT AN EARLY RETIREMENT

937
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,319
AFTER TONIGHT'S TOWN MEETING.

938
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,222
THOUGHT OF BECOMING A SPORTS
AGENT?

939
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,692
'CAUSE I KNOW AN OLD VET WHO CAN
STILL USE REPRESENTATION.

940
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:45,128
I'LL PRAY ABOUT IT.

941
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,164
REALLY?

942
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,768
YA, I'M TAKING SOME TIME TO
CLIMB THE RIGHT MOUNTAIN...

943
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,138
SEE WHAT GOD
REALLY WANTS FOR ME.

944
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,343
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW,
I TAKE 25%.

945
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,378
OH, FORGET IT.

946
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,320
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

947
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,389
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

948
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,693
CROSS CHECK!

949
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,196
(Boy) WELL, THERE'S NO CHECKING.

950
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:22,799
YOU'RE A GOALIE. NOW GO SIT IN
THE PENALTY BOX.

951
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,143
GET HER!

952
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,679
(Girl) CODY HARRIS SHOOTS!

953
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,183
SCORES!!

954
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,859
WHERE DO YOU THINK A KID GETS
THAT?

955
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,995
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF I
   EVER SEE HER AGAIN, SHE'S
   GOT A JOB.

956
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,730
YA, YOU'LL
REPRESENT HER, HUH?

957
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,198
YA, SHE'S YOUNG.

958
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,934
OH... HO, HO, HO.

959
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,304
FIND THE VERSE YET? YEAH, HERE
IT IS.

960
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:05,575
