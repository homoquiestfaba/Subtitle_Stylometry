1
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,193
Reporting to you live
from Lynwood County

2
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,895
where a chilling scene
has been discovered by police.

3
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,632
The bodies of four
family members were found
inside early this morning

4
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:42,503
in what police are describing
to be a brutal homicide.

5
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,506
We are collaborating
with various law
enforcement agencies

6
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,643
on a possible connection
to a previous set
of murders in Oakwood Glen.

7
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,219
Dozens of miniature
cameras were found
inside the property,

8
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,722
hidden in household objects
such as smoke detectors,

9
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,091
bookshelves
and light fixtures.

10
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:08,229
These killers are
broadcasting their crimes
as a live feed.

11
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,564
Viewers apparently had no idea

12
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,467
that what they were watching
was happening in real life.

13
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,236
I thought that it was fake.

14
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,605
You just don't expect
it to be real.

15
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,374
I kind of feel sick
to my stomach about it,
but it's still entertaining.

16
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:25,813
It appears that these victims
were given the opportunities
to defend themselves.

17
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,818
This played out like
some kind of deadly game.

18
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,988
The violence was
kind of overwhelming...

19
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,824
Gruesome and...
Graphic.

20
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,893
But it was okay in the moment
because it was
like a horror movie.

21
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,163
I was rooting for them.
I really didn't want
them to die.

22
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,299
The whereabouts of
a fifth family member

23
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,535
Marissa Vasquez
are unknown tonight

24
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,571
as authorities continue
to search for the young
woman missing

25
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,540
since the horrifying incident.

26
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,045
Our working theory is that
this feed is being transmitted
on a time delay.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,882
FEMALE REPORTER: These killers
are treating their broadcasts

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,684
like a Hollywood horror movie,

29
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,454
designed with one
chilling purpose...

30
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,991
...to entertain.

31
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,229
The question that remains
is will these killers
strike again?

32
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,130
And if so...

33
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,832
MAN:
How will they select
their victims?

34
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,703
JAMIE: I keep having this...

35
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,540
This nightmare.

36
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,810
It starts the same
every night.

37
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,812
There's, um...

38
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,381
There's a storm outside.

39
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,652
It's thunder and
lightning and...

40
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,590
I feel like I'm not alone.

41
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,893
Like someone's watching me.

42
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,897
MAN: Someone is watching you?
Who's watching you?

43
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,369
JAMIE: Her.
MAN: Your mother?

44
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,103
JAMIE: Well,
at first I just...

45
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,540
I feel her presence.

46
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,609
But when the lightning
flashes, I can see her.

47
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,911
She's laying on
the kitchen table.

48
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,717
And she's got
a shroud over her.

49
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,653
MAN: So what's happening
in Jamie's world?

50
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,823
JAMIE: And I can see
all these bugs,

51
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,861
these spiders and cockroaches,
and they're just...

52
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,363
I'm fine.

53
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,998
They're just eating
away at her.

54
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,835
MAN: Are you feeling scared?

55
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,606
No.

56
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:11,078
MAN: Those are
very scary images.

57
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:15,816
It's okay to be scared.
It's perfectly normal
to be scared.

58
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,918
Yeah.

59
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:25,659
MAN: Sometimes letting
yourself be vulnerable
makes you stronger.

60
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,966
So do you think your father
has dealt with his grief well?

61
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,302
JAMIE: No.

62
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:39,306
He came home one day
with this new girlfriend.

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,809
MAN: You must resent
him for that.

64
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,879
JAMIE: I don't resent him.
I resent her.

65
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,182
MAN: That's your
stepmother, Olivia.

66
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,452
How do you feel about Olivia?

67
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,555
JAMIE: She's so different
from my mom.

68
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,858
I barely survived the first
six months of their marriage.

69
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,497
Now, I gotta be stuck with her
on a whole ten-day vacation.

70
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,637
DJ: I told you, you should
have peed at the airport.

71
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,673
ADAM: I understand that.

72
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,518
It's not gonna be a problem.
I'm gonna take care of it.

73
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,952
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

74
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,754
Is there some maid you hired
I'm unaware of?

75
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,355
Coat on the rack,
suitcase out of the way.
Come on.

76
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,725
Wait, wait, wait. Steve.

77
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,159
JAMIE: Dad!
Let me explain.

78
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,895
JAMIE: You're shouting.
Let me explain.

79
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,032
I'm gonna get you the money.
You have my word.

80
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,568
The deposit should go
through any day now.

81
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,670
It's not like I'm trying
to fuck you over!

82
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,340
I'm not trying to give you
the runaround.

83
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,108
Look, I'm gonna work
something out here.

84
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,756
OLIVIA: DJ, no food!
It's almost 11:00.

85
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,560
I know you can hear me.

86
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,711
You've gotta be kidding me.

87
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,116
Look, you don't have
to threaten me.

88
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,720
Expect a check tomorrow
afternoon. Two days at most.

89
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,255
Okay, fine.

90
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,437
Is it a healthy
snack at least?
It's gluten-free.

91
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,007
Really?
Hey. What?

92
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,277
How do you eat this?
It's delicious.

93
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,613
OLIVIA: Ugh!

94
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,987
Something smells good.
You guys have a snack
without me?

95
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:19,026
JAMIE: Uh, what happened to
the wallpaper in my room?

96
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,897
ADAM: Just feeling it out.

97
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,566
We were gonna run it by you.

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,902
Um, but you didn't.

99
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,871
And you just went
into my room?

100
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,906
ADAM: Look, I really think
you're going to like it.

101
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,643
OLIVIA: Look,
I understand you're mad.

102
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,477
Of course, we were
gonna tell you first.

103
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:42,515
We just thought that we'd
find something that you liked.

104
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,620
JAMIE: Funny, because
I don't remember anybody
ever having a problem

105
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,690
with my wallpaper before.
Right, DJ?

106
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,427
Right, DJ?
Yeah. Totally.

107
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,029
I mean,

108
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,900
actually, that wallpaper
is kind of creepy.

109
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,510
Okay.
This is really uncool.

110
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,945
Jamie...

111
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,251
You told me you were
gonna ask her before
we tested the paint.

112
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,620
ADAM: I was going to,
and then I remembered
how she reacted

113
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,123
when I asked if
I could throw out her
Harry Styles posters.

114
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,992
OLIVIA: This is not
helping here.

115
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,027
I mean,
how'd she even see it?

116
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,862
Hey, Josh, it's me.
I've left you like
a thousand messages

117
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,865
so just call me back
when you get this.

118
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,914
DJ!

119
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,917
DJ!

120
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,286
DJ!

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,521
What?

122
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,292
My charger,
why did you take it?

123
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,061
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I have my own charger.

124
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,898
JAMIE: I don't
believe you.
Fine.

125
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,665
JAMIE: Wait!

126
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,602
So, you're not
screwing with me?

127
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,071
No. I'm being totally normal.

128
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,639
You should try it sometime.

129
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,742
JAMIE: Wait, Deej, wait.

130
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,513
I'm sorry.
Whatever.

131
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,048
Hey. Come on.

132
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,751
It's just you and me, right?

133
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,322
DJ: Sure.

134
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,259
OLIVIA: DJ,
take out the trash!

135
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,198
OLIVIA: Oh, my, God! Sorry.
I'm sorry.
JAMIE: Hey! Get out!

136
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,467
OLIVIA: Sorry.
JAMIE: Get out of here!

137
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,947
Cool.

138
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,032
You're gonna die!

139
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,899
Matt!

140
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,102
I'm sorry, dude.
You definitely frightened...

141
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,503
MATT: Uh, so, that
was too easy.

142
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,339
You were just like
a sitting duck, man.

143
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,974
How you doing?
DJ: I'm all right.

144
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,147
You survive Florida, my man?

145
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,151
Yeah. It was pretty boring.
Hot as hell.

146
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,453
I went to the beach,
went to dinner.

147
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,755
I'd rather be playing
Xbox, but...

148
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,060
Oh. It's on already?

149
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,827
Hell, yeah.
Okay, I'm getting my revenge.

150
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,497
DJ: Let's do this.
MATT: No, you can't
push it like that.

151
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,600
That is against the rules.
You can't do that, no!

152
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,971
You can't score.
DJ, I'm gonna kick your...

153
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,707
Hey, bro.
You staying a while?

154
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,411
I don't... Um...

155
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,116
Yeah, this...
It's kind of a long story.

156
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,652
Matt? It's 11:30 at night.

157
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,089
Wait, why didn't
you just call us at least?

158
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,392
I was going to call,
but Sheryl kind of

159
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,795
accidentally deliberately
threw my cell phone
in the toilet.

160
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,231
But he's gonna be out
of here in three days.

161
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,166
Tops. Three days tops.

162
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,469
Hi, Liv. How are you?
I'm good, thanks.
Thanks for asking.

163
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,605
OLIVIA: How you doing?
Oh, my God.

164
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,707
No way. You're too hot
for this guy.

165
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,975
This is stupid.
This just doesn't even work.

166
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,477
We got some pizza
in the freezer.
The two of you.

167
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,246
Go get some food.
Oh. Okay.

168
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,215
I'll set you up in the room.

169
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,418
Mmm.

170
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,406
JAMIE: Coming!

171
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,209
Yeah.

172
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,450
Hey, Killer. Hi.
Oh. Hey, there.

173
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,787
Now's not actually
a good time to talk.

174
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,223
MATT: No, no, no. No, no.

175
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,392
You're not getting
off that easy.

176
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,263
You gotta give me something.
Come on, it's me.

177
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,000
Catch me up.
I wanna know about
your life. Go.

178
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,402
Um...

179
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,571
Olivia's trying to
destroy my life.

180
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,506
Okay, first of all,
refined sugars,

181
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,341
that's what's
destroying your life.

182
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,678
Second of all,
Olivia is not scary at all.

183
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,247
If anything,
she's terrified of you.

184
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,083
Why would she be afraid of me?

185
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,387
'Cause you're a teenage girl.
Teenage girls are terrifying.

186
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,556
One look from a teenage girl

187
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,493
will send most men off...
You just did it.

188
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,994
You did the teenage girl look.

189
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,829
I'm terrified right now.

190
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,698
You see?

191
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,837
I just feel like...

192
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,574
Like I don't have a say
in anything, you know?
And it stresses me out.

193
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,445
MATT: It's good not to
have a say in things.
You just gotta chill.

194
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,848
Believe me, I know.
That's why I self-medicate.

195
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,819
Really?

196
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,655
It's for my glaucoma.
You know that.

197
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,593
All right, good talk, son.

198
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,129
You gotta get out
of this funk.

199
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,464
Come here.

200
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,799
JAMIE: Okay.

201
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,169
MATT: Do your homework
and eat more vegetables.

202
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,206
And, uh, drink
more water and exercise.

203
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,208
That's what
your Uncle Matt says.

204
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,244
It's really good.
It's really good.

205
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,960
He's my brother.
What am I supposed to do?

206
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,403
OLIVIA: You tuck him in.

207
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,814
ADAM: Hey, guys.
Look at the camera.

208
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,451
Look up at the
camera and smile.
JAMIE: What the...

209
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,453
ADAM: What do you think?
Is that a butterfly?

210
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,655
YOUNG JAMIE: A butterfly!
ADAM: A butterfly?

211
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,058
Did Mommy make
a big butterfly, too?

212
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,627
Great job too, Mommy.

213
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,531
Hey, I got your texts.
All 20,000 of them.

214
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,600
I was worried that on your way
home from the airport

215
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,668
you got trapped
under a burning car.

216
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:20,072
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, go for it.

217
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,415
Do you see us
staying together?

218
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,083
I mean, like,
past senior year.

219
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,488
Whoa. Yeah.

220
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,990
I mean, I think so. Do you?

221
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,826
Yeah.

222
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,997
Babe, what's going on?

223
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,468
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

224
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,036
Talk about what?

225
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,823
Babe, what's going on?

226
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,927
Do you think

227
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,665
even when people die

228
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,801
they could still judge you
for your mistakes?

229
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,870
Baby, are you talking
about your mom?

230
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,308
It's been six years.

231
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,811
All right? What would
she judge you for?

232
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,048
I gotta go.

233
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,685
Come on, I miss you,
and you're freaking me out.

234
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,756
Talk to me. Like,
did I do something?

235
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,925
Did I screw up?
Say something wrong?

236
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,162
No. No, it's not you.
I just...

237
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,067
Yeah, I gotta go.
Jame.

238
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:26,899
Does she know
I'm 35 grand deep?
No, I'd be a dead man.

239
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,436
Thirty five grand?
Look, don't...

240
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,740
Jesus, even the rich are poor.

241
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,876
Here, man, it sounds like
you need this more than I do.

242
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,048
Oh.

243
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,183
Oh, God, it's like
we're back in senior year.

244
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,854
Where'd you get
this shit anyway?

245
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,956
Same guy we got it
from in senior year.

246
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,825
No.
No, I'm not kidding, man.

247
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,027
Dirk, he's a lifer.
No.

248
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,564
All right, I'm going to arrive
around the corner. Watch out.

249
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,265
There's a guy right there.

250
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:02,935
What the hell?

251
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,505
Okay, sorry, I'm back, guys.

252
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,209
Oh, come on. That's bull crap.

253
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,219
Hey, Jame?

254
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,824
Yeah?

255
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,596
Just wanted to see
if you're okay.

256
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,601
Yeah, I'm okay.

257
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,005
Listen, I...

258
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,078
We shouldn't have
gone in your room
without your permission.

259
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,546
It was stupid of me.

260
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,285
I know this transition's
been rough.

261
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,623
And the last thing
you need is someone
invading your privacy.

262
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,934
All right. Good night.

263
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,608
JAMIE: Night, Dad.

264
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,286
Hey.

265
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,055
Five more minutes,
then the game goes off
and the teeth get brushed.

266
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,357
DJ: Can it be ten?
ADAM: Five.

267
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,337
Shit.

268
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,811
Maybe I've been trying
to change too much.

269
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,180
I'm just afraid I'm never
gonna connect with her.

270
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,315
Stop it.

271
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,819
You're just feeling
each other out.

272
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,791
Besides, you got lucky.

273
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,393
You missed the zombie years.

274
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,164
The piss, the shit,

275
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,632
the puke.

276
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,270
You took a shortcut to
the best parts of motherhood.

277
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:54,907
No.

278
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,181
What the fuck?

279
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,000
What the fuck?

280
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:07,313
Jesus!

281
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,949
What?

282
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,455
DJ?

283
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,881
MAN:
It's started.

284
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,075
Two to three minutes.

285
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,210
Yeah, okay.

286
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,242
I'm in here!

287
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,123
Hello?

288
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,140
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

289
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,310
I got it.

290
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,630
DJ: What's going on?
OLIVIA: Don't know,
I heard something.

291
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,732
DJ: Okay.
JAMIE: What's going on?

292
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,838
ADAM: Matt,

293
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,375
is that you?

294
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,579
JAMIE: What was that sound?

295
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,684
Matty?

296
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:22,754
Matt?

297
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,899
Call the police.
Okay.

298
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,170
JAMIE: Dad,
what was down there?

299
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,339
What did you see?

300
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,642
What are you getting?
It's okay.

301
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,545
Just hang back, guys, okay?

302
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,524
The phones are gone.

303
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,792
Okay, get back in the bedroom
and lock the door. Now.

304
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,161
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

305
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,664
Jamie! Jamie, come on!

306
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,668
Stay up here.
Listen to what your dad said.

307
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,636
Hello?

308
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,778
Matty?

309
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,621
Matty, if this is you,
it's not funny.

310
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,326
Shit.

311
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,547
Oh, shit.

312
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,577
Jesus Christ!

313
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,087
What the fuck?

314
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,659
Dad! Please
come back upstairs.

315
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,695
Jamie, go back upstairs.
Everything's gonna be okay.

316
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,131
Dad, please. Please,
come back upstairs.

317
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,767
ADAM: It's okay, sweetie.
Get back up there.

318
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,546
OLIVIA: I can't see anything.

319
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,585
DJ: What's going on
down there?

320
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,525
JAMIE: Dad...

321
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,492
Dad! Dad!

322
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,426
Adam! No!

323
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,997
Get off of him!

324
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,439
Get off of him, please!
JAMIE: Dad!

325
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,510
OLIVIA: Jamie, get back here!

326
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,145
Dad!

327
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,582
Come on, go, go, go!

328
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,785
JAMIE: We have to help him!

329
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,521
No, we have to help him!
OLIVIA: Jamie,
just come with us!

330
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:56,755
DJ: This way, we gotta go!
OLIVIA: Get in!

331
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,328
What do we do?
Lock the door. Look the door.

332
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,963
Help me. Come on.

333
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:29,855
Is it okay?

334
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,156
Oh, shit.

335
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,761
No! Hold it!

336
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,830
No!

337
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,499
No!

338
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,214
Is he gone?

339
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,087
Oh, my God.

340
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,861
DJ: Jamie.

341
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,156
OLIVIA: Check under the bed!
DJ: Jamie, I'm scared.

342
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,659
It's gonna be okay.
No, no, I'm just scared.

343
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,560
OLIVIA: Where are the phones?

344
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,295
JAMIE: What are you doing?
OLIVIA: Where the hell
are the phones?

345
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,164
JAMIE: We have to help him!
We wait for the...

346
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,866
The phones were right here.
Where are the phones?

347
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,167
We gotta go downstairs,
and we have to help him!

348
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,802
There's somebody downstairs.

349
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,470
Our only priority right now
is to get out of this house.

350
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,472
Do you understand?
JAMIE: How are we
gonna do that?

351
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:55,807
Check the windows. See if we
can get out through that side.

352
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,345
We can't jump.
It's way too high.

353
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,153
What is that
Back away. Back, back, back.

354
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:11,222
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.

355
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,329
BOTH: Help! Help us!

356
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:19,965
Help!

357
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,641
Help us! Somebody help!

358
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,315
DJ: What is it?
Nothing, nothing.

359
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,018
What
Get back, get back, get back!

360
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,927
Oh, my God.
JAMIE: What's that?

361
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,765
What is that?
What is happening?

362
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:56,067
You don't understand.

363
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,736
It's ridiculous. It's like...

364
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,838
Jamie

365
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,339
She treats me like a child,

366
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,275
but yet she's closer to my age
than to my dad's.

367
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,443
I don't know.

368
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,112
I don't know.

369
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,614
She's a total gold digger.
They were watching me...

370
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,349
And the grossest part is,

371
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,151
I think my little brother
has a crush on her.

372
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,087
What the hell is this?
I don't know. I don't know.

373
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:21,793
You know, my dad acts like
I'm the one with the problem.

374
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:24,696
But really, he's the one
in total denial.

375
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,965
What is this?

376
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,633
He's the one that's
responsible for all this.

377
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,535
Is this a prank between
you and your friends?

378
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,204
This isn't funny, Jamie!
No, I don't know
how they got these!

379
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,641
How'd it get on the screen?
I don't know. He's filming me!

380
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,043
Sometimes...

381
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,213
Sometimes, I wish it was him.

382
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:45,784
Oh!

383
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,218
Oh, no!

384
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,056
It's okay.
Oh, my God.

385
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,391
No!

386
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,960
Turn it off.

387
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,362
It's okay. It's okay.
Turn it off! Turn it off!

388
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,938
Who's doing this?
JAMIE: I don't know!

389
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:11,743
DJ: Jamie, I'm scared.
Okay. Okay, look...

390
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:13,144
All right. All right,
we just stay calm.

391
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,780
We're gonna get
out of this house.

392
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,282
Okay? Just help me look
for something sharp.

393
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,250
Something we can
protect ourselves with.

394
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,988
JAMIE: There's nothing here.

395
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,893
I can't find anything.

396
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,197
I can't find anything.
OLIVIA: Come on, keep looking.

397
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,769
DJ: I found something.

398
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,637
That's good.
Just hold on to it, okay?

399
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:43,408
Come on, Jamie, here.
We'll just take
the glass, okay?

400
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,677
All right, listen. Come here.
Listen to me.

401
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:49,881
We're gonna walk out
of that door right now. Okay?

402
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:51,883
Just stay together.
DJ: Are you sure?

403
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:54,285
Everyone's gonna be fine,
I promise.
Just stay together, okay?

404
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,720
You know what,
it's gonna be fine.

405
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,088
It's gonna be fine. Come on.

406
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,990
Come on.

407
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,192
Help me.

408
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,940
Stay together.
Yeah.

409
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,519
OLIVIA:
Nobody's here. It's just us.

410
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,968
What do we do?
I don't know.

411
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,870
Come on, stay together.
Come on.

412
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,273
I hear something.
Was that you?

413
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,843
JAMIE: My God. What is that?
DJ: What's what?

414
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,744
JAMIE: I hear something.
OLIVIA: It's okay.

415
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,147
Keep calm.

416
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:00,718
Do you hear that?
What is that?
I hear something.

417
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,287
OLIVIA: Just stay together.

418
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,860
What?

419
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:21,206
Someone is watching us.

420
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,640
My cell phone.

421
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,109
Wait, wait, wait!

422
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,980
Where is it? Shit.

423
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,840
Okay.

424
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:05,350
Jamie

425
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:06,952
What is that?

426
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,293
Where is it?

427
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,031
No, no, don't touch that!
Don't touch that.

428
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:22,500
Olivia, someone's
planning this.

429
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,146
"Kill or be killed."

430
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,316
They want us to fight back.

431
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,189
OLIVIA: Careful!

432
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,191
It works!

433
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,560
What do we do?

434
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,096
Oh...

435
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,102
OLIVIA: Oh, my God!

436
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:14,119
Just stay close, all right?

437
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,629
DJ: What is that?

438
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,498
It smells like gas.

439
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,230
Where's Jamie?

440
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:40,765
DJ: Jamie.

441
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,369
Jamie, come here.

442
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:47,138
Come on. Get down, dude.
Get down.

443
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,464
Run. Run!

00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:48,866
OLIVIA: Adam!
JAMIE: Dad!

445
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,768
DJ: Go! Go! Go!

446
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,272
OLIVIA: We can't get out!
We're trapped!

447
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,274
DJ: He's here. Run!

448
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:58,175
Go! Run!

449
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,447
No! No, back up!
JAMIE: Olivia!

450
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,682
Stay back! Get back
in the basement! Get back!

451
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,184
Olivia, come on,
hurry! Olivia!
Stay back!

00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:17,862
Okay, let me look.

OLIVIA: We need to
get out of here.

455
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,768
JAMIE: Somebody
could be in here.

456
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,135
No! No!

457
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:27,805
It's locked!

458
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,674
We have to try and find
a way out of here.

459
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,709
The windows!

460
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,281
Okay. Okay. Okay.
No...

461
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,450
Oh, my God.
No...

462
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,286
What are we gonna do?

463
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,621
Find something
to pry it open with.

464
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,509
OLIVIA: What

465
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:09,480
"What would she do?"

466
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,283
OLIVIA: Was
that your mother's?

467
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,328
Help me!

468
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,496
Damn it!

469
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,237

They're screwing with us.

498

00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,420
Are you all right?
Let's go, come on!

521
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:11,922
Josh, look behind you!

522
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,291
Why won't this stupid
door open? Jamie!

523
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:17,562
No!

524
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,196
No, Josh!

525
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,900
No!

526
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,706
Josh!

527
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,010
Josh!

528
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,815
Why are you doing this?

529
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,121
God damn you!

530
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,629
Leave us alone!

531
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,839
Help! Help us!

532
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:38,142
Why? Why...

533
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,353
Guys, there's another window.
There's another window.

534
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,728
Guys! Guys!
All right. All right. Come on.

535
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,599
Come on.

536
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,072
Olivia!
Wait.

537
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,775
It's okay.
JAMIE: Olivia, where
are you going?

538
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,284
Okay, listen to me.
All right. I want you
to be strong for me.

539
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,821
We locked ourselves in here.
They can't get in here, okay?

540
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,422
I'm gonna go outside
and find some help.

541
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,292
It's gonna be fine. It's safe.
Just wait here.

542
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:32,396
I promise, I'll come back.
Okay? I'll come back.

543
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,100
Olivia!

544
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,226
I'll come back
for you both.

545
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,061
I promise.

546
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,016
Are we gonna die?

547
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,727
I don't know.

548
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,462
Oh, my God, you're alive.
We have to...

549
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,497
Okay, wait, wait. Oh, God.
Get out of here.

550
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:52,502
OLIVIA: Come on.
Hurry. Hurry. Pry it off.

551
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,273
Run! Run!

552
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:59,910
Run! Get out!

553
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:40,284
OLIVIA: Wait! Help!

554
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,119
Help!

555
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:47,491
MAN: Come around back.

556
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,033
Hello?

557
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,217
Don't worry.

558
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,386
She made it out.
I know she did.

559
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:30,267
DJ, you can still go
to the bathroom.

560
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:35,472
Don't worry.
I'll keep a close watch.

561
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,442
Just go use the sink.

562
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:42,246
Okay.

563
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,972
DJ: Jamie?

564
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:47,611
Jamie.

565
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,181
Jamie,
the door's locked.

566
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:54,418
I can't get out.

567
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:58,488
Come on. Come on. Come on.

568
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:00,590
Jamie!

569
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,094
I can't open the door.

570
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:06,396
Jamie!

571
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,566
What's happening?

572
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:20,177
Jamie! Jamie! Help!

573
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,546
Shit.

574
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,168
Who are you?

575
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,827
JAMIE: Fuck.
DJ: You okay?

576
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:50,660
Okay. Come on.

577
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:24,828
Jamie. Your arm.
Come here.

578
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,928
JAMIE: What is that?

579
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,664
JAMIE:
I keep having this nightmare.

580
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,335
It starts the same
every night.

581
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,136
There's a storm outside.

582
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,906
It's thunder and
lightning and...
Stay here.

583
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,343
Then I get this feeling...

584
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,978
That someone's watching me.

585
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:52,549
When the lightning flashes,
I can see her.

586
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:55,151
She's laying on
the kitchen table...

587
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:00,657
And she's got
a shroud over her...

588
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:04,828
And I can see all these bugs,

589
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:09,366
these spiders and cockroaches,
and they're just...

590
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,035
Eating away at her.

591
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,282
What is it?

592
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,455
Olivia. No.

593
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:36,760
What is it?

594
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,263
Nothing.
It's just a mannequin.

595
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,532
They're just trying
to scare us.

596
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:29,379
It's my nightmare.

597
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:44,694
DJ, run!

598
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:47,096
Come on! Let's go.

599
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,502
It's okay. Don't look.
Come on, go.

600
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,486
Is he going to find us?

601
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:16,960
Yes.

602
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,634
Stay here.

603
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,583
Who are you?

604
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:01,625
Why are you doing this?

605
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:07,664
MAN:
Because it's fun for them.

606
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,267
Fun for who?

607
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:14,938
The people watching.

608
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:20,777
Just tell me what you want.

609
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,812
To cut you open

610
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:27,083
and see what's inside you.

611
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:31,621
We've been watching
you a long time.

612
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:34,724
We know your darkest
thoughts, Jamie.

613
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:38,862
We see the anger
you hold back.

614
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,331
For your mother. Your father.

615
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,303
You used that to stay alive.

616
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:51,941
And now we all want to see
how far that will take you.

617
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:55,679
There's a shock value to that
that's endlessly entertaining.

618
01:16:55,812 --> 01:16:56,913
I couldn't help it.

619
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,848
I had to know how it ended.

620
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:01,317
Use this gift, Jamie.

621
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,322
The only way you're going
to survive is if you become

622
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,892
the darkness inside you.

623
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:15,832
Please, whoever's
watching this,

624
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:19,102
please help us!
We live at 2-1...

625
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,239
...Lane.

626
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,959
Remember when you asked me
if we were gonna die?

627
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:48,097
And I said I didn't know.
Yeah.

628
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:51,968
I do know.

629
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:57,774
The only other person who's
gonna die here tonight...

630
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,211
Is him.

631
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,582
Listen to me.
No, Jamie.

632
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,718
DJ, you have to trust me.
No.

633
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:11,120
It's okay. So this
is what we're gonna do.

634
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:41,845
Get the fuck out of our house.

635
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:56,325
DJ, now!

636
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,834
Come on, go on!

637
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,870
DJ!

638
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,460
JAMIE: Get off of me!

639
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,043
DJ: Jamie!

640
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,178
Get off of her!

641
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,514
Jamie!

642
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:02,258
Jamie! No!

643
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:19,008
Burn in hell, fucker!

644
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,984
Okay, DJ, help me. Come on!

645
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:41,297
Come on! DJ, let's go!

646
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,545
DJ: Come on, Jamie, come on.

647
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:58,614
We're almost there.
I can't keep going.

648
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,250
I don't think anyone's coming.
It's okay. Come on.

649
01:22:01,384 --> 01:22:03,886
I can't do it.
All right, come on.

650
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,489
Come on, Jamie.

651
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:08,224
Hey! Hey!

652
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,358
Stop!

653
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,695
Come on. Hey!

654
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,265
Come here! No! Stop!
Please!

655
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:27,443
Get off!

656
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:30,213
DJ, look out!

657
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,354
No, please! Jamie!

658
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,563
DJ! DJ, are you okay?

659
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:49,999
I'm fine. I'm fine.

660
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,272
Leave us alone!

661
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,841
Why are you doing this to us?

662
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,110
Why are you doing this to us?

663
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:03,546
Why are you doing this to us?

664
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,591
Why are you doing this to me?

665
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,794
MAN:
The rules have always
been very simple.

666
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:21,030
What is this?

667
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:25,034
MAN:
Kill or be killed.

668
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:45,388
It's your turn now, Jamie.

669
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,625
We're not going
to hurt your brother...

670
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:55,331
As long as you do exactly
what I tell you.

671
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,800
Don't listen to him, Jamie.

672
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:02,205
You will provide
the excitement

673
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:05,274
for our next family, Jamie.

674
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,482
You will give the audience
the reason...

675
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:22,158
...to keep watching.
