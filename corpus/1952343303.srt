1
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,225
- YOU HAVE IT?

2
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,559
- GIVE ME.

3
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,961
- NOT UNTIL I SEE IT.

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,231
- NOW.
I HAVE TO...GET RID OF IT.

5
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,000
- I'VE MET TOO MANY CHARLATANS
SINCE OUR ARRIVAL HERE,

6
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,468
AND MANY KNIGHTS
HAVE BEEN TRICKED

7
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,571
INTO TAKING FALSE RELICS
TO THE HOLY SEE.

8
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,440
I WON'T BE ONE OF THEM.

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,487
STAY HERE, SIR RAYMOND.
STAND GUARD.

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,822
- YES, SIR.

11
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,669
- IT'S IN THERE.

12
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,853
- IF THIS IS A GENUINE
PIECE OF THE CROSS,

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,721
THEN IT IS NOT
FOR US TO TOUCH.

14
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,525
- COULD IT BE?

15
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,729
- <i>VENI, VENI</i>
<i>SANCTE SPIRITUS...</i>

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,533
...AMEN.

17
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,872
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST!

18
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,289
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
- GOOD.

19
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,925
TAKE IT AWAY.
QUICK.

20
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,994
- BLESS YOU, MY SON.

21
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,447
- WELL, IS IT?

22
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,951
- IT IS A TRUE RELIC.

23
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,853
A REAL PIECE
OF THE LORD'S CROSS.

24
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,289
- YOU COULD FEEL THE HOLY
SPIRIT POURING FROM IT.

25
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,825
- WE HAVE
FINALLY SOMETHING

26
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,761
TO MAKE THIS CRUSADE
WORTH THE FIGHT.

27
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,299
LET'S GO.

28
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,992
- WORD HAS SPREAD ABOUT
OUR FIND, SIR GREGORY.

29
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,697
- AND THEY SAY
A PIECE OF THE CRUCIFIX

30
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,598
IS AS PRECIOUS
AS THE HOLY GRAIL.

31
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,768
- I SAW SOME RED FACES
IN TANCRED'S COURT

32
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,537
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS.

33
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,506
HE FEELS HE WAS BEATEN
TO THE ULTIMATE PRIZE.

34
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,275
- WELL,
AS WELL HE MIGHT.

35
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,910
WHEN WE BRING
THIS BEFORE THE HOLY SEE,

36
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,545
THERE'LL BE PRAISE INDEED.
YOU'LL BE A HERO.

37
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,415
- A HERO?

38
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,851
I'M MORE CONCERNED AT
HOW THESE NIGHTS GROW COLDER.

39
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,887
- THE WEATHER IS TURNING.

40
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,323
PERHAPS NOW IS THE BEST TIME
FOR US TO LEAVE.

41
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,625
- WHEN WAS THE BEST
TIME TO ARRIVE?

42
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,829
- THE CRUSADE WAS
WORTH ALL THE SACRIFICE.

43
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,831
DON'T YOU THINK, BROTHER GEORGE?
- OF COURSE.

44
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,399
- THINK OF ALL
THE GLORY YOU'D HAVE MISSED

45
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,967
HAD WE ARRIVED ANY LATER.

46
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,473
- WHAT GLORY WAS THERE
IN THIS BLOODSHED?

47
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,475
- PERHAPS YOU FORGET
IT WAS THE GLORY OF GOD.

48
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,810
- GOD HAD NO WISH FOR THIS.

49
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,213
THIS WAS THE GREED OF MAN.

50
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,848
- BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU SAY, MY LORD.

51
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,283
THAT COULD BE
CONSTRUED AS BLASPHEMY.

52
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,219
- YOU WERE AT THE COUNCIL
OF CLERMONT, AS WAS I.

53
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,787
EMPEROR KOMNENOS
ASKED FOR OUR HELP,

54
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,955
AND WE WERE
READY TO GIVE IT.

55
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,523
- CLERMONT WAS
A COUNCIL OF WARMONGERS.

56
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,091
I SEE THAT NOW.
- YOU NEEDN'T SPILL TEARS

57
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,459
OVER THOSE WHO HAVE SLAIN.

58
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,862
THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY GOT.

59
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,732
AND NOW WE HAVE
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,567
AS IT SHOULD BE.

61
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,236
- WHAT WOULD
YOU SPILL TEARS OVER?

62
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,037
- I SPILL THEM
OVER SLEEPING ALONE.

63
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,808
- FOR ME, IT'S SPENDING
ANOTHER NIGHT IN THIS COLD CAMP

64
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,610
WHILE MY LANDS ARE
PROBABLY BEING PLUNDERED

65
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,513
BY THE THIEVING BASTARDS
I LEFT TO LOOK AFTER THEM.

66
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,016
WHEN CAN THE REST OF US
SEE THIS TREASURE?

67
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,085
- AN ARTIFACT
OF THIS MAGNITUDE

68
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,554
SHOULD ONLY BE FOR THE EYES
OF THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF.

69
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,756
HE SHALL DECIDE WHO
IS FIT TO GAZE UPON IT.

70
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,097
I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME.

71
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,667
TOMORROW,
WE LEAVE FOR JAFFA.

72
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,769
FROM THERE,
WE TAKE A SHIP TO ROME.

73
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,938
WE PRESENT OUR GIFT,
AND THEN...

74
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,675
FINALLY...WE GO HOME.

75
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,012
- YES!

76
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,316
THAT'S A SIGN
FOR MORE MEAD, LADS.

77
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,409
- THIS FOR
YOUR THANKS, CAPTAIN.

78
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,478
- I THINK WE'LL HAVE A SMOOTH
PASSAGE FOR YOU, MY LORD.

79
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,914
OH, OOPS.

80
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,651
YOUR BACKSIDE'S TOO USED TO
FINE WINES AND LAZY HORSES, EH?

81
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,721
- AND MY BLADE IS
USED TO INSOLENT TONGUES.

82
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,322
- OH, I'M SURE IT IS.

83
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,158
AND ME, BEING A GOD-FEARING MAN,
WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

84
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,493
FATHER.
- IT'S BROTHER.

85
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,429
- CAREFUL THERE.
- YES, MY LORD.

86
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,269
- WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

87
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,070
- I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

88
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,472
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
NOT FOR YOUR EYES.

89
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,439
- MAYBE NOW YOU'D ALLOW ME
TO BRING YOU A CLEAN TUNIC.

90
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,007
YOU SMELL WORSE
THAN THE CAPTAIN.

91
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,878
- YOU KNOW MY VOW.

92
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,547
NOT UNTIL
I REACH MY OWN BED.

93
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,050
- AT LEAST NOW I CAN
FINALLY SEE THAT HAPPENING.

94
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,354
I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET BACK HOME.

95
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,023
- ME TOO.

96
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,560
AND THEN WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT YOUR STATUS AS SQUIRE.

97
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,230
I'M SURE YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE PROUD TO KNOW

98
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,333
HOW BRAVELY YOU
FOUGHT ALONGSIDE ME.

99
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,435
YOU FOUGHT AS A KNIGHT.

100
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,972
I WONDER WHAT
THE GIRLS BACK HOME

101
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,240
WOULD SAY ABOUT SIR PAUL.

102
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,570
- THE GOSPEL IS TAKEN
FROM MARK, CHAPTER FOUR,

103
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,972
BEGINNING
WITH THE 39TH VERSE.

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,274
<i>ET EXSURGENS COMMINATUS</i>
<i>EST VENTO</i>

105
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,543
<i>ET DIXIT</i>
<i>MARI TACE OBMUTESCE...</i>

106
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,646
- DID YOU SEE IT?
THE RELIC.

107
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,748
- NO, I WAS OUTSIDE.

108
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,350
- WHY SUCH SECRECY?

109
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,719
- WE'RE TRYING
TO PRESERVE ITS SANCTITY.

110
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,554
- PRESERVE?
PRESERVE IT FROM WHO?

111
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,456
AREN'T WE HONORABLE KNIGHTS?

112
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,460
- WE'LL SEE IT SOON ENOUGH.

113
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,631
<i>- ...QUIA ET VENTUS</i>
<i>ET MARE OBOEDIUNT EI.</i>

114
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,167
<i>IN NOMINE PATRI, ET FILII,</i>
<i>ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. AMEN.</i>

115
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,795
- CAPTAIN!
THE WATER IS RUINED TOO!

116
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,598
- WHAT IN GOD'S NAME?

117
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,566
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

118
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,902
- HERE. TASTE.

119
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,244
- OH, IT'S SALT WATER.

120
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,478
- ALL OF IT IS.

121
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,247
BUT THE WATER
WAS FRESH LAST NIGHT.

122
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,349
- A WAVE MUST'VE WASHED OVER
AND SPOILED IT.

123
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,717
- IMPOSSIBLE!

124
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,485
EVEN THE BARRELS THAT
WEREN'T OPEN ARE RUINED!

125
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,687
AND THIS?

126
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,362
- BUT WE ATE WELL
LAST NIGHT.

127
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,099
- IT'S ALL INFESTED.
WE HAVE NOTHING.

128
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,268
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.

129
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,604
MY MEN ARE TALKING--
WHISPERING EVIL THINGS.

130
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,339
THEY TALK OF A CURSE--

131
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,875
AN EVIL YOU
HAVE BROUGHT UPON US.

132
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,678
- AR--I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CREW'S CONCERN,

133
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,847
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS
BEEN SOME MISFORTUNE HERE.

134
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,682
BUT NOT A CURSE.

135
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,118
WE ARE CRUSADERS.

136
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,486
WE FOUGHT
WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE.

137
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,455
THEN WHY IS GOD PUNISHING US?

138
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,059
MAYBE YOUR PRECIOUS WAR
WAS LESS THAN HOLY.

139
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,695
- CAPTAIN!
STARBOARD!

140
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,937
- HEY, HEY,
HARD TO PORT!

141
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,806
WE HAVE TO RIDE OUT
THIS SQUALL.

142
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,108
STOW THE SAILS!
THEY'LL BE RIPPED TO PIECES!

143
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,010
- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?

144
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,112
- YOU CAN HELP BY
KEEPING OUT OF OUR WAY.

145
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,248
GET BELOW DECKS
AND TIE EVERYTHING DOWN,

146
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,749
INCLUDING YOURSELVES.

147
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,252
AND YOU CAN PRAY
FOR OUR LIVES!

148
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,438
- AHH!

149
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,290
- AH!

150
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,915
- THANK GOD.

151
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,149
WHERE'S THE CREW?

152
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,752
- SWEPT OVERBOARD.

153
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,188
- THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT WE SURVIVED.

154
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,723
- IT WAS THE WILL OF GOD.

155
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,858
- OH, I MUST'VE BLACKED OUT.

156
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,426
I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE.

157
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,795
- NEVER SEEN A STORM
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

158
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,132
- IT RAGED FOR TWO HOURS
OR MORE, AND THEN SILENCE.

159
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,667
- AND THEN THIS DAMNED FOG.

160
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,402
- NOT ONLY ARE
WE NOW OFF COURSE,

161
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,903
WE HAVE NO MEANS
TO FIND A PORT.

162
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,940
- THAT TEMPEST COULD'VE BLOWN US
ANYWHERE IN CHRISTENDOM.

163
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,274
- LAND!

164
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,834
- WHERE'S THE SHIP?

165
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,075
- WELL, LET'S
NOT STAND AROUND HERE.

166
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,444
WE'LL CATCH OUR DEATH
FROM THE COLD.

167
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,280
THERE MIGHT BE
WARMTH AND FOOD FURTHER ON.

168
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,956
- I THINK WE SHOULD
STOP AND PRAY FOR GUIDANCE.

169
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,060
- OR WE COULD CONTINUE
WALKING AND FIND SOME.

170
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,529
- I WONDER WHY THE CRUSADE
HAS STRENGTHENED THE FAITH

171
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,297
OF EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU.

172
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,200
- WELL, MAYBE I WAS THE ONLY
ONE FIGHTING WITH MY EYES OPEN.

173
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,571
SHH, SHH, SHH.
LISTEN, WHAT'S THAT?

174
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,376
STAY.
GUARD THE RELIQUARY.

175
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,511
COME ON.

176
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,784
- IF YOU INSIST.

177
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,964
- BLITHERING BARBARIANS!

178
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,132
- ROBERT!
NO, NO!

179
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,039
- AH!

180
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,476
AH!

181
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,781
AH.

182
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,855
- AH! AH.

183
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,390
- BANDITS.

184
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,076
- AH!

185
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,945
- THE TURKS
ARE ON OUR SIDE.

186
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:49,827
- AH--UGH.

187
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,225
- YOU FIGHT LIKE A KING.

188
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,661
- YOU KNEEL WHEN
YOU SPEAK TO A KNIGHT, DOG.

189
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,795
- SIR ROBERT!

190
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,864
CRUSADES ARE OVER.

191
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,134
SURELY THAT MEANS THAT
WE CAN ALL BE FRIENDS NOW.

192
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,069
- MY THOUGHTS TOO.

193
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,807
WE HAVE BEEN HUNTING
THESE...BANDITS

194
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,111
EVER SINCE THEY PILLAGED
SEVERAL MOSQUES.

195
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,646
WHEN THEY ATTACKED
THESE PILGRIMS,

196
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,282
WE COULD NOT STAND ASIDE IDLY
AS AN INJUSTICE WAS COMMITTED.

197
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,616
- YOU LIE.

198
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,119
- IT IS TRUE, MY LORD.

199
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,454
THE TURKS
FOUGHT TO SAVE US.

200
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,957
WE ARE THE ONLY TWO
WHO SURVIVED.

201
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,361
- THE TURK'S NAME
IS HASAN.

202
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,467
MY WIFE, SAFA.

203
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,102
OUR FRIEND, ALEM.

204
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,604
- YOU WILL BE
REWARDED FOR YOUR--

205
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,507
- WE DID NOT DO IT
FOR A REWARD.

206
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,009
AND AS I SEE IT,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

207
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,711
TWICE.

208
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,013
THE FIRST IS MY REWARD.

209
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,116
AND THE SECOND...A DEBT
OF HONOR THAT I OWE YOU.

210
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,753
WE WILL TRAVEL
THESE LANDS WITH YOU

211
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,255
UNTIL I CAN
REPAY SUCH A DEBT.

212
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,926
- YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY WANT
THESE SAVAGES TO TRAVEL WITH US.

213
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:33,164
- FIND BROTHER GEORGE.
TELL HIM TO TEND TO THE WOUND.

214
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,303
THESE PILGRIMS WILL TRAVEL
WITH US UNTIL THEY FIND SAFETY.

215
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,548
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

216
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,150
- PERHAPS YOU ARE A MAN OF PEACE
AS WELL AS A MAN OF WAR.

217
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,956
- AH, SIR ROBERT...

218
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,658
I TAKE IT YOU
NO LONGER DISAPPROVE

219
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,892
NOW WE HAVE HORSES?

220
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,366
- WOULD YOU LISTEN
TO ME IF I DID?

221
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,801
OF COURSE NOT.

222
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,571
- WHAT TREASURE
DO YOU CARRY?

223
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,340
- IT IS A GIFT
FOR THE HOLY FATHER.

224
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,844
- A TROPHY
FROM THE CRUSADES?

225
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,718
ANIMALS SENSE THINGS
WE CANNOT.

226
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,122
REAL POWER
FROM PERCEIVED POWER.

227
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:35,760
REAL VICTORY
FROM PERCEIVED VICTORY.

228
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,897
I FEAR THIS CRUSADE
WILL NOT BE THE LAST.

229
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,334
- AFTER WHAT I'VE WITNESSED,
I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

230
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,932
- I WONDER WHY YOU ARE
SO KEEN TO RETURN HOME.

231
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,435
DID YOU NOT FIND
THE GLORY YOU SOUGHT?

232
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,837
- THERE WAS NO GLORY.

233
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,708
- FIGHTING FOR GOD
IS GLORY ENOUGH.

234
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,509
- I USED TO THINK SO.

235
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,211
- AND NOW?

236
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,048
- MAN BEGETS THE EVILS
OF THIS WORLD.

237
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,350
NOT GOD.

238
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,954
- AND IS YOUR LOSS OF FAITH

239
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,423
THE REASON YOU DRESS
LIKE A FILTHY PIG?

240
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,033
I ONCE LED
100 MEN-AT-ARMS.

241
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,869
WHAT YOU SEE HERE...

242
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,039
IS ALL THAT'S LEFT.

243
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,208
TO WASH MY HANDS
OF THAT BLOOD...

244
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,511
WOULD BE LIKE PONTIUS PILATE
WASHING HIS HANDS.

245
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,983
I'M NOT YET READY
FOR MY ABSOLUTION.

246
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,115
- ALL OF THIS IS
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE...

247
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,359
YOUR SHIP BEACHED HERE.

248
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,163
FROM HERE, WE SHOULD
GO INTO CONSTANTINOPLE,

249
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,399
AND FROM THERE,
YOU CAN CARRY ON TO ROME.

250
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,135
- THAT IS A LONG WAY AROUND.
WHY NOT GO WEST?

251
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,472
- BECAUSE THAT WAY, YOU WOULD
HAVE TO CROSS THE SEA TWICE.

252
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,974
AND...

253
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,511
AFTER YOUR
RECENT EXPERIENCE,

254
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,080
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WOULD PREFER TO STAY DRY.

255
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,582
- SO WE
FOLLOW YOU BLINDLY?

256
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,785
- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
OWN BLIND PATH IF YOU PREFER.

257
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,620
- CAREFUL HOW YOU SPEAK TO ME.

258
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,355
- WHY SHOULD SHE
WATCH HER MOUTH

259
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,458
AROUND SUCH
AN UNGALLANT KNIGHT?

260
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,227
- A KNIGHT WHO HAS A SERF
LIKE YOU UNDER HIS PROTECTION.

261
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,995
YOU SHOULD BE
THANKFUL FOR THAT.

262
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,198
I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF.

263
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,768
- YOU HAVE COURAGE.

264
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,003
IT IS A FINE
QUALITY TO HAVE.

265
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,439
- SOMETHING I INHERITED
FROM MY FATHER.

266
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,109
HE WAS A BLACKSMITH.

267
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,513
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SURVIVE
IN AN UNJUST WORLD.

268
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,483
- THE WORLD IS
NOT UNJUST, MY CHILD.

269
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,384
GOD IS EVERYWHERE.

270
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,889
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

271
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,592
- THAT IS BLASPHEMY.

272
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,328
- IF THERE IS A GOD,

273
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,463
WHY DID HE
KILL MY FATHER...

274
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,398
AND HAVE ME INDENTURED
TO A SPOILED LORD

275
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,067
WHO DRAGGED ME
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

276
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,337
ON A PILGRIMAGE
I HAVE NO BELIEF IN?

277
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,705
WHERE'S THE SENSE
IN THAT?

278
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,306
- THERE ARE PUNISHMENTS
FOR WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID.

279
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,543
- YOUR GOD PUNISHES THOSE
WHO DO NOT BELIEVE?

280
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,479
<i>ALLAH SUBHAN-ALLAH</i>
IS MORE MERCIFUL THAN THAT.

281
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,715
- DON'T GET ME
STARTED ON YOU, HEATHEN!

282
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,386
- THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS
IN THIS CAMP.

283
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,128
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE.

284
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:43,040
I THINK NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME FOR US TO SLEEP.

285
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,009
MY KNIGHTS WILL KEEP WATCH.

286
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,790
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S
ALL WE COULD SPARE.

287
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,559
BUT IT'S NICE AND WARM.

288
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,961
AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T PUT
YOU TO SLEEP LIKE THE LAST TIME.

289
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,863
- THANK YOU.

290
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,267
COLD'S BITING WORSE
THAN EVER TONIGHT.

291
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,198
- NO SIGN?
- NO.

292
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,933
- THE RELIC WAS SAFE.

293
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,168
- WHY WOULD THIEVES
NOT TAKE IT?

294
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,703
- WE TRACKED
THE KNIGHT'S FOOTSTEPS.

295
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,639
THEY JUST VANISH.

296
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,340
- MUST'VE BEEN AN AMBUSH.

297
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,410
- YOU MISHEARD ME,
I SAID THEY VANISH.

298
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,846
HE DID NOT
TAKE ANOTHER STEP.

299
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,583
THIS IS NOT
THE WORK OF...NORMAL MEN.

300
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,585
- THE HASHSHASHIN
WALK THESE LANDS.

301
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,886
THEY ARE MURDERERS
AND THIEVES.

302
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,188
- EVEN THE HASHSHASHIN
LEAVE A TRACE.

303
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,657
- THEN IT IS
THE DEVIL'S WORK.

304
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,494
- THERE IS
NO MORE WE CAN DO.

305
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,296
WE MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE
AND MOVE ON.

306
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,213
- YOU SHOULD PLACE A BRIDLE
OVER THE FRIAR'S MOUTH.

307
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,582
HE'S SCARING THE OTHERS WITH
ALL THIS TALK OF THE DEVIL.

308
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,317
- IS HE SCARING YOU?

309
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,688
- IF GOD DOESN'T EXIST,
THEN NEITHER DOES THE DEVIL.

310
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,257
I'M ONLY AFRAID OF
THE EVIL IN MEN'S HEARTS.

311
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,659
NOT IN THEIR MINDS.

312
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,062
YOU KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE.

313
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,031
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU DO EITHER, MY LORD.

314
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,267
- OH, NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

315
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,103
- IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.

316
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,823
- CUT THEM DOWN.

317
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,095
CUT THEM DOWN.

318
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,569
- THIS IS EVIL,
I TELL YOU.

319
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,671
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME
FOR SCAREMONGERING!

320
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,707
- THE FOOD ON THE BOAT,
THE STORM, THE BANDITS,

321
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,176
AND NOW THIS--IT'S THE
DEVIL'S WORK, AND YOU KNOW IT.

322
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,278
SATAN IS TRYING
TO DESTROY THE CROSS!

323
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,581
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

324
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,484
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO?

325
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,891
BURY THEM BOTH.

326
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,238
- I AGREE
WITH YOUR PRIEST.

327
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:38,008
THIS PLACE IS...EVIL.

328
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,312
- WE SHOULD LEAVE HERE.
- WAIT, WAIT.

329
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,350
NOBODY LEAVES UNTIL
THE DEAD ARE BURIED.

330
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,027
- I AM A NATIVE
TO THIS LAND.

331
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,196
NO, NOT JUST A NATIVE.
MORE THAN A NATIVE.

332
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,865
I KNOW THIS LAND
CORNER FROM CORNER.

333
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,433
AND YET,
IN ALL MY LIFE,

334
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,536
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THINGS
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

335
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,171
MAYBE YOUR PRIEST
IS RIGHT.

336
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,107
MAYBE THERE IS EVIL
IN THIS PLACE.

337
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,780
AH!

338
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,915
- BROTHER GEORGE.

339
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,852
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

340
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,990
- BLESS US NOW.

341
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,228
- I HAVE MIXED THE HERB
IN THE WATER TO NUMB THE PAIN.

342
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,730
YOUR LEG
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

343
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,465
IT WILL NEED BINDING.

344
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,837
- THE CROSS OF CHRIST?

345
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,242
PART OF IT, YES.

346
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,812
- NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHY BAD LUCK FOLLOWS YOU.

347
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,616
YOURS IS A PRIZE EVIL
FINDS WORTHY OF DESTRUCTION.

348
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,185
- ALL THE MORE REASON
TO GET IT SAFELY TO ROME.

349
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,687
SIR ROBERT, I WANT YOU
TO GUARD THE RELIQUARY.

350
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,089
MAKE SURE
NO ONE TOUCHES IT.

351
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,964
- THANK YOU.

352
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,570
- SOMETHING PUZZLES ME.

353
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,173
YOU'RE CARRYING
A RELIC THAT YOU BELIEVE

354
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,910
TO BE A PIECE
OF CHRIST'S CROSS.

355
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,746
AND YOU ACCEPT
THAT TO BE REAL?

356
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,614
AS MUSLIMS?

357
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,918
- THE KORAN SPEAKS
OF JESUS AS A PROPHET.

358
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,853
- YOU BELIEVE IN HIM TOO?

359
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,321
- OF COURSE.

360
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,822
ALTHOUGH
THERE IS SOME DEBATE

361
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,891
AS TO WHETHER
HE DIED ON THE CROSS.

362
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,128
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU FIGHT FOR SIMILAR BELIEFS.

363
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,863
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

364
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,865
- WE ARE NOT FIGHTING NOW.

365
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,600
- AND YOU?

366
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,303
YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.

367
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,071
SO IS THE CASKET EMPTY?

368
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,640
OR DOES IT JUST
CONTAIN A PIECE OF WOOD?

369
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,311
- MAYBE THERE WAS
A MAN CALLED JESUS.

370
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,179
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.

371
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,381
BUT AS THE SON OF GOD?

372
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,351
OR EVEN AS
THE PROPHET OF GOD?

373
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,819
NO.

374
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,822
IT'S JUST A STORY.

375
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,792
- THEN THAT
IS YOUR OWN BELIEF.

376
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,328
I WONDER...

377
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,629
WHO IS RIGHT?

378
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,090
MM. EH.

379
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,439
- EVERYONE,
GRAB A TORCH.

380
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,751
ROBERT!

381
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,486
- THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER.

382
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,492
- ROBERT!

383
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,102
- EH, EH, EH.
- OH!

384
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,037
- HA! HA!

385
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,006
- HAY-YA!

386
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,843
- AH!

387
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,165
- ARE THEY GONE?

388
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,667
- I THINK SO.

389
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,269
AND SO ARE THE HORSES.

390
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,212
- ROBERT?

391
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,148
ROBERT, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

392
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,687
- AH.
- WE NEED A HEALER.

393
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,355
- SAFA!

394
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,626
- AH!
- LOOK!

395
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,862
- AH, HE'S IN FEVER.

396
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,296
I NEED COLD WATER
AND PLANTS.

397
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,832
ALEM, BRING BORAGE
AND MOUNTAIN BALM.

398
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,068
THERE MIGHT
BE MORE INSIDE.

399
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,071
- IS YOUR PRIZE
WORTH THIS SACRIFICE?

400
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,974
- WE CAN'T ALLOW
ANY DARK FORCES TO WIN.

401
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,209
- I AGREE.

402
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,777
OUR GODS
MAY BE DIFFERENT,

403
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,213
BUT OUR ENEMY
IS THE SAME.

404
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,382
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

405
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,293
- WE NEED TO FIND
SOME WISE COUNSEL.

406
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,496
SOME HOLY GROUND.

407
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,533
- THERE IS A--
A MONASTERY NORTH OF HERE.

408
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,501
A DAY'S MARCH ON FOOT.

409
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,004
IS--IS THAT SACRED ENOUGH?

410
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,408
THANK YOU, HASAN.

411
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,885
- HIS FEVER IS EASING.

412
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,621
YOU HAVE
A PRECIOUS SKILL.

413
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,035
- CAN YOU SPEAK?

414
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,403
- I, UH...

415
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,574
- YOUR NAME WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO START.

416
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,343
- PAUL.
- SQUIRE PAUL?

417
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,679
- SOON TO BE A KNIGHT...
WHEN WE RETURN HOME.

418
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,113
- LIKE SIR GREGORY.

419
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,584
- THE MEN ARE STARVING.

420
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,019
AND MY STOMACH
IS COMPLAINING TOO.

421
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,088
- THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE
TO HUNT DOWN HERE.

422
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,391
IT WILL HAVE TO COMPLAIN
A LITTLE LONGER.

423
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,927
- LOOK, WE CANNOT
AFFORD TO BE WEAK...

424
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,929
IF WE ARE
ATTACKED AGAIN.

425
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,532
- THAT KIND OF TALK
CAUSES PANIC, ARTHUR.

426
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,172
- OUR FORTUNE HAS CHANGED.

427
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,274
A FARM.

428
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,102
- GREETINGS.

429
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,403
I AM SIR GREGORY.

430
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,139
- YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM THE WAR, MY LORD.

431
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,642
- WE ARE
HEADING TO ROME.

432
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,645
- THEN YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM ROME, MY LORD.

433
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,083
WE...WE HAVE
TRAVELED FAR WITHOUT FOOD.

434
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,585
WE ARE VERY HUNGRY.

435
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,355
IF YOU HAVE ANY TO SPARE,
WE WOULD BE MOST GRATEFUL.

436
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,891
- FOR YOU.

437
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,460
NOT FOR THEM.

438
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,533
- THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS.

439
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,869
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?
THE WAR IS OVER.

440
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,141
AS A KNIGHT,
I VOUCH FOR THEM.

441
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,111
- SO DO I.

442
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,917
- ALL RIGHT.
COME IN.

443
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,752
- YOU ARE MOST KIND.

444
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,694
- GUARD
THE RELIQUARY.

445
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,300
- EXCELLENT.

446
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,135
THIS STEW
IS FIT FOR A KING.

447
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,310
- WE'VE HAD A HARD ROAD
SINCE WE WERE SHIPWRECKED HERE.

448
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,412
THIS IS A HOSTILE LAND.

449
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,614
- NO.

450
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,950
SINCE MY WIFE DIED,
MY DAUGHTER AND I

451
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,120
HAVE NEVER HAD
MUCH TROUBLE LIVING HERE.

452
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,358
DURING THE WAR, CRUSADERS
OCCASIONALLY PASSED THROUGH.

453
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,961
BUT NOW THERE
IS ONLY PILGRIMS.

454
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,330
THIS LAND IS ENJOYING
TIME OF PEACE.

455
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,302
SOME MORE SOUP?

456
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,009
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
- I SWEAR.

457
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,578
WHEN HE WAS THROWN
FROM THE CATAPULT,

458
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,880
WE THOUGHT HIS BONES
WOULD SNAP IN TWO.

459
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,782
AND WHEN HE
SURFACED FROM THE LAKE,

460
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,418
HIS FACE WAS
AS WHITE AS YOURS.

461
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,025
A YOUNG MAN
SHOULD TALK TO A LADY.

462
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,471
- SIR GREGORY TOLD ME I'M
TO BE KNIGHTED WHEN WE RETURN.

463
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,875
MAYBE YOU WOULD CARE TO SEE
ENGLAND WHEN I'M KNIGHTED.

464
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:14,077
THEN YOU CAN SEE MY LANCE.

465
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,915
- WHAT?
WHAT DID I SAY?

466
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,654
- INSIDE.

467
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,691
INSIDE, ALL OF YOU!
QUICKLY, RUN!

468
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,293
- WHAT IS IT?
- SOMETHING'S COMING.

469
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,462
SOMETHING'S COMING.
- RUN!

470
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,297
- INSIDE!

471
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,232
- QUICKLY!

472
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,434
- WHAT?
- LOCUSTS!

473
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,335
- YOU HAVE BROUGHT
A PLAGUE WITH YOU.

474
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,539
- QUICK!

475
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,374
GO QUICK!
GO, GO, NOW!

476
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,305
OH, OH!

477
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,445
- IT'S CLEAR.

478
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,053
- THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
SATAN IS TRYING

479
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,990
TO STOP YOU FROM
DELIVERING YOUR PRIZE.

480
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,426
- THEN WE BETTER
REACH THE MONASTERY...

481
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,428
BEFORE THE DEVIL
REACHES US.

482
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,255
SO STILL...

483
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,423
YOU'RE NOT SWAYED
BY RELIGION?

484
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,624
- I THINK THAT
THE RELIC THAT YOU CARRY

485
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,426
IS NOTHING BUT A CURSE,

486
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,261
AND YOU SHOULD LET
THE MONKS DEAL WITH IT.

487
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,997
THE POPE HAS MORE THAN
ENOUGH POWER AND WEALTH,

488
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,532
SO WHY GIVE HIM MORE?

489
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,735
- I SEEK FORGIVENESS.

490
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,439
- I THOUGHT ALL CRUSADERS WERE
GRANTED REMISSION OF THEIR SINS.

491
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,907
- OH, I DON'T SEEK
FORGIVENESS FROM GOD.

492
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,109
I SEEK IT FROM MYSELF.

493
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,300
- WHAT BRINGS KNIGHTS
OF THE CRUSADE

494
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,036
TO OUR HUMBLE MONASTERY?

495
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,537
- WE NEED SHELTER.

496
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,773
WE HAVE WOUNDED...

497
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,775
AND SOMETHING EVIL
IS STALKING US.

498
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,979
- EVIL?

499
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:43,980
A WOMAN.

500
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,182
- SHE IS WITH ME.

501
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,022
- THE TURKS CANNOT ENTER.

502
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,124
- THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

503
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,527
THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS.

504
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,129
- THE TURKS WILL BE HAPPY

505
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,731
TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS.

506
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:08,771
- LET ME BRING YOU TO SPEAK
WITH OUR ABBOT.

507
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,807
BUT YOUR WEAPONS
MUST STAY HERE.

508
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,176
WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD EITHER.

509
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,601
- TAKE THE WOUNDED
TO A PRIVATE CHAMBER.

510
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,575
WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT?

511
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,377
- A SACRED RELIC FROM
THE HOLY LANDS.

512
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,446
IT'S WHY WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR ABBOT.

513
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,853
- WHERE AM I?

514
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,254
- SIR ROBERT,
YOU'RE AWAKE AT LAST.

515
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,056
- WHAT HAPPENED?

516
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,158
- YOU WERE BURNING
WITH A FEVER,

517
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,761
BUT YOU'RE SAFE
IN A MONASTERY.

518
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,915
- MY BROTHERS WOKE ME
TO SAY

519
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:29,519
YOU CARRY SOMETHING
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.

520
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,189
- WE CARRY A GIFT
FOR THE HOLY FATHER.

521
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,459
- WE HAVE SEEN MANY PILGRIMS
AND KNIGHTS PASS BY.

522
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,128
MANY EAGER TO MAKE
A NAME FOR THEMSELVES

523
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,231
BY BRINGING TRINKETS
OF UNIMAGINABLE WORTHLESSNESS.

524
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,834
- WE HAVE A PIECE
OF THE TRUE CROSS.

525
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,336
- SO I HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

526
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,148
- TELL ME, FATHER,
HAVE THESE TRAVELERS

527
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,851
YOU SPEAK OF BEEN PURSUED
BY MALICIOUS FORCES

528
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:05,188
INTENT ON DESTROYING
THEIR RELIC?

529
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,292
SINCE WE LEFT THE HOLY LAND,
WE'VE BEEN STRUCK BY TEMPESTS,

530
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,828
SHIPWRECKED,
MEMBERS OF OUR PARTY

531
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,629
HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED
IN THE FOREST.

532
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,232
BIRDS HAVE BEEN STRUCK DEAD
IN THE SKY.

533
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,601
WE'VE BEEN ATTACKED BY WOLVES
AND A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS

534
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:23,406
AND ALL BECAUSE WE CARRY...
THIS.

535
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:56,005
AND YOU BELIEVE THIS
TO BE PART OF THE CRUCIFIX?

536
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,008
- WE DO.

537
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,619
- IT IS TRUE.

538
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,323
BEHOLD!

539
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,527
FROM THE CROSS OUR SAVIOR
WAS CRUCIFIED UPON!

540
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,197
AND IT WEEPS HIS BLOOD!

541
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:34,777
<i>"IESYS NAZARENYS</i>
<i>REX IYDAEORYM.</i>

542
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:39,015
JESUS NAZARENE,
KING OF THE JEWS."

543
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,451
THIS TRULY IS PART
OF THE CRUCIFIX.

544
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,254
THE INSCRIPTION WAS PLACED
ABOVE CHRIST'S HEAD.

545
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,725
PUT THERE TO MOCK HIM.

546
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,997
THIS RELIC--

547
00:48:55,065 --> 00:49:00,069
BUT THIS RELIC IS TAINTED
BY THIS CURSED INSCRIPTION.

548
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:03,172
DARK FORCES ARE NOT TRYING
TO STOP YOU.

549
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,875
THE RELIC IS ATTRACTING EVIL
TO YOU,

550
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,945
DRAWING IT LIKE A MOTH
TO A FLAME.

551
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,280
- WELL, THEN--

552
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,015
THEN WE MUST DESTROY IT.

553
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,085
- IT IS SACRILEGE TO DESTROY
A SACRED RELIC.

554
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,854
- WELL, IF IT IS THE LETTERS
THAT ARE CURSED,

555
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,691
WHY NOT TRY TO REMOVE THEM?

556
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,867
- TRY THIS.

557
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,430
- THAT CANNOT BE.

558
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,100
- CAN WE BURY IT
IN THE MONASTERY?

559
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:13,442
- COMING HERE HAS NOT
IMPROVED OUR SITUATION.

560
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,623
- BEHIND YOU!

561
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,795
- THERE'S ONE BEHIND YOU
ON THE TABLE!

562
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,402
- IT'S BOLTED FROM INSIDE...

563
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,872
LIKE A FORT.

564
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,957
YOU WILL ALL ROT IN HELL.

565
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:53,602
- YOU KILLED HIM.

566
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,706
- THE MONKS WERE POSSESSED.

567
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,643
THE RELIC IS DRAWING
EVIL TOWARDS US.

568
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,345
- THEN WE MUST DESTROY IT
BEFORE IT KILLS US ALL.

569
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,380
- NO!

570
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,887
IMPOSSIBLE.

571
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,895
IT'S NOT EVEN WARM.

572
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,364
- IT IS MADNESS TO DESTROY
A RELIGIOUS ARTIFACT.

573
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,266
- EVEN ONE SO EVIL?

574
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,435
- YOU SAW THE BLOOD.

575
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,870
THAT IS BLOOD OF OUR SAVIOR.

576
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,040
BLOOD THAT MUST NOT
BE TAINTED.

577
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,276
THERE ARE POWERS IN ROME
THAT CAN DEAL WITH THIS.

578
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,011
- WE WILL NEVER MAKE IT.

579
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,614
- HE'S RIGHT.

580
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,317
AND EVEN IF WE DID,
THE EVIL IT DRAWS TO US

581
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,252
WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING BEFORE
WE EVEN REACHED ROME.

582
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,753
- THEN LEAVE IT HERE.

583
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,722
- FOR OTHERS TO FIND
AND BE SLAUGHTERED?

584
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,058
NO.

585
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,193
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO KEEP OTHERS SAFE.

586
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,596
THAT IS THE CODE
WE SWORE ALLEGIANCE TO.

587
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,800
THAT IS THE KNIGHT'S CODE.

588
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,134
WHAT SAY YOU,
SIR ROBERT?

589
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,737
ROBERT, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

590
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:02,938
- NEVER FELT BETTER.

591
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,341
- WE CANNOT DESTROY IT.

592
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,544
WE CANNOT LEAVE IT
AND WE CANNOT TAKE IT.

593
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:12,881
YOU HAVE PUT US IN A PUZZLE
THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE.

594
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,516
- WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE THE DAMNED THING.

595
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,219
- IF IT CAN WORK ITS EVIL
HERE ON HOLY GROUND,

596
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,888
WHERE CAN WE TAKE IT
THAT IT'S SAFE?

597
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:23,158
- IT DIDN'T WORK
IN JERUSALEM.

598
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:27,329
AT LEAST NOT TO THIS EXTENT.

599
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,665
- THE POWER OF THE HOLY LAND
MIGHT BE ENOUGH

600
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,401
TO CONTAIN THE EVIL.

601
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,270
- WE MUST RETURN TO JERUSALEM.

602
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,772
- HEAD BACK?

603
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,108
- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY.

604
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,681
- THANK YOU.

605
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,616
- THANK YOU.

606
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,285
- FOR WHAT?

607
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,420
- HOW MANY MORE TIMES
WILL YOU SAVE MY LIFE?

608
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,522
- AHH.

609
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,893
HOW MANY MORE TIMES WILL
I PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER?

610
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,096
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

611
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,399
HASAN AND BROTHER GEORGE
CAN ACCOMPANY YOU.

612
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,301
THE EVIL WON'T
FOLLOW YOU THERE.

613
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,970
- AND RETURN TO WHAT?

614
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,272
I HAVE NO HOME.

615
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,374
MY FATHER'S FORGE
WAS TAKEN BECAUSE

616
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,778
HE COULD NOT PAY HIS TAXES.

617
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:21,083
IT WAS HIS LIFE.

618
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,919
- PERHAPS IF WE RETURN
TOGETHER,

619
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,855
YOU COULD FIND A HOME.

620
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,966
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
LAST NIGHT.

621
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,369
IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE LOSS
FOR BOTH OF US.

622
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,038
I CONSIDER YOUR DEBT
TO BE REPAID.

623
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,473
- BAH.

624
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,109
MERELY A TIMELY ENTRANCE.

625
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,877
A FOOL COULD BREAK
OPEN A DOOR.

626
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,547
I'VE YET TO ACTUALLY
SAVE YOUR LIFE.

627
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:29,051
- YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WIFE
TO CONSIDER, MY FRIEND.

628
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,753
I HAVE NONE.

629
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,022
- NO...LADY WAITING AT HOME?

630
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,527
I WAS MARRIED ONCE
IN MY YOUTH.

631
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,362
- AND WHAT HAPPENED?

632
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,565
- SHE DIED IN CHILDBIRTH
ALONG WITH THE CHILD.

633
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,506
- I THINK YOU SHOULD REST,
MY FRIEND.

634
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,208
- SPARE ME YOUR PITY.

635
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:07,923
- DON'T MOVE.

636
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,991
DON'T EVEN BREATHE.

637
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,292
- DO WE NOT HAVE
ENOUGH PROBLEMS

638
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,994
WITHOUT FIGHTING
AMONGST OURSELVES?

639
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,195
- THE FOOL'S AFFLICTED
WITH MADNESS!

640
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,832
HE OFFENDED ME.

641
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,133
- AND HOW WOULD THAT BE,
SIR ROBERT?

642
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,603
- I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOK OF HIM.

643
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:24,540
AND AS FOR YOU...

644
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,809
LAY A FINGER ON ME AGAIN
AND YOU WILL BLEED, WHORE.

645
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,043
AND YOU WILL NOT STOP ME.

646
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,912
- I WILL NOT NEED TO.

647
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:33,715
SHE CAN FIGHT HER OWN BATTLES.

648
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,250
- WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?

649
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,428
- HIS SKIN IS BURNING.

650
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,865
- THE FEVER WAS CLEARING.

651
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,266
WHAT WAS THAT?

652
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,401
- A SPLINTER?

653
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,435
- HE'S BEEN POISONED

654
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,304
BY A SPLINTER FROM THE RELIC.

655
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,405
IT'S WORKING INTO HIS BODY.

656
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,739
- WHAT CAN WE DO?

657
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,442
- IT'S BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE
TO CURE HIM.

658
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,912
LET ME GO!

659
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,258
- WE'LL HAVE TO BUILD
A STRETCHER.

660
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,527
- A FOULNESS AFFLICTS HIM.

661
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,729
SOMETHING WICKED COMES NEAR.

662
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:24,633
THE STORM, THE PLAGUE...
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

663
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,369
A DEMON STRENGTHENS
AND DRAWS CLOSER.

664
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,739
- DID HE HURT YOU?

665
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,207
- NO.

666
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,576
- NOW HAVE SAFA TAKE
A LOOK AT THAT

667
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,846
AND THEN STAY CLOSE BY.

668
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,702
- I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT.

669
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,772
- SIR ROBERT'S CONDITION
IS DETERIORATING.

670
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,710
TO STOP NOW WOULD BE
TO CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH.

671
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,613
- THEN WE GO ON.

672
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,735
- THE DEMON HAS FOUND US.

673
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,473
I DON'T FEAR YOU, DEMON.

674
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,309
I HAVE THE POWER OF GOD
ON MY SIDE.

675
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,179
CHRIST IS MY SAVIOR,
AND IN HIS NAME

676
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:21,750
I CAST YOU TO THE PIT
OF HELL WHERE YOU BELONG.

677
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,820
BEELZEBUB,
EATER OF THE DEAD,

678
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,121
BE GONE BACK TO HELL!

679
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,060
UGH!

680
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:37,766
- DIE BY MY BLADE.

681
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,170
- IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,
HIS SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT,

682
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,206
I CONDEMN YOU.

683
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,488
- SAFA!

684
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,690
- GET THEM OFF ME.
HELP ME!

685
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,559
HELP ME!

686
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,451
- THE DEMON HAS FOUND IT.

687
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:38,226
- DID YOU KILL IT?

688
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:43,532
- THE HOLY SYMBOL DREW
ITS BLOOD, BUT...

689
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,770
I DON'T THINK IT KILLED IT.

690
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:52,808
IT HAS BOUGHT US
A LITTLE MORE TIME THOUGH.

691
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,056
WE MUST DESTROY
THE RELIC BEFORE--

692
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:13,095
BEFORE THE BEAST RETURNS,
ELSE...

693
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,097
WE ALL DIE THIS NIGHT.

694
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,883
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS WISE?

695
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,785
- WE HAVE NO WAY
OF DESTROYING THE RELIC.

696
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,488
WE MUST BURY IT,

697
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,990
SO NO ONE ELSE HAS
THE MISFORTUNE OF FINDING IT.

698
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,659
AND THEN WE RETURN LATER,
BETTER PREPARED.

699
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,695
- RETURN?

700
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,863
- WITH AN ARMY FROM JERUSALEM.

701
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,598
200 MEN TO FIGHT THAT DEMON.

702
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:52,467
- 200, 500, 1,000!

703
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,336
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

704
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,205
- WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
- SIEGE WEAPONS.

705
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,674
MY FATHER HELPED BUILD
SOME ONCE.

706
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,610
A MACHINE OF WAR WILL
BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

707
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,578
TO SLAY THE BEAST.

708
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,681
- YOU MAY BE CORRECT
TO A POINT.

709
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,918
IT IS HELL SPAWN.

710
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,419
MORTAL WEAPONS CANNOT KILL IT.

711
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,823
- THE FEVER GROWS WORSE.

712
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,695
- HE NEEDS TO DIE.

713
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,097
- NO!
HE'S A KNIGHT.

714
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,465
HE FOUGHT WITH HONOR.

715
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,501
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
AN INGLORIOUS DEATH.

716
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,378
- THEN WE MUST KEEP
THAT DOG ON A LEASH.

717
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:51,026
- LET'S LEAVE THIS PLACE

718
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,362
AND PUT THIS NIGHTMARE
BEHIND US.

719
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:16,918
ROBERT.

720
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:20,956
ROBERT, YOU NEED TO EAT.

721
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,991
ROBERT, I KNOW YOU'RE
INSIDE THERE.

722
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,492
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

723
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,760
DON'T LET THIS THING
CONTROL YOU.

724
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,762
FIGHT THIS THING.

725
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,763
YOU WILL DIE HERE.

726
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,866
YOUR SOUL WILL ROT IN HELL.

727
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,267
- YOU ARE A KNIGHT!

728
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,602
- YOUR SPIRITS ARE DEAD.

729
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:35,203
- YOU ARE A CRUSADER.

730
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:52,454
- HOW IS HE?

731
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,656
- HE NEEDS AN EXORCIST.

732
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,292
- MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WE NEED FOOD.

733
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,527
THAT WAS THE LAST.

734
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,330
- WE HAVE PASSED
NO ANIMALS FOR DAYS.

735
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:07,002
AND STILL IT'S A DAY'S RIDE
TO THE NEAREST TOWN.

736
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,471
- HAVE NO FEAR.

737
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,006
THE EVIL IS BEHIND US.

738
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,608
<i>ALLAH SUBHANAHU WA-TA'ALA</i>

739
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,211
IS GUIDING US ALONG
A SAFE PATH.

740
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:21,283
OR PERHAPS IT IS CHRIST,
PEACE BE UPON HIM.

741
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,152
IF WE BOTH PRAY,

742
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,821
SURELY SOMEONE
WILL BE LISTENING.

743
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,758
EITHER WAY,
WE WALK AS BROTHERS.

744
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:34,162
WE WILL SURVIVE.

745
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,008
- FATHER, FORGIVE ME FOR
ALL MY SINS.

746
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,580
- SORRY.

747
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,452
CAN I PRAY WITH YOU?

748
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,854
- OF COURSE.

749
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:11,032
I THOUGHT YOU DOUBTED.

750
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,469
- I SAW THAT DEMON
WITH MY OWN EYES.

751
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:19,240
FROM WHICHEVER HELL IT CAME,
I SAW IT.

752
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:24,713
THAT MEANS THAT THERE
IS A HELL.

753
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:30,418
- THEN...THERE MUST
BE A HEAVEN.

754
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,797
- SIR ROBERT?

755
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,767
- AHH!

756
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:17,599
- MAY THAT BE THE LAST
OF THE DEMON SPAWN.

757
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,535
- AT DAWN, WE GO DOWN.

758
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,438
MAKE SURE HE'S DEAD.

759
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,985
- WE'RE BEING WATCHED.

760
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,387
- IT'S JUST YOUR IMAGINATION.

761
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,123
- THIS VALLEY IS PERFECT
FOR AN AMBUSH.

762
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,958
- DOES THAT MEAN
WE HAVE WILLINGLY

763
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:47,195
WALKED INTO A TRAP?

764
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,065
- WE'RE JUMPING AT SHADOWS.

765
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,733
HE'S NOT HERE.

766
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,636
COME ON.

767
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,755
- IT CANNOT BE.

768
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,546
RUN!

769
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,383
- OUR PROBLEMS
ARE FAR FROM OVER.

770
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,252
- CAREFUL.

771
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,487
- CAREFUL.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

772
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,623
- IS THIS REALLY
CHRIST'S BLOOD?

773
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,225
- IT IS.

774
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,927
- WHY DOES IT CONTINUE
TO BLEED?

775
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,630
- FOR ALL THE PAIN
THAT CHRIST ENDURED.

776
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:33,902
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

777
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,370
- IF IT'S GOING
TO KEEP TURNING UP

778
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:36,938
EVERYWHERE WE ARE,
THEN WE MAY AS WELL

779
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,206
CONTINUE TO CARRY IT.

780
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,075
AT LEAST THIS WAY WE KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

781
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,978
LET'S GO.

782
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:56,718
- WHAT IS IT?

783
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,454
- I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

784
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,924
- YOU CAN.
YOU CAN.

785
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,726
IT THRIVES ON OUR DESPAIR.

786
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,428
STAY STRONG.

787
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,565
- MY FRIEND...

788
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:16,404
YOU SHOULD TAKE
A LOOK AT THESE.

789
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,306
- LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE
IN A SIEGE.

790
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,009
- THIS WAS NO WAR BETWEEN MEN.

791
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,510
- THESE WERE FIGHTING MEN

792
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,480
HEADING FOR THE HOLY LAND.

793
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,482
- WELL, THEY FOUND HELL
RIGHT HERE.

794
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:33,187
- THESE TRACKS ARE ALMOST
TWO DAYS OLD.

795
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:36,124
- THAT'S BEFORE
WE WERE SHIPWRECKED.

796
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,526
FRIAR GEORGE THOUGHT
THAT IT HAD BEEN

797
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,128
DRAWN TOWARDS US.

798
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:45,233
BUILDING ITS POWER
TO CONFRONT US.

799
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,568
WON'T BE LONG BEFORE IT
FINDS US AGAIN.

800
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,237
- WHERE'S REBECCA?

801
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,676
- REBECCA?

802
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:02,350
- MY CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

803
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,919
THE BEATING HEART
OF THE COMMUNITY.

804
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,526
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

805
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,595
THE CRAFT,
HOW TO USE THE FORGE,

806
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,431
THE RIGHT TIME
TO STRIKE THE STEEL.

807
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,874
SPARE ME!

808
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,351
- YOU ARE SAFE.

809
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,419
- I HAVE SEEN THE DEVIL.

810
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,121
THE FACE OF DEATH.

811
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,522
THE REAPER,
SHE DID THIS!

812
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,324
SHE DID ALL OF THIS!

813
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,993
- ENOUGH.
YOU ARE SAFE.

814
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,162
- YOU.
YOU TURKS.

815
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,098
YOU TURKS BROUGHT IT HERE.

816
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,766
- I SAID YOU ARE SAFE.

817
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,334
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

818
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:54,802
- A SURVIVOR.

819
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,739
- A KNIGHT?

820
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,941
A KNIGHT HAS COME
TO DELIVER US FROM EVIL.

821
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,142
SAVE US, SIR.

822
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,744
SAVE OUR SOULS.

823
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,447
- SHH.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

824
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,383
- MY LADY.

825
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,017
SIMON, MY LADY.

826
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,653
- AND WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

827
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,923
- I WAS A FIGHTER.

828
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:20,328
1 OF 100 MEN ON OUR WAY
TO SEEK NEW LIFE IN JERUSALEM.

829
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,599
THEN--THEN THE WAR ENDED,
BUT WE CONTINUED.

830
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:29,203
CONTINUED TO FIND THAT NEW LIFE
IN THE HOLY LANDS.

831
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,406
WE ARRIVED AHEAD OF--

832
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:34,442
AHEAD OF TALES ABOUT
THAT DEMON WHO--

833
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,078
WHO FED FROM THE DEAD
OF THE CRUSADES

834
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,281
AS IT WAS SEARCHING
FOR SOMETHING.

835
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,917
IT HUNTED US FOR SPORT.

836
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,219
HUNDREDS OF OUR MEN.

837
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:50,024
MANY MORE FROM THE TOWN
WERE ALL CUT DOWN.

838
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,292
OUR STEEL IS USELESS!

839
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,095
- YOU SAY IT HUNTED
FOR SPORT?

840
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:57,632
- IT TORMENTED ITS VICTIMS
LIKE A CAT WOULD.

841
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,868
IT CHASED THEM DOWN BEFORE
SLAUGHTERING THEM.

842
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,171
IT ENJOYED THE SLAYING.

843
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:10,344
- IF HUNDREDS OF WARRIORS COULD
NOT STOP THIS MONSTER,

844
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,848
THEN WHAT CHANCE HAVE WE?

845
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,149
- WE NEED A MIRACLE.

846
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,285
- I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS.

847
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,619
WE JUST NEED TIME.

848
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,456
- TIME?
THERE IS NO TIME.

849
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:27,428
- BUT...WE HAD WEAPONS
TO KILL IT.

850
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:31,032
THOUGH WE HAD NO TIME
TO DEPLOY THEM.

851
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:34,469
- WEAPONS?

852
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,104
WHAT WEAPONS?

853
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:39,941
- HERE.

854
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,142
COME.

855
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,044
LOOK HERE.

856
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,023
SEE?
SEE?

857
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,993
WE HAD THE WEAPONS
TO KILL THE BEAST.

858
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,229
- PERHAPS NOW WE CAN MAKE
A STAND.

859
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,998
- BUT STEEL WILL NOT EVEN
SCRATCH ITS HIDE.

860
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,048
- SIMON?

861
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,458
- NEVER!

862
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,228
TWO DIED TO KILL ONE MAN.

863
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,998
WHAT CHANCE HAVE WE AGAINST
THE DEMON NOW?

864
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,733
WE SHOULD RUN.

865
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,101
- WE TRIED THAT.

866
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,570
- WELL, THEN WE TRY HARDER.

867
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,073
AND IF THERE IS A GOD,

868
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,274
THEN WE PRAY
THAT HE SAVES US.

869
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,543
- "IF"?

870
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,512
YOU'VE FOUND FAITH ONLY
TO LOSE IT NOW?

871
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,383
- THOSE WEAPONS ARE NOT GOING
TO BE POWERFUL ENOUGH,

872
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:07,021
AND THEY WERE OUR ONLY HOPE.

873
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:11,025
- NO.

874
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,628
THERE IS ANOTHER.

875
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,834
WHAT BETTER WEAPON THAN
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST?

876
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,627
- AND IF THIS DOESN'T WORK?

877
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:54,001
THEN WE NEED SOMETHING
TO BUY US SOME TIME.

878
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,927
THE BEAST CAN APPEAR
WHEREVER WE ARE.

879
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,830
IT'LL COME HERE.

880
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:03,204
WHEN IT REACHES HERE,
WE FIRE.

881
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,973
CAN'T MISS AT THAT RANGE.

882
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,950
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE,
JERUSALEM?

883
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:19,320
- IT WAS LIKE THIS.

884
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,922
WAR TORN.

885
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,825
FRIGHTENING.

886
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,232
THAT'S WHEN THE DREAMS STARTED.

887
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,769
- DREAMS?

888
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:37,571
- AHH, DREAMS OF BATTLE.

889
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:41,942
FIGHTING.
ALWAYS VERY VIVID.

890
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:47,882
THEN WHEN WE GOT HERE
AND FOUND THE RELIC...

891
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,886
I HAD DREAMS OF THE DEMON.

892
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,890
- YOU HAD PREMONITIONS?

893
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,491
- I DON'T KNOW.

894
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,596
MAYBE THAT'S HOW
THE DEMON KNEW

895
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,498
WE WERE TAKING THE RELIC
OUT OF THE HOLY LAND.

896
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,969
IT WAS USING ME.

897
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:13,874
NOW I JUST DREAM OF RETURNING
TO MY LAND

898
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,510
AND FINDING SOMEONE
TO SHARE IT WITH ME.

899
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,479
- AND INSTEAD
YOU MET AN INDENTURED SLAVE.

900
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:21,715
- NO.

901
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:25,252
I MET AT WOMAN WHO JUST DIDN'T
KNOW SHE WAS FREE.

902
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:36,864
IT'S COMING.

903
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,405
WHERE IS IT?

904
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:54,682
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

905
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,721
- RUN!

906
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,056
RUN!

907
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,516
GO!

908
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,055
FIRE!

909
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,835
THE RELIC!

910
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:30,237
THROW ME THE RELIC!

911
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:41,975
WE DID IT.
