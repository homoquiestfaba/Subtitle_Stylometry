I really wanted to get
you something, but...

177
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,294
A bunch of places.
Don't worry about it.

178
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,330
Where did you get all these?

179
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,066
Oh, that's from the documentary
I did on Reginald Foster.

180
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,734
Oh. The black billionaire.
Yeah.

181
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,769
He was a very
reluctant subject.

182
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,338
Really?
Yeah.

183
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,673
Then how did you get
him to agree to do it?

184

Oh, you know, Harper,
I never take no for an answer.

Is that a work thing,
because I can...

189

No, you're fine.

Am I interrupting?

191
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,923
Uh. Not at all.

192
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:25,790
Lisa said you
were with a friend.

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,958
Yeah.

Yeah. "Harp."

198
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,099
Sure. Harp, of course.
The writer.

199

201
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,872
Okay. Good to meet you.
You guys are friends from work?

202

No. Right, Brian.

B-Mac?

Yes. That's what
she calls you.

212
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,824
Is that right?
JORDAN: No.

213
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,259
Harper!
HARPER: Yeah, it's really cute.

214
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,728
So it's good to
finally meet you, Brian.

215
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,163
She will not stop.

216
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,098
She won't stop
talking about you.

217
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,400
Seriously, she won't stop.

218
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,367
I guess that's
nice to hear, right?

219
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,869

got to bail on dinner tonight.

The boss is all up my ass.

223
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,678
No, no. It's totally fine.
I get it.

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,379
You didn't have to walk all
the way here to tell me that.

225
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,914
You could've called,

226
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,849
you could've emailed,
you could've sent a text.

227
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,152
Yeah, but the damnedest thing,
none of my devices were working.

228
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,720
So I figured I should just come

229
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,155
and deliver
the message in person.

So I can come
with you to Mia's.

it's important to me.

to wait outside?

you this weekend?

Julian, you don't have to sell me.
Your school is extraordinary.

254
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,070
Well, that's because
of donations,

like yourself, Elliot.

00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,598
Your pops, always clowning me.
Just like in college.

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,233
The old days.

354
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,536
Hey there, gorgeous.
Hey.

355
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,205
So good to see you.

356
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,308
There is nothing more beautiful
than a woman with child.

357
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,375
Is it a boy or a girl?

358
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:36,247
Yeah, we're just hoping for
a healthy baby. This time.

359

Harper.

360
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,651
We just wanted it
to be a surprise.

361
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,853
Oh. Well,
Harp's good for that.

369
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,377
And both of their
families are coming, too.

00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,478
Oh, word?

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,348
That's perfect.

372
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,415
Why is that perfect?

373
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,155
Oh, you know, it's Christmas
time, family, friends,

374
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,423
lots of stories,
that kind of thing.

375
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,325
And a lot of work for Mia.

376
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,793
Oh, please, are you kidding me?

377
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,262
She lives for
this kind of a thing.

378
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,297
Well, I don't think Lance does.

379
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,399
He was giving you a hard time.

380
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,402
Oh, no, he was just
messing with me.

381
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,770
If you say so.
Yeah.

382
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,407
Have you thought any more
about pursuing his bio?

383
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,611
His bio...
No, no, not really.

384
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,580
I think that's for the best.

385
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:46,184
You guys should just concentrate
on being friends again.

386
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,685
Yeah, absolutely.

387
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,823
Let me ask you something.
Does Mia look thin to you?

388
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,893
Really?

389
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,795
You're asking
the pregnant fatty

if another woman
that you slept with

391
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,199
looks skinny?
Shh. Shh.

Yeah, but they're
organized and we're not.

If they can get
the word "homo" banned,

403

we should be able to get "nigga" banned.

What's to know?

She's career-obsessed and
lives on her BlackBerry.

from a piece of fiction.

really get along, do we?

Hawaii the day after Christmas.

Seasons in Maui. Honeymoon suite.

514
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,085

the playoffs this year or what?

Yeah, that Atlanta
D is pretty tough.

definitely make the playoffs.

520
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:00,931
And what about
that rushing record?

521

Really? We're gonna talk
about football all night?

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,915
Just like the TV show.
Mmm-hmm.

528
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:18,877
One hundred seventy-six.

529
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,786
Yards for the record.
Right, Lance?

530
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,291
Right, yeah, 176.
Right.

531
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,260
You remember your
first pro yards?

532
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,665
Why don't you hop on that broom
and fly back out the window?

533
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,068
Quentin!

534
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,803
So, Murch,
how's the fundraising going?

535
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,172
Oh, uh...

536
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,276
We ran into a snag
this week. (CLEARS THROAT)

537
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,911
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

538
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,279
Is it Elliot?

539
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,114
Yeah, he's not
contributing this year.

540
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:52,016
Elliot Gibson,
the philanthropist?

541
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,817
Isn't he a bit
of a morality nut?

542
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,688
Yeah! Yeah, that's him.

543
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,623
My God.
Did he say why?

544
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,226
To hell with him, man!
We got you.

545
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,161
What's his usual contribution?

546
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,196
Two million.
Oh, hell no.

547
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,167
Murch, if you need anything,
just let me know.

548
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,236
No, no, no!
You sure about that?

549
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,672
You guys have done
more than enough.

550
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,574
Thanks. I can handle this.

551
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,612
MIA: Listen, I have
a fabulous weekend planned.

552
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,714
And after dessert,
it's pajama time!

553
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,316
You know I like to sleep naked.

554
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,558
ROBYN: Oh, God.
JORDAN: Quentin.

555
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,353
So, about those yards, Lance.

556
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,988
You remember your first...

557
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,124
I'm sorry, can I trouble you
for the bathroom?

558
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,193
Of course.
Lance, could you?

559
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,328
Yeah.

560
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,701
Mmm mmm mmm.

561
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:48,105
Look at her.
That waddle brings back nightmares.

You too, Robin Thicke.

565
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,313
Yeah, I said it.

566
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,382
Mia, do you have some Prosecco?
Where are those people?

567
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,017
Hello? Excuse me?

QUENTIN: How did this Elliot guy
find this in the first place?

570
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,958
How do I know?
Is he a porn watcher?

571
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,293
First of all, it's not porn.

572
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,761
Well, I'm getting
a little excited.

573
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,062
Cut it out.
Get your hands off.

a little excited.

look cute in your PJs!

00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,316
Yeah.
Yeah, nice.

Hey, um...

584
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,987
We're going, right, Murch?

585
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,750
Oh. We were gonna go hang out with
the fellas. You don't mind, do you?

586
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,426
Oh. No!

Please, they got 900
channels up in here.

Plus, me and Robyn are gonna sit up and
talk about people, so... (CHUCKLES)

00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,401
Perfect.
Talking about people.

Oh, um, babe,
can I use your phone?

591
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,805
Because I can't get
a signal up in here.

592

In my hand?

Yeah, stop!
Would you hand me that?

Yes, very.

Whatever you want, baby.

00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,321
I want you to be
a little nicer.

603
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,823
I thought I was being nice.

604
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,024
To everybody.

605
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,995

What?

Oh. Harper,
please don't play dumb.

610

It belittles both of us.

611

So this is what you've
been strategizing about!

612
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,193
Uh. Yeah, yeah.
What do you think?

00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,863
I think it's brilliant.
Have you asked him?

00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,198
No, I've got to
figure out an approach.

You already got him with
that first yards question.

616
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,238
Just brush off those journalistic
skills and get in there.

617
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,840
You've got to convince him that
he needs to tell his story.

618
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,777
Well, that's a lot
easier said than done.

Well, just keep talking to him.

I can work on Mia,

he'll do whatever she says.

00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,727
Hell no, it ain't close.

701
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,295
Amen.

702
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,429
Really?

703
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,764
QUENTIN:
Look, I'm just saying.

704
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,499
If Candace

705
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,267
ain't the best at
rocking the mic...

706
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,169
I didn't say that.
I didn't say she's not the best.

707
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:30,007
She can rock the mic.
She's rocking the mic.

708
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,308
She-mutt rocks it, right?

709
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,377
Yes, she does...
I'm done.

710
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,012
I'm saying,
if she's not the best

711
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,414
at rocking the mic,
then maybe she didn't.

712
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,416
Good point.

713
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,451
JORDAN: <i>So, Mia.</i>

714
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,488
What do you think Lance is gonna
do with all of his new free time?

715
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,657
Oh, you better get him some golf
lessons or he will drive you crazy.

716
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,160
Look, he can drive
me crazy all he wants.

717
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:53,330
Plus, the children would
love to have him around.

718
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:55,365
It's gonna be nice.

719
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,502
Has he ever thought about
writing his memoirs?

720
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,470
He'd never get that bored.

721
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,672
Yeah, you're probably right,
but you know what?

722
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,142
He's got such a legacy,
and I think people

723
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,511
would love to hear his story.
Your story!

724
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,246
I don't know,
it just seems like,

725
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:12,416
with him retiring, it would be
the perfect time to reflect.

726
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,718
Mmm.

727
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,087
Yeah, maybe you're right.

728
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,056
Maybe it is.

729
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,326
JULIAN: (CHUCKLES)
Nice move, nice.

730
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,063
Didn't Shelby and
Mia pledge together?

731
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,531
Yes, line sisters.

732
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,398
Line sisters.
Mmm-hmm.

733
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,334
That's why her ass is up here.

734
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,170
Exactly.

735
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,739
Mia and Lance, they take
their Greek life seriously.

736
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,676
What is that,
"Friendship is essential to the soul"?

737
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:45,549
Along with manhood, scholarship,
perseverance and uplifting.

738
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,684
In case y'all didn't know.
HARPER: Okay.

739
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,252
You think your
kids are gonna pledge?

740
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,088
Ain't no think.

741
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,789
Sullivan has been
frat over 100 years,

742
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,071
and we're gonna
keep that moving.

743
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,194
JULIAN: Oh! Nice.

744
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,830
So, tradition, that's one of
your main principles, then?

745
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,072
I didn't say
nothing about that.

746
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,634
All right, everybody, then.

747
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,470
If you had to boil
your principles down

748
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:09,239
into three words,
what would they be?

749
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:14,344
For me, it would be creativity,
stability and partnership.

750
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,717
Tradition, family and love.

751
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,587
JULIAN: Ancestry,

752
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,856
perseverance,

753
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,458
children.

754
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,895
Money, bitches,
pussy and getting head.

755
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,765
Mother...
That's four, first off.

756
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:39,402
Money, bitches,
pussy/getting head.

757
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,804
(CHUCKLES)

758
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,606
Mmm mmm mmm.

759
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,142
God, family, football.

760
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,181
In that order?

761
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,185
In that order.

762
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,737
(EXHALES)
L-Boogie!

763
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,805
I thought I'd hit
the trail myself.

764
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,307
Show me the way?

765
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,551
Well, the kids look beautiful.
Getting big.

766
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:28,652
You must be proud.

767
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,923
Yeah, no doubt, man.

768
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:35,358
It's the best thing
I could've ever done.

769
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,660
Are you excited?

770
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,461
Me? Yeah, I'm excited.

771
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,596
Nervous.

772
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,601
Yeah, Robyn and I
were having trouble

773
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,405
Yeah, I did hear something about that.
Was it low sperm count?

774
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,807
What? No, no.
No, I'm good.

775
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,877
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed.

776
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:57,280
It's just a little bit more of a
challenge than we anticipated.

777
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,349
(PANTING)

778
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,319
Are you all right?

779
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,888
I think I got a pebble
in my shoe or something.

780
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,528
You're not the
author of this, man.

781
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,664
What do you mean?

782
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,967
You know, Faith was a breech baby.
For real?

783
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,501
Yeah, no doubt.

784
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,503
29 hours of labor,

785
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,873
and my little baby girl wasn't even
breathing when she came into this world.

786
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,843
Longest 15 seconds of my life.

787
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,746
But our faith.

788
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,815
Our faith never wavered.

789
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,686
Yeah, God's always
got a plan, man.

790
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,608
Just got to trust everything's
going to work out.

791
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,659
I got a team meeting.
Let's do this.

792
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,828
I'll give you a head start.

793
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,531
(MOANING)

794
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,435
You were amazing this morning.

795
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,437
I thought we were gonna
wake up the whole house.

796
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,639
(CHUCKLES)

797
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,744
You know how much I love you?

798
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,013
Yes, I know how
much you love me.

799
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,981
No, seriously,
do you know how much?

800
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,850
I know that
you're gonna be late.

801
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,920
Wow. Always
on a schedule.

802
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,990
That's me. I can't help it.

803
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,692
And I love who you are.

804
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,861
Believe me, your
whole strong, independent,

805
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,930
Olivia Pope thing is very sexy.

806
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,466
But sometimes you act
like you don't need me.

807
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,368
I don't.

808
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,875
Everybody needs
somebody, Jordan.

809
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,548
I'll call you when I land.

810
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,383
Yeah.
Or maybe I should just text you.

811
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,918
Is that better?
No. Call me.

812
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,054
(ENGINE STARTS)

813
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,867
Harper, I'm gonna need you
to go to the store later.

814
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,603
Okay, sure. What's going on?

815
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,475
The caterer broke his arm
slipping on some ice.

816
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,776
Huh.

817
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,813
Too late to find
a replacement, so...

818
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,015
Well, isn't that a lot of work?

819
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,916
I'm fine, Harper.

820
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,120
Okay. I'll go
get dressed.

821
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,588
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

822
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,795
So, what's Harper
been working on?

823
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,530
Anything new?

824
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,767
Quentin, you're sure you
got the Thai basil, right?

825
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,103
Yes, man! You told me
for like the 20th time.

826
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,471
I'm just saying.

827
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,940
God!
Robyn's real specific.

828
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:38,742
Plus, you can't tell
a pregnant lady shit.

829
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,510
You got a point there.

830
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,132
Yeah, man.

831
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,613
Y'all getting your balls
back for Christmas or what?

832
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,748
Married folk.

833
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,850
Anyway, shoot.

834
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,618
She's supposed to be
on maternity leave.

835
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,621
Here she goes cooking
a four-course meal.

836
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,956
Good for her, man.

837
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,024
She's got Jordan here, man.

838
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,026
Not in the kitchen.
That's her arena.

839
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,163
Yeah, it is.
There's hell of a tension.

840
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,966
Man, they should drop the gloves
and start smacking each other.

841
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,834
I hope they show
a titty or something.

842
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,102
No question.
I'm just playin', man.

843
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:12,008
Between your wife and your ex, it's
like what, <i>Mob Wives</i> up in here.

844
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,043
You need to have
a pay-per-view event.

845
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,912
Not a bad idea. Maybe that's
the way you can close that

846
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,180
two-million gap you got.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

That's a big nut.

Yeah, man.
He's going through it, huh?

Everybody's going through it.

00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,698
Well, how are
you doing, shorty?

What do you mean?

858
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,034
You cool?

859
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,002
Yeah.

860
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,904
Money-wise?

861
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,706

it's getting embarrassing, but I'm...

No, this is embarrassing, man.
I'm your man.

865

you talk to your friends.

1395
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,224
Somebody.

1396
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,393
I don't know.

1397
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,664
I'm alone, but I ain't...
Trust me, I ain't lonely.

1398
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,870
I appreciate you, brother.

1399
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,741
And I love you, sis.

1400
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,847
Amen.

1401
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,754
Hey.

1402
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,556
Hey.

1403
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,526
You okay?

1404
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,362
Not really.

1405
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:03,965
You talk to Candace?

1406
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,334
Text.

1407
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,604
I hate texts.

1408
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,440
How's Kennedy?
Is she okay?

1409
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:14,909
Despite how bad a mother I am?

1410
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,246
Yes.
I didn't say that.

1411
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,881
I did.

1412
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,383
I don't have one
maternal bone in my body.

1413
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,755
All I do is criticize
her because she's not me.

1414
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,426
Who the hell am I?

1415
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,863
That is such a loaded question.

1416
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,367
Thanks for the
compassion, honey.

1417
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,468
I'm not your honey.

1418
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,938
I'm not here for you
like that anymore, Shelby.

1419
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:46,407
I'm sorry.

1420
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,318
This night
couldn't get any worse.

1421
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,495
That medicinal weed is no joke.

1422
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,332
Ugh! I was wrong.

1423
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,301
It's dark.

1424
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,404
(CHUCKLES)

1425
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,007
HARPER: Wow.

1426
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:20,408
JORDAN: You like it?

1427
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,477
Yeah. How did you do this?

1428
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,679
Once I understood what was
really going on with your book,

1429
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:26,914
I wanted to inspire you.

1430
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:30,685
Actually one of Brian's colleagues
put the mock-up together.

1431
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:31,753
B-Mac.

1432
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,689
What could have been, huh?

1433
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,626
Do me a favor and
after you send me a copy,

1434
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,828
just make sure you delete that.

1435
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,964
Because I don't want it to
be taken out of context.

1436
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:45,500
Well, you can
delete it yourself.

1437
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:46,934
Merry Christmas.

1438
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:53,007
Yeah. It's about time you caught
up with the rest of the world.

1439
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,509
I don't know.
There's something about pen and paper.

1440
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:55,743
It's just...

1441
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:58,313
When I'm finished,
I know it's real.

1442
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,914
I can touch it.

1443
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,716
Mmm. I get that.
It's like your baby.

1444
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:03,985
Yeah.

1445
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,955
Yeah. That used to be one
of my favorite metaphors.

1446
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,024
Mmm.

1447
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,960
I'm sorry, hon.

1448
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,803
You're fine. You're fine.
Don't worry about it.

1449
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,033
You must be hyped to
get to Hawaii, huh?

1450
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,569
I don't know.

1451
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,973
Kind of doesn't feel like
I should be going anywhere.

1452
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:27,942
Oh, right.

1453
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,779
I don't think I
can leave until...

1454
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,986
Hey, hey.

1455
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,590
I'm losing my best friend.

1456
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,394
I know.

1457
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:48,863
And she tries, you know.
She calls, she emails.

1458
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:52,567
And I'm just, Jordan's
always just too damn busy.

1459
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:54,035
You didn't know.

1460
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,704
I should have known.

1461
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,336
Now, I just feel like I'm just too late.
You know, I just feel like...

(SOBBING)

1463
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,448
Now I just feel like
I'm too late and what...

1464
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,817
It's okay.

1465
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:12,987
It's okay.

1466
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,957
You are here now.

1467
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,593
So is she.

1468
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:24,732
As long as she's still here,
you're right on time.

1469
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,102
I love you, Harper.
Love you, too.

1470
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,040

Wait, Robyn. This is...

1473
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,050
Oh, no. Shit. Robyn?

1474
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,019
Robyn, please,
it's not what you...

1475
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,888
I know Mia's sick!

1476
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,456
Robyn, be careful.

1477
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,425
Robyn.
Leave me alone.

1478
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,127
Listen to me.
I swear. Robyn?

1479
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,196
I swear, Robyn.

1480
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,599
What? What could
you possibly swear?

1481
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,636
That I didn't see what I thought?
That it's complicated?

1482
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,704
Well, yeah, kind of...

1483
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,088
Am I making too much noise?

1484
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,758
No, no, man.
You're good. Yeah.

1485
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,959
Okay.

1486
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,044
It was third and
long in Dallas.

1487
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,616
Cowboy Nation was in a frenzy.

1488
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,753
I was nervous, excited.

1489
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,526
Iso lead was the play.

1490
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:00,695
Took it right up the gut. Pow.

1491
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,498
Knocked the snot out of me.

1492
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,970
But not before I moved those chains.
First down.

1493
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:11,205
Cowboy Nation just fell silent.

1494
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,648
You're a bad man.

1495
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,151
Yeah, it felt good, man.
It felt good.

1496
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,221
I knew I belonged then.

1497
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,225
You couldn't stop me
from bragging, boy.

1498
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:36,531
Then you came up that week after that.
Remember?

1499
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:37,665
Yeah, with Murch.

1500
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,567
That's a weekend
I will never forget.

1501

On the bus we came up.

1502
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,737
Yeah, man.
But we had good times.

1503
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,005
Once you guys got there
we had a good time.

1504
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:45,306
Yeah, we did.

1506
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,744
Because somebody threw up
in his brand-new...

1507
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:51,712
Yeah, it was Murch.
Murch threw up.

1508

Q was mixing his drinks.

1509
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:56,751
He paid for that.

turkey over there?

too heavy for you?

Why don't you stop
staring so hard, brah?

raise your game up.

gave me a crib sheet.

a ride with you, man?

01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,314
Just... Let's go.

1568
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:14,749
Listen.
I can't believe I...

1569
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,517
Lance, talk to me.
Little sneaky snake.

1570
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:19,120
No, no. I'm done talking.
Just get in the car.

1572
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,401
What did you do now?

1573
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,871
And you think it'll
fit with the luggage?

1574
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,439
Yeah. Perfect.
Yeah? Okay.

1575
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,407

01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:41,876

1577
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,010
Hello!

1578
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,880
Oh, my gosh!

1579
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:47,348
I missed you so much!

1580
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,817
Look at you.

1581
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:52,219
How was Grandma's? Was it fun?
GIRL: Yes.

1582
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,388
Hey, girls,
you want some hot chocolate?

1583
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,923
BOTH: Yes!

1584
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:57,424
Mommy, can we?

1585
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,927
Please, please, please!

1586
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:00,928
Just for a little while.

1587
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,296
BOTH: Yay!

1588
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,805
Can we talk?

1589
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,252
I am going to resign, Julian.

1590
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,188
Absolutely not.

1591
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,190
No.

1592
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,293
Candace, listen to me.

1593
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:34,495
The school does
not work without you.

1594
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,297
We can find another way.
Together.

1595
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,967
Listen. I don't
care what happened.

1596
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,136

Okay.

1601
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,446
And for the record,
it was once.

1602
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:29,984
I was young and I was stupid,

1603
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:32,052
and I was drunk!
Babe...

1604
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,357
Stop.

1605
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,496
But I have moved on

1606
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,901
and I am those girls' mother.

1607
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,303
And Julian,

1608
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:54,909
I am your wife.
Come to me first.

1609
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:56,543
Yes, baby. I'm sorry.

1610
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,579
I'm sorry.

1611
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:03,417
You and those girls
are my entire life.

1612
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,986
Just please forgive me.

1613
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,521
Please.

1614
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,557
I guess.
Baby.

1615
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,029
I love you, Julian.

1616
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:16,096
I am so sorry.

01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,669
How can I calm down?

1620
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:23,704
I let my guard down.
I let my guard down!

1621
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,506
I got sucker-punched. Again!

1622
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:26,974
We don't know the full story...

1623
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:28,943
I know enough of the story.
You think you do.

1624
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:31,111
But we won't know until
we speak with Harper.

1625
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,347
No. Fuck Harper! Fuck him!

1626
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,116
Right.

1627

There it is.

1628

You're so filled
with anger that you...

1629
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:48,128
And it's all aimed at him, but
we all played a part in it.

No. No, Mia.

1631

We have never had
this discussion before,

1632
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,700
and we are not about
to start right now!

1633
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:55,569
Tell me how
angry you are at me.

1634
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:57,738
I deserve it.

1635
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,006
No.

1636
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,709
I knew what I was doing.

1637
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:04,478
I knew I was wrong.

1638
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,614
And I knew it would hurt you.

1639
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,619
And I'm sorry for that.

1640
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:18,025
And I'm sorry that I chose him.

1641
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,498
It's my fault what
it's done to you two.

1642
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,068
And I can't rest knowing that
you're still holding on to this.

1643
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,705
You chose him?

1644
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,541
It's weighing you down.
You need to let go.

1645
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:35,609
You need him.

1646
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:38,412
I don't need him.

1647
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,047
Yeah.

1648
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:42,449
Yeah, you do.

1649
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,654
You need to forgive.

1650
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,759
I will never forgive him.

1651
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,061
I need you to.

1652
01:23:57,165 --> 01:24:00,200
Lance, look at me.

1653
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,303
I called us a car, man.

1654
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,105
You should go on.

1655
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:40,274
I'll probably just end up
staying here or something.

1656
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,678
That was some
melodramatic shit.

1657
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:50,818
Guess you're off your high
horse now, ain't you?

1658
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,487
So, you're just gonna
kick me when I'm down, huh?

1659
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:55,589
I told you,
karma's a bitch, man.

1660
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,659
I deserve this.

1661
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:00,694
No. Ain't nobody
deserve misery.

1662
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,830
But it's just your turn now.

See, that's exactly why
I don't tell people shit.

1664
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:09,777
And how's that helped you?

1665
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,508
Look, your marriage
is on the rocks,

1666
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:18,612
you tried to exploit your best
friend for financial gain,

1667
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,214
and you got a low sperm count.

1668

01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,116
I'll be here when you get back.

1745
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,586
I promise.

1746
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:03,821
Yeah, you're right.

1747
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:06,793
I should not have come
here and been dishonest.

1748
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:07,661
Yeah, you think?

1749
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:11,198
But you know what?
I'm glad I did.

1750
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,034
Yeah.

1751
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:16,937
Because in the
past couple of days,

1752
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:19,206
we've talked more
than we have in years.

1753
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:22,709
I mean, we used
to be best friends.

1754
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:25,812
And now, I...

1755
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,114
I want that back.

1756
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,718
And I think you do, too.

1757
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,155
This has nothing to
do with a book or...

1758
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,158
You're my boy.

1759
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:42,195
And I miss you.

1760
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,800
Why should I believe you?

1761
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,604
Because all I have is my word.

1762
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,240
Literally.

1763
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:55,609
It's all I've got.

1764
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,151
She wants me to play today.

1765
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,256
That actually
makes sense to me.

1766
01:32:09,258 --> 01:32:11,825
In what way? How?

1767
01:32:11,827 --> 01:32:14,160
Because it's you, Lance.

1768
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:16,263
God, family, football.

1769
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:20,667
Did you pray on it?

1770
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:24,004
My mind's made up.

1771
01:32:24,006 --> 01:32:26,306
I think Mia's
mind is made up too.

1772
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:30,744
She pretty much trumps
you right about now.

1773
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:33,713
You're not just playing for
you, or your team or the fans.

1774
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:34,875
You're playing for all of us.

1775
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,818
I mean, you know,
not me, but...

1776
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,956
You play for Mia.

1777
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,191
August, Hope,

1778
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,562
little LJ and Faith.

1779
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,933
And on Christmas
you play for him.

1780
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:01,074
I hate you, man.

1781
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:04,210
I really hate you.

1782
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:07,847
I know.

1783
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:09,983
But you'll hate yourself more
if you don't ask him.

1784
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,153
You should ask him.

1785
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,956
He listens to you.

1786
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:39,045
Do you need me
to pray with you?

1787
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,046
Hold your hand?
Read Scripture?

1788
01:33:40,048 --> 01:33:41,314
Man, get the hell out of here.

1789
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:42,949
Okay. I'm not even here.

01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:16,188
I got to check her cervix.

2087

He's gonna need to
talk me through this

2089

in case things
get a little hairy.

2090
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,263

I know,
but you're not a doctor.

2092
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,900
I know. Look, Harp,

2093
01:53:27,902 --> 01:53:30,135
I was there for all my kids.
The nurses taught me how to measure.

2094
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:31,937
And I know my way
around a vagina.

2095
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:36,074
It was a joke.
Just trying to lighten the mood.

2096

Okay, but the baby's breech.

2097
01:53:40,014 --> 01:53:42,147
I got you, Harp, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.

2098
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:43,949
All right, I should tell Robyn.

2099
01:53:43,951 --> 01:53:46,251
I heard! Just do it!
Let's go!

2100

Lance, I was supposed
to have a C-section.

2119
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:33,892
I didn't want to be cut,
but I want you to cut me.

2120

What? No, no, no, baby.

2121
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:39,571
No one's gonna cut you, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be fine.

Right, yeah.
