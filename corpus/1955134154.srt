1
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:19,973
Ray, at thirteen a Jewish boy
becomes a man.

2
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:21,569
They have a celebration

3
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,125
they call Bar Mitzvah;
it means "Son of the law."

4
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:27,845
But this doesn't mean he's prepared
to confront the world as a man...

5
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:30,894
In fact, he's still a baby.

6
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,534
He still carries

7
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:36,814
fears in his heart.

8
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:39,490
The faster he conquers these fears,

9
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,646
the faster he becomes a man;

10
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:45,809
the more prepared he is

11
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:50,128
to live in this world.

12
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:52,085
This man

13
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:55,372
has betrayed you.

14
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:57,845
He has robbed the property
of you and your brothers.

15
00:14:58,427 --> 00:14:59,644
He has to die because

16
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:03,809
life doesn't allow
enemies to live side by side forever.

17
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,094
If he leaves here alive,

18
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,815
he will eventually return to kill,

19
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,412
because he'll be driven by the fear

20
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:20,685
that one day we'll change our minds.

21
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:31,524
There's one shell in the chamber.

22
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,527
Kill him.

23
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,768
I'm not doing it.

24
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:46,330
Either you do it or we set him free
and you can wait for him to return.

25
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,288
Kill him.

26
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,811
Carry this with you.

27
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,565
Nothing will cost you more.

28
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:53,010
I heard the shot.

29
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,884
I went

30
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:58,564
into the garage
and he was in the back,

31
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:00,493
in the car,

32
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,170
with the shotgun across his chest.

33
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:12,247
They wouldn't let his wife see him;

34
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:18,726
they can't even bury him in a
Catholic cemetery.

35
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:21,726
A woman and three boys!

36
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:25,451
Is this how you take care of your family?

37
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:30,688
Now what are these poor people
supposed to do?

38
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:33,011
What a sin!

39
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:36,647
What a sin...
