1
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:15,568
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:23,407
- Lenas, Noah, Bender, Anybody?

3
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,721
Gone, they are all gone.

4
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:33,821
(door slamming)

5
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,312
- For fuck's sake, it's okay. Don't shoot!

6
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:46,011
- Jimmy, Christ! Are you okay?

7
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:49,251
- I think I broke my leg.

8
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,271
I thought you were dead, man.

9
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,131
What happened?

10
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:53,631
- Oh man, when those
things hit the dining room

11
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:54,751
I got pinned in the kitchen.

12
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,272
I had to use a forced air vent to get out.

13
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,951
Where are the others?

14
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,992
- There are no others,

15
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:05,992
those things, they tore up my paper dolls.

16
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,220
What were they?

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,580
What the fuck were they?

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,380
- I don't know, man.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,400
But I'm not sticking around to find out.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,320
Come on, let me help you up.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,440
We'll get you out of here.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,520
- Oh, my leg!

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,400
(roaring)

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,040
They've got me!

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,241
- I need my gun.

26
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,743
Jimmy, you've got to
let go, I need my gun.

27
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:24,703
(roaring)

28
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:25,743
(gun shots)

29
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:30,313
(screaming)

30
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:43,433
(blood dripping)

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,533
(roaring)

32
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:27,773
(heaving)

33
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:38,313
(roaring)

34
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:44,013
(loud screams)

35
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:58,933
(soft guitar playing)

36
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,415
- [Man] Christ, how much do
you think this place is worth?

37
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,735
- [Man] You couldn't even
afford the light bill.

38
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,435
- [Man] I can't afford a freaking burger.

39
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,575
- [Man] It's just a
house guys, nothing more.

40
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,395
It's just wood, plaster,

41
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:33,575
and maybe some very
expensive marble. That's it.

42
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:36,095
- [Man] I could fit a
small town in this place.

43
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:39,815
- [Woman] I feel like I'm standing
in front of the holy grail.

44
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:43,436
I can't believe I'm going
into the Fischer House.

45
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,106
(heavy door slams)

46
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:52,556
(all talking over each other)

47
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:56,706
- [Man] Living large!

48
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:59,916
- [Man] Have you seen anything
like this, unbelievable.

49
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,466
- Guys, guys, quiet
down until we figure out

50
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,506
what's going on here.

51
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:11,671
- My name is John Stoker.

52
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,668
Welcome to my home.

53
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,964
I'm glad you could all make it.

54
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,824
- [Woman] Wow, this
house is in great shape.

55
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:22,944
- I've been restoring
it to its former glory.

56
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,304
I have added a few modern
touches here and there

57
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,427
but I have tried to keep it as
close to its original beauty

58
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,807
as possible.

59
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,567
- You've done a great job.

60
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:34,007
I don't think I've ever been
in a house this elegant.

61
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,327
- Thank you.

62
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,427
Well, I guess introductions are in order.

63
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:41,127
I'd like to learn more about each of you.

64
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,847
- I'm Ted Sturgeon.

65
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:45,447
I guess you could say I'm the
leader of our little society.

66
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,999
I'm a field energy expert.

67
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:51,359
- The best, the guy's
a natural EMF detector.

68
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,659
- I've heard of you, Ted.

69
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,499
Your background is most impressive.

70
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,040
- Thanks.

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,382
Over here we have Ketchum and Monks.

72
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,642
Two veterans in the paranormal field.

73
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,822
They've forgotten more
than most of us know.

74
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,162
The young men over here
are Clegg and Shelly.

75
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,102
They'll be doing a video
documentation of the house.

76
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:11,782
- We're just glorified
interns man, that's all.

77
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,822
- Don't sell yourself short.

78
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,062
I saw the ORR piece you
guys shot with Discovery,

79
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,320
it was good stuff.

80
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,771
- You saw that?

81
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,991
- Thanks, man.

82
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,911
- And we have Erin Cooper, our resident

83
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,691
crystal ball, she hasn't
been with us very long

84
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:31,511
but has produced some
incredible results in that time.

85
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,531
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

86
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,531
- The pleasure is mine.

87
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:40,331
Well, I guess I'll
start with the briefing.

88
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:44,351
This house was built by a
man named Alfred Fischer.

89
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:48,011
Fischer was a notorious
conman, who made his fortune

90
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,870
peddling drugs and whores
on the carnie circuit.

91
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,331
What he built here was,
for all intensive purposes,

92
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,211
a whorehouse.

93
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,951
It became the most popular and successful

94
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:58,331
one of its day.

95
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:00,871
But, rumors of dark pagan rituals,

96
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,431
forced Fischer to close the doors.

97
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:06,291
Fischer was rumored to be an occultist.

98
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,150
Wealthy patrons filled his bank account

99
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,131
for a glimpse, and sometimes a taste,

100
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:15,531
of the power he supposedly wielded.

101
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,891
And eventually he just vanished,

102
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,171
no one knows for sure
what happened to him.

103
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,551
Some speculate that an
incantation gone wrong

104
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,851
claimed his life.

105
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,151
Quite possibly his soul.

106
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:29,250
But the house remained, and has become

107
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,191
one of the biggest hot
spots of paranormal activity

108
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,790
on the east coast.

109
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,990
I have to warn you folks,
this place makes Amityville

110
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,263
look like a spinning teacup ride.

111
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:43,251
The manifestations can
be harsh and jarring.

112
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:47,272
Some very nasty stuff put down seeds here.

113
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,212
- As long as we can catch it on film,

114
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:52,571
harsh is fine with us.

115
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,252
- I bought the place for
a song five years ago.

116
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:58,972
I have had numerous
parapsychologists and psychics here

117
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,993
to help me investigate the
place, and cleanse the horrible

118
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,973
energy that resides here.

119
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,692
Every attempt has failed.

120
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,252
You were brought in to take a crack at it.

121
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:12,373
And if you can, help
me cleanse this house.

122
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,632
I will give you enough funding
to keep your organization

123
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:18,013
going for a long time.

124
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,033
- Fair enough.

125
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:24,202
- So, let's get started.

126
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,033
- Okay, before we do...

127
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,772
- Is there a problem?

128
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,132
- I have the impression that there's a gun

129
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,192
under your jacket.

130
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,812
- Hm, damn you're good.

131
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,953
What gave it away, did
you smell the gun oil?

132
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,089
- Actually yeah I did.

133
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,149
(laughs)

134
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,289
- That is incredible.

135
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,689
I definitely hired the right people.

136
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:47,670
- Still, I have an issue with that.

137
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,510
- What do you mean?

138
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,569
- Well guns shoot bullets,
bullets kill people.

139
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,250
People like us.

140
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,869
- I certainly appreciate your concern,

141
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:58,870
but I assure you, the gun is meant only

142
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,210
for squatters, vandals and wild animals.

143
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,010
We are in proximity of
an abandoned asylum,

144
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,610
and although they closed the
gates over five years ago,

145
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,909
I do occasionally find
former patients walking here.

146
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,090
I do the best I can, but from time to time

147
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,530
receive unexpected guests.

148
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,469
The gun is merely for effect,
I have never fired it.

149
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,369
And I do have a permit to carry it.

150
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:24,710
- Still, it makes me nervous.

151
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,829
- I have no intention of putting it away.

152
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,730
But I will compromise with
you, seeing the obvious

153
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,490
distress it's causing.

154
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,210
I'll double your pay.

155
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,220
- That's more than fair, right Ted?

156
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,890
- Yeah, okay.

157
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,749
- Okay.

158
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,510
Now that we're all on the same page,

159
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,860
let's begin.

160
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,140
(eerie ambient noise)

161
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,779
(whispering in a foreign language)

162
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,140
- Erin!

163
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:19,509
Easy now.

164
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:20,369
- Are you alright?

165
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:21,790
Should I call a doctor?

166
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,090
- What the fuck happened?

167
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,775
- Relax, I'm fine.

168
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,835
Place just overwhelmed me for a second.

169
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:32,865
There's definitely
energy to be found here.

170
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:33,575
- What happened?

171
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,074
Did you see something?

172
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:38,515
- No, but I felt something.

173
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,214
It was a concentrated slap in the face,

174
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:41,755
and I wasn't ready for it so soon.

175
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,255
- You gonna be okay?

176
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:46,515
- Yeah, I'll be fine, it
comes with the territory.

177
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,595
- Why don't you uh,

178
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:49,774
knock the road dust off before we start?

179
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,935
Give Ms. Cooper an opportunity
to collect herself.

180
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,095
- Really, it's not necessary,
this isn't the first time

181
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,814
I've been sucker punched
in the line of duty.

182
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:59,355
- I insist.

183
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:00,895
Actually I have some
things I can attend to

184
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,755
just now.

185
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,455
Please make yourselves at home,

186
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:07,145
I'll return shortly.

187
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:15,785
- We'll be here when you're ready.

188
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,975
(beeping)

189
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,335
Listen, we gotta talk.

190
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,594
- Ted, there isn't a problem,

191
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,235
stop looking for one and for god's sakes

192
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:28,135
don't make one.

193
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:29,115
- I am responsible--

194
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,114
- You're responsible
for paying your bills,

195
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,495
I mean none of us are
in this for the money,

196
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:33,875
but we all have to eat.

197
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,814
If we treat this guy right,

198
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,654
and take advantage of this
marvelous opportunity,

199
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:41,175
we may just make something of ourselves.

200
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,015
Go outside, cool your heels,
we don't need you upsetting

201
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,574
the newbies with your trademark paranoia.

202
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,735
- He's right, you gotta
relax about this stuff.

203
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,195
This is the Fischer house,
man, the mecca east coast

204
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:52,835
horror house.

205
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,675
And not only are we here,
we've got a guided tour

206
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:58,354
and a paying gig, this is big time.

207
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,194
- I'll get some air.

208
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,715
This discussion isn't over.

209
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:07,064
Nobody leaves this room until I get back.

210
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,515
- What was that all about?

211
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,594
- Oh just papa bear worried about his cubs

212
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,454
going into the dark woods.

213
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:24,675
The usual pre-jitter routine
of our commander-in-chief.

214
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:25,515
You'll get used to it.

215
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,955
- Yeah, he's just overprotective.

216
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:30,482
- Well, I can take care of myself.

217
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:31,862
- Yeah?

218
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,482
I'm sure you can.

219
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:36,522
- So you guys think we'll
actually get anything here?

220
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:38,582
- Well, for the sake of
book and movie deals,

221
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,262
I sure hope so.

222
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:42,342
- And what about science?

223
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:45,572
- Yeah, that too.

224
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,362
- Try not to break the time code, okay?

225
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,182
It's such a pain the ass to load.

226
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,442
- Fine dude, chill, dude
one mistake and you never

227
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,645
let me forget about it.

228
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,602
- You do it all the time.

229
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:12,481
- So why bother making
a big deal out of it?

230
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,031
- You need stock?

231
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,721
- Yeah.

232
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,591
- I thought I told you
to buy some last week?

233
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:20,951
- Fuck, man, look I'm broke okay?

234
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:23,471
I'm sorry but my parents
stopped sending me checks,

235
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,451
and I'm gonna get taken to
court over my student loans.

236
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:27,431
- Man you need to learn to manage money.

237
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,191
- Oh I do, do I?

238
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:31,881
Thank you, I knew that.

239
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,591
Doesn't look like this
Stoker guy has a problem

240
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,711
with that now does he?

241
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:39,331
You know, one little
knickknack from this place

242
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,211
and I could probably pay
off my student loans--

243
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:44,191
- Man, don't even think it.

244
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:47,841
- I'm just talking here.

245
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,651
Fuckin' A.

246
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:52,661
It's good to be the king.

247
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:57,581
(beeping)

248
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:03,071
- [Stoker] Monks, can you hear me?

249
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,911
- [Monks] Loud and clear boss.

250
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,411
- Okay, here's how we'll play it.

251
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:09,411
Ted, I'd like you to
take the upper west wing,

252
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,671
Ketchum, you take the lower west wing.

253
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,591
Clegg and Shelly, I'd like
you to split the difference

254
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:16,191
between the upper and lower east wings.

255
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,951
Erin, you come with me,
I have some particular

256
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,991
hot spots I'd like to
investigate with you.

257
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,031
Are you up for it?

258
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,491
- Absolutely.

259
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,471
Listen, all of you, I was caught offguard

260
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,651
before, but I can handle
this, so no kid girls

261
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,528
or I'll kick all of your sorry asses.

262
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:35,888
- That's the Erin I know.

263
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,368
- Okay, if anyone has a problem, chime in.

264
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:42,258
Otherwise, let's keep channel one silent.

265
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,508
- Monks, Ketchum,

266
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:56,708
you read me?

267
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,248
- Yeah I just switched over to channel two

268
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,048
a few seconds ago.

269
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:01,968
What's with you and
this cell roaster shit?

270
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,628
You watch too many spy movies.

271
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,408
- [Ted] Are we alone
on this channel Monks?

272
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:08,088
- [Monks] As far as I can tell.

273
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,748
- Thoughts gentlemen?

274
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:12,108
- Regarding our eccentric host?

275
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:14,331
He seems okay to me.

276
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,447
- Wish I could say the same.

277
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,087
The guy isn't being straight
with us, I can tell.

278
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,887
There's something strange about him.

279
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,747
- If you have an aversion
to strange people, Ted,

280
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,747
my boy, you're in the wrong business.

281
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,187
- Yeah he's offering good money, Ted.

282
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,587
Money we're in need of.

283
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,707
And at twice the original rate.

284
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,067
- Something just doesn't
sit right with me.

285
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,627
The guy gives me a bad feeling, man.

286
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:40,267
- Leave the precognition to Erin okay?

287
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,677
I got work to do, I'm back on one.

288
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,607
- Monks.

289
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,687
- I'm still with you man.

290
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,487
- Am I being an overbearing prick again?

291
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,507
- Yeah, but, you know
you're just looking out

292
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,747
for your people.

293
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,247
- Well somebody has to.

294
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,167
God knows what would happen to you guys

295
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,547
if I wasn't around.

296
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:01,687
I'm switching back to one,

297
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,147
shake my cage if you need me.

298
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,487
- Will do.

299
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:08,637
(door slams)

300
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:14,517
(high-pitched ambient noise)

301
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:32,287
- Holy...

302
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,667
Oh yeah.

303
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,337
I bet that thing's worth a fortune.

304
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:43,757
(door creaks)

305
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:04,457
(loud sound effect)

306
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:16,445
(beeping)

307
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:31,635
- Bullet holes.

308
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:33,355
Monks.

309
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,275
Monks, you there?

310
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,905
I found something.

311
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,269
(beeping)

312
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,789
(echoing roar)

313
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,208
- Make a pretty decent horror flick here.

314
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,379
(whistling)

315
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,198
- [Voiceover] Ketchum, are
you making that racket?

316
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:25,738
- Sorry.

317
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:29,209
Pardon me, mein Fuhrer.

318
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:40,379
(ghastly ambient noises)

319
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:47,788
(distant tool tinging)

320
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,950
(tool tinging rapidly)

321
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,880
(laughter)

322
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,080
- Thanks.

323
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,740
That would've hurt.

324
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,440
- No doubt.

325
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,320
- Look, I hope you weren't
offended by what Ted said.

326
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,010
He's just very protective.

327
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,933
- And so am I, that's why I
insisted on keeping the gun.

328
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:01,582
- You don't really think
you're gonna need to use it

329
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:03,263
though, do you?

330
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,863
- Probably not.

331
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,583
But I have had to run a
few junkies and crazies

332
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,712
out of here, it's always
something to be concerned about.

333
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,222
- So where are we heading?

334
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,743
- Into the bowels of Hell.

335
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:20,603
Or actually, the backbone
of the establishment.

336
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:21,903
The service rooms are down here,

337
00:21:21,903 --> 00:21:26,232
it seems to be where most
of the energy resides.

338
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,343
Are you okay?

339
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,062
- There's something...

340
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:33,463
I don't know...

341
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:37,152
I just got this gnawing feeling inside.

342
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:41,102
I feel a lot of negative energy here.

343
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,883
- I've seen this place
turn a few people like you

344
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:46,062
inside out from the moment
they stepped in here.

345
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:49,162
But it's okay, nothing can hurt you.

346
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:52,613
I won't let anything hurt you.

347
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:29,622
(voices chatting in the distance)

348
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:41,899
(distant piano)

349
00:22:52,758 --> 00:22:56,958
(doorknob rattling)

350
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,268
- Fuck you.

351
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,968
(door creaking)

352
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,859
(ambient echoing sounds)

353
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:52,739
(zapping)

354
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:54,239
- Monks.

355
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,358
Monks, it's Ted, come in.

356
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,779
Monks!

357
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,598
- Go ahead big guy.

358
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,939
- [Voiceover] I'm still prowling,
probably will be for a while.

359
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,979
Anything happen?

360
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,359
- Nada, all systems are green.

361
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,579
- [Voiceover] Good, I'll
radio you if I find anything.

362
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:13,599
- Monks, Monks, Monks it's Ted

363
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,858
I don't know who the fuck that was,

364
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:16,518
but it wasn't me!

365
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:21,188
Monks, that wasn't me on channel one!

366
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:32,208
(echoing roar)

367
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,689
Shit.

368
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:47,439
(screaming and roaring)

369
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,279
- Hey uh, Sturgeon?

370
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,839
I lost you there, man.

371
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,307
Okay, there you are man, never mind.

372
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:03,806
- It begins, again.

373
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:09,627
- Oh.

374
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:16,867
Hello!

375
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,657
Hey!

376
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,437
Anyone there?

377
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:25,527
Clegg?

378
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:28,267
Sweet!

379
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:34,406
Hello.

380
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,237
What the fuck?

381
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:53,475
(laughs)

382
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:55,405
Oh my god.

383
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,315
Oh my god.

384
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:02,245
Oh!

385
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,474
(laughs)

386
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:06,934
I love you.

387
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:10,195
Hey, anyone there?

388
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,334
Clegg!

389
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:17,944
Oh my god.

390
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:21,622
Oh my god.

391
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:25,442
Holy!

392
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:35,762
Alright, cool.

393
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:40,782
Don't worry, it's all
going to a good cause.

394
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,082
Oh yeah.

395
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,092
Get...

396
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:47,842
Mine.

397
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,731
Oh my god.

398
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,162
Damn it.

399
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,882
Caught on tape, nice.

400
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:19,932
(loud ambient noises)

401
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,572
Shit.

402
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:26,992
Hey look, okay, I'm not a bad guy, okay?

403
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:30,421
I just...

404
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:33,792
I'm sick, I don't even know why I took it!

405
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,134
I have problems.

406
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:38,644
Look...

407
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:40,364
I'll just...

408
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:43,394
Everything goes back.

409
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,505
Good as new, right?

410
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:51,044
Please.

411
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:54,714
Don't hurt me, please!

412
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,465
This isn't real.

413
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,344
They can't hurt me.

414
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:02,505
Just, go away, please!

415
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,365
Just leave me alone!

416
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,765
Please go away!

417
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:10,134
The power of Christ compels you!

418
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:15,995
Oh shit, it worked.

419
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,134
Yeah!

420
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:23,824
That's right you pussy shit bags!

421
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:26,484
You don't fuck with Shelly!

422
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:30,005
- [Voiceover] Yo, Shelly,
what's happening dude?

423
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:30,865
- Hey!

424
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:31,824
- [Voiceover] Hey, you alright dude?

425
00:29:31,824 --> 00:29:34,324
- No I'm fine man.

426
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,664
- [Voiceover] You sure you're alright man?

427
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:37,585
- No, no, I'm good.

428
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,884
I just found out I had a
shit tape in the camera,

429
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,124
I lost a lot of really good stuff.

430
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:45,915
You really gotta spring
for better media, man.

431
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:48,925
Fuck me.

432
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:53,534
(heavy breathing)

433
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:14,655
Ah.

434
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,706
Fuck you.

435
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:27,465
(heavy breathing)

436
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:35,896
- What's your story?

437
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:38,955
Your gift, was it something
you were born with?

438
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:42,558
- Every woman on my
mother's side always had

439
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:44,638
intuition.

440
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:47,368
- Did you lose someone?

441
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:49,978
- My father.

442
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:54,358
I was 300 miles away in college
when it happened, but...

443
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:57,228
I knew he had died.

444
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,318
I knew before the phone call.

445
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,538
- I'm sorry.

446
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:04,458
- I guess that's when I
decided to use my abilities

447
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,958
to try and help people.

448
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:11,088
So, you've had a lot of
people in this place?

449
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:12,398
- A lot of people did
disappear when this place

450
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,878
celebrated its hay day.

451
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:16,978
- What do you think the story was?

452
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,958
Do you believe the rumors?

453
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,918
- Absolutely.

454
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:24,818
From the records I found,

455
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:26,438
I think Fischer was able
to accomplish something

456
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:29,638
in this house that we can only dream of.

457
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,158
The man was decades ahead of his time,

458
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:33,678
a true pioneer in the occult field.

459
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:35,458
I know he wasn't a hero.

460
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,318
Loose women and easy money
were as sacred to him

461
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:39,538
as anything we hold dear.

462
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:42,918
- That happens to people
sometimes I guess.

463
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,558
- I guess it does.

464
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:47,358
So, what brought you here?

465
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:50,218
It couldn't be the ambiance.

466
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,878
- Well before your phone
call, we were about ready

467
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:53,258
to close our doors.

468
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,178
Our funding was cut.

469
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:57,998
- I guess this is an
important gig for you guys.

470
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:02,408
- It's life or death.

471
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:15,448
(shower running)

472
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,348
(moaning)

473
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:01,563
(beeping)

474
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:54,488
(peeing)

475
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:56,268
- Uh.

476
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:59,938
Making the bladder gladder.

477
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:03,898
Next best thing to an orgasm.

478
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,278
(humming)

479
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:25,348
- Oh, I didn't know there was a gentleman

480
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:27,549
caller I had tonight.

481
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,648
Why...

482
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:34,169
Look at me, I'm not even
dressed for a visitor.

483
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,748
- Folks, we got a squatter here.

484
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,879
Hello, hello?

485
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,749
Looks like we have one
of those former patients

486
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,408
Stoker was mentioning.

487
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:46,509
- Who are you talking to?

488
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:49,589
- No one, obviously.

489
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,206
What are you doing here?

490
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,166
- Well, I live here.

491
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:57,666
The question is, what are you doing here?

492
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,506
Are you a thief?

493
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:04,796
Take what you will, but
please, don't hurt me.

494
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:06,946
- No, I'm uh...

495
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:10,506
Part of a research team,
I'm not here to hurt you.

496
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:13,946
- Well, I hope not.

497
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,846
There isn't much I could
do to fend off a strong man

498
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:18,986
like yourself.

499
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,426
Why I suppose you could
force me to your will

500
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:24,026
right here and now, and
there is nary a thing I could

501
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:27,156
do about that.

502
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,206
(laughs)

503
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:33,586
I'm Pauline, and you are?

504
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:34,706
- Um...

505
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:37,206
Ketchum.

506
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:39,706
- I see, so that's what you do to them...

507
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,906
Catch them.

508
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,476
And what do you do to
them after you catch them?

509
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:49,486
Something naughty, and not
at all proper, I'd imagine,

510
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:52,706
like all those fantasies
you've entertained.

511
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:57,426
Taking a woman by force,
subjecting her to your power,

512
00:35:57,426 --> 00:36:00,386
bending her to your will.

513
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:04,446
- Okay wait a minute, I get
it, this is a little fantasy

514
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,446
of mine.

515
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:09,806
Except usually I'm a
warden at a women's prison.

516
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:12,946
Don't even wanna ask what a
shrink would say about that.

517
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:13,966
(giggles)

518
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,466
- Why not enjoy it then?

519
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,926
I won't tell on you.

520
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,886
- I get it now.

521
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,046
It's all making sense.

522
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,026
The shower, you, this whole scenario.

523
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:27,556
The house is fucking with me.

524
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,566
This is a hallucination.

525
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,646
- You're a silly one.

526
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:36,406
Does this...

527
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:38,646
Feel like a hallucination to you?

528
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,126
- This is wrong.

529
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,686
What are you doing to me?

530
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:45,376
- What I do best, Mr. Ketchum.

531
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:55,076
Hey, what...

532
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:59,376
I've never been with a man before.

533
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,206
- Oh, oh.

534
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:06,126
- Ah, ah.

535
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:10,916
(heavy breathing)

536
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:26,246
- What the hell am I doing?

537
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,776
- How could you do this to me?

538
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:32,386
I told you I didn't want to.

539
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,646
Look what you've done to me.

540
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:38,786
- I don't know what
came over me, I'm sorry.

541
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:41,626
- You've ruined me.

542
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,686
You made me ugly.

543
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:46,206
- You're beautiful.

544
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:49,226
(roars)

545
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:53,796
(screaming)

546
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:04,946
(roaring)

547
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:09,696
(grunting)

548
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:18,916
(roars)

549
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,466
- Now you're the ugly one,

550
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:26,486
Mr. Ketchum!

551
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,346
How does it feel to be the weak one?

552
00:38:28,346 --> 00:38:33,346
The victim, flesh for the beast.

553
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:35,806
You had a taste,

554
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:39,806
and now I want a taste.

555
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:42,281
(death metal music)

556
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,632
(roars)

557
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,782
- This is so weird.

558
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,842
- What's that?

559
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,882
- I don't know.

560
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,442
This place feels

561
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:09,122
familiar.

562
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:12,302
It's like I've been in this room before.

563
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:15,622
- Yeah, you're the fourth
psychic who has felt that.

564
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,862
Deja vu I guess.

565
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:19,362
- So who were some of the previous people

566
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:20,282
you've brought in?

567
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,062
Anyone I would know?

568
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:23,442
- I don't think so.

569
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:25,942
- Try me, I follow a lot of people.

570
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:27,282
- Well I can't remember any of the names

571
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,502
off the top of my head right now.

572
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:33,502
Could we possibly focus on
the task at hand please?

573
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:35,082
- Sorry.

574
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,422
- No, I'm sorry.

575
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:39,122
It's just that we're in the
hottest room in the house

576
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:41,922
right now and I always get
a little nervous in here.

577
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,562
I didn't mean to snap,

578
00:39:43,562 --> 00:39:44,942
I'd be happy to look up some of the names

579
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:46,802
for you after we're done here.

580
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,882
- If you want, it isn't that important.

581
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:52,022
- Do you want me to leave while you..

582
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,882
You know, plug in?

583
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,462
- As much as I'd hate to be alone in here,

584
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,502
yeah you should.

585
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:02,142
Don't go too far?

586
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:05,872
- I'll be right outside.

587
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:39,082
Jimmy.

588
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:44,082
(loud echoing roar)

589
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:58,362
(deafening growling)

590
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:17,762
(high-pitched tone)

591
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:29,452
- Fischer.

592
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:32,562
- If you have what I desire,

593
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:37,562
there would be more than this.

594
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:45,839
- I ask for no more.

595
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,839
- Then that is what you shall receive.

596
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,679
What are you doing?

597
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,068
I paid for the amulet,
not for gypsy drama.

598
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,968
- What you are looking for has
to be hidden deep, Fischer.

599
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:15,378
Deeper than a mortal can look.

600
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:19,048
As deep as the soul.

601
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:35,418
I believe this is what
you are looking for?

602
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,358
Yes.

603
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:42,128
(ominous tone)

604
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:50,218
- And now here is, in my hands.

605
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:53,499
- To be added to your other curio perhaps?

606
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:56,798
A museum of magic to only gaze upon,

607
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:58,739
but never test.

608
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,679
- What I do is none of your concern.

609
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,358
- I see hunger in your eyes.

610
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,399
- Yes, I came from a
long line of hungry men.

611
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:11,919
- You listen to me, Fischer.

612
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:14,019
This is old magic,

613
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:16,239
older than time.

614
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,849
You use it wisely, or it
will have its way with you.

615
00:43:21,678 --> 00:43:24,481
It has a hungerous way.

616
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:28,061
- I'm not paying you for the gypsy one.

617
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:30,361
- And I'm not charging you for it.

618
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:34,601
It's all part of the service.

619
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:37,581
- Our business is done.

620
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,461
It's done with.

621
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:44,711
(mumbles)

622
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:04,331
(gurgling and grunting)

623
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:17,861
(distant laughing)

624
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:35,421
- I have been pacing this floor

625
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:37,241
for almost...

626
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,921
I don't know, an hour?

627
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:42,161
A little more, and nothing to report

628
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:46,871
except for a leaky radiator.

629
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,721
Ketchum!

630
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,141
What's up man?

631
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:55,691
(flashlight clicks)

632
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:58,501
Hey, did something happen?

633
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:01,351
Ketchum, wait up!

634
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:07,721
- Are you okay?

635
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,581
- Yeah, I think so.

636
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,841
- What happened?

637
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:14,101
- I had a vision of Fischer,

638
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:15,781
he appeared to me in this room

639
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,281
and showed me something.

640
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,821
Something to do with that medallion

641
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:20,001
that he wears in the painting.

642
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:20,981
- What about the medallion?

643
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:21,741
Did he show you where it is?

644
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:22,901
- John, you're hurting me!

645
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:25,201
- I'm sorry, I just...

646
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,441
I've never had anyone get anything

647
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:28,841
this substantial before.

648
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:31,541
You are as good as Sturgeon said.

649
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,461
Better.

650
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:34,761
Come on, there are other
rooms in the house.

651
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:37,301
- I just need a few minutes, okay?

652
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,441
That took a lot out of me.

653
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:41,661
- Of course, I apologize.

654
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:43,161
Please, catch your breath.

655
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:44,561
Take as long as you need.

656
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:47,591
- Thank you.

657
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,591
- Ketchum, are you okay?

658
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:09,493
(ball bouncing)

659
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:31,733
(door creaking)

660
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:39,593
(toys whirring)

661
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:51,943
- You like them?

662
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:54,663
I collect toys from all over the world.

663
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:58,283
- Shit, I didn't know anyone was in here.

664
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,703
Who are you?

665
00:46:59,703 --> 00:47:02,663
- I'm Cassandra, silly.

666
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:04,423
- You live here?

667
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:05,723
- Well, of course.

668
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:07,323
Where else would I live?

669
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:09,623
- Does anyone know you live here?

670
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:13,173
- You do.

671
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:18,243
You know, I've been watching you all day.

672
00:47:18,243 --> 00:47:23,243
I'm just curious, why are you
creeping around in the dark?

673
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:35,203
Did you come here to spy on me?

674
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:37,563
Catch me without my undies on?

675
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,503
Cause I never seem to wear them.

676
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:42,423
Or much else.

677
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:43,863
Do you mind?

678
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:46,043
- No.

679
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:47,983
I think it's refreshing.

680
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:49,923
Very European.

681
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,763
But still, I'd like to know why--

682
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:56,323
- So, why don't you take your clothes off?

683
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:59,263
- No, thanks.

684
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:02,143
So, listen, about you living here,

685
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:03,883
does the owner of the house know--

686
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,963
- The wicked, wicked boy.

687
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:09,993
I wanna show you my latest masterpiece.

688
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:14,523
Be careful!

689
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:19,133
If you break my toys
I'll get cross with you.

690
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,843
They're delicate.

691
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:27,313
But, most beautiful things are.

692
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,543
You like it?

693
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,743
- That's, that's good.

694
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:36,143
Really, really good.

695
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:38,063
- What kind of toy is that?

696
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:39,403
- You're joking right?

697
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:42,573
This isn't a toy, it's a very...

698
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,923
Well, okay, I guess it's a toy.

699
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:50,243
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, did
you come here to play with me?

700
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:51,303
- It's not like there's much else

701
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,483
going on out there.

702
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:55,383
Is that what you want?

703
00:48:55,383 --> 00:48:56,683
To play?

704
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,923
- So badly.

705
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:03,653
I mean it's so hard to
find a proper playmate.

706
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:07,403
- Oh man.

707
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,623
This is weird.

708
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:10,703
I mean,

709
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:13,303
you're hot.

710
00:49:13,303 --> 00:49:15,303
Even if you're psychotic or something,

711
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:17,223
you're definitely hot.

712
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:20,803
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

713
00:49:20,803 --> 00:49:23,823
But I'm here to investigate
the house, okay?

714
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:26,403
- Why don't you start with me?

715
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:27,623
I'm part of this house.

716
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:29,343
- No, that's not why I'm here.

717
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,543
- You're here because there's a hunger

718
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:34,483
deep inside you, and
this is the only place

719
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:36,503
that can satisfy it.

720
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:38,283
I mean come on, if you think you're here

721
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:43,283
for any other reason than
that, then you're a fool.

722
00:49:44,463 --> 00:49:48,033
- God, this has got to be a dream.

723
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:53,623
- This is what you want, isn't it?

724
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,143
What you crave in every sweaty little

725
00:49:56,143 --> 00:50:00,883
fantasy that plays in
your dirty little mind.

726
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:04,363
I'm just here to oblige it.

727
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:07,663
And if this is a dream,

728
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:11,263
well I can think of worse ones to have.

729
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:16,033
(guitars echoing)

730
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:24,093
(breathing heavily)

731
00:50:43,383 --> 00:50:45,103
- Hey, ow, ow!

732
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:47,063
What are you doing?

733
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:51,113
Don't, come on I don't like this.

734
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:53,523
Seriously, untie my hands!

735
00:50:53,523 --> 00:50:56,483
This is not funny, Cassandra.

736
00:50:56,483 --> 00:51:00,223
- (laughing) Oh, so my wicked
boy likes to be in control,

737
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,923
does he?

738
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:02,923
- Yes, that's the issue, okay?

739
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:04,203
I don't know you.

740
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:05,863
You could be a serial killer or something,

741
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:08,583
waiting to pull out a
butcher knife or something.

742
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:10,743
(knife tings)

743
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:13,863
- Shit, shit no, come on,

744
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:17,043
come on, put that away alright?

745
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:18,943
- I know a game.

746
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,483
Do you wanna play

747
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:25,523
tic-tac-toe?

748
00:51:25,523 --> 00:51:29,583
- Listen, this isn't funny, this...

749
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:33,283
Stop.

750
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:37,853
- Shut up, okay?

751
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:42,573
(laughs)

752
00:51:55,163 --> 00:52:00,163
(moaning)

753
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,943
- You scared the living shit out of me.

754
00:52:13,943 --> 00:52:17,153
- God, I was just fucking with you.

755
00:52:18,163 --> 00:52:22,243
- It looks like...

756
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:25,933
Looks like someone did get hurt though.

757
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:31,633
- No!

758
00:52:31,923 --> 00:52:34,263
This one was my favorite,

759
00:52:34,263 --> 00:52:37,213
you destroyed it.

760
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:39,863
- It's not like I could reach underneath

761
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:42,103
and pull it out with my hands tied

762
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:44,003
now could I?

763
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:47,123
- You ruined it!

764
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,643
- Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

765
00:52:49,643 --> 00:52:52,343
I'm very, very sorry.

766
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,963
I'm sorry.

767
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,103
Look, why don't we put some clothes on,

768
00:52:58,103 --> 00:52:59,623
and I'll introduce you to the other folks

769
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:01,803
I'm with here.

770
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,383
I know Stoker will wanna
have a word with you.

771
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:09,373
But we can eat, and figure
out why you're here.

772
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:13,143
You could go with me, if you like.

773
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:14,863
When I leave here.

774
00:53:14,863 --> 00:53:18,273
- It just means so much to me.

775
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:22,013
- I'll do anything to make it up to you.

776
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:28,023
- Anything?

777
00:53:28,023 --> 00:53:31,353
- Yes.

778
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:33,143
- Okay.

779
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,263
I'm gonna lead you.

780
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:37,463
Close your eyes,

781
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:40,023
and let me surprise you with something.

782
00:53:40,023 --> 00:53:41,923
- Something good right?

783
00:53:41,923 --> 00:53:44,703
- Something very, very good.

784
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:48,393
Something to take my mind off the toy.

785
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:52,703
- Alright.

786
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:54,923
But don't try to scare me again,

787
00:53:54,923 --> 00:53:57,933
I'm a professional.

788
00:54:04,863 --> 00:54:08,993
(loud banging)

789
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:11,763
You fucking crazy bitch!

790
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:12,823
I don't know what your story is,

791
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:14,123
but I'm gonna radio the others

792
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:16,443
and call the cops on you.

793
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:19,673
You're trespassing!

794
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:23,243
(loud roaring)

795
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:27,333
(gasping)

796
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:44,603
(gurgling)

797
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,696
- You wicked boy.

798
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,486
- Okay, summer campers,
it's counselor Monks,

799
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:15,866
just looking for a sound off.

800
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:18,246
- This is Stoker.

801
00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:19,686
- Hey Monks.

802
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:21,746
- This is Sturgeon, all is well.

803
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:24,006
- This is Clegg man,
everything's cool dude.

804
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,846
- Yeah, this is Ketchum, leave me alone

805
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,266
I'm trying to take a wiz.

806
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:30,086
- Uh, this is Shelly, checking in.

807
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:33,536
- Thanks guys, carry on.

808
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:44,076
(knocking)

809
00:55:47,406 --> 00:55:50,716
- The fuck?

810
00:56:00,686 --> 00:56:03,886
- Are you ready?

811
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:05,746
- Yeah.

812
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:08,006
Can you linger this time?

813
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:12,016
- Absolutely.

814
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:30,566
(distant growling)

815
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:40,046
(panting)

816
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,756
- Oh, no.

817
00:56:57,826 --> 00:57:02,196
(sobbing)

818
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:08,956
Ah.

819
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:14,276
(moaning)

820
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:22,116
No!

821
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:35,406
(laughing)

822
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:38,796
(screams)

823
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,880
(gun cocking)

824
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,690
- I thought you were gonna
stay with me in here?

825
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,850
- Sorry, slight change of plans.

826
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,590
- What are you doing John?

827
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,370
- What I have to do.

828
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,330
What they want me to do.

829
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,750
- Who are they, John?

830
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,430
- They go by many names.

831
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,030
Carnex, Carnivore from the Nexus,

832
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,850
Succubi.

833
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,070
That medallion is the
key to their kingdom,

834
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,990
and I want it Erin.

835
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,330
Every time I've gotten
this far with someone

836
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,190
they invariably get killed
before they find it.

837
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,110
What did you see?

838
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,070
- Monks, it's Erin.

839
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,710
Stoker's gone crazy.

840
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,290
He's threatening me with a gun.

841
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,130
- He can't hear you Erin.

842
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,460
The house has seen to that.

843
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:39,720
(grunting)

844
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,547
- [Voiceover] Monks, it's Erin.

845
00:58:43,547 --> 00:58:45,527
I'm heading to the control room,

846
00:58:45,527 --> 00:58:49,567
I have to talk to you.

847
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,297
- Uh, okay Erin.

848
00:59:03,647 --> 00:59:07,337
- There you are.

849
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,897
(gentle guitar)

850
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:19,647
- Erin.

851
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:22,767
Wow, that outfit.

852
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,347
Wow.

853
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:26,947
- I've been watching you, Monks.

854
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:28,607
Watching you,

855
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,607
watching me.

856
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:33,927
You've wanted me for a
long time, haven't you?

857
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:35,727
- For as long as I can remember.

858
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:39,097
Since the first time I met you.

859
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:46,287
- So take me.

860
00:59:57,497 --> 01:00:00,397
(distant roaring)

861
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:04,577
(death metal music)

862
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:07,577
Fuck me harder!

863
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:09,737
(panting)

864
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:13,377
- Erin.

865
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:14,597
Oh, shit.

866
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:16,117
(laughing)

867
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:17,857
Oh no.

868
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:20,017
- I should've known.

869
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:23,187
- What?

870
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:25,317
- You're pathetic, you know that?

871
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:27,417
I finally let a loser like you

872
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:30,337
have the opportunity of a lifetime,

873
01:00:30,337 --> 01:00:31,857
and you blew it.

874
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:34,037
- I was just a little excited.

875
01:00:34,037 --> 01:00:35,757
It's been a long time.

876
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,217
Believe me, just give me a minute.

877
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,317
- That's all you need isn't it?

878
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:44,007
- Christ, you don't have
to be so mean about it.

879
01:00:45,197 --> 01:00:50,197
- You are a little cock sucker,
is that the problem Monks?

880
01:00:50,497 --> 01:00:51,797
Do you like the cock?

881
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:52,877
- Stop talking to me like that,

882
01:00:52,877 --> 01:00:55,157
what is your problem?

883
01:00:55,157 --> 01:00:58,897
- I need a real man, that's my problem.

884
01:00:58,897 --> 01:01:02,437
Maybe Sturgeon or Clegg
wants to have a go?

885
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:04,217
We can fuck after I tell them

886
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:07,857
what a disappointment you were.

887
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:18,167
(roaring)

888
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:25,457
(organs squishing)

889
01:01:25,457 --> 01:01:29,127
(loud high-pitched music)

890
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:36,197
- Say, lover boy, I have an idea.

891
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:38,777
Why don't I take you to
meet the other girls?

892
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:42,867
Why they'll just eat you up.

893
01:01:56,617 --> 01:02:01,307
(all growling)

894
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:18,667
(breathing heavily)

895
01:02:44,477 --> 01:02:49,477
(loud ambient music)

896
01:02:51,557 --> 01:02:56,467
(breathing heavily)

897
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:25,817
(screaming)

898
01:03:47,937 --> 01:03:52,387
(gun cocking)

899
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:57,097
- I hope you had a nice nap.

900
01:03:57,097 --> 01:03:58,897
If you don't tell me what I want to hear,

901
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:01,817
you'll be taking a much
longer one very soon.

902
01:04:01,817 --> 01:04:03,377
- I don't know where the medallion is.

903
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:04,697
- Yes you do.

904
01:04:04,697 --> 01:04:06,657
You just don't realize it.

905
01:04:06,657 --> 01:04:07,837
Tell me what you saw in the room,

906
01:04:07,837 --> 01:04:09,877
that's all I need to know.

907
01:04:09,877 --> 01:04:13,627
- And if I do, you won't kill me?

908
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,257
- I won't kill you.

909
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:18,297
You have my word.

910
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:19,717
- Before I tell you,

911
01:04:19,717 --> 01:04:21,657
tell me something.

912
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,057
Why?

913
01:04:24,057 --> 01:04:25,517
- I love them.

914
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:27,757
And they love me.

915
01:04:27,757 --> 01:04:30,237
But there's more to it than that.

916
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:32,037
We spend our entire lives wondering what

917
01:04:32,037 --> 01:04:35,217
lies beyond this bag of skin we wear.

918
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:37,657
Those creatures are confirmation.

919
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:39,517
Confirmation that more
lies on the other side

920
01:04:39,517 --> 01:04:41,017
than we've ever dreamed possible.

921
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:42,417
They've opened a door.

922
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:45,017
And I intend to go through that door.

923
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:48,477
But I need the medallion
to completely control them.

924
01:04:48,477 --> 01:04:50,917
- And why haven't they killed you?

925
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:52,437
- I give them what they need.

926
01:04:52,437 --> 01:04:53,537
I feed them.

927
01:04:53,537 --> 01:04:54,857
- And what do you get out of it?

928
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:58,357
- They were beautiful women,
who Fischer sacrificed

929
01:04:58,357 --> 01:05:00,737
and imbued with the spirit of the succubi.

930
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:02,317
Do you really need to ask?

931
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:04,217
- How many times have you done this?

932
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:06,757
How many people have you led to slaughter?

933
01:05:06,757 --> 01:05:07,757
- I don't know.

934
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:10,077
30 or so since I bought the house.

935
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,557
You see, I'm killing two
birds with one stone.

936
01:05:12,557 --> 01:05:13,977
They won't show me exactly
where the medallion

937
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:16,837
is hidden, so I figured I'd
hire some parapsychologists

938
01:05:16,837 --> 01:05:20,017
and psychics, none of
them were the real deal.

939
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:23,077
You have surpassed them all.

940
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:26,597
- You are a fucking murderer.

941
01:05:26,597 --> 01:05:28,537
- I've never killed anyone,

942
01:05:28,537 --> 01:05:32,317
and I've never forced anyone
to come into this house.

943
01:05:32,317 --> 01:05:36,757
- In my vision, I saw a huge painting.

944
01:05:36,757 --> 01:05:40,137
It was a painting of Fischer
surrounded by three girls.

945
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:41,657
- I know where that painting is,

946
01:05:41,657 --> 01:05:44,117
there's only one like it in the house.

947
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:46,577
- So let me go.

948
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:50,097
- Let you go?

949
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:52,297
That wasn't the deal.

950
01:05:52,297 --> 01:05:54,417
I said I wouldn't kill you.

951
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:58,587
I didn't say you wouldn't die.

952
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:19,367
- Well hello there.

953
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:22,277
I'm Irene.

954
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:25,257
Haven't seen you here before.

955
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:26,977
I've seen many a man in this place,

956
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:29,417
and I never forget them.

957
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:32,577
Their faces, their musk,

958
01:06:32,577 --> 01:06:36,677
their taste.

959
01:06:36,677 --> 01:06:38,857
Don't say much do you?

960
01:06:38,857 --> 01:06:43,857
That's okay, I like
the strong silent type.

961
01:06:43,857 --> 01:06:47,837
As a matter of fact, I like any type.

962
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,157
Tell me, what type do you like?

963
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:54,037
You like the demure heroine?

964
01:06:54,037 --> 01:06:56,317
The harsh mistress?

965
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:59,717
The back alley whore?

966
01:06:59,717 --> 01:07:02,577
The neighbor's wife?

967
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:06,617
The distant cousin?

968
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:10,417
My you're a bashful one aren't you?

969
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:15,417
Well, don't be shy, tell Irene
all your dirty little longings.

970
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:18,557
I promise you I'll like them,

971
01:07:18,557 --> 01:07:23,147
and I can indulge every one of them.

972
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:27,077
Maybe you just like to watch.

973
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:30,947
Is that the case?

974
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,137
Do you like this body?

975
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:38,547
Do you want to touch me?

976
01:07:38,547 --> 01:07:40,037
Taste me?

977
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:43,757
Explore every inch of me.

978
01:07:43,757 --> 01:07:47,567
I'd like to taste you.

979
01:07:49,657 --> 01:07:52,477
- So uh...

980
01:07:52,477 --> 01:07:54,497
Are you a friend of Stoker's?

981
01:07:54,497 --> 01:07:56,777
(laughs)

982
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:58,917
- You could say that.

983
01:07:58,917 --> 01:08:01,517
Stoker and I go way back.

984
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:04,017
I met him when he first bought the house.

985
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:07,637
I was the first one to welcome him.

986
01:08:07,637 --> 01:08:11,317
And I'd like to welcome you as well.

987
01:08:11,317 --> 01:08:13,077
- Do you live here?

988
01:08:13,077 --> 01:08:15,437
Cause, he never said
anything about anybody

989
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:17,417
living here.

990
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,277
- Oh, must have slipped his mind.

991
01:08:20,277 --> 01:08:23,157
Such a big house, and
poor Stoker has so much

992
01:08:23,157 --> 01:08:26,847
on his mind.

993
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:29,257
- You're not his girlfriend are you?

994
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:30,797
- No.

995
01:08:30,797 --> 01:08:33,737
I don't have a boyfriend.

996
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:36,977
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

997
01:08:36,977 --> 01:08:41,687
- Uh, I...

998
01:08:42,677 --> 01:08:45,077
Well...

999
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:50,077
Hey, you're not one of
those, you know, crazy people

1000
01:08:50,217 --> 01:08:53,157
he was talking about are you?

1001
01:08:53,157 --> 01:08:55,538
- Now why would you say that?

1002
01:08:55,538 --> 01:08:58,518
- Oh I don't know, I mean...

1003
01:08:58,518 --> 01:09:03,518
You're naked and touching
yourself in front of me.

1004
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:07,838
I mean, it's totally cool,
I just, it's not usually

1005
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:09,098
an ice breaker, that's all.

1006
01:09:09,098 --> 01:09:11,098
- Silly boy.

1007
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:12,398
Don't you know when a
girl's just trying to

1008
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,938
get your attention?

1009
01:09:15,938 --> 01:09:19,628
- No, not really.

1010
01:09:21,278 --> 01:09:25,508
(soft guitar)

1011
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:36,458
(death metal music)

1012
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:52,338
- Come on.

1013
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:53,998
Come on, fuck me.

1014
01:09:53,998 --> 01:09:56,318
(laughing)

1015
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:57,738
- I can't believe this.

1016
01:09:57,738 --> 01:09:59,598
You are so fucking hot.

1017
01:09:59,598 --> 01:10:01,118
- Harder.

1018
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:05,148
Harder, harder!

1019
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:07,558
- What the fuck?

1020
01:10:07,558 --> 01:10:09,418
Don't do that you crazy bitch!

1021
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,758
- (laughing) That's right, that's right.

1022
01:10:12,758 --> 01:10:16,298
Crazy bitch, you're a crazy bitch.

1023
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:19,698
Now split me in half.

1024
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:22,518
Come on you little runt!

1025
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:26,858
- God damn it, don't
fucking do that again!

1026
01:10:26,858 --> 01:10:30,138
- Lay back and enjoy the ride pretty boy.

1027
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:33,558
(roaring)

1028
01:10:33,558 --> 01:10:37,208
(yelps)

1029
01:10:38,418 --> 01:10:42,568
(screaming)

1030
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:05,258
(blood dripping)

1031
01:11:10,178 --> 01:11:12,418
- Those are my girls.

1032
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:16,988
As deadly as they are beautiful.

1033
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:51,248
(cane tapping on floor)

1034
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:17,348
(laughing)

1035
01:12:21,278 --> 01:12:24,678
(crunching and squishing)

1036
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,698
(screams)

1037
01:12:27,698 --> 01:12:31,928
(roaring)

1038
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:47,378
- Aw, look at the little birdy.

1039
01:12:47,378 --> 01:12:51,318
Can we play with it before
we rip its wings off?

1040
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:54,598
- The way she stares at me.

1041
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:57,658
She's undressing me with her eyes.

1042
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:00,698
She wants to ravish me, I can tell.

1043
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:05,278
- I love saving the prettiest for last.

1044
01:13:05,278 --> 01:13:08,898
- It's been so long
since we've had company.

1045
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:11,998
And even longer since a proper meal.

1046
01:13:11,998 --> 01:13:14,478
- You tend to your hunger, Cassandra,

1047
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:16,498
and I'll tend to mine.

1048
01:13:16,498 --> 01:13:18,678
- What are you?

1049
01:13:18,678 --> 01:13:21,618
- Famished, darling.

1050
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:25,938
- Let's just put the poor
thing out of her misery.

1051
01:13:25,938 --> 01:13:30,368
(all laughing)

1052
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:39,448
- Get the fuck away from me!

1053
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,738
- We thought that might
bring you to your senses.

1054
01:13:48,738 --> 01:13:52,668
Welcome home.

1055
01:13:59,078 --> 01:14:04,078
(eerie ambient noise)

1056
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:39,118
(laughing)

1057
01:14:39,118 --> 01:14:42,728
- I am so impressed with you.

1058
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:45,198
Everyone else, wiped out.

1059
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,108
But you, you're a survivor.

1060
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:52,818
You know I hate to trip you up
this close to the finish line

1061
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:57,818
kid, but I can't very well
leave any witnesses, can I?

1062
01:14:58,718 --> 01:15:03,088
By the way, that gown looks lovely on you.

1063
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,818
It's a perfect choice for the

1064
01:15:04,818 --> 01:15:09,178
grand finale of tonight's little drama.

1065
01:15:09,178 --> 01:15:13,538
- Just do whatever it
is you're going to do.

1066
01:15:13,538 --> 01:15:16,898
I'm tired, and I don't wanna stare at your

1067
01:15:16,898 --> 01:15:19,588
fucking face anymore.

1068
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:21,938
- You're right.

1069
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,938
We should get this over
with, I'm looking forward to

1070
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:26,438
spending a little quality
time with the girls.

1071
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,148
Kill her.

1072
01:15:29,148 --> 01:15:32,178
(roaring)

1073
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:35,645
- Why would they kill one of their own?

1074
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:38,415
- Hey!

1075
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:40,095
Why would you do this to me?

1076
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:41,535
We had a deal!

1077
01:15:41,535 --> 01:15:43,775
I've given you everything
you've ever asked for!

1078
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:47,805
- You broke our only rule!

1079
01:15:48,415 --> 01:15:50,395
- Well I wasn't gonna hurt you with it!

1080
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:52,675
- No, you were going to do worse.

1081
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:55,335
You were going to control us with it.

1082
01:15:55,335 --> 01:15:58,375
- Well you forgot something, Stoker.

1083
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,775
That's why Erin came back.

1084
01:16:00,775 --> 01:16:03,075
To set things right.

1085
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:04,315
- Erin?

1086
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:05,595
- You didn't honestly think

1087
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,435
we were all trapped in here now did you?

1088
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,835
- All along, you knew.

1089
01:16:10,835 --> 01:16:13,955
- And now I know why.

1090
01:16:13,955 --> 01:16:16,795
Feels so good to be in the old place.

1091
01:16:16,795 --> 01:16:19,595
In the old flesh.

1092
01:16:19,595 --> 01:16:20,915
We do have to do something about that

1093
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:23,635
bothersome medallion though, don't we?

1094
01:16:23,635 --> 01:16:27,015
- Yes, absolutely, let's destroy it!

1095
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:30,315
That is why I sought it out
after all, to protect you.

1096
01:16:30,315 --> 01:16:33,275
You didn't honestly think I
was gonna use it against you?

1097
01:16:33,275 --> 01:16:35,115
Let's destroy it and I'll
have a fresh crop of people

1098
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:36,455
in here in no time!

1099
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:37,775
More than ever before,
now that we have an extra

1100
01:16:37,775 --> 01:16:39,395
mouth to feed.

1101
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:43,415
- Unfortunately the
medallion can't be destroyed.

1102
01:16:43,415 --> 01:16:45,755
But I know the next best thing.

1103
01:16:45,755 --> 01:16:48,455
We'll put it somewhere for safe keeping.

1104
01:16:48,455 --> 01:16:50,995
The usual place.

1105
01:16:50,995 --> 01:16:55,075
Oh, John, we're gonna
need your help for this.

1106
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:58,315
And you'd love to help us wouldn't you?

1107
01:16:58,315 --> 01:17:02,205
- Of course, I live to serve you all.

1108
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:13,915
(loud shrieking)

1109
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:18,245
(death metal music)

1110
01:17:34,015 --> 01:17:39,015
(laughing)

1111
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:49,475
(loud grunting and roaring)

1112
01:18:03,975 --> 01:18:06,895
- Think we'll be waiting
long for others to come?

1113
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,795
I'm hungry.

1114
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:13,055
- Such an appetite for
such a slight thing.

1115
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:15,415
- I'm a growing girl.

1116
01:18:15,415 --> 01:18:18,575
- It's always so lonely here.

1117
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:21,095
- There's enough greed and
lust in the hearts of men

1118
01:18:21,095 --> 01:18:25,435
to keep our doors open
for a very long time.

1119
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:29,065
Others will come.

1120
01:18:31,075 --> 01:18:35,485
(gloomy ambient music)

1121
01:19:03,495 --> 01:19:06,615
- [Voiceover] Flesh for the beast.

1122
01:19:06,615 --> 01:19:11,165
(death metal music)
