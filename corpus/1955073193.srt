1
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,261
<i> Tonight,</i>
<i>investigators are</i>
<i>questioning the credibility</i>

2
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:02,261
<i> of those clinical trials.</i>

3
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:07,266
<i> I'm very angry. I can't</i>
<i> believe doctors could betray</i>

4
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,301
<i> so many people.</i>

5
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,372
<i> I was part</i>
<i>of the initial test group</i>
<i>for the drug vypraxilin.</i>

6
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,806
<i> And...</i>

7
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:19,178
<i> I can say without a doubt it</i>
<i> was probably</i>
<i> the worst decision</i>

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,846
<i> I've ever made in my life.</i>

9
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,415
<i> These people knowingly</i>
<i>put out inaccurate information</i>

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,251
<i> and they were being selective</i>
<i> in the facts about the case.</i>

11
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,488
<i> She looked at me</i>
<i> and then collapsed.</i>

12
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,591
<i> Her mouth filled with blood</i>

13
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:34,193
<i> and it was terrifying.</i>

14
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:40,666
<i> In fact, an</i>
<i>investigation by the fda found</i>
<i>no evidence of false data</i>

15
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,101
from pierson pharmaceuticals.

16
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,872
<i> This is the third</i>
<i> death attributed</i>
<i> to the medication,</i>

17
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:50,742
<i> with many more claims</i>
<i> surfacing each day.</i>

18
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,478
<i> They need</i>
<i> to be held accountable.</i>

19
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,285
<i> We should just leave</i>
<i> and go to London for a while.</i>

20
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,157
Wouldn't that
seem guilty if I just
left the country?

21
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,292
And what would
you tell them
if they accuse you?

22
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,694
The truth?

23
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,363
Well, I've
faced inquiries
before. I can...

24
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,464
I'm not gonna
run away.

25
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,601
I'm not talking about
running away, Arthur.

26
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,503
I'm talking about
clearing your head,

27
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,338
getting out
of town together
like we said.

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,173
Yeah.

29
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:21,673
Yeah?

30
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,211
Any updates?
Just give him
a little privacy.

31
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,346
Don't talk
to me.

32
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,550
Yeah,
you tell Dr. shuman to
get back in the lab immediately

33
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,419
and get this thing
sorted out.

34
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,889
Immediately. You do it,
or I'll get someone
else who can.

35
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,757
Just do it.

36
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,327
Now.

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,596
Okay, look, I got
to get back
to the...

38
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,365
I'm going back
to the office.

39
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,901
They can't do anything
unless I'm there
holding their hand.

40
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:51,803
Why don't you
ever consider anything
i say to you?

41
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,273
It's your
greatest fault.
You know that?

42
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,775
You know what, maybe
I'll just leave town
without you, Arthur.

43
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,310
Come on.

44
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,279
Graham will take
you home and I'll
see you tonight.

45
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,780
Okay.
Emily, come on.

46
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,682
Stop being
a child.
Grow up.

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,384
Fuck you.

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,720
Let her go.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Emily?

50
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,396
She'll come around.

51
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,806
Our exposure's limited
at best.

52
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,641
Oh, yeah?

53
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,611
Well, there's no
such thing
as limited exposure.

54
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,813
Got the deposition
tomorrow and I need
you to cover this.

55
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,617
Get Jake coburn
in legal. I want
a strategy before I leave.

56
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,320
Sir, we advise you
against answering
any questions at this time.

57
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,487
Duly noted.

58
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,426
Emily?

59
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,905
Emily!

60
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,952
Where the hell is she?

61
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,754
Emily!

62
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,256
I'm gonna
grab you
some dinner.

63
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,658
I'll call in
the usual.

64
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,869
Don't step anywhere
inside this house.
Don't touch anything.

65
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,505
Get security up here
right now.

66
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,573
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,945
So there was
no more contact
after you left the park?

68
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:17,516
I figured it was just
another call for attention.
That's all.

69
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,418
Yeah, it could be.

70
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,755
Jane is the advisor we retained.
Private org. Kidnap and rescue.

71
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,592
I should advise you, sir,
to involve the FBI.

72
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,528
I've employed you
so I don't
have to.

73
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,800
Right now, your girlfriend
is alone and scared

74
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,868
and praying that someone
will save her life.

75
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,105
In 11 hours, Emily
could be home or dead.

76
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,708
If this is gonna work you're
gonna have to trust me.
You understand?

77
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,044
So what are
the next steps?

78
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,880
The tech team is working
on your phone
to trace the sender.

79
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,450
When these people
reach out again and
we know what they want,

80
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,820
Jane will help color
who they are.
They need us to open up.

81
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,123
All confidential passwords,
everything will need
to be transparent.

82
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,393
Tell me, are they likely
to harm her, hurt her?

83
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,662
Yes.

84
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,664
You don't sugarcoat
your responses, do you?

85
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,065
Why the fuck
would I do that?

86
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,625
What do they want?

87
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,828
Two and a half million
dollars, unmarked.

88
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,766
Octavia gallery by 1:00 P.M.
or they cut her open.

89
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,534
Can your team prep by 1:00?

90
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,404
It'll be tight.
It's lunchtime.
There's lots of exits.

91
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,639
We can expect
heavy foot traffic.

92
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,474
We'll have snipers
cover the exterior.

93
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,611
Snipers? We don't need
snipers. I've got the cash.

94
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,646
<i> Let's do this civilly</i>
<i> and quietly.</i>

95
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,195
<i> I'm right behind you.</i>

96
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,006
<i> You tailing him?</i>

97
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,508
Yeah, I've got
eyes on him.

98
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:27,212
<i> Do not turn around.</i>

99
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,715
<i> Do not acknowledge</i>
<i> that you can hear me.</i>

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,921
<i> Wait for them</i>
<i> to approach you, Mr. denning.</i>

101
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,795
<i> You have him? He's out</i>
<i> of my line of sight, Jane.</i>

102
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,698
Relax.

103
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,945
I know this is hard,
but I need you to stay
calm as ice.

104
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,551
<i> Approaching on your right.</i>

105
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,819
She remind you
of someone you know?

106
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,822
Yeah.

107
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,991
Like most women,
she's expensive.

108
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,661
You want
to talk a deal?

109
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,631
<i> Drop the bag.</i>
<i> Just drop the bag.</i>

110
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,999
Let's go
somewhere quiet.

111
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,235
Okay.

112
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,241
Do not follow him. Mr. denning,
you have to trust me.

113
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,575
<i> Do you hear me?</i>

114
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,913
<i> What's he looking at?</i>
<i> Why is he stopping? Jane?</i>

115
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,081
<i> I don't know.</i>

116
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,081
<i> He's off script.</i>
Yeah.

117
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,084
<i> Stop, Mr. denning.</i>
<i> You're putting</i>
<i> your life at risk.</i>

118
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:39,084
<i> This could part of their plan.</i>

119
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:43,221
<i> Drop the money.</i>
<i> Give it to him,</i>
<i> then we'll go away.</i>

120
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,523
Just one thing.

121
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,930
You see what happens
when you fuck with me?

122
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,565
Where's Emily?
Who?

123
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,666
Where is she?

124
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,268
I don't know
what you're saying!

125
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,737
You hurt her?
Where's Emily?

126
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,609
<i> Jane? What the fuck</i>
<i> just happened?</i>

127
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,216
<i> He just attacked him.</i>
<i> Get him out of here now.</i>

128
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,718
<i> Get him out.</i>

129
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,982
Yeah.

130
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,786
Oh, come on.
Don't turn into
that guy.

131
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,120
You just won
an estate claim

132
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,089
where the widow's husband
didn't have a will.

133
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,924
It's time to party.

134
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,961
Call your wife. Tell her
to bring a friend, actually...

135
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:59,130
Maybe a chesty one,
some kind of assets.

136
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,704
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna take out
your wife myself.

137
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,873
Since when are you
interested in women?

138
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,241
Ben Cahill,
was that a joke?

139
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,377
That was fun.

140
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,245
Eleven straight.
Congrats.

141
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,981
Any calls?

142
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,215
Hatty, you're gonna
have to excuse Ben.

143
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,151
That's how
he shows his joy.
Right.

144
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,987
Couple folks from
the lake Avenue
construction case,

145
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,090
that Chinese guy from
shai fen associates,
and your wife.

146
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,960
Okay. Can you ask
the paralegals why
those Flynn v. Benson files

147
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,261
haven't shown
up yet, please?
Yeah.

148
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,834
You have been a machine
for over a year now.

149
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:39,037
I know you and Charlotte have
had a devastating few months,

150
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,773
but billing 100 hours
a week is not gonna
help you get through that.

151
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,342
It's not gonna
help you make partner,

152
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,879
and it's not gonna keep
our wife happy.

153
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,148
You've got to get out
of this office.

154
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,054
Wow, you are
no fun at all. Okay.

155
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,857
Well, I'll take that.
Thank you.

156
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,324
You trying
to scare me?

157
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,026
Well, you just
look so focused
over there.

158
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,062
You got good news?

159
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,097
Another win.

160
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,000
So I was hoping maybe
we could celebrate.

161
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,336
I can't.
I picked up
another shift.

162
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,074
All right, well...

163
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,475
I guess
I'll see you
in 36 hours.

164
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,813
You know
we're understaffed.

165
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,115
No, no, no, no.
I get it. I get it.

166
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,883
There's chicken pie
in the oven
if you're hungry.

167
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,722
I hate waking up
without you, Charlie.

168
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,360
Well, um...

169
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,364
You wanna
go on a date?

170
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,267
Yeah.

171
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,203
When?

172
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,171
When I'm done.

173
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,041
Deal.

174
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,146
You look nice.

175
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,347
Thank you.

176
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,863
Emily hynes?

177
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:31,543
<i> You didn't accept, did you?</i>

178
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,146
<i> She had her issues,</i>
<i> but it's not like I can't...</i>

179
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,915
<i> Issues? Yeah.</i>

180
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,384
You broke her heart. She
threatened suicide.
That's not normal.

181
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,853
I remember
some pretty
manipulative shit.

182
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,491
I'm actually impressed
someone your age knows
how to use social media.

183
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,159
Oh, really?
Yeah.

184
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,494
Is that right?

185
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,062
You accepted
the friend request,
didn't you?

186
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,330
So what if I did?

187
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,365
Your wife's
a 12!
Yeah.

188
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,468
She's far more attractive
than you. She's far more
intelligent than you.

189
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,471
Frankly, you don't
deserve her.
Yeah, well...

190
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,307
Okay, don't break
the only good thing
in your life

191
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,375
on a hypothetical...
I'm not
breaking anything.

192
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:08,546
Charlie and i
are fine, all right?
I love my wife.

193
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,448
Yeah, we've had
a rough year,
but you know what?

194
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,518
I'm not gonna mess
it up over some stupid
fucking friend request.

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,854
Just keep talking
to your ex.
Keep talking to Emily.

196
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,090
I think that's a good idea.
You're gonna spend
your 4:00 A.M.'s drunk,

197
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,159
eating burritos
over the sink.

198
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,395
I love burritos.

199
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,398
Yeah, I kind of
love them, too.
Yeah.

200
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,886
God, really?

201
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,555
Paranoid much?

202
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,460
You're three minutes
and 32 seconds late, pal.

203
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,329
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're looking sharp.

204
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,932
Huh?

205
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,208
The estate claim
cashed in?

206
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,010
Yep.

207
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,544
So I take it the info

208
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,413
I put in Mrs. takiff's
file worked?

209
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,616
Mrs. takiff would have lost
everything if we wouldn't
have helped her.

210
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:23,021
I already starting
fixing this new
Benson vs. Flynn file.

211
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,522
You know,
i was thinking,
one of these days,

212
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,157
you may actually
win a case
without cheating.

213
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,226
It's not cheating...

214
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,561
Not if the good guy wins.

215
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,299
So you're
the good guy.

216
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,478
Emily! How are
you doing?
Hi.

217
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,612
I'm great.
How are you?

218
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,747
Good to
see you.

219
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,148
Good to
see you.

220
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,317
Wow.
Is it
10 years?

221
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,752
I think so, yeah.
It's been
ten years?

222
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,121
Oh, my god! Yeah.
Can you
believe it?

223
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,557
You are
not a lawyer.

224
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,158
Is that so hard
to believe? Really?

225
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,027
Yes, yes,
it is so hard
to believe.

226
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,630
The undisputed beer pong
champ really, goes on
to do great things.

227
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,165
Yeah, well, nothing
screams success

228
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,134
like a student loan
that I can't pay off.

229
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,070
Oh, come on, Ben.
You knew what you wanted,
and you went for it.

230
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,573
I think that's great.
Yeah.

231
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,175
Ambition always was
one of the sexiest things
about you.

232
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,276
Oh, really?
Yeah.

233
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,648
So what
about you?
How you been?

234
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,585
I've been
fine, yeah.

235
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,153
Yeah?

236
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,155
Seems like you've
been having
a good old time,

237
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,225
judging by your
half-naked photos
that I saw online.

238
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh, you've been...

239
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,163
Really? You've been
cyberstalking me, Ben?

240
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,731
I wasn't
cyberstalk...
I was just...

241
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,100
Intrigued.

242
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,268
Oh, intrigued, okay.

243
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,103
I was curious.
That's all.

244
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,338
Okay.

245
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,208
So how is
it being married?

246
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,812
It's complicated.

247
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,049
"I do. You do."
Seems pretty
self-explanatory to me.

248
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,484
Well, that's
the easy part.
And then there's...

249
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,820
It's just complicated.

250
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,627
Well, I'm dating
a guy who's completely
not right for me,

251
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,662
and he wants
to get serious,
and I don't.

252
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,400
And I came here
tonight to see you...

253
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,306
But you're wearing
a wedding ring.

254
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,574
Yeah.

255
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,111
And you're happy?

256
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,318
Right?

257
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,554
Why do
you ask?

258
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,791
I should run.

259
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,661
No, no, no. Wait.
No, I really...

260
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,596
Please, this is
a bad idea.

261
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,298
I don't want
to overstep.

262
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,799
I don't want
to say something
that I'm gonna regret.

263
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,868
I don't even know
what I was thinking
would happen tonight.

264
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,504
I feel really stupid.
I just...

265
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,640
Nothing is
gonna happen.
We're just...

266
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,242
We're just
gonna sit and talk.
That's all.

267
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,879
I don't think
so, Ben.

268
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,453
Hey, what's going on?

269
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,858
It's a disaster.

270
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,495
I feel like such a cliché.
I'm dating my boss.

271
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:54,365
Technically he's
everyone's boss.
He's the ceo of pierson.

272
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,666
You're dating
Arthur denning?

273
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,402
Yeah.
Holy shit!

274
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,738
I was his head of sales.
I'm not a gold digger,
you know.

275
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,407
Arthur can be really
charming when he
wants to be.

276
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,144
Well, if your heart's
not in it, why don't
you just leave him?

277
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,714
He won't let me.

278
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,249
What do you mean,
he won't let you?

279
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,783
I mean he
won't let me.

280
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,853
It started with threats,
you know, implying I would
lose my job.

281
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,722
Is he
hurting you?

282
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,493
I was on his laptop,
and I found data

283
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,929
about the clinical trials
that went bad last summer.

284
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,264
From viprexalin.

285
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,168
268 people died.

286
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,203
You know what Arthur
was concerned about?

287
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,337
What?
How the deaths

288
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,739
would affect
his financials.

289
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,507
Did he say that
in the emails?

290
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,778
Try to remember
if he actually
addressed the deaths

291
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,547
from viprexalin
in these emails.

292
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,951
I'm not sure.
I mean, maybe.

293
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,420
Where is this data?
Do you still have it?

294
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,722
Arthur would know
that it came from me.

295
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,326
Well, we can make
it look like it came
from someone else.

296
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,761
Oh, rea... how?

297
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,464
I can help you
with this, okay?

298
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,234
Now, do you want
my help or not?

299
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,705
Do you mind
grabbing that
for me?

300
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,443
Thank you.

301
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,483
Hey. Thought
i heard you.

302
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,320
I can't remember if
i took your Pinot noir
or grigio from you.

303
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,589
It's okay.
I'm detoxing.

304
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,993
Hi.
Hello, tall guy.

305
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,598
Oh, I'm just here...
We're just
friends, okay?

306
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,866
I'm just here
on business,
you know.

307
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,302
Okay.

308
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,837
Have fun, Hanna.
Thanks.

309
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,309
Hanna?
Yeah.

310
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,514
Most nights I spend
in an apartment that
Arthur bought for me,

311
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,316
but here,
i can escape
all that.

312
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,386
Here, I can be
a regular girl
named Hanna Harlow,

313
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,856
who reads trashy magazines
and watches reality TV

314
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,591
and exists in sweats.

315
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,828
Does your boyfriend
know that you own
this place?

316
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,031
I'm only here
when he's out
of town.

317
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,366
No, I can't stay.

318
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,602
It's just a drink.

319
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,419
Okay.

320
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,425
Let's see. Escrows,
bank transfers.

321
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,062
Look at that.

322
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,766
There are hundreds of millions
hidden in offshore
bank accounts here.

323
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,302
These are
documented payoffs...

324
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,006
That required
a fingerprint I.D.

325
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,642
Denning validated
all of these personally.

326
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,544
Arthur made changes
to the internal
lab results,

327
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,646
because he knew the fda
wouldn't approve them.

328
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,415
Oh, you've
definitely got
the groundwork

329
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,884
for a gigantic
civil lawsuit
here, but I can't...

330
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,853
I can't use this.

331
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,623
Why not?

332
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,925
You said we could make
it look like it came
from someone else.

333
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,629
What comes next
is our secret.

334
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,500
Denning finds out
that you leaked this,

335
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,337
you'll be exposed.

336
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,076
Expose what you want.

337
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,657
Unzip me.

338
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,619
I didn't say
you could touch.

339
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,992
Oh, my god.

340
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,947
Come here.

341
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,752
Oh, my god. No.

342
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:15,853
What are you
waiting for?

343
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,591
Don't you want
to fuck me?

344
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,962
Holy shit.
I can't...

345
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,041
I can't do it.

346
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,713
I can't do it.

347
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,493
Ben.

348
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,764
Take the
fire escape.

349
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,067
Don't let my neighbor
stop you. She'll talk you
to death.

350
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,974
Or you can
finish what
you started.

351
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,747
I can't.

352
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,154
Have fun?

353
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,626
You smell
like vodka.

354
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,130
Doug opened up
one of his
office bottles.

355
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,370
We ended up
working late,
ate thai.

356
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,139
Yeah?
Yeah.

357
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,041
What did
you have?

358
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,644
Oh, noodles,
spicy noodles.

359
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,945
They weren't great.

360
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,255
Anyway, I think
I'm gonna go
shower. I'm tired.

361
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,394
Are you serious
right now?

362
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,001
Did you forget
about date night?

363
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,773
I wouldn't have
been any fun anyway.

364
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,975
I worked a double,
so I'm a zombie.

365
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,344
No, no, no, no.
Let me make this
up to you this weekend.

366
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,947
You're off the hook.

367
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,216
No, goddamn it.
We need a night.

368
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:36,387
You and me. We need
to get back
to normal, all right?

369
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,889
I'll join
you upstairs.
Thank you.

370
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,963
Give us
a minute.

371
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,233
The information against
Arthur denning
you gave me, is it legit?

372
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,703
Because if you're wrong,
you'll be doing
document review

373
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,237
for the rest
of your career.

374
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,077
Abrams' office,
five minutes. Brief him
on what you have.

375
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,245
Keep it short.
Do not fuck up.

376
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,920
Senior partner
just threatened you.
You're moving up.

377
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,823
Wait, so you
have information
against Arthur denning,

378
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,058
like, the Arthur denning?

379
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,160
You don't fuck
with a guy like him.

380
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,463
He and Mr. Abrams
are at war,
so tread lightly.

381
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:53,864
I'll fill you
in later.

382
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,201
Hope you have
your affairs in order.

383
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,450
Mr. Abrams.

384
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,119
Mr. Cahill. Come on in.

385
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,354
Wow.

386
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,822
Have a seat.

387
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,964
So, hill tells me
you have something.

388
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,166
Yeah, with
pierson pharmaceuticals.

389
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,269
You're not serious,
are you?

390
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,338
We go way back
with them, you know,

391
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,875
so that's like pissing
in the wind, son.
You know, I...

392
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,378
You've gone after
Arthur denning before,

393
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,448
and it was one
of the only cases
that this firm ever lost.

394
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,819
Now, I have studied
every word of every
motion filed and...

395
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,123
Well, with all due
respect, I don't think
that you played

396
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,858
your cards
quite right
last time.

397
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,128
Oh, you don't?

398
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,397
Look, denning's
team forged
expert reports

399
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,200
that allowed
him to slip
by fda approval.

400
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:06,570
They knowingly changed
the observation and conclusions
of these drug trials.

401
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,205
Take a look
at this. There were...

402
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:12,376
These are facts I know.
I know about this stuff.
Come on.

403
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,911
Serious health
defects, 268...

404
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,512
But you're
not telling me

405
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,881
how you're gonna
win this time. That's
what I want to hear.

406
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,217
Well, I've got...

407
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,322
Confidential internal memos

408
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,958
that will back
up everything
inside that folder.

409
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,196
Well, that's
a neat little thing.

410
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,200
Well, just
keep talking.
Go ahead.

411
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:40,337
Pierson is a global corporation
with an infantry of lawyers,
but with this,

412
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,241
we can go after denning
personally for fraud.

413
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,977
Now, you thought
this through?

414
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,480
If you're gonna go
after denning
for fraud publicly,

415
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:55,085
a man worth about
8.5 billion dollars?

416
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,455
And you're gonna
accuse this man of
manipulating drug trials?

417
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,390
In a lawsuit, yes.

418
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,292
A lawsuit's public, Mr. Cahill.

419
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,096
You have kids?

420
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,568
No.

421
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,403
Where'd you go
to law school?

422
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,207
Vandy. Undergrad
at Tennessee.

423
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,876
That's good.
So how much
you worth?

424
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,512
How much am I worth?
Yeah.

425
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,948
Your life, how much
is your life worth?

426
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,985
Why don't you just jot down
the dollar amount here?

427
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,520
Do you have
any idea?

428
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,956
It ain't much, but...

429
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,262
See the pen?
That's a valenti,
one of the first.

430
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,131
That thing costs
about $68,000.

431
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,267
68,000 dollars?

432
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,270
You didn't
know that,
did you?

433
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,272
So how am I gonna know
your worth unless
you tell me?

434
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,044
I'm worth
this case.

435
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,347
You know
why that's worth
68 grand?

436
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,918
Because it has
a reputation.

437
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,320
It has a name brand.
It has an identity.

438
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:08,158
We get a case like
this, a litigation
at this level,

439
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,660
I need lawyers
who kill.

440
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:16,934
Lawyers with reputations
walk into a courtroom
and intimidate.

441
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,239
I don't see you
in that picture,
Mr. Cahill.

442
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,245
Mr. Abrams,
i fight to win.

443
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,014
Some of your other
senior partners
like hill,

444
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,584
they're a little soft.
They work within limits.

445
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,354
You need someone
who isn't afraid
of the wrong thing...

446
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,589
For the right reasons.

447
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,693
That's you?

448
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,365
You take it all.
You give it to hill.
Let him look at it,

449
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,001
and I think
you could lead
a support team.

450
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,307
Leader of
the support team?

451
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,313
Yes, sir.

452
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,723
You know
what? No.

453
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:15,425
No, that's just
trumped up
paralegal bullshit.

454
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,095
I've done
my time
making copies.

455
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,597
I want denning. I want
to be the handler,

456
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,166
and I want the
goddamn generator
fee for bringing it in.

457
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,604
Sit down.

458
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,582
Understand this.

459
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,689
You get a nine
figure judgment,
or get a new job.

460
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,095
Done. Done.

461
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,330
Mr. Cahill.

462
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,635
Enjoy the pen.

463
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,237
You're gonna
let me keep
the pen?

464
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,272
You better go
before I change
my mind.

465
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,779
I want to find out
who exactly denning's
legal team is.

466
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,448
Let's dig in, find out
everything we can
about them.

467
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,484
How far back?
Three years? Five maybe?

468
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,652
A decade's worth.

469
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,187
Fuck.

470
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,822
Copy that.

471
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,457
Why do we use
so much paper?

472
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,526
I mean, do we
really need to print
out this much?

473
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,261
Electronic copies
can be
tampered with.

474
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:28,098
Until the courts figure
that nonsense out,
this firm uses paper.

475
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,766
We depose denning
in two days.

476
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,436
This is three weeks' worth
of research to comb through.

477
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:35,472
You need a strategy.

478
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,540
If I may make
a suggestion...

479
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,375
We're good.
Thank you.

480
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:41,645
Do you mind asking hatty
to bring in some dinner
menus, please?

481
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,148
You were
on your way
out, right?

482
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,352
I'll fetch her
for you.

483
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,855
All right. Let's start
with some cataloging.

484
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,858
This is the subpoenaed
bank records.

485
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,463
Cross-reference his offshore
accounts with his tax
returns, please.

486
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,765
You got a minute?

487
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,367
Yeah, I'm all ears.

488
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,303
In private?

489
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,374
What's going
on, Doug?

490
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,844
So I was doing
background checks
on this denning discovery.

491
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,879
Guess whose name
i caught.

492
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,383
Emily hynes. Yeah.

493
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,854
Only took me two days
and a lexisnexis account
to find that.

494
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:26,723
Yeah, well, Arthur denning
has a lot of people
working for him.

495
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,594
Yeah.

496
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:33,730
So your shady ex-girlfriend
just shows up
out of the blue,

497
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,766
right around the same time
you find evidence on
her billionaire boyfriend?

498
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,807
Is this what I think it is?
What are
you asking me?

499
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,275
Did you get
this evidence
from Emily?

500
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,476
Emily has nothing
to do with it.

501
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,811
Then where
did you get this?
Why?

502
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,546
Cause I think
she fed it to you
for whatever reason.

503
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,150
No. No, Doug.

504
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,488
Fruit of the
poisonous tree.
You taught me that.

505
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,294
Okay, we are under
compulsory evidence
origin disclosure order.

506
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:05,562
Okay, in a case
this massive,

507
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,631
all evidence
has to be
obtained legally.

508
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,469
Look, if i
caught this trail,
others will, too.

509
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,671
Okay, you gotta get
your shit in order.
Just listen to me.

510
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,805
Listen to me.

511
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,207
The entire case
rests on this.

512
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,676
We have a case here,
and we're gonna win it.

513
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,647
Yeah, well,
you are playing
with fire.

514
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,448
Okay, I don't know
what's going on
between you two,

515
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,250
but you gotta stop it.
You gotta get her
out of town.

516
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,685
Okay, Doug.
That'll be all.
Thank you.

517
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,973
Hello. You
live here?

518
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,276
No.

519
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,479
Why?

520
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,752
Do you know her?

521
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,456
No.

522
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,829
You lied to me twice.
Take another look.

523
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,536
Are you a cop?

524
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,571
Do you know her
or the man
she's dating?

525
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,507
Who the fuck
are you?

526
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,545
You've never seen
her before?

527
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,916
No.

528
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,018
But I have seen you
creeping around
here at night

529
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,721
and if it happens again,
I'm calling
the actual cops.

530
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,661
Have a good night.

531
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,871
There you go.

532
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,339
A bottle of gaia?

533
00:37:56,341 --> 00:38:00,277
That's right.
350 bucks a bottle.

534
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,646
That hurt, when you took
that gunshot wound
to the chest?

535
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,614
Oh, my god.

536
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,370
Look, let's...
No cooking
tonight, okay?

537
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,873
Let's go out and
celebrate properly,
you and me.

538
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,712
Can I change?

539
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,047
Nah. I think
you should
wear that.

540
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,849
Move.

541
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,713
Wow!

542
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,616
This is not how
i remember it!

543
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,985
You want to go
someplace else?

544
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,088
I can barely
hear anything
you're saying.

545
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,090
Okay, I'm gonna go
get some drinks.
I'll be right back.

546
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,137
Two vodka sodas, please.
Thank you.

547
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,373
Hello.

548
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,382
Do I know you?

549
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,517
Don't ask a question
you already know
the answer to.

550
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,854
Okay.

551
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,060
You have
a good night.

552
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,695
You made an enemy
you don't want.

553
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,563
Is that right?

554
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,934
Why don't
you tell
Arthur denning

555
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,070
that this is some real
amateur-hour bullshit.

556
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,809
What do you want?

557
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,511
For you to drop
this case.

558
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:14,511
I'm not dropping
this case.

559
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,151
You will recuse yourself
and resign from your firm.

560
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,821
And if I don't?

561
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,857
Your wife will
never look
this happy again.

562
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,693
Have fun.

563
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,005
Hey.

564
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,810
Sorry it took
so long.

565
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,611
That's okay.
I made a friend.
Yeah?

566
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,116
Benjamin Cahill.
Wow, how long
has it been?

567
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,152
Like, ten years,
i think. Hi.

568
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,089
I was just
getting cozy
with your wife.

569
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,993
Yes, she said that
she recognized me
from your profile picture.

570
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:07,130
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah, it's crazy.

571
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,233
Emily said that you guys
met freshman year
at Tennessee?

572
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,635
Yeah.
We dated, actually.

573
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,637
But I think Ben
got over me
since then.

574
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,042
So are you here
by yourself?

575
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,243
No, girls'
night out.

576
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,111
You know, drinking
and dancing and...

577
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,615
Speaking of which,
i should probably
go find them.

578
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,017
Okay. Well,
it was nice
to see you.

579
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,953
It was lovely
meeting you.
You, too.

580
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,921
You smell so nice.

581
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,089
Oh, thank you.

582
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,059
Ben?
Okay.

583
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:39,596
Don't ever ignore my phone calls
or I'll tell her what happened.

584
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:40,930
It was nice
to see you, Emily.
Bye.

585
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,073
I didn't know
that was your type.

586
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,242
That's not my type.

587
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,212
Charlotte, you're
my type.

588
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,550
She wears a lot
of perfume.

589
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,922
You gonna ask
a girl to dance?

590
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,190
Okay. Come on.

591
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,712
Thank you.

592
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,047
Yeah. What's
going on?

593
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,727
Why did you
never mention Emily?

594
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,832
When we talked about
your ex-girlfriends,

595
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,900
you never
brought her up.

596
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:04,013
We never talk
about anything
really, I mean...

597
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,049
Especially since the...
The baby?

598
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,087
Yeah.

599
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,756
The night I lost the baby,
i was sitting
right here, remember,

600
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,291
and I was curled up
in a little ball?

601
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:22,231
The pain was
really unbearable
that night.

602
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,101
And you came, and you knelt
and you looked at me,
and you said...

603
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,205
That we needed
to be brave...

604
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,611
And that
from now on,
it's just us.

605
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,382
I'll never
forget that.

606
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,988
You made a promise
that we would be okay
and it was just us.

607
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,997
Yeah, but we never
talked about the baby
after that.

608
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,099
I know, Ben.

609
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,203
We didn't have to
until now.

610
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,049
Again.

611
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,059
Harder!

612
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,062
What the fuck?
This is getting a little crazy.

613
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,864
I thought you said
you get off
on violence.

614
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,100
Am I gonna have to hit myself
or are you gonna fucking do it?

615
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:52,749
Your ad said
you liked it rough.
This just feels wrong.

616
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,284
Can I send these
to myself?

617
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,989
No. These are for me

618
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,325
to remember you by.

619
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,866
Get off me.

620
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,268
I thought you said
we were just
getting started.

621
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,469
I want you
to leave.

622
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,941
Now, before I call the cops
and show them how bad
you beat me.

623
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,545
You're out
of your mind.

624
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,229
Fuck.

625
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,365
Get it together.

626
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,041
<i> Sir, this is Dr. kroeher.</i>

627
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,410
<i> I can understand</i>
<i> what you must be</i>
<i> going through.</i>

628
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:58,447
<i> It's a lot to handle,</i>
<i> but I can tell you this.</i>

629
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,184
<i> You won't survive another day</i>
<i> without coming in.</i>

630
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,821
<i> Doesn't matter if it's</i>
<i> this hospital or not.</i>

631
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,924
<i> You need medical attention.</i>
<i> Is that clear?</i>

632
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,185
You're gonna sit here
all night, bro?

633
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,488
Yeah, bro.
You old enough
to work here?

634
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,123
You old enough to mind
your own business?

635
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,628
Hey, Anthony.

636
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,331
How about one of them
cream sodas
you're so famous for?

637
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,166
Don't get up.
Sit down.
Yes, sir.

638
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:51,500
I come here
all the time.

639
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,602
How's it going?

640
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,237
Oh, it's all right.
How you doing?

641
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,472
What's this? Oh, oh, oh.

642
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,642
Glad you're putting
it to use.

643
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,611
Well, I'm trying.
Yeah.

644
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,548
So how we doing?
Well...

645
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,483
Firm's got
a solid case,
no question.

646
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,387
Solid. But?

647
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,124
But denning's
lawyers waited
till last night

648
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,960
to file a motion to keep
those internal docs out.

649
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,497
So you got
a work around,
do you?

650
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:24,467
No. No, not yet,
but I'm not gonna
sleep until I do.

651
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,936
Well, you know,
this isn't about
effort anyway.

652
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,538
It's about denning.

653
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,275
You poked the bear.

654
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,143
Now he's restless
and ready to come.

655
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,313
So what
would you do?

656
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:38,581
I don't know.

657
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:42,418
Probably call you.

658
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,521
You know, here's
someone like you been
through so much,

659
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:49,625
a major tragedy,
unthinkable...

660
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,362
But you come out
the other side.

661
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:56,465
Many people
wouldn't have
made it. You did.

662
00:48:56,467 --> 00:49:00,436
I knew that about you.
I knew it before
you came into my office.

663
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,471
I might have
not let you
in otherwise.

664
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,476
Wait a second.

665
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,612
So hill giving me
that meeting
with you,

666
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,647
that was just some kind
of a setup or what?

667
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,151
Setup? Come on.
You're a public defender,

668
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,053
or you were one.
Yeah.

669
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,955
The hardest thing
for a public defender

670
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:22,625
is whether or not
he or she is gonna
make a dent of difference.

671
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,127
Now, you did,
every time.

672
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,996
Feel like I'm a little
bit in over my head
to be honest.

673
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,264
No, you're not.

674
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,199
Hey, let me tell you
the worst vice is advice.

675
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,500
I just been
giving it to you.

676
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,570
Son, listen to me.

677
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:38,174
You gotta shed
this distraction
you're in now,

678
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,309
what's bothering you.
Don't tell me.

679
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,112
Just shed it.
You understand?

680
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:48,317
We're gonna have to attack
this motherfucker,
clip his claws.

681
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,521
Take his head, and chop
that fucking thing off.

682
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,090
We'll put it
on the wall.

683
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,492
A trophy.

684
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,260
Okay.

685
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,401
Okay. Now
we're talking.
All right. All right.

686
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:08,704
Call me anytime.
And Anthony,

687
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,374
forget the cream
soda once again?

688
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,409
See that?
I knew you did.

689
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:16,579
You shed whatever's
distracting you,
you'll be okay.

690
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:17,680
Good seeing you, son

691
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,780
hey.

692
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,424
Oh, I don't
know what...

693
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,563
Okay. Oh, no, no.

694
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,199
Oh, god...

695
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,794
What?

696
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,243
Wait. Wait.

697
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,448
No. No.

698
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,337
Oh, my god...

699
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:22,705
What the fuck
am I gonna do?

700
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,612
Jesus Christ.

701
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,647
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

702
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,183
Sorry. I was just gonna
say what's up to Hanna,

703
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,718
and have some wine.
Oh, yeah.

704
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,720
She's not here right now.
She's supposed to be
back later on.

705
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,589
Okay, cool.
I left my...

706
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,459
My cellphone
here last night.

707
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,560
Cool.

708
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,595
Yeah.

709
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,766
I have a small
confession to make.

710
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,669
I'm married and
she's got a boyfriend
who isn't me.

711
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,572
So...

712
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,210
So I never saw you,
and we never had
this conversation.

713
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,612
All good.

714
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:04,780
I would
appreciate that.

715
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,683
Allright.
I'll see
you later.

716
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:26,335
Hey!

717
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,337
Is that you?

718
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,409
What's wrong?

719
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,980
We need
to talk.

720
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:39,582
What is it?

721
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,788
I screwed up.

722
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,495
I got mixed up in something
that I shouldn't have and...

723
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,403
Did you fuck her?

724
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,574
How did
she die?

725
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,745
I don't know.
Pills, I think.

726
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,415
It looks like
she hit her head.

727
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,687
Oh, we worked
so hard, Ben.

728
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,489
You know,
and we just started
to get ahead,

729
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,458
and then you throw it away
to get involved with
an ex-girlfriend

730
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,560
for a fucking case?
I was doing
this for us.

731
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,495
Oh, don't say that!
That is insulting!

732
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:28,497
That's so insulting
to me and my marriage!

733
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,633
There were other ways
you could have
landed a case!

734
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:33,469
You know that. When I go out
and I work a double shift,

735
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,537
that is for us!
This was for you!

736
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,345
What do you think, baby?
What do you think?

737
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:46,448
You think if you, like,
land partner and
you win a case,

738
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,050
that I'd feel
differently about you?

739
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,387
Because I love you.

740
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:52,621
I love you,
rich or poor.

741
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,889
I love you, too.

742
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,726
I love you too,
and I'm so sorry
for this.

743
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,532
There was
a text message.

744
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,536
It mentioned a meeting
at an art gallery at...

745
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,974
Maybe I could
go over there
and see if I can

746
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,710
try to piece this thing
together. It's the
only lead I got.

747
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,979
And what if
it doesn't
lead anywhere?

748
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,848
In the next few days,
they're gonna
find Emily's body.

749
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,484
The police are gonna
get involved and I'll
have to admit everything.

750
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,722
So what do we do until then?

751
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:33,862
We act as normal
as possible, okay?

752
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,664
You go to work.
I go to work.

753
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,934
Until I can figure
something out,
we'll just leave her there.

754
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,816
Do you want
some coffee?

755
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,851
Yeah. That'd be nice.

756
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,861
She remind you
of someone you know?

757
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,696
Yeah.

758
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,932
Like most women,
she's expensive.

759
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,951
Just a word.
I just...

760
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,437
What the fuck
happened back there?

761
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,005
Oh, this gentleman
approached me,

762
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:24,573
said things
as if he were
the kidnapper.

763
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,608
I didn't want
to chance it,
so I took action.

764
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,210
That kidnapper
was an art dealer.

765
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,913
Yeah, I know that now.
I'm aware of that.

766
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,081
But you know,
he's getting
medical attention

767
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,918
and compensation
for his
inconvenience.

768
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,686
Compensation?
Are you fucking
kidding me?

769
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:38,821
She could
be dead
because of you!

770
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:39,922
Jane, stop!

771
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,562
The kidnappers
weren't there.

772
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,931
If they were, they had
no intention
of approaching me,

773
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,200
and time
is precious.

774
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:54,102
I don't think
these guys would
waste it, do you?

775
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:58,974
And it could have been
a ruse or a trick.
I don't know,

776
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:02,611
but as always, in matters
like this, I'll take things
into my own hands.

777
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:06,782
My actions may appear
somewhat rash or foolish,

778
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,650
but I did
what I believed
was right.

779
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,788
So this now is the situation
we find ourselves in.

780
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,693
I want Emily back,
and I want her back, now.

781
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,728
So how are we going
to accomplish this, Joe?

782
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:19,728
Can you enlighten me?

783
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,502
<i> No, giffords,</i>
<i> I can't tell you why.</i>

784
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:29,505
I just need you to hack
Emily hynes' profile

785
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,708
and erase any communication
between the two of us, okay?

786
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,143
Yeah, no, I understand
but it's not possible.

787
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,846
What do you mean,
it's not possible? You hacked
visa, for god's sakes.

788
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,882
Yeah, I can hack anyone, okay?

789
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,583
But your talks
with her
are all online,

790
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:42,918
which means
that your chats
are broken up

791
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,820
into 10,000 little
bytes and pieces.

792
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,256
<i> I can't erase all that.</i>
<i> Delete the messages</i>
<i> on your end.</i>

793
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:50,158
<i> I'll ghost her account</i>
<i> and try and work out</i>
<i> the rest, okay?</i>

794
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,971
Are you serious right now?
Everyone's waiting for you.

795
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,213
Ben!

796
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,648
Yeah, all right.

797
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,780
Who is this?

798
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,716
<i> Why did you answer?</i>

799
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,686
- Mr. denning, what happened?
- Where's your troop?

800
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:29,024
I was expecting
an army.

801
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:31,860
Well, your expectations
have often been
your downfall, Charles.

802
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,933
Well, I'd rather have
faulty expectations

803
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:41,169
than sell faulty
pharmaceuticals.

804
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,772
But then again,
that's just me.

805
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:47,075
Let the record reflect
that we have filed a civil suit

806
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:49,378
on behalf of
the named plaintiffs

807
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,714
against Arthur denning
of pierson pharmaceuticals.

808
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:55,751
Let's begin by confirming
your identity for the record.

809
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:58,020
Your name is legally
Arthur denning?

810
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,728
Would you like him
to repeat
the question?

811
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,964
I'd prefer
if we spoke
off the record.

812
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,936
Okay.

813
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:20,042
New events have come
to light that change
the nature of this allegation.

814
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,678
Such as?

815
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,915
Well, I could elaborate,
but I would prefer
if Mr. Cahill did.

816
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:34,189
It's curious, isn't it,
that she was drawn
to us both?

817
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,393
What the hell
you talking about?

818
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,930
What is this?

819
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,099
I understand
you're in
possession of files

820
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:46,301
that were
illegally stolen
from my computer.

821
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,107
Everything was
obtained legally

822
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,243
and submitted
to you in discovery.

823
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,947
Really? Everything?

824
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,850
Everything.

825
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,420
The woman who
brought that
evidence to you,

826
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,323
where is she now?

827
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,031
I have no idea
what you're
talking about.

828
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,235
You know
you're cornered, Arthur.

829
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,371
Answer the questions
on the record.

830
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,842
I haven't been able
to reach her.
Have you?

831
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:28,944
No?

832
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:33,782
Charles, I am
prepared to settle

833
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,818
the class-action
certification
right now.

834
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,120
Mr. denning, is that...

835
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:39,955
You're admitting fault?

836
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,890
$300 million
to the class members.

837
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:44,860
One third will take care
of your attorney fees,

838
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:49,030
and within 24 hours, the $400
million will be wired to your
trust account.

839
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:52,000
Okay. We're gonna need both
sides to agree on this

840
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:55,370
and have the judge sign
for the class settlement.

841
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:58,907
Oh, in this town, I think
you'll find a judge that
will be able to do that.

842
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,812
I don't understand
why you're
doing this.

843
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:06,381
'Cause we got
something he wants.

844
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:10,085
Yeah, in exchange
for a settlement,

845
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,554
we sign a confidentiality,

846
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:16,491
then we return
the evidence
to Mr. denning,

847
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:20,529
including the files
that were
"hypothetically"

848
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,432
taken from
his computer.

849
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:27,803
No risk
of criminal prosecution.

850
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,539
Then we're done.

851
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,108
<i> Ciao.</i>

852
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,117
Did he just
buy back
the evidence?

853
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,920
Yes, he did,
and he did it legally.

854
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,395
At least you're rich.
Live with that.

855
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,997
Congratulations.

856
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:06,474
Aside from the suicide attempt
a few years ago,

857
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,844
did Emily seem
relatively stable?

858
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,049
Yeah, I guess so.
Seemed okay.

859
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,419
Did you two
have sex regularly?

860
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,856
How is
that relevant?

861
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,326
Well, she's
still missing,
so everything is.

862
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,563
She mixed
quite a cocktail
for herself.

863
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:32,567
Oxy, rits, vics, ads,
uptake inhibitors,

864
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:35,537
and a whole lot of colors
i have never seen before.

865
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,239
So what are you
getting at?

866
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:39,574
Well, she either
spontaneously developed
every mental disorder

867
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,309
on the planet,

868
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:44,613
or something
in her life,
maybe someone,

869
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,148
was scaring her.

870
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,353
Yeah, I know
what you're
getting at.

871
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:56,358
I own a pharmaceutical company,
but I didn't prescribe
those, okay?

872
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,526
So why aren't you
out there
looking for her?

873
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,030
You know, I've got
to be honest here.

874
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:05,333
It doesn't seem like
you even care
if we find her.

875
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,669
After 48 hours,
the chances
of recovering her

876
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:09,170
are increasingly difficult.

877
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,376
Emily can be difficult
and I love her.

878
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:18,146
If anything,
her being difficult
is the thing I love most.

879
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,616
Weird, isn't it?

880
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,194
<i> You've reached Charlotte.</i>

881
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:35,563
<i> Leave a message</i>
<i> after the beep.</i>

882
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:38,199
Hey, honey, it's me.
Give me a call.

883
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,957
Emily?

884
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,377
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

885
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,197
Police! Open the door!

886
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,469
This is the New Orleans
police department!

887
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,371
We have a warrant
to search your home!

888
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,173
You have 30 seconds
to come out!

889
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,417
Clear!

890
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,320
Clear.

891
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,223
We have a dead body in here!

892
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,062
Clear.

893
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,246
Clear.

894
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,811
Fuck.

895
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,884
You didn't
do it, right?

896
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,320
No, I didn't
do it.

897
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,855
I gotta ask
the question, man.
I'm sorry.

898
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,491
Jesus Christ.

899
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,360
I told you
not to get involved
with her.

900
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,662
You knew
Emily was crazy.

901
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,264
I know! I know!

902
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:30,732
I told you she was nuts.
I should have
listened to you.

903
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:32,200
All right?
It was stupid.

904
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,706
If the cops
catch you
with this,

905
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,675
they're gonna
shoot first,
ask questions later.

906
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,378
Just get the fuck
outta here
with that.

907
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,947
Thank you.
You're a good friend.

908
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,916
I know. I know. I know.
Good friend.

909
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,688
Fucking dumb friend,
that's what I am. Jesus.

910
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,943
Oh, I just spent
three hours
with detectives.

911
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:19,280
I don't know
if there's anything
more I can say.

912
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:21,649
We just have
a few more
questions.

913
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,552
Did your husband
ever mention
Emily hynes before?

914
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,989
I'm sorry.
Who exactly are you?
I'm her attorney.

915
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:31,993
Joe bilson.
My associate, Jane clemente,
kidnap and rescue.

916
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,230
So you're not cops?

917
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,232
We're privately contracted
by Arthur denning...

918
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:38,733
She has
no comment,

919
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,336
and you have no place
being here, so I suggest
you leave.

920
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,774
You do realize
the woman discovered
dead in this house

921
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,277
was a woman
her husband was
having an affair with?

922
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,883
Mr. denning is willing
to offer aid in her
legal expenses

923
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:57,885
if she's willing
to help us
find him.

924
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,859
This is a manhunt,
and he is a fugitive
at large.

925
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,263
You're not gonna
touch her.

926
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:09,964
We spoke with
Emily's neighbor.
What was her name?

927
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,400
Amy Campbell.

928
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:16,871
Seems Ms. Campbell saw Ben
at Emily's loft
on numerous occasions.

929
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:20,842
Ms. Cahill, you may think
you have the complete
picture, but you don't.

930
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,679
Guys, I can
file a motion
if you need me to,

931
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:26,014
or I can just
tell you right now.

932
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,815
Fuck off.

933
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,618
If you change
your mind,
you call us?

934
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,717
Yeah, the cops keep circling
my house. It's freaking me out.

935
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,452
Can I come stay
with you tonight?

936
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,090
Yeah. Yeah, it's my
neighbor Hanna.

937
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,758
Or whatever
her name was.

938
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,427
They still haven't
figured out what
happened to her.

939
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,331
Yeah, I don't know.
It's freaking me out.

940
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,533
I don't want
to stay here
tonight. Just...

941
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,701
No.

942
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,539
Oh, my god.

943
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,913
Uh.

944
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,054
Help me! Help!

945
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,523
Help!

946
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,602
Help!

947
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,473
No.

948
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,988
<i> Do you have any idea</i>
<i> of what's happening here?</i>

949
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,792
The entire city is hunting
for this guy!

950
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,063
We find him first
before the cops do.

951
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,805
You know what he's got
and what he could
use it for.

952
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,577
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch this settlement
fall apart!

953
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,849
If we don't find him,

954
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,152
lot of people
are gonna get hurt.
Understand?

955
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:46,821
Understand?

956
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,159
<i> Incoming!</i>

957
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:52,894
Incoming!
Incoming!

958
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:56,164
26-year-old
female. Multiple trauma,
skull fracture.

959
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,799
Maybe her clavicle
is broken, too.

960
01:13:57,801 --> 01:13:58,966
Moving to trauma two!

961
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,568
Need 100% oxygen!

962
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,837
125 milligrams of solu-medrol,
i.V. Push.

963
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:04,939
How long's she been down?
I need an answer!

964
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,441
I'm not sure.
She got a name?

965
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,209
Amy Campbell.
What? What
happened to her?

966
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:09,977
I'm sorry I didn't
clean her up better.

967
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,680
Amy, I need you
to lay down. You've
had an accident.

968
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,849
Do you remember
what happened to you?
Honey, lay down.

969
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:16,951
Did you see what happened?
Did you see the person
that did this?

970
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,986
Were you beaten?
Hey! Step back!

971
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,705
Are you okay?

972
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,242
I'm okay.

973
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:44,111
<i> I thought that I could</i>
<i> handle this, Ben...</i>

974
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,550
But I can't.

975
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,954
I just can't.

976
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,495
It's just you and me.
It's just us.

977
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,701
<i> Are you sure that, that girl</i>

978
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:09,504
that they brought
into the icu
is Emily's neighbor?

979
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:14,208
<i> Her name is Amy Campbell</i>
<i> and somebody has</i>
<i> massacred her, Ben.</i>

980
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,279
Someone who knows
what we did.

981
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,820
She saw me
at Emily's place.
She can I.D. Me.

982
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,626
As terrible as it sounds,
she can't wake up
until I fix this.

983
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,300
All right, baby,
i love you.

984
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,868
I love you, too.

985
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,843
I'm sorry.

986
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,614
I'm sorry.

987
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,116
What the fuck? What?

988
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:37,351
Dr. Hughes!
Dr. Hughes!
Room two!

989
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,388
What happened?
I don't know
what happened.

990
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,857
She's coding.
Get the crash
cart! Go. Go.

991
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,025
I'll get the bags!

992
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,699
- Come on. Don't die on me.
- Come on. Stay with me.

993
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:52,867
Oh. God...

994
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,869
Don't die on me now.

995
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,108
Can I help
you with something?

996
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,529
Next time, you should
phone me before
you come here.

997
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:34,335
Article 7-14 of the standard
practice of code of ethics

998
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:37,104
says we may not
talk off the record.

999
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,177
All right, here's what's gonna
go down. We're gonna settle.

1000
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:45,179
I'm gonna
give you everything
that I got,

1001
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:49,083
all the evidence that we got
against you, legal, illegal.

1002
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:51,452
And the manner in which
you were able to cover up

1003
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:54,822
all the shit that
you've done.

1004
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:58,259
I'd love to help you
but there's just
one small problem.

1005
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:00,127
Yeah? What's that?

1006
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,364
I don't have the faintest
fucking clue what
you're talking about.

1007
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:05,199
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

1008
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:09,270
Emily was gonna
extort you
and you found out

1009
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:11,305
and you got
your feelings hurt,
so you killed her

1010
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,940
and then you
framed me for it.

1011
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,977
Well, I did
not kill Emily,

1012
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,246
although I can tell by
the conviction in your voice
you think I did.

1013
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,582
You know, I just
realized something.

1014
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,820
It's so funny.

1015
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:29,557
Emily kidnapped herself,
didn't she? Of course.

1016
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:32,393
I mean, in retrospect,
it makes total sense,
doesn't it?

1017
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:35,830
Of course, when you love
someone, you tend
to overlook the obvious,

1018
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:40,267
but that's it.
Poor old Emily.

1019
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:43,938
She was testing me to see
if I would bring the money
for her.

1020
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,109
But she didn't live
long enough to see
what I would do.

1021
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:53,214
Pity. Kind of sad
that she involved you, too.

1022
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:01,488
So why did you send that guy
to come intimidate me
at the club?

1023
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:07,394
Oh, come on.
I have a net worth
of $8.7 billion.

1024
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:11,165
Do I look like a man who would
hire street thugs to do
his dirty work?

1025
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,904
I never wanted
any of this.

1026
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,975
Of course you didn't.
I'm sure you didn't.

1027
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:24,411
You're married,
and you got involved
with an ex-lover

1028
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:26,313
whom you must have known
wasn't too tightly wrapped,

1029
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:31,886
not playing with a full deck
of cards, as they say,
with deep mental

1030
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,889
and emotional
disturbances and issues

1031
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,259
and all that googly crap
we talk about.

1032
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:42,329
You got involved because
you wanted to shine in court.

1033
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,365
Probably fill
some gigantic hole

1034
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:48,402
in your dreary, insipid,
lackluster life.

1035
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:52,139
You know,
you knew the risks,
but you proceeded anyway.

1036
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,243
It rained, and you got wet,
and I have no sympathy.

1037
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,949
Now that you are down
a rabbit hole, the only
question I have

1038
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:06,053
is how far
are you willing to go
to get out?

1039
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,356
Like the man said,

1040
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:11,959
"it's better to go too far

1041
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,527
than not far enough."

1042
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,131
Stalin.

1043
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,952
<i> 911 operator.</i>
<i> What is your emergency?</i>

1044
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,956
<i> Hello?</i>
Yeah, look...

1045
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:45,059
<i> Sir? I can't quite hear you.</i>
<i> Can you repeat that?</i>

1046
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,240
Motherfucker! Come here!

1047
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,275
Hey.
Hey, baby.

1048
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,612
Charlie.

1049
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,748
Everything's gonna
be okay, all right?

1050
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:58,358
Hold on.

1051
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:08,836
Who are you?

1052
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,675
Hey! I said who
the fuck are you?

1053
01:25:14,677 --> 01:25:17,478
When they find you, you're
looking at three counts
of murder one!

1054
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,682
That's death in this state!

1055
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:25,486
Something tells me
i got a better lawyer
than you.

1056
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:27,221
Why did you
kill Emily?

1057
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,426
I didn't.
I moved her.

1058
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,329
Why?

1059
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,298
You really don't know.

1060
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,569
Don't you touch her! Hey!

1061
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:44,905
Hey, Charlie, look at me!

1062
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,312
No!

1063
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:54,681
No!

1064
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,185
You son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!

1065
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,792
Why are you doing this?

1066
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:10,597
How is what I do any different
than what you do, Mr. Cahill?

1067
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:13,734
You think you're
a righteous man
but you're not.

1068
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:15,536
You're just confused.

1069
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,906
There is no right,
no wrong.

1070
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:26,914
Only what is true.

1071
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,492
Die, you fucker! Die!

1072
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,774
Help. We need help.

1073
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,917
We need help!

1074
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:12,753
You're gonna
be okay, baby.

1075
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:14,321
I'm gonna come back
to get you.

1076
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:15,656
Don't leave me, Ben.

1077
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:17,557
Ben.

1078
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:18,959
Sir, are you all right?

1079
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,060
Ben. Don't leave me.

1080
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,668
Okay.
Sir?

1081
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:30,904
- Is she gonna make it?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1082
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,706
Listen, man,
just leave town.
You have to.

1083
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,741
Listen, no,
I'm not going anywhere

1084
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:38,312
until I figure out
who did this.
Do you hear me?

1085
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:42,816
Now, I've got the laptop
from the guy who
tried to kill me.

1086
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:46,486
I'm gonna send you
an encrypted file and i
need you to try to decipher it.

1087
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,923
<i> Okay. Why?</i>

1088
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:53,060
Because I think
i figured out
who did this,

1089
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:54,728
and I just
need the proof.

1090
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:31,064
Been reading about you here
in the paper, manhunt.

1091
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:34,000
Fuck you.

1092
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:35,902
You want
some coffee?
Listen to me.

1093
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:37,871
Is everything all right
here, Mr. Abrams?

1094
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,807
Yeah, everything's
fine, susie,
just fine. No.

1095
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:42,909
Thank you for inquiring,
honey. Thank you.

1096
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,445
Let me know
if you need me.
I sure will.

1097
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:46,580
Keep your eye on us, too.

1098
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:47,748
I will.

1099
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:51,151
You...

1100
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:55,989
You've looked better.

1101
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,825
I should fucking
put you
in the ground.

1102
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:02,062
Oh, boy, you got
evidence
against you, son.

1103
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,799
Direct, circumstantial.
It's all over
the place, son.

1104
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,136
It's just not
in your favor.

1105
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:10,637
Oh, I forget,
the motive, too.

1106
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,606
Why did
you do it?

1107
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,774
Why did you
do this to me?

1108
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:14,941
What? Do what?

1109
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:16,176
I didn't do
anything to you.

1110
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,081
I killed somebody
because of you.

1111
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,851
Oh, no.
You did that
on your own.

1112
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:31,725
No. No. You did this
to me, and
i can prove it.

1113
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:33,727
You can prove it?
I can prove it.

1114
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,028
Be my guest.

1115
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:40,934
I didn't kill Emily.

1116
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,670
Any good lawyer will tell you
it doesn't matter what is.

1117
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:45,906
It's what "is" looks like.

1118
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:54,214
There was a biker,
a man on a motorcycle,

1119
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:58,118
who tried to bury me
underneath a church.

1120
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,220
Yeah?
Anyway, I snapped
his neck.

1121
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,724
You know him?

1122
01:31:04,726 --> 01:31:07,127
I've never
heard of him, no.

1123
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:09,596
No, I think you do
because you hired him.

1124
01:31:09,598 --> 01:31:11,965
Unfortunately for you,
this guy also kept

1125
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:16,002
a very detailed expense
report on his laptop,
just like an accountant.

1126
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:21,541
See, I got a tech guy who was
able to trace the accountant

1127
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,743
right back to you.

1128
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:25,812
I smell
a blackmail here.
Oh.

1129
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,882
Yeah, is that
what you're doing?
Blackmailing me?

1130
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:30,784
You think I'm
blackmailing you?

1131
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:32,586
Why the fuck
would I blackmail you?

1132
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:35,222
Listen, never bullshit
a bullshitter, son.

1133
01:31:35,224 --> 01:31:36,857
You know
how I built
my reputation?

1134
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:38,525
How did you build
your reputation?

1135
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:41,495
Breaking down every
crooked banker

1136
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:45,732
and ceo sociopath this side
of the Mason-Dixon,

1137
01:31:45,734 --> 01:31:48,702
bullshitting me
every day of the week.

1138
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:52,873
You know, I do the wrong thing
for the right reasons
just like you.

1139
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,208
Who do you think you'll be
without your reputation?

1140
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:59,112
Reputation, Mr. Cahill,
is an idle impression,

1141
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:03,650
is "oft got
without merit, lost
without deserving."

1142
01:32:03,652 --> 01:32:05,118
There's some
Shakespeare for you.

1143
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,521
Yeah.
Can you
handle it?

1144
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:09,222
I'll take care
of my reputation.

1145
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:14,761
What's gonna
really bog us down now,
buddy is you thinking,

1146
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,998
having the audacity

1147
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,168
and the profound ignorance
to think you can
take me down.

1148
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,641
We got company.

1149
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:40,587
The state of Louisiana
from 1979 till now,

1150
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:46,560
has executed
659 criminals,
some of them guilty,

1151
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:51,231
with eight waiting in line,
queued up, ready to go next.

1152
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,999
I'm waiting
for you to join them.

1153
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:05,345
My profound ignorance
uncovered something.

1154
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:08,582
You been working
with Arthur denning
the whole time,

1155
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:11,818
taking bribes,
throwing cases
for him for years.

1156
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,187
And now
he's hanging you
out to dry.

1157
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:16,122
You are done.

1158
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:19,125
I'm gonna crucify you
and you know it.

1159
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:22,295
You sure you want to play
this game with me?

1160
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,864
You should probably
run while you still
have a chance.

1161
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,601
Fuck you.

1162
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:29,069
Yeah?
Yeah.

1163
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:34,274
You're in my church now,
and I suggest you leave it.

1164
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,943
Mr. Abrams.

1165
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,878
George. Hey, George...

1166
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,146
Keep your hands
on the table.

1167
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:41,648
What's going on?

1168
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:47,287
Well, you're not
gonna give me
a manicure, are you?

1169
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,022
Now, on the table.

1170
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:50,857
Well, this is embarrassing
for both of us, I think.

1171
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,695
I will crucify you.
Believe me, I will.

1172
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:00,333
Enjoy your pen.

1173
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,871
Go ahead, motherfucker!

1174
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:06,806
Mr. Abrams, I need you
to put that down!

1175
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,709
Didn't know
i had that in me,
did you? Oh.

1176
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:14,314
Put it on the ground
and back away from the weapon.

1177
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:17,984
Oh, it has come
to this, hasn't it?

1178
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,120
It has come to this.

1179
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:26,993
You do the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

1180
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:33,099
You stretch yourself

1181
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:35,902
beyond the limits.

1182
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:41,941
You want to see a man
ain't got no limits?

1183
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,814
You're going
to jail.

1184
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:49,716
Criminals go
to jail.

1185
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:59,292
I'm sorry
about this, 'cause...

1186
01:34:59,294 --> 01:35:02,195
I don't like
this kind of thing.

1187
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:06,332
Please pardon
the theatrics.

1188
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:39,866
I'm not gonna stand by and watch
this settlement fall apart!

1189
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:47,173
If we don't find him,
a lot of people
gonna get hurt.

1190
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:49,476
- Understand?
<i>- I understand, Charles.</i>

1191
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,066
You having
second thoughts?

1192
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:18,838
I'm dying.

1193
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,440
I know that.

1194
01:36:23,077 --> 01:36:24,778
Why'd you ever
come work for me?

1195
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:28,214
I agreed
to work for you

1196
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:30,416
because I thought
you and I wanted
the same thing,

1197
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:32,552
the truth.

1198
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:36,790
There's no truth
in the law.

1199
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:39,359
Everybody lies.

1200
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:43,263
Stop searching for it.

1201
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:46,933
Ain't gonna
find it, so...

1202
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:57,143
Neither will you.

1203
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:03,917
I'm gonna miss
you, too, Dougie.

1204
01:37:03,919 --> 01:37:05,852
Yep. Yeah.

1205
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:10,190
Look, look, it's not like
we're moving
to China, allright?

1206
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:13,026
We're just moving
a couple hours away.

1207
01:37:13,028 --> 01:37:16,129
How about we facetime on the
weekends? How's that sound?

1208
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:21,835
Allright. You're a good man,
Dougie. I'll see you later.

1209
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:51,624
Hey.
Hey.

1210
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:53,993
What's wrong?

1211
01:38:57,231 --> 01:38:59,165
I'm gonna ask you
this one time,

1212
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:02,402
and I need you
to tell me the truth.

1213
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,375
Okay.

1214
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:15,114
Why does this smell
like Emily's perfume?

1215
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:19,152
I mean, you don't
even wear perfume.

1216
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,112
It was an accident.

1217
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,984
I went to
confront Emily,

1218
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:53,119
and she was weird.
She was high...

1219
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:55,488
And she slapped me.

1220
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:04,030
And I was so mad
at her... and you.

1221
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:10,536
The guy in the church,
he knew.

1222
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:15,541
In the back of your mind,
i thought that
you knew, too.

1223
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:25,018
I pushed her.
She fell.

1224
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:30,790
Her head hit the table
and she didn't get up.

1225
01:40:36,563 --> 01:40:39,465
I could have
helped her,

1226
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:43,169
but I didn't help her
because I thought
that if she...

1227
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:47,306
If her heart
stopped beating,

1228
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:52,512
then mine would
stop hurting.

1229
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:56,616
It kind of did.

1230
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:07,794
It's okay.

1231
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,531
It's just us.

1232
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:24,477
Well, we've got a busy day
ahead of us tomorrow.

1233
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:30,283
I'm gonna finish packing.
