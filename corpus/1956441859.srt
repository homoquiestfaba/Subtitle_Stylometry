00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,449
[man] What I'm saying is that it's
more than what it seems, that's all.

3
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:37,654
Much more. People don't know because
they're too busy with their game shows

4
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:43,994
and football and silliness to take the time
to look and read and figure it all out.

5
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:48,368
Who is it that said, "Believe none of
what you hear and half of what you see"?

6
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,403
These are interesting times
we're living in.

7
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:56,542
That's another saying.
Chinese. Actually, it's a curse.

8
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:59,075
All you have to do is look

9
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,682
and learn to connect the dots
and get ready.

10
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,950
Did you know there's only three
days' worth of food in the stores

11
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:11,458
and when the S-H-T-F,
the 99% are gonna be out of commission.

12
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:13,625
[sighs]

13
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:14,859
I'm only telling you this

14
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:16,860
because I wouldn't be
a good father to you

15
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:20,664
if I didn't let you know
all the stuff that I know.

16
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:25,068
It bears repeating, so I'm repeating
it, so you can be prepared.

17
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,573
It's only a matter of time
and it's not far off now.

18
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:29,973
All you have to do
is look around.

19
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,445
You can see it
if you open your eyes.

20
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:36,614
The biggest problem we have isn't anything
that a little focus couldn't cure.

21
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,582
And it's not like it's so hard.

22
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:43,057
There's tons of information out there
if people just take the time to look.

23
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,461
And if you think being busy with all
that stuff you think is so important,

24
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,764
well, you're gonna learn that
that's not what really matters,

25
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,970
I mean what really matters.

26
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:59,641
All that's gonna matter
is what you do now.

27
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:03,876
And I'm not saying all this to
scare you or because I'm scared,

28
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:07,882
because I'm not scared,
if that's what you think, no, I'm ready.

29
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,686
I just want to be ready.

30
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,658
[man on phone]
<i>Nice talking with you, Dad.</i>

31
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,028
[man sighs]

32
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:22,764
Yeah, okay. Bye.

33
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,540

35
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:47,522
Maggie, huh?

36
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,026
You're new here.

[beeping]

38
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,536
And $22.56.

39
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,576
It's always a good idea
to know your neighbor.

40
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:11,112
You never know
when you might need 'em.

41
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,083
Can I see
your driver's license?

42
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:16,919

Hi.

63
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,428
Hi.

64
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,000
- That'll be $9.50.
- [woman] Okay.

65
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,310

Oh, I'm sorry!

That's my fault.
I got ya.

00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,156
Okay.

Phew.

90
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:16,504
[Ed] Nice car.

91
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,440
It's not a Ford.
You like it?

92
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,774
Yeah. It's good... on gas.

93
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:27,512
Oh, that's important. You never
know when you're gonna need some.

94
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,250
- Yeah.
- You like coming here?

95

Dan's, I mean.
I see you here from time to time.

It's... it's convenient.

97

00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,460

- Ronnie?

Ronnie.

102
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,237
That's a man's name.
Ronnie what?

103
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,640
Meisner.

104
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,443
- M-E...
- E-I.

105
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:57,644
Ah...

106
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,584
Hemsler. That's my last name.
Ed Hemsler. Pleased to meet you.

107
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,417
Ooh. [chuckles]

108
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,418
Okay. Nice to meet you.

- Have... have a good day.

- [gasps]

What're you shopping for today?

113
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,818
Oh. Hi.

114
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,723
Just some stuff.

115
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,755
And how about you?

116
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,361
Yeah, I'm just
getting some stuff too.

117
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:22,265
Well, it's good
to see you again, Ronnie.

118
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:25,433
All right.
You have a good day.

119
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,235
- Ed.
- Ed.

120
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,246
Wow, you were busy.
What're you getting ready for?

121
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,780
Oh, no. I just
needed some things.

122
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:43,253
You're ready, aren't you?
I get it. I can see it.

123
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:44,919
You can see?

124
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,823
I knew it the minute I saw you.

125
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:48,689
You know, the way
you were looking.

126
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:50,791
Smart shopping, strategic.
I get it.

127
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:53,361
Well, I was just
getting some things.

128
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,366
Yeah, I know.
And I know you know.

129
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,402
This is all going down.

130
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:03,206
You like coffee?

131
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:07,007
You gotta realize
there's more to it than that.

132
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,514
There's things that most
people don't understand.

133
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,281
America.

134
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:16,349
This is such a special place.

135
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,721
Special in history.

136
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:21,624
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

137
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,428
You ever hear
of <i>The Federalist Papers?</i>

138
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,427
Uh-uh.

139
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:27,796
To know what they are,
you gotta go way back

140
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:30,364
to what's called
the <i>Magna Carta.</i>

141
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,033
That's when things
really got going,

142
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:34,436
but you can go back
further than that if you want.

143
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:37,939
See, it's all a matter
of controlling people.

144
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,840
You got basically two types:

145
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:42,543
those who want to control you and
those who don't want to be controlled.

146
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:44,879
That's me, the second type.

147
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,416
You want more coffee?

148
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,317
Oh, no. No. I...

149
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,321
Ooh. Ooh, I got to get back.

150
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,794
[sighs] Yeah,
I gotta get back to some stuff, too.

151
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,269
[bell jingles]

152
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:06,967
You need to borrow my watch
next time?

153
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:08,438
Sorry.

154
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:30,896
[bell jingles]

155
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,833
- [Ed] You like pie?
- [gasps]

156
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,137
I like pie.

157
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:43,505
Just 'cause they have
some great pies

158
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:44,773
at Guy's Grill.

159
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,508
I was thinking maybe
we could go to dinner

160
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,543
and then finish up
with a couple of slices.

161
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:51,749
Apple, peach. Around 8:00?

162
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,620
8:00 sounds good.

163
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,755
Oh. Good.

164
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:21,647
They have karaoke.

165
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,516
[singing]

166
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,555
[cheering]

167
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,688
[Ed] Not that there's
anything special about it.

168
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,427
The way I see it,
we're pretty much all the same.

169
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:41,031
I'm your basic, average
red-blooded American male.

170
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,832
I got a son, Brian.

171
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:46,637
He's got a nice family.
Great daughter. Pretty wife.

172
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,708
They got a big house about
an hour or so from here.

173
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,179
I had him around the time
I started with Capital Bearings.

174
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:58,719
I did systems analysis.
Basically quality control.

175

00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,657
- You sure?
- Don't worry about me.

351
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:12,826
You're not out of the way
or anything.

352
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:15,528
Oh, it's... I'm fine.

353
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,630
- A hundred percent, yeah?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

354
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:20,532
- Thank you, but, really, I'm good.
- Oh, man.

355
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,339
[tires screeching,
car approaching]

356
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:27,440
I only hope I can do it like
you do when I'm your age.

357
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,779
Oh, it's not what it seems.

358
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,684
Whatever. Just don't do
anything I wouldn't do twice.

359
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,367
<i>...the third major power outage
this year due to high winds.</i>

360
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,735
<i>The LLPC has begun upgrades
to the system</i>

361
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:58,305
<i>that are intended to prevent
future power outages.</i>

362
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:03,446
<i>Needless to say, Ed Hemsler has a backup
generator for just such occasions...</i>

363
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,616
<i>because Ed Hemsler
thinks of everything.</i>

364
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,855
<i>Because Ed Hemsler
thinks of everything.</i>

365
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:14,791
<i>Because Ed Hemsler
thinks of everything.</i>

366
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:20,931
[vehicle approaching]

367
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,941
[Ed] You like Chinese?

368
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,885
What...

369
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,054
We don't have to do Chinese.

370
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:21,727
Ed Hemsler, a woman doesn't
like to be left in the dark.

371
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,727
When a gentleman takes her out,

372
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,398
the least he could do
is contact her in some way

373
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,601
and let her know that he had fond
memories of their evening together

374
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:36,671
even if he didn't,
because that's what gentlemen do.

375
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,573
But I am a gentleman.

376
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,543
Well, then where were you?

377
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,014
Why didn't you call me?

378
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:46,549
I thought you might want
a break or something.

379
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,620
A break from what?

380
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,656
Well, from me.

381
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,763
I kissed you.

382
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,567
You did.

383
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,872
Chinese is fine.

384
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,308
I'll be right out front.

385
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,643
You can find out the truth if
you know where to look for it.

386
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,517
The Internet is the biggest
library in the universe.

387
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,855
Someone called it the deep
water of logic and limitation.

388
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,020
And I like to swim.

389
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,589
Ask me something.

390
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,457
Something? Like what?

391
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,028
Something like anything.

392
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,133
Well, I don't know.
Like what?

393
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,469
Isn't there something you want
to know that you don't know?

394
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,539
Not really.

395
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:41,541
- Nothing?
- No.

396
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:45,510
So, you know everything there is
you want to know.

397
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:46,744
No, I didn't say that.

398
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,516
So, what do you want to know?

399
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:53,587
I think what I mean is I don't
know what I want to know yet.

400
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,456
About you.

401
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,093
And when I know what I want to
know, I'll let you know.

402
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,762
Is that okay?

403
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:04,498
Yeah.

404
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,140
Good noodles.

405
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,740
[Brian on phone] <i>One day,
you must remember to explain to me</i>

406
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,675
<i>what this has to
do with the real world.</i>

407
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,045
What this has to
do with the real world?

408
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,716
What... Jesus, Brian.

409
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,683
No, I'm not
hogging the conversation.

410
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,620
You want to speak?
Go ahead, speak.

411
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,787
<i>I actually don't want to talk
about any of this anymore.</i>

412
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,790
<i>It's not like I have
a bank account</i>

413
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,959
<i>that is magically filled every other week.
I have work that I have to do.</i>

414
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:37,863
- Are you saying I didn't earn it?
- <i>I'm not saying anything.</i>

415
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,265
$23.50.

416
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:40,899
Well, I did earn it.

417
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:43,636
Seventeen years of earning it
doing real work.

418
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:47,071
Work that mattered, back when
people honored their commitments.

419
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:50,511
But now, all I can say is good
luck when it's time to collect.

420
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,147
We don't
accept checks anymore.

421
00:36:57,818 --> 00:36:59,785
[Ed] Now, I know you think
I'm saying all this stuff

422
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,754
just to make you think
that I'm smarter than you

423
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:03,221
so that I can act like
I'm still your father.

424
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,957
Well, I got news for you,
I am still your father.

425
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:09,227
[Brian on phone] <i>I know you're still
my father. That's why I called.</i>

426
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,968
<i>Janet and I want to invite you
to Thanksgiving dinner this year.</i>

427
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,606
Will your mother be there?

428
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,674
<i>Of course not. Will you come?</i>

429
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:22,844
Can I bring someone?

430
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:29,819
Tina?

431
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:32,786
[mouthing]

432
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:36,058
Hey, I'll call you back, okay?
Yeah.

433
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,929
I see him.
The way he waits outside for you.

434
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,362
He's, like,
so totally your BFF.

435
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,898
What is that? A BFF?

436
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,333
[scoffs]
Best friend forever.

437
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,471
He waits for me?

438
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:55,375
Look, my guy, the guy I'm into right
now, he's like that.

439
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:57,877
He thinks about me.
He holds doors.

440
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,883
Oh, Ed does that.

441
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:03,086
- Ed?
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,285
Ed's a good name.

443
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,624
I mean, it's not very original,
but that might not be such a bad thing.

444
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,029
- You want my opinion?
- Yeah.

445
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:14,630
I say, ride it like a wave.

446
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,631
What's that mean? "Ride it..."

447
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:20,200
Don't fall off the board
and it's all good.

448
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:22,903
When I'm you're age,
if don't mess it up,

449
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:24,238
I'm going to have an Ed

450
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,945
and I'm going to dig it
because it's all there is.

451
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:32,115
Just Ed or Chris...

452
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,149
Bobby, Peter...

453
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:38,655
He's invited me to Thanksgiving
at his son's house.

454
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,057
Whoa.

455
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,760
Turkey is a serious thing.

456
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,628
It's a commitment.

457
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,799
You can tell a lot about a
person by how they cook a turkey.

458
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:51,969
I don't think
Ed's gonna be making the turkey.

459
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:04,881
[chimes]

460
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:11,353

[chimes]

462
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,831
[Ed] <i>I've got you.</i>

463
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,232
Sure?

464
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,768
Almost there.

465
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,306
- Keep them closed.
- Okay, I am.

466
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:36,748
Showing you this means I'm
trusting you more than anybody.

467
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:39,414
- What is it?
- No, keep 'em closed.

468
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,916
They're closed.

469
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:42,718
Even my son
has never seen this.

470
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,322
For goodness' sake,
what is it?

471
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,155
Open them now.

472
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:48,259
Okay.

473
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:53,866
You can't see it, can you?

474
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,200
What can't I see?

475
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:08,313
[lock clicks]

476
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,899
Oh.

477
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,009
[Ronnie] Oh.

478
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,913
You have to promise me that you will never
tell anyone what you've seen here today.

479
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:44,915
I do, I... I promise.

480
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,549
Because if people find out,

481
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:50,055
when the S-H-T-F,
they will tear this place apart.

482
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:55,092
Not that I want to be
cruel or anything,

483
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,797
but they've had
plenty of warning.

484
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:01,431
This is the power supply
over here.

485
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:02,466
[mechanical whirring, humming]

486
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:05,002
I got these special mufflers

487
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,406
I designed myself.

488
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:12,278
The exhaust is channeled around to the
other side of the house to a hidden chute.

489

[clattering]

490
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:20,121
[whispers] Well,
you really are ready for anything.

491
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,356
The way I see it,

492
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,892
you never know
when things are gonna go south.

493
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:31,095
The world, the flesh
and the devil conspire,

494
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,066
and things fall apart.

495
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,871
This is my security blanket...

496
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,140
my safety net...

497
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,976
my 401k.

498
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,010
You remember when you asked me

499
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:51,117
if there was anything that I
wanted to know that I didn't know?

500
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,153
Yeah.

501
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:57,926
How... how did you do this?

502
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:02,229
What... what do you mean?

503
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:05,333
It's perfect.

504
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:30,057

[chattering]

506
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:41,235
Wrong.

507
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,342
[gasps]

508
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:51,180

510
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,351
Ooh.

511
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,192
Don't... No, I can't.

512
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:06,429
Ooh! [chuckles]

513
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:13,499
Whoa! Whoo!

514
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:15,538
[chattering]

515
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:28,317
Oh.

516
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:01,982
- Here, let me help you with that.
- Oh, no, I can handle it.

517
00:44:01,984 --> 00:44:03,283
Come on,
let me be the gentleman.

518
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,454
You are
the perfect gentleman.

519
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:07,457
Why...

520
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:09,756
[sighs] Why don't you let me...

521
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:11,193
Please?

522
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:14,264
[kisses]

523
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,576
The perfect gentleman.

524
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:35,420
[sighs] Perfect.

525
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:01,579
[breathing heavily]

526
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:22,131
[Ed] I keep this place
to work on basic skill sets.

527
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,366
You got nothing to be afraid of.

528
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,271
[Ronnie] I said I'm not afraid.

529
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,173
[Ed] Okay.

530
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:32,240
And let your eye go right down the
barrel to sight what you want to hit.

531
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,343
Couldn't you thought
of something more sinister?

532
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,582
- [Ed] Oh, it's a bear.
- It's a teddy bear.

533
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:38,283
You're...

534
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,216
Ooh! [laughs]

535
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:43,488
- Whoa!
- I did it! I did.

536
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:03,376
[chuckles]

537
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,346
What are you laughing about?

538
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:09,648
This.

539
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:12,085
Us. Here.

540
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:14,587
[chuckles]
It's so peaceful.

541
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:16,689
Mm-hmm.

542
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:18,658
It's nice.

543
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:23,396
I laugh because soon,
it's all gonna be over.

544
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,266
What do you mean?

545
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:29,569
I mean moments like this.

546
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,705
They're going to be few
and far between.

547
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:38,811
Most of the time
we'll be scrambling to survive.

548
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:44,083
Ed, I don't understand.
What... Survive what?

549
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:47,287
Oh, you have to know
what I'm talking about.

550
00:46:48,354 --> 00:46:53,293
Deep down, you can feel it even
if you don't admit it to yourself.

551
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,198
[scoffs] It might start
with a news bulletin.

552
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:04,501
You're watching a commercial or something,
and suddenly, this guy comes on.

553
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:07,604
One of those
plastic talking robots

554
00:47:07,606 --> 00:47:10,577
telling us the stock
market is gonna crash.

555
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:13,814
Then the president comes on.

556
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:18,349
And the people are all
waiting for him to speak.

557
00:47:18,351 --> 00:47:22,452
And when he does, he says
there's a national emergency

558
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:24,757
and he has to declare
martial law.

559
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:27,794
So, you can't believe it.

560
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:31,329
So, you go to the local store
and you see

561
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:35,634
<i>everyone in the street with
a strange look in their eyes</i>

562
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:37,639
<i>because they can't
believe it too.</i>

563
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:42,408
So, you get to the store
and it's filled with people

564
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,413
buying everything
they can get their hands on.

565
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:51,917
And up in the sky, helicopters
start going whoop, whoop, overhead

566
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:55,824
and you know... you know.

567
00:47:57,757 --> 00:48:01,893
The first day, you watch TV trying
to find out what's going on,

568
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:05,232
but by the third day,
it's nothing but static.

569
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,172
And the net's down, too,
just like your cell phone.

570
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:14,910
<i>Around about this time,
you hear the first gunshot.</i>

571
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:20,246
<i>And at first,
it sounds strange and novel.</i>

572
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:23,682
But then, it's everywhere.
It starts getting closer.

573
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:27,454
- [helicopter whirring]
- [Ed] <i>And then, you see a body in the street.</i>

574
00:48:27,456 --> 00:48:29,622
<i>Nobody has come to move it.</i>

575
00:48:29,624 --> 00:48:32,795
And then, another and another.

576
00:48:33,394 --> 00:48:37,264
So you decide to leave,
only you're not alone.

577
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:39,834
The streets are
choked with cars.

578
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:42,769
And then, the military comes.

579
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:45,939
Only it's not our military,
it's some other country's,

580
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:48,544
and you can't believe it.

581
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,845
But you know it's true.

582
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,883
You know.

583
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,686
You know.

584
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:03,425
It's all over.

585
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:11,701
You really think
that's gonna happen?

586
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:17,607
Ah.

587
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,576
Maybe. I don't know.

588
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,651
You're a really special lady,
Ronnie Meisner.

589
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:37,426
[stammers] Ed?

590
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:28,945
Are you okay?

591
00:50:31,048 --> 00:50:32,417
Aces.

592
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:24,865
- Dad. Welcome.
- Hey.

593
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:27,902
[Ed] This is, uh...

594
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,503
my girlfriend, Ronnie.

595
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:32,770
And a Happy Thanksgiving.

596
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:35,039
Thank you so much.
Uh, Ronnie, I'm Brian.

597
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,107
It's great to meet you.

598
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,241
- Ed.
- Janet.

599
00:52:37,243 --> 00:52:39,042
Hi. [kisses]

600
00:52:39,044 --> 00:52:40,778
I'm so glad
you could make it.

601
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,718
Oh, honey, this is Ronnie,
Dad's girlfriend.

602
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,056
- Look at you. Adorable.
- Hey.

603
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:52,725
- There's my girl.
- Hi, Grandpa.

604
00:52:56,062 --> 00:52:57,595
So, how's things going?

605
00:52:57,597 --> 00:52:58,631
Come in. Come in.

606
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:00,932
I wouldn't want to be
part of that. [laughs]

607
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:02,267
[Ed] Yeah,
you don't want that.

608
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:03,771
[Janet] Jeanine.

609
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:10,911
- I'm Jeanine.
- Nice to meet you. Ronnie.

610
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:13,882
[male announcer on TV,
indistinct]

611
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:21,922
How long has it been
with you two?

612
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:25,958
Oh, not long.

613
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,259
So, but...

614
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:28,730
But it's good?

615
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:30,029
Yeah.

616
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:34,069
You two,
you both seem so young,

617
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:35,971
so vital.

618
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,239
[chuckles]

619
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:39,840
[sighs]

620
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:43,344
You know you can turn it up
if you want.

621
00:53:44,244 --> 00:53:47,212
Oh, no. It's really not a problem.
I just like to look at the score.

622
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:48,583
Oh. You can turn it up.

623
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,152
It's really better
with the sound down.

624
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:54,589
[slurping]

625
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:56,858
I know what you're thinking.

626
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:59,028
I'm not thinking anything.

627
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:02,798
I thought that's what this
was all about: not thinking.

628
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,735
You ever talk about
traveling together?

629
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:07,269
Now's the time.

630
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:11,740
Brian and I, we've been
plotting our trip to Spain.

631
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:15,175
Oh. Spain sounds nice.

632
00:54:15,177 --> 00:54:16,843
It's hard, you know.

633
00:54:16,845 --> 00:54:19,879
Make the time to travel.

634
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,085
To... get on track.

635
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:27,756
How are you and Ed with that?
Are you...

636
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:30,158
You guys on track?

637
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:33,896
Uh...

638
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:37,666
Yeah, great. We're on track.

639
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:40,633
Don't be so sensitive.

640
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:42,868
I get it.
The angry old man thing.

641
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,839
I'm not angry. I care.

642
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:46,674
I care, too.
About my family.

643
00:54:46,676 --> 00:54:50,179
Oh, you got a funny way of showing
it, keeping your head in the sand.

644
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,115
Okay.

645
00:54:54,783 --> 00:54:56,183
I'll bite.

646
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:57,219
Show me.

647
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,320
- Brian, you...
- No, really.

648
00:55:00,322 --> 00:55:02,259
Show me something worth seeing.

649
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:06,163
All right.

650
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:13,070
And so it begins.

651
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:15,671
Where are they going?

652
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:18,007
More wine?

653
00:55:19,074 --> 00:55:20,210
No, thanks.

654
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:22,610
- [Ed] Did you even read it?
- [Brian] Of course I read it.

655
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:25,378
You stood here pacing back and
forth while I read the thing.

656
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,149
What's in your bug-out bag?

657
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,083
What is a bug-out bag?

658
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:32,089
The bag that's waiting for you
when the S-H-T-F.

659
00:55:32,722 --> 00:55:33,789
The what?

660
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,258
When the shit hits the fan!

661
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:36,928
[groans]

662
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,831
[sighing deeply]

663
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:43,298
Why do you always
act like this?

664
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,965
Like what?

665
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,836
Like you're in on some secret
that nobody else knows about.

666
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,706
I'm not the only one. There are lots
of people that know what's going on.

667
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:54,075
That's right, you're all sitting around
in your underwear with your computers...

668
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:56,111
I do not sit around
in my underwear!

669
00:55:56,113 --> 00:55:57,912
Okay, whatever the fuck
you're wearing,

670
00:55:57,914 --> 00:56:00,115
you're all telling me that
the government is doing this,

671
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:02,216
and corporations
are doing the other thing.

672
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:06,253
But you know what I see are
just people trying to survive.

673
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:08,058
Exactly, survive!

674
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,727
Look, all I'm saying is...

675
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:14,229
Wait... Let me show you.

676
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:16,997
Why don't you just admit it?
You're scared.

677
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:21,170
You're scared to face the fact that you're
never gonna figure it all out, and so what?

678
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:23,806
That's just the world,
that's what it is.

679
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,408
- [Janet] Dinner.
- It's fucked up!

680
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,881
It is crazy. It's stupid.
but it's just the world.

681
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:30,145
Dinner.

682
00:56:30,147 --> 00:56:32,013
[Brian] And you know what?

683
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:34,218
We are all gonna die one day.

684
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,321
Even you.

685
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:40,993
[Janet screaming] Dinner!

686
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:44,292
Go to the far outside.

687
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:46,161
- [Ronnie] And slice it...
- [Ed] Shape, slice...

688
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:48,330
- [Brian] Go work my way there.
- [Janet] Yes, you work your way.

689
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:50,401
Please help yourselves.
Don't let it get cold.

690
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,768
- [Brian] You'll have that?
- [Janet] Yes.

691
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,305
Thanks, Brian.

692
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:57,440
- [Brian] This looks very, very...
- And sweet potatoes?

693
00:56:57,442 --> 00:57:00,109
Oh, we're not doing
sweet potatoes this year.

694
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:02,245
- No sweet potatoes?
- Mm-mmm.

695
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:03,913
It must really be
the end of the world.

696
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:05,080
You should try this.

697
00:57:05,082 --> 00:57:06,549
It's basmati rice.
It's from India.

698
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:08,851
I know
what basmati rice is, Mom.

699
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:10,320
Next, you're gonna tell me
to finish it all

700
00:57:10,322 --> 00:57:12,222
because of starving children
in India or something.

701
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:15,327
Which reminds me,
why exactly are we eating their rice?

702
00:57:15,994 --> 00:57:18,330
It's not theirs,
it's yours now.

703
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:20,333
So, yes,
you should finish it.

704
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:24,534
- It's exotic.
- [Janet] It's a little festive this year, dinner.

705
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:25,802
[Brian] It's innovative, right?

706
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:27,973
[chattering continues]

707
00:57:29,307 --> 00:57:33,110
I don't know if I'm starving,
or if it's actually good...

708
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:38,182
You know, I was just talking to Ronnie here
about her and Ed maybe taking a little trip.

709
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:39,215
Hmm?

710
00:57:39,217 --> 00:57:41,520
Maybe going someplace exotic?

711
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:45,190
I'm sure if they want to take a
trip, they'll take a trip.

712
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,394
I'd like to see China.

713
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:52,931
China? You know
what they're doing over there?

714
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,164
I like the food.

715
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,368
There's more to the world
than Chinese restaurants.

716
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,870
[Brian] Here we go.

717
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:00,238
Like what, Grandpa?

718
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,140
Well, the thing about China...

719
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:04,475
I think your grandpa would like
to have his dinner in peace.

720
00:58:04,477 --> 00:58:07,444
- No, no. I...
- I know what you're doing, young lady.

721
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,247
I'm not doing anything.

722
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:11,850
Oh, that's right. You're so clever.
You're smarter than all of us.

723
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:14,051
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Jeanine!

724
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:17,087
[scoffs] Like I'm saying anything
you haven't said a million times.

725
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:19,056
I can assure you,
I do not use...

726
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:20,859
[Jeanine] Why do you
always have to pretend

727
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:22,993
to be something you're not?
[scoffs]

728
00:58:22,995 --> 00:58:25,230
It's like
I'm living in <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

729
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:27,998
Oh, please. You don't even know
what <i>The Twilight Zone</i> is.

730
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,600
It's a stupid TV show
in black-and-white,

731
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:33,203
so, yes, I know what
<i>The Twilight Zone</i> is, Brian.

732
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,571
All right, that's enough.

733
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:36,341
[sighs] What?

734
00:58:36,343 --> 00:58:38,042
Are you gonna
send me to my room, Brian?

735
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,944
- As a matter of fact, yeah.
- [Ed] Hey.

736
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:43,281
Hey. What kind of daughter calls
her father by his first name?

737
00:58:43,283 --> 00:58:45,887
One who has no respect.
That kind.

738
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,887
[laughs] For what?

739
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:48,890
For what?

740
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:52,224
For what? How about
the roof over your head.

741
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:54,559
Or how about the orthodontist?
Or how about the phone?

742
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:58,264
Or how about all the schoolbooks that I
buy you you never even have time to read?

743
00:58:58,266 --> 00:59:01,499
Why should I? The world's
gonna end any day now anyway.

744
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:04,903
That is just great. You see,
you have her talking this crap now!

745
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:07,572
- You see what you've done?
- Jeanine's got a mind of her own.

746
00:59:07,574 --> 00:59:10,041
Yeah, I just decide to use it.

747
00:59:10,043 --> 00:59:11,342
To stockpile nonsense?

748
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,278
You know what?
How about we all calm down

749
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,447
and maybe we talk about something
that we can all agree on.

750
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:19,087
- Hmm?
- Me and Brian agree on something.

751
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:21,519
We both think
our fathers are assholes!

752
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:24,923
All right, that's it.
Zero 'tronics for you.

753
00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:27,226
That means one month,
no TV, no phone.

754
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:29,128
- No phone?
- Yeah.

755
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,662
Ask your grandpa about that.

756
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:33,332
How're y'all gonna deal with
that when the Internet goes down,

757
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:35,401
the electrical grid collapses,

758
00:59:35,403 --> 00:59:37,203
and then, you have
to communicate with what?

759
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:39,205
You guys are gonna have to
use smoke signals...

760
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:41,473
- Mom!
- Maybe if you had a little bit more self control.

761
00:59:41,475 --> 00:59:43,945
I hope the world does end
and takes you with it!

762
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:47,515
Come back here, young lady!
Come back here!

763
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:54,154
- [Ed] Hey!
- More wine?

764
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:55,458
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.

765
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:59,394
[sighing] Not again.

766
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:02,298
[sighs]

767
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:05,033
Where is she going?

768
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:06,535
Nowhere.

769
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:11,540
You think I'm an asshole?

770
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,302
[sighs] Good night, Ronnie.

771
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,318
Don't you want to come in?

772
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:02,388
[sighs]

773
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,489
Oh, hell.

774
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:16,100
Jesus.

775
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,119
Oh...

776
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,058
Would you like a drink?

777
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,226
I thought you were
a fellow traveler.

778
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:44,695
I am a fellow traveler!

779
01:02:44,697 --> 01:02:46,800
No! I mean a prepper.

780
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:50,166
The way you shopped,
the stuff you bought.

781
01:02:50,168 --> 01:02:52,137
You used cash!

782
01:02:52,537 --> 01:02:55,805
[sighs] Not that I go in for that
level of paranoia personally,

783
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:58,809
but, hey, you can see how I could
have come to that conclusion.

784
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:02,445
Cash is easier.
You don't have to remember numbers.

785
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,414
You might try checks.

786
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,553
[Ronnie]
Everybody doesn't take checks.

787
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:09,389
Everybody takes cash.

788
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:19,398
[sighs]

789
01:03:22,267 --> 01:03:23,635
[coughs, gasps]

790
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:32,743
[exhales sharply]

791
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:35,946
When my daughter died,
it started up in her room,

792
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:39,252
and it just...
came down here.

793
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:41,288
But...

794
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:43,487
I don't understand
how you could...

795
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:44,524
Please.

796
01:03:58,237 --> 01:03:59,607
[moaning]

797
01:04:08,214 --> 01:04:10,651
- [groaning]
- [clattering]

798
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:16,757
[Ronnie] Oh... Oh.

799
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:18,626
[Ed grunts]

800
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:21,429
[both moaning]

801
01:06:14,476 --> 01:06:16,346
Oh, don't worry about it!

802
01:06:27,356 --> 01:06:31,728
Do you want your toast buttered
or you wanna do it yourself?

803
01:06:32,628 --> 01:06:34,765
[Ed] Oh, no, you can butter it.

804
01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:58,053
[clattering, thudding]

805
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,589
[Ronnie]
Oh, just leave it.

806
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:02,727
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

807
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:05,663
[gasps]

808
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:11,735
Ed?

809
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:17,541
[chattering]

810
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:23,080
- [doctor] Mrs. Meisner?
- How is he?

811
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:25,846
- [doctor] Your husband's...
- No, he's my boyfriend.

812
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:29,484
[doctor] Your boyfriend
has had what we call a TIA.

813
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:32,088
It's like a mini stroke,
but temporary.

814
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,757
It seems he's been
rationing his medications,

815
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:37,527
missing the target
on his recommended dosages.

816
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:41,697
He's gonna be a bit wobbly for a
time, but he seems like a tough man.

817
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:43,465
Can I see him now?

818
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:46,871
[doctor] Certainly,
but take it easy on him.

819
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:51,976
[sighs]

820
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,761
[Ronnie] Oh.

821
01:08:12,063 --> 01:08:14,032
You poor dear.

822
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:19,569
No. No, no, no, no. Don't.
Don't try to speak. Shh.

823
01:08:19,571 --> 01:08:21,104
I'm not a poor dear.

824
01:08:21,106 --> 01:08:23,906
No. No.

825
01:08:23,908 --> 01:08:25,010
You're strong.

826
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:33,519
The doctor told me you weren't
taking your medication.

827
01:08:34,586 --> 01:08:36,887
Yeah, it's the money,
isn't it?

828
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:41,094
I know how expensive
it gets. I know.

829
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:46,499
But you? It make no sense.

830
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,200
[sobs]

831
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:53,106
You spend all your money
on that... on that stuff.

832
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,074
For something
that may not even happen.

833
01:08:58,076 --> 01:09:01,513
No, you?
You only think about tomorrow

834
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,117
when I'm here.
I'm here right now.

835
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:10,024
And all I think about is you.

836
01:09:15,228 --> 01:09:16,697
[door opens]

837
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:18,933
I came as fast as I could...

838
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,612
Dad...

839
01:09:37,117 --> 01:09:39,153
[Ronnie sobbing]

840
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:34,809
[sighs]

841
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,740
You know,

842
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:42,678
you're the smartest man I know.

843
01:11:44,813 --> 01:11:47,084
No, I'm not.
I'm an asshole.

844
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,089
But I'm getting better.

845
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:23,153
The truck runs good.

846
01:12:24,854 --> 01:12:26,156
Well, it's a Ford.

847
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,030
Thanks for picking it up.

848
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,236
Ronnie seems like
a really great lady.

849
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,808
Yeah. Pretty great.

850
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,915
- Well...
- You got a minute?

851
01:12:52,816 --> 01:12:54,885
[Ed strains, grunts]

852
01:13:02,326 --> 01:13:03,828
[breathes heavily]

853
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:06,296
[groans] Follow me.

854
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:16,774
[sighs]

855
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:23,382
What do you see?

856
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,852
Nothing.

857
01:13:28,086 --> 01:13:29,154
Exactly.

858
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:50,074
See it now?

859
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:04,089
[door creaks, shuts]

860
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:10,429
So, this is where
all your money goes.

861
01:14:13,431 --> 01:14:14,900
So?

862
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:19,838
What do you think?

863
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:24,109
Honestly...

864
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:27,213
I'm not sure.

865
01:14:27,913 --> 01:14:29,249
Well, you can tell me.

866
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:32,515
Crazy, right?

867
01:14:32,517 --> 01:14:34,117
Look, Dad, I don't...

868
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:38,024
Well, sometimes, crazy times
call for crazy people.

869
01:14:41,459 --> 01:14:45,266
You know, Dad...
I don't think you're crazy.

870
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:49,003
Okay, maybe a little.

871
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:53,873
But I think you have to do
what makes you happy.

872
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,478
I meant... I think,
that's all any of us can do.

873
01:15:00,312 --> 01:15:03,614
I mean, if this is what
makes you happy,

874
01:15:03,616 --> 01:15:08,422
and you're not hurting anyone, I
say, hey, what the hell, go for it.

875
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,292
And that's what you think?

876
01:15:13,893 --> 01:15:15,228
That's what I think.

01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:27,441
Hey, Dad?

879
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,411
Are you okay?

880
01:15:32,045 --> 01:15:33,347
Holy shit.

881
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:44,359
I am happy. [laughs]

A sign?

899
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:17,615
From God?

900
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:20,618
Well, I don't know.

901
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,156
It said, "yard sale."

902
01:18:25,823 --> 01:18:27,392
"Yard sale"?

903
01:18:31,227 --> 01:18:33,795
Not to get metaphysical
or anything,

904
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:36,467
but I had an inspiration.

905
01:18:38,201 --> 01:18:43,240
And it does feel
kind of... divine.

906
01:18:44,174 --> 01:18:45,376
Divine?

907
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,378
Well.

908
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:50,215
I was thinking...

909
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:55,653
[sighs] maybe if we had
a yard sale.

910
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:58,389
My stuff and yours.

911
01:19:00,592 --> 01:19:02,361
We could make
a weekend of it.

912
01:19:02,893 --> 01:19:06,261
I did some research.
People can make a lot of money.

913
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:11,169
But even if we don't,
I have a feeling.

914
01:19:13,403 --> 01:19:18,142
What happened when you were
in the hospital?

915
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:21,447
What happened?

916
01:19:22,813 --> 01:19:25,416
Did you see the light?

917
01:19:26,784 --> 01:19:28,420
- The light?
- You know.

918
01:19:29,586 --> 01:19:30,688
The light.

919
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:34,694
I don't...
I don't think so.

920
01:19:35,728 --> 01:19:37,497
I just have a feeling.

921
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,168
I don't mean to upset you.

922
01:19:44,636 --> 01:19:46,473
I'm not upset.

923
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,607
Well, you sound upset.

924
01:19:50,175 --> 01:19:51,577
I'm not upset.

925
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:58,283
It's just I...
I had a feeling, too.

926
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:05,492
Maybe it's not divine
like you, but...

927
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:09,394
I have a feeling, too.

- ...that one day will realize what she did.

And then, she'll regret it,
I can promise you that.

You don't even know her.

- Now, just a minute.
