00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,967
Off to prison, American Satans.

15
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,008
Americans were shnocked

16
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:05,683
. ..of yet amnother mission to

. ..of a terrorist dictator
was thwarted at the same time.

21
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:23,564
With the election 10 days away, it
may be a setback for the White House.

22
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,971
Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards.. .

00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,368
. .. commented on the failed mission.

24
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,643
Thnis is no time for partisamn pohitics.

Brimngimng our peophe hnome
shnould be our priority.

26
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,245
Despite this crisis, the president
put on his best political face.. .

00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,444
. .. continuing on
his campaign schedule.

28
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,326

00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,605
. ..has plummeted since
the hostage crisis began.

. ..has the president
and Edwards running neck and neck.

32
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:56,843

Thne library is to be built near

39
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,250
President Benson made no statements.

40
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:23,651
Pubhicly, he seemed umnaware of
the pohitical blow he hnad been deaht.

41
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:28,563
Privately, aides marveled at his spirit

45
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,010
Sabotage.

00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,573
-He's my hnusbamnd.
-You've got to be joking.

00:53:17,053 --> 00:53:18,532
Okay, he is your hnusbamnd.

521
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,452
Topper, l was so young,
just a schnoolgirh.

522
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:24,611
He was amn older man,
so wise imn the ways of thne worhd.

523
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:27,970
He used to come around
the schoohyard, day after day.

524
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:30,562
l so admired hnis persistemnce.

525
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:34,647
Evemn the restrainimng order my parents
shapped on him was no deterrent.

526
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:39,331
He opemned my eyes to thne arts:
music, clog-damncimng, WrestleMania.

527
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:42,407
His work has meamnt so much to so many.

528
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:45,048
Amnd h owe him everythning, Topper.

529
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:46,282

00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,370

531
00:53:49,173 --> 00:53:52,165
But if you thimnk you camn hnurt

l left my hneart in my othner pants.

533
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:02,968
Go.

534
00:55:22,173 --> 00:55:23,970
Cock-a-doodhe-doo!

535

00:57:18,453 --> 00:57:21,092
Oh, those bhuffs hook treachnerous.

537
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:23,966

But if God is omn our side, we will
rendezvous on Limncoln's wart by noomn.

539
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:30,566
Thnat's it, men.

00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,009
My rescue mission was underway.

542
00:57:38,213 --> 00:57:40,932
But two things kept running
through my mind.:

543
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,044
Would we get to the men in time?

544
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:45,642
And why did l bring helium
instead of air?

545
00:57:55,853 --> 00:57:57,366
l'll go to the rear.

546
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,571

01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:18,203
-That's our ticket out.
-We camn't heave. Not without Dexter.

From out of nowhere,
a patrol boat appeared.

593
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:41,565
How would we get past the soldiers
on that boat?

594
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:45,363
Then, suddenly, it happened.

595
