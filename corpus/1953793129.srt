1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,278
Barbie Sunday
show cancelled

2
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,501
What are we going to do now ?

3
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,675
I'll think of something.

4
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,300
Cold Pizza And
A Warm Puppy

5
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,769
What's funny?
Russ didn't tell you ?

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,937
Tell me about the job,
but he didn't tell me anything funny.

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,558
He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No . Who is Pete ?

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,986
Well, it seems there's this physician type
character named Pete was all depressed one day.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,193
He felt terrible because he did some stuff
he just couldn't get over.

10
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,452
What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.

11
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,623
But Pete wasn't 
the worst guy in the universe

12
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,370
because no matter how hard he tried to
forget about it, he couldn't.

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,372
The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism

14
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,794
was overwhelming.

15
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,002
But every once in a while,
he heard a voice inside

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,553
that said:
" Pete, don't worry about it. "

17
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,507
You weren't the first licensed practioner 
that sleeps with one of your patients

18
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,183
and you won't be the last.

19
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,101
Besides, you're single.

20
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,645
Let it go.

21
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,099
But then , just when he was almost over with
the guilt and all,

22
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,605
another voice would bring him back down to reality

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,777
and said, " Oh Pete ,

24
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,150
but dude,

25
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,856
you're a veterinarian! "

26
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,020
Vi !

27
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,355
Let's go !

28
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,559
What are you doing ?

29
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,579
I don't get it.
Don't get what ?

30
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,415
What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .

31
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:24,258
You mean the veterinarian man ?
Yea, that guy. I don't get it .

32
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,593
He sleeps with his patients .

33
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:31,348
His patients are probably
cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.

34
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,940
Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats

35
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,977
I used to nap with all the time. 
I think it's sweet.

36
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,855
Actually, don't worry about it , partner.

37
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,315
There're plenty of other jokes in 
the universe that we can share .

38
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,363
Let's just get
ready for tonight.

39
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,612
Some well deserved vacation.

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,743
I got a good one for you, Violet .
Lay it on me!

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,956
Oh damn!

42
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,118
What?
I think I forgot it .

43
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,964
But that's the good thing, Daze;
I'll be here when it comes back to you .

44
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,130
Ten, nine , eight,

45
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,555
seven ,

46
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:09,970
six ,

47
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,016
five ,

48
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,013
four

49
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,181
three ,

50
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,345
two

51
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,729
One!

52
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,571
What happened over there?

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,036
Well...

54
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,533
I was just thinking that,
since how you're 18 and all,

55
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,620
you can be charged as an adult now,
for all felonies.

56
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,965
Kid's meal, ferris wheels...
God knows what else.

57
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,089
I know.

58
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,180
But hey, this should turn that around.

59
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,970
I've invited the Boss
to our party.

60
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,950
"Dear Daisy,

61
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,949
I'm sorry I couldn't be at
your birthday party

62
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,080
but I hope you have
a wonderful day. Chet . "

63
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,414
it was swell of you
to invite him.

64
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,417
Hello?
Oh, hey Russ.

65
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,871
Is that Russ calling us
to wish us a happy vacation?

66
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,581
Because if it's not,
he has got the wrong number.

67
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,756
Oh ...
Ur...

68
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,718
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .

69
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,137
Vi ?
No fucking way!

70
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,556
Violet says no.
Violet says " Fuck NO !"

71
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,260
I thought you said
we had some down time ahead.

72
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,231
No, Violet told me
you would pull something like this.

73
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,809
Oh, yea , no kidding.
She said you'll do that too.

74
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,770
Up the money and call it 
an easy gig!

75
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,732
That's textbook, Russ!
What you think we're, stupid?

76
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,071
Yes ! Same me to you!

77
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh, can you believe him?
Look at here , Daze.

78
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,661
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.

79
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,706
Be your best in my 
new signature dress.

80
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,880
Let them know you mean business
at the disco or in the boardroom ,

81
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,170
with the amazing versatility
of the premier piece

82
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,587
in my high-end line
of super stylish couture .

83
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,263
Who is better than you, girl ? 

84
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,640
Oh man !

85
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,969
How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.

86
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,519
How do you know ?
I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper 
has got one

87
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,100
and everybody was talking about it.
Let's get us ours'.

88
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,645
We can't.
Why not?

89
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,155
Because we blew the money 
on rent again.

90
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,702
Still, we might still have enough
for just one dress and then maybe ...

91
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,869
What?

92
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,281
Again , Vi ?

93
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,582
Call Russ back
before he gives the job away.

94
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,379
We got it.
But...

95
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,669
He said it was an easy gig.
right?

96
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,342
Yea.
Up the money too, didn't he?

97
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,010
Yea.

98
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,638
Then what are we waiting for?

99
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,384
That's shit!

100
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,183
Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy.
I know what we said,

101
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,733
but we have changed our mind and we...
we reconsidered your offer.

102
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,862
And we think that actually it
would go down quite well, because, er...

103
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,736
see...that day that you talked about...
( indistinct muttering )

104
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,622
Um...deeper, baby , deeper ...

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,788
Ow, gross!
You weren't suppose to like it!

106
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,878
oh...like I never do it, princess.

107
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,872
Have you gals heard about this guy?

108
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,715
O.k , so basically there was
this guy that stole some shit from Chet.

109
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,009
What did this guy take from him?
A truck full of cologne.

110
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,217
Now, this truck contains something 
in addition to just cologne

111
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,849
Something like what?
A bag full of money.

112
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,556
The weird part is that
the guy called us up and then 

113
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,859
have the stones to taunt us 
after he did what he did.

114
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,857
Stones...
Or some kind of death wish .

115
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,946
Coz he obviously gave us his address .

116
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,358
His name and number
were clear as day,

117
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,076
the whole time
he was fucking with us .

118
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,788
Cold Pepper lives about three 
blocks from this dude.

119
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,160
She has checked him out.

120
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,743
Says he's leaving in the morning
comes back in the afternoon.

121
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,335
When he comes home,
you'll be waiting for him.

122
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,548
And that's that.

123
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,716
The landlord is on our team,
so the door will be open.

124
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,719
Better be! 
Relax! The door will be open .

125
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,891
And you don't have to worry 
about the noise either.

126
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,018
Why not?
The building's almost empty.

127
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,606
Switching over to condos
or some kind of gentrification or 
some kind of shit.

128
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,941
make sure that this guy
is working alone , Ross.

129
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,442
Pretty sure. landlord says
the guy is a loner .

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,652
This happen tomorrow.

131
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,401
Can you handle it?
Of course we can handle it.

132
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,578
You got the specs' ?

133
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,209
Now we good ?

134
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,544
Yea , we're good.

135
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,872
Come on, Daze.

136
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,793
Do you gals know about 
Barbie Sunday's new dress ?

137
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,128
Yea, we know.
Just checking.

138
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,720
Daze !

139
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,055
Yea ?

140
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,967
Happy Birthday!

141
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,601
Thanks , Russ.

142
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,101
If you keep an eye on your partner, 
you might be around to see her next one.

143
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,394
Fuck off, Russ!

144
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,650
Ask her about Rose.

145
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,153
I said : Fuck off, Russ!

146
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,941
Who's Rose?

147
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,317
My old partner.

148
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,196
I thought I was your only ...
Sorry, Daze .

149
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,496
Well, what happened to her?

150
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,662
She died.
How?

151
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,869
Got shot.
How?

152
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,124
The usual way.

153
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,752
Somebody pointed a gun at her
and pulled the trigger .

154
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,296
Who?
It's complicated.

155
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,387
Well, it all kind of makes sense now.
Why ?

156
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,505
You talked about her in you 
sleep some times.

157
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,681
I do ?

158
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,349
Yea.

159
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,311
Dreaming Flowers

160
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,601
Vi ?
Yeah, man

161
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,808
I can't wait until
we get the dresses.

162
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,942
Things are going to change 
for us after that.

163
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,102
Oh hell yeah !

164
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,356
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah. This'll do .

165
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,576
If you touch you DIE

166
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,041
Cool?
Cool.

167
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,728
This really is the last time 
I'm going to say this to you...

168
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,975
Okay ? Or anything else.

169
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,183
I don't want you to send me 
anything anymore.

170
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,815
I don't...I threw out the flowers.

171
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,272
You can't fix it!

172
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,398
And I'm really done with you.

173
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,618
I don't want to talk to you again,
I don't want to hear from you again.

174
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,196
I want you to leave me alone.

175
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,203
Please . Okay ? You don't know
how to fix this.

176
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,159
You can't fix it!

177
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,711
You...have no clue...

178
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,129
Just leave me alone.

179
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,840
I don't ever want to hear from you again.

180
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,361
Wake me up when the latch turns.

181
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,862
But what if ...

182
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,066
This isn't exactly the residence of
a renegade, Daze .

183
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,821
But...
Just keep a lookout while I
go dream about a dress.

184
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,311
Him

185
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,570
Oh my God,
is that the guy?

186
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,950
What's going on ?
I don't know !

187
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,445
Why didn't he take our guns ? 
I don't know !

188
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,414
Should we wake him or
just pop him ? 
I don't know, Daze .

189
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,216
Hey, girls.

190
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,218
There's stuff in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

191
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,724
Do you know why we're here ?
Yes, I've been expecting you.

192
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,644
I think there must be some sort 
of misunderstanding.

193
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,522
We're not here
to clean your bathtub,

194
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,605
or organise your closets or
make you happy.

195
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,148
Really?

196
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,653
Yea.

197
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,326
We are here to kill you.

198
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,701
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.

199
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,085
Do you mind if I've a word
with my partner ?

200
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,257
Wait a second.
Search him, Daze.

201
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,616
He's clean, Vi.

202
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:00,952
Come on then.

203
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,508
This isn't going much like 
the picture by... 
Yea, I know.

204,
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,094
I wish
it would be more like a normal job.

205
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,755
Now it's weird!

206,
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,882
I never really talked 
to a job before.

207
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,434
Listen...this might be 
some kind of a test.

208
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,895
Everything is a test
when you're a career woman.

209
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,555
Damn right .

210
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,858
And thoses dresses aren't
going to buy themselves.

211
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,938
I got it! What?
I know what we can do! What?

212
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,941
Why don't we just go in there,
blast him without thinking about it ?

213
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,696
That way, we don't have 
to think about it.

214,
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,654
We don't even have to look either because
we never going to miss at that distance.

215
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,865
That's a good plan, Daze.
A real good one!

216
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,325
You think so?
Totally!

217
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,667
Cool.

218
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,836
But don't aim too high.
Why not?

219
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,539
We don't want to hit that little bird.

220
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,881
Oh, yea, good thinking.

221
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,258
Okay, ready?

222
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,885
Ready!
Let's do it!

223
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,948
Who wants a snack?

224
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,026
Be careful, they're hot.

225
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,697
Um ... No, thank you.

226
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,666
Don't you like cookies?
Yea, but ...

227
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,502
I feel kinda bad now.

228
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,294
Don't be ridiculous.
Are those oatmeal ?

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,596
Thanks, mister.

230
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,689
What's wrong ?

231
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,856
Wait a minute,
did you put something in these ?

232
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,022
Why are you looking 
at us funnny ?

233
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,948
No, no...no

234
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,526
It's just that you girls 
are not what I expected.

235
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,162
We didn't picture you either.

236
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,666
Keeps life interesting I guess.

237
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,164
Do you've any milk ?

238
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,555
I hate to interrupt or anything but...

239
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,647
don't you think you girls 
should better reload ?

240
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,147
Excuse me,
but what is your deal ?

241
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,352
I rather not discuss it.

242
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,568
Why not?
That's my business, that's why why not.

243
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,573
What's the big...

244
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,152
I thought for sure they'll send professionals.
They did !

245
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,454
Then why is that matter
I don't want to discuss ?

246
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,573
Wouldn't you be curious 
if you were us?

247
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,533
There's a place around the corner
if you need more ammo.

248
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,333
We got ammo!
Then let's get this show on the road!

249
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,124
I'm expecting company.

250
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,834
What kind of company ?
I'd rather not say.

251
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,758
except to say that we probably 
don't want to be here when they arrived.

252
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,553
They ? Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?

253
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,051
Whatever , man.
Do you got any more cookies ?

254
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,227
Maybe. Maybe not.

255
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,602
How about this. If you shoot me,
I'll tell you where they are,

256
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,934
and I'll throw in the recipe.
How're you going to do that dead ?

257
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,861
Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.

258
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,199
Excuse me, I need to
confer with my colleague .

259
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,110
Again?
Yea. Again.

260
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,744
Don't worry, I won't move this time.

261
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,159
I'll be right here
when you get back.

262
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,664
I know we have to off this guy 
coz that's what we got to do,

263
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,337
but I don't want to do it until 
I know why he wants us to do it.

264
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,083
I mean, something's wrong here.
What's this, Daze ?

265
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,424
I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack
a truck chucked full of cash and cologne

266
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,266
to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.

267
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,603
I want this guy's story but
getting it will just make our job harder.

268
00:21:58,818 --> 00:21:59,979
I mean it changes everything.

269
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,186
that's why they don't name any other 
pigs on a sausage farm.

270
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,239
And for that reason I think we 
shouldn't talk to him anymore.

271
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,158
That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.

272
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,696
He sure is.
How about those cookies? Oh man !

273
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,620
Have you ever had anything 
like that in your whole life ?

274
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,993
If we were rich
and didn't have to kill him,

275
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,955
we could pay him just to make 
those cookies for us, all the time.

276
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,418
Hell, what if the cookies
are just the tip of the iceberg ?

277
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,258
What if he makes brownies ?

278
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,170
We get so fat,
but it'll be so worth it!

279
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,343
Anyway,
Let's just do it as we said before...

280
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,216
I would just run in there,
blast him.

281
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,676
You bring anymore ammo?
No.

282
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,439
I thought you said you have some more.
Nah...I just wanted to sound pro and said I did.

283
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,649
It's not like we're facing five 
or six jokers

284
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,693
who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclub.

285
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,776
Beside, I was trying to
save up for the dresses.

286
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,030
Never got the hang of these.

287
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,957
I must be tiring your bucket list,

288
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,084
but I wouldn't sweat it!

289
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,083
Where is that place again ?

290
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,546
What place ?
The place...where you said 
we can get the bullets.

291
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,385
I thought you had some.

292
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,095
I was mistaken.

293
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,970
I've got a pretty
good steak knives ...

294
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,968
just trying to help .

295
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,180
You go out the front door.
You hook a right.

296
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,016
Then walk three blocks,
straight down on this side 
of the street.

297
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,442
You can't miss it.

298
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,191
I'll go, Daze.
Why can't I ?

299
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,147
'Cause you look 12
and I've ID.

300
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,698
They might actually check 
in this part of the town.

301
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,114
Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone,
and remember what I said.

302,
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,286
Okay.

303
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,497
You guys need anything ?

304
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,625
No, we're good.

305
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,849
So how long have you two been friends?

306,
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,689
I'm not suppose really to talk 
to you any more, so ...

307
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,542
Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.

308
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,962
But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.

309
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,387
You have one new message.

310
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,300
This really is the last time 
I'm going to say this to you...

311
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,641
Okay ? Or anything else.

312
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,846
I don't want you to send me 
anything anymore.

313,
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,515
I don't...I threw out the flowers.

314,
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,942
You can't fix it!

315
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,145
And I'm really done with you.

316
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,152
I don't want to talk to you again,
I don't want to hear from you again.

317
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,609
I want you to leave me alone ...

318
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,755
Um... me and Vi have been
friends for a pretty long time...

319
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,219
Maybe three years.

320
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,599
What?

321
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,896
You asked how long we have 
been friends a minute ago.

322
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,231
Oh yes .

323
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:28,983
Right.

324
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,610
We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?

325
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,691
Yea.

326,
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,620
It was that dull hospital 
over at Lexington.
Know it?

327
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,371
No.

328
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,200
We were doctors.
I mean, surgeons.

329,
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,498
Violet tells me to say surgeons.

330
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,751
Working in hospital never gave 
me bad dreams, that's for sure.

331
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,551
Anyway,
she is my best friend ever.

332
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,507
I kinda worry about her sometimes
though.

333
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,641
Half the time,
I wished I was more like her.

334
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,938
And then...

335
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,193
What?

336
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,282
I don't know.

337
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,367
She reminds me of my daughter.

338
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,418
Is that her on the phone machine?

339
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,754
But it's not important.

340
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,000
Is it, but...

341
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,798
don't let it distract you.

342
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,687
What's with that...
What's with what ?

343
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,773
The numbers you two wear.

344
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,859
These?
Yes.

345
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,531
Oh, that's our rank.

346
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,239
Officially, I'm killer number 9 
and Violet is killer number 8.

347
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,070
And how do you move up?

348
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,791
Making hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.

349,
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,868
Who is number 1?

350
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,495
No one ever seen him.

351
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,960
But he once killed three ninjas...

352
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,128
with a finger nail file.

353
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,379
Violet's Odyssey

354
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,138
Who's this?

355
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,094
There's a place about two blocks 
out from you.
It looks ike a hardware store.

356
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,352
If it is closed,
that's only what the sign says.

357
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,029
Hold on hold on, 
I'm going to take a piss.

358
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,659
Oh what else is new...

359
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,618
The moment each time 
I might need to take a piss,
you got to take a piss!

360
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,168
Not every time.
God damn it,

361
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,746
every single time I got to take a piss,
you got to take a piss!

362
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,670
You're not suppose to look down
or you can't (stood?) like a man, okay ?

363
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,878
I didn't!
You're looking down,
I saw you look down!

364
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,213
I'm looking at your face!
My man, why are you looking 
at me at all?

365
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:07,426
You get me worried 
about you sometime.
Don't you know...pee like a man?

366
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,896
Death's Door
Let's hope she hurries.

367
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,020
What's the big deal?
Who's coming over?

368
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,225
Is not important.

369
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,272
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me
where you stashed that money or anything.

370
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,119
I'm expecting company because 
of something else I did.

371
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,117
What else did you do?

372
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,079
I robbed somebody.

373
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,037
Somebody else...that's not our boss?

374
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,289
Yea.

375
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,418
Who?

376
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,842
Donnie Daffo.
Oh my...!

377
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,055
Then you really are serious
about getting yourself killed.

378
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,883
I figure it's people who
visits me today as well.

379
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,305
Small world because er...me and Vi
hate those guy's guts.

380
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,057
Two months ago
Vi ran into them

381
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,438
and they locked her in a dumpster.

382
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,563
It looked like someone had taken 
the life out of her.

383
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,865
Is that all they did?

384
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,161
You mean...
locked her in that trash can?

385
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,623
Well, yeah , I mean,
that's all she told me.

386
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,575
What else would they...

387
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,423
Russ is such an ass.

388
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,548
Thinks he's smart
but he is not.

389
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,165
Nothing to say this time ?

390
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,798
Maybe you might have
learned your lesson after all.

391
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,138
I'd like something to have you
tell your boss.

392
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,092
In this fucking economy
that chicken shit must be pretty hard up

393
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,511
to send a little cunt like you

394
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,096
to do a man's job.

395,
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,149
Fuck you later!

396
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,503
The hardware store you're looking for

397
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,089
is right around the corner.

398
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,726
Hi .
We're closed. What do you want?

399
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,363
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yea, you do.

400
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,658
The black door in the back.

401
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,698
Much obliged.

402
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,758
How can I help you ?

403
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,771
Let's go, let's go, come on.

404
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,727
Move fast.
Check on those boxes right over there.

405
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,778
Let's go, come on.

406
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,789
"But dude,
you're a vegetarian ! "

407
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Oh...
See ?
Oh...ah

408
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,527
Tat...tat...

409
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,743
One, two, three , four, five...
I demand to fight thumb .

410
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,708
Alright...???

411
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,959
No, you go first!
No ...you are ... 

412
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,542
...( indistinct reply )

413
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,219
Hey!

414
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,509
Look who's here?

415
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,015
We just saw your stupid 
little girl friend

416
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,810
had to tell about herself.

417
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,849
You should see the face.

418
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,145
Just this one we had to wack 
out a couple of quiet rounds.

419
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,781
Yea...and we took our time doing it too.

420
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,235
Your stupid little girlfriend looked 
scare more than those two 
fagggots put together .

421
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,239
Even when things are getting up before them.

422
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,035
Step aside, Joe babe.

423
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,790
Well, don't, if you want to be a tough guy 
and see what happens to you!

424
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,216
Do it, do what they say, Daisy.

425
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,763
Can I ask you fellows something?

426
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,551
Nah, forget it.
Come on.

427
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,849
Excuse me?

428
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,856
Please .

429
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,103
Everybody!
Please.

430
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,192
Very good !

431
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,024
But I won't get into it until
you hold through the hardware!

432
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,322
Why would we do that ?
So you don't get tired .

433
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,037
What do you think we are, stupid?
Of course I think you're stupid!

434
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,656
That's the point!

435
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,958
You're going to have enough trouble keeping up with what I'm going to tell you as it's.

436
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:52,664
If you tug it out too
we'll be wasting everybody's time.

437
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,340
You don't want mama's good 
wrist? go to waste, do you?

438
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,220
Heck, I'll be surprise if your 
arms aren't burnt already

439
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,380
for keeping us at 
guns' point for so long

440
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,351
I mean. it's not like we're
packed or anything, what're you afraid of?

441
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,646
Felt better ?

442
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,779
Alright, where was I ?
You're going to ask us something.

443
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,656
Oh, that's right. Thanks.

444
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,828
Okay. So, here it goes...

445
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,167
My partner weighs in 
at about 95 pouds, right ?

446
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,966
And together you guys are pushing
half a ton, give or take, correct ?

447
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:45,216
So, did you need much help 
stuffing her into that garbage can ?

448
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:50,979
Now...

449
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,064
I usually don't talk to people
like you in the first place,

450
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,361
but if I did that sort of thing,

451
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,981
I would say you girls
should have your own TV show.

452
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,659
And that they should call that program
"The Adventures of Donnie Bitches " .

453
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,951
But like I said, it's tough.

454
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,281
I usually don't talk
to people like you.

455
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,538
Because talking to people 
like you doesn't make much sense.

456
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,708
What do you mean,
" people like us ? " 

457
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,790
What the hell kind 
of people are we ?

458
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,970
Dead ones.

459
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,385
Ha...ha...What?

460
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,028
Found some bullets.
But now I might be out again.

461
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,534
I don't know about you, partner,
but I think I'm hearing something.

462
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,457
Something like what ?

463
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,627
The " Internal Bleeding Dance " !

464
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,962
I could sure use some help too.
You got it, partner!

465
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,302
No but I want the fat one !
They're all fat , beat it !

466
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,021
Say mister,

467
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,441
You got any other leads
where I can get some more bullets?

468
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,148
The other place got turned into 
a crime scene, long story.

469
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,446
So just keep thinking on it, 
okay ?

470
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,363
Are you expecting anybody else ?

471
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,240
Are you sure ?

472
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,201
It might be back up 
for Donnie's crew.

473
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,162
Maybe they suppose to call in,
you know, like we do.

474
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,706
Then why don't they just 
come right in if everybody else has?

475
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,677
I don't know...who the hell is it.
I'm out of bullets again!

476
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,850
I'll get it.

477
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,560
What? Wait but
what if it's Donnie's other guys?

478
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,113
I know what they'll do.
I thought you wanted us to kill you ?

479
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,405
You jealous ?

480
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,694
Kinda.
Now take the fire escape. I'll stall them.

481
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,280
Otherwise they'll kill us all 
after they saw what happened in here.

482
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,330
Go !

483
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,002
You should come too !
No, no, I shouldn't .

484
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,125
This way I buy you some time. 
Go !

485
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,297
Please .

486
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,549
Go, go , go!

487
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,845
Everything okay in there?
I thought I heard something .

488
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,302
Fine... Dolores .

489
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,937
How've you been ?
I thought I heard something .

490
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,266
You know what, I did too. 
Sounds like it's coming from upstairs again.

491
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,730
I was sure it's coming from here.

492
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,272
Did you try next door ?
Are you sure everything is okay in there?

493
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,940
Yes.

494
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,450
I really should go now, Dolores.

495
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,156
You take care.

496
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,241
But I...
Dolores...

497
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,583
Dolores...

498
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,621
Take care.

499
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,347
Couldn't get me right,
so...!

500
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,277
115th Precinct,
Officer Minocha speaking.

501
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,447
There's something wrong 
at the apartment down the hall from me.

502
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,653
Then we'll have to take care 
of him too, you know ?

503
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,778
I know.

504
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,567
I think we should do it now .
Why ?

505
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,991
He's sleeping.
It'll be merciful.

506
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,449
I thought we're out 
of bullets again.

507
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,248
We're...but I can run out
and get some more somewhere real quick.

508
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,959
We couldn't even do it now 
even if we had the bullets.

509
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,666
Why not?
I don't know.

510
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,968
He said,
he wanted to see it coming.

511
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,421
When?
While you were out.

512
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,390
Did he say anything else ?
Like what?

513
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,350
Like why he wants to check out that bad.

514
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,224
A little .
Well ?

515
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,061
He...has got bad cancer .

516
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,402
It's in my pancreas and it's spreading.

517
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,400
Going to die and I rather 
not take the scenic route.

518
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,701
I don't think he has 
anybody who loves him either.
It must be even worse.

519
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,788
We should think about 
going to his funeral.

520
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,832
You know, just so that there's someone there.

521
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,838
What?

522
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,086
What ?

523
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,968
At the end of the day, 
Donnie will send the surviving member 

524
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,720
of his squad and
finish the job, either way.


525
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,844
So if it's not us doing this,
it'll be somebody else!

526
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,800
and besides, 
this guy is dead already!

527
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,307
In fact, it's way better
if we're the one doing it

528
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,643
because unlike Donnie's punks,

529
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,976
we are not going to 
torture him for 8 or 9 hours first.

530
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,941
Did you hear something?

531
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,713
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.

532
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,290
What's with the " E " chilled ?

533
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,050
This ?
Yea .

534
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:39,338
I've been deputised.
I'm serious , Vi. 
Fine!

535
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,599
I had a little incident
while I was out getting the bullets.

536
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,727
Do you want to talk about it?
Are you interested?

537
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:46,929
Always.

538
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,019
So the second I get the lead,

539
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,693
three desperado storeman 
holed up the the spot.

540
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,356
First I'm thinking,
I'm just going to lay low and I'll 
be free and let this shit be.


541
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,950
Then , one of them sees me
and gets the bright idea

542
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,779
that they should rob me too.

543
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,366
So I proceeded to inform the perv
and his pals

544
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,417
about multiple ways in which 
they might violate their mothers.

545
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,498
So while they were trying to 
figure out where I got the balls,

546
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,836
the cops showed up.

547
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,135
Was it because the place
has a silent alarm ?

548
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,215
No.

549
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,387
Was it because the cops
just got lucky ?

550
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,597
Hell no!

551
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:27,099
This place is a stone's throw
from the 115th Precinct!

552
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,305
So the minute I 
remembered that little detail,

553
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,598
I'm thinking one or two things.

554
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,977
These desperados are either
stupid or crazy as all hell.

555
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,690
Whatever the case,
the cops apprehended the whole crew,

556
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,574
and then one of the 
fuzzy-wuzzy asked me if I was okay.

557
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,360
So I said, " Officer ,

558
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,241
how do you know
I wasn't in on it ? "

559
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,745
What makes you think
a girl cannot be in on it?

560
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,584
Next thing I hear,

561
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,084
is " Bang, bang , bang ! "

562
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,710
The guy behind the register flips
and start shooting at the pervs.

563
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,963
It seems the other gunner 
beneath the counter took the robbery personally.

564
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,173
Well long story short,

565
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,675
just about everybody 
ended up taking a shot or two,

566
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,098
except for yours truly.

567
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,760
That's how I got this one chilled on me.

568
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,060
It was blasted off 
the portal and just landed there.
Scout's honor.

569
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,649
Anyway, right about then,
I thought it might be prudent to exit

570
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,353
the premises through the rear.

571
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,068
Some days, you just can't 
get a bullet to save your life.

572
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,071
And here above all places.

573
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,245
I mean , shit,
this is America , right?

574
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,492
But...how did you get so dirty?

575
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,243
I slipped on a banana peel 
at an alley way coming back. 

576
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,663
Let's go see about the dresses.

577
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,973
How are you gals holding up?

578
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:52,812
Fine.

579
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,191
Fine. We're out of 
bullets again, you know ?

580
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,440
Why don't you use 
one of those guys's gun?

581
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,359
They seem to have plenty.

582
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,949
Why didn't the hell I think of that?

583
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,594
These guys got everything Daze !

584
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,311
Even a little ??? for your purse.
You know, the blue one ?

585
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,061
This's like Christmas !

586
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,235
Oh, I got you...
Idiot !

587
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,079
Take your pick, mister.

588
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,449
Why don't you decide?

589
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,410
Okay, let's see...

590
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,795
I'm going to go with the .38 , 
Daze.

591
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,301
Alright, you ready, Mister ?

592
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,029
Sure .

593
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,736
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

594
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,738
Hadi Haha .

595
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,289
What?

596
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,826
Are you done yet?

597
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,002
Come again?

598
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,960
I said , " Are you done yet ? "

599
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,165
What are you talking about?

600
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,086
You're...seriously going to do it,
were you ?

601
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,129
I most certainly was...

602
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,006
With that piece ?

603
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:52,974
Yea !

604
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,224
Suit yourself.
Why...shouldn't I ?

605
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,311
It is unprofessional.

606
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,524
How is that?

607
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,027
Forensics.

608
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,817
Forensics ?
Yea !

609
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,566
Forensics. Ballistics.

610
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,785
There's a real good chance 

611
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,955
those dorks will foul everything up for us
if we do it like this.

612
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,450
I mean Donnie's guys 
can even wind up with the credit 

613
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,954
if they traced the gun ,

614
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,666
and boss try to 
weasel out of paying us .

615
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,295
Even worse, we might 
get blamed for every corpse in here.

616
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,002
And boss would chaff us to the hill
and account the unnecessary roughness.

617
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,514
Not to mention the gang war
we might already started.

618
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,967
And it's not even like we can
switch out the bullets

619
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,433
because the caliber wouldn't
begin to match the ones in our styles and rods.

620
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,808
So, like I said, you can do it
your way if you want to, but ...

621
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,233
we risk looking unprofessional
and getting screwed...

622
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,314
out of a couple of hot dresses.

623
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,024
Good thinking , Daze .
Forensics will fuck you.

624
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,770
You would've thought of it too, Vi .

625
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,277
Yea , maybe.
I need a smoke.

626
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,324
You do that ?

627
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,327
When did you start doing that ?

628
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,536
I don't know.

629
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,536
Where did you get those?

630
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,959
Oh, from those guys.

631
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,747
You mind if I smoke in your place, mister?
Yea.

632
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,510
Yea, you mind or yes it's okay?
Yea, I mind.

633
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,388
Actually...
do what you like.

634
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,383
It don't matter anyway.

635
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,933
I'll take it out to the stairs.

636
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,733
Oh, Violet , you might 
want to wipe your prints off those pieces .

637
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,685
Put them back on the floors.

638
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,067
Sounds good , Daze .

639
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,706
Come on, sit down,
I want to show you something.

640
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,085
You know you probably be a millionaire 
if you clean your ears out more often.

641
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,510
No, ah !

642
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,263
Here .

643
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,220
Now what're you going to tell me?

644
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,136
Yea, the secret...

645
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,142
you were going to tell me.

646
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,714
Can I ask you something ?

647
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,172
Why is she so mad at you ?

648
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:19,135
She's your friend, you tell me.
I'm not talking about Violet !

649
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,268
She blames me for something.
For what?

650
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,934
Her mother's death.
Why, did you kill her?

651
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,736
No, no...she died 
after she left me.

652
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:41,031
Why did she leave you?
She didn't love me.

653
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,406
Why didn't she love you?
I don't know, Daisy.

654
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,039
I don't think people have
a lot of control over that sort of things.

655
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,340
As a husband I wasn't 
much of a price anyway.

656
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,177
Whatever the case,
she...felt in love with some one else.

657
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,513
Who?

658
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,136
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.

659
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,896
I only saw him once...

660
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,265
from a distance.

661
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,859
They died in a car accident.

662
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,944
How did your daughter 
figure that it's your fault?

663
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,407
Well, my daughter
didn't know about the affair.

664
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,125
She blamed me for the breakup

665
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,420
and consequently the...
car accident.

666
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,628
Well, did you
ever tell her the whole story?

667
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,342
No .
Why not ?

668
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,048
Because I want her to remember 
her mother the way she does now.

669
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,884
That's stupid.
You are stupid.

670
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,311
Thank you .
Did your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

671
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,064
What?
Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

672
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,191
Very much.

673
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,858
At least you did something right.

674
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:03,281
Now, I'm going to get some bullets
and be done with all these.

675
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,948
Tell Violet.

676
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,870
Photosynthesis

677
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,310
You like my partner, don't you?

678
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,935
What's there not to like?
She's a...sweet girl.

679
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,693
Do you like her better than me ?

680
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,234
I don't know you as well.

681
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:26,867
That's okay.

682
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,117
I like her better than me too.
She might even think she can

683
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,871
keep you alive for 
some silly reasons. Kids.

684
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,632
May I ask you a question, Violet ?
You may ask.

685
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,548
You ever miss a doll house?

686
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,591
Not particularly.

687
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,894
And I think I know
what you're driving at, mister.

688
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,100
But this job never got to me,

689
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,853
aside from the 
sensational rush of the action.

690
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,776
What about those men?
What men?

691
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,109
The ones you killed.

692
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,066
That...was fucking magical.

693
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,821
Did you see that ?

694
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,120
Is a bit early to know
but career wise,

695
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,290
that little miracle,
might be my Mona Lisa .

696
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,117
If not, my Billie Jean.

697
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,870
Actually...
Do you have family?

698
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,542
What?

699
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,124
Do you have any family?

700
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,505
What a random question!
Well, do you?

701
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,554
Daisy is like family.

702
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,768
You didn't answer the question.

703
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,524
I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?

704
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,226
When was the last time 
he and you spoke?

705
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,612
What do you care?
That long, huh?

706
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,122
Are you afraid of what is next ?
You mean getting shot ?

707
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,957
I mean after that.

708,
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,417
I haven't thought about it.

709
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,835
And ?

710
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,586
I haven't come up
with anything conclusive .

711
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,304
I'm not an expert or anything
but I have a theory.

712
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,512
Hmm?

713
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,349
I figure...

714
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,972
I figure heaven 
is probably a place where

715
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,767
Nobody cares how big
or small you are or what you look like.

716
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,358
People probably
don't even have bodies.

717
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,743
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.

718
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,113
But if they do have bodies,
everybody got to to be naked for sure.

719
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,575
because that's how we all 
show up here in the first place, right?

720
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,958
And, also if you've a back problem,

721
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,964
or bad knees 
or self-esteem issues,

722
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,713
that stuff wouldn't 
bother you anymore up there.

723
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,341
And everything is free too,

724
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,339
or at least wholesale.

725
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:57,260
I don't know if there are animals
but that would be cool .

726
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,935
Oh yea,

727
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,773
and when you walk into the gate,
it's for the very first time.

728
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,572
They're probably playing
that Louis Armstrong's song.

729
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,653
Something nice like that.

730
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,655
Part of it came
from this girl I knew.

731
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,996
She died.

732
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,827
It's a long story.
Anyway she finds everybody

733
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,128
would be naked up there,
that was her idea.

734
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,500
How did she die ?
I don't want to talk about it !

735
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,753
I mean,
I do but,

736
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,506
when I tried it never works.

737
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,012
Maybe someday.

738
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,193
Wow...

739
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,400
Sit up...

740
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,540
Who wants some snack ?

741
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,376
You know what?

742
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,419
Wow!

743
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,216
What?

744
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,629
I don't think 
there're enough holes here 

745
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,590
from the first time 
Daisy and I came out blasting.

746
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,049
Is that important ?

747
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,182
Could be.

748
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:23,354
In any case, I've a feeling like 
my partner is not exactly holding up her end.

749
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,356
I've never...

750
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,316
actually...

751
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,982
really ever killed anybody.

752
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,029
I've been using blanks.

753
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,197
I just make sure 
me and Violet never share ammunition.

754
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,492
I guess that...she's so fierce
and thorough on a job,

755
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,369
I can pack a squirt gun
it just won't matter!

756
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,168
How do you mean 
holding up her end?

757
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,877
I mean that I might be 
the only one who taking out the trash.

758
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,837
Means that looks like
she might be packing blanks.

759
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,173
So what?

760
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,887
So what?
Yes, so what?

761
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,062
Even if she isn't taking people out,
isn't it better that she is with you?

762
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,557
You think your problem's of
having two targets instead of one

763
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,938
might save you behind a time or two

764
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,567
Do you understand ?
She's risking her life as well ?

765
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,069
Do you think
your...your friendship

766
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,867
might have helped 
keep you sane

767
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,618
as you wonder through this life of yours?
There's still the principle.

768
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,001
We have rules
and what she meant happened to her,

769
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,125
is a big No No,
no matter how you sliced it.

770
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,084
Coz one day you're packing blanks
and the next you're wearing a wire.

771
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,300
So what are you gonna do about it?

772
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,977
I'm going to have to take her out
if my suspicion is true.


773
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,767
I thought
Daisy was your friend.

774
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,023
I'm not saying I'm going to like it.

775
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,230
I thought you said she's like family

776
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,613
She is.

777
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,526
But she is a businesswoman too
so she will understand.

778
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,660
I was figure to 
check it out first anyway,

779
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,831
Why?
Because that's how it usually goes
for the big ones.

780
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,663
You got a hair dryer?

781
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,207
Rose Again

782
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,970
If you touch you DIE 

783
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,195
Unit 42 , come in.

784
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,710
Unit 42,
respond to dispatch.

785
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,258
You just missed her.

786
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,302
Daze ?
She just left.

787
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:28,890
Who?

788
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,767
Rose.

789
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,017
Was she alive?
I don't know.

790
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,061
She asked about you.

791
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,688
What did she say ?

792
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,605
She said :
" I'm looking for your partner. "

793
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,693
Those were her exact words.

794
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,151
Is that all she said ?
No .

795
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:51,748
She said that roses were dead,
and violets were too.

796
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,121
She split after that
and that's the end of it.

797
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,328
How long have you been here ?

798
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,293
She's taller than I thought.

799
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,963
How long have you been here, Daze ?

800
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,171
I can't really tell.

801
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,097
Time is spent up now,
so I don't know.

802
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,346
I keep missing my flights.

803
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,227
What's that?

804
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,855
Oh, that ?

805
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,733
That's his,
the guy's.

806
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,321
Rose is back.

807
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,572
Nine Divided by One

808
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,499
Hello, Number 9.

809
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,5
Oh my !

810
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,380
Are you... ?

811
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,054
Wow!

812
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:53,343
I always figure you were...
You always figure I was what ?

813
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,970
Imaginary.

814
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,056
Or a boy.

815
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,770
Do you know what I've been doing today ?

816
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,603
I've been watching you 
and your partner.

817
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,230
Did you hear something?

818
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,282
That partner of yours 
is clean out of her mind.

819
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,282
She's going to put 
us all in a real bad spot.

820
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,412
We can't let that happen.

821
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,789
I can't let that happen.

822
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,839
I won't let that happen.

823
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,049
Do you even know what grief 
her little sloth is going to cost us?

824
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,179
Well, I 'll tell you.

825
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,509
Two the idiots that she went to
??? with were engaged.

826
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,137
Do you know who 
they're going to marry?

827
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,523
The Police Chief's step-daughters. 

828
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,813
And you can bet the house once
they sort out all these rubbish ,

829
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,232
Boss is going 
be held accountable.

830
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:51,318
Next to that, a garden variety
gang war would be a Sunday stroll.

831
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,362
There's dead guys 
at the bottom of the steps .

832
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,205
He saw me !

833
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,547
Can I ask you a question, mam' ?

834
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,339
Do you always work by your self ?

835
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,170
Yes.

836
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,888
Is it lonely?

837
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,892
What's that to you?

838
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,098
Just wondering.

839
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,930
Well then, let's get 
back to business

840
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,144
because I'm late
for my ballet class.

841
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,319
Finish the job
or face the consequences.

842
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,400
Am I clear ?

843
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,405
Well...

844
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,073
I got news for you, Number 1.

845
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,081
Given the situation , I see
why are you T.O. and all,

846
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,249
But what's done is done.

847
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,164
And my partner comes first.

848
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,337
What's that suppose to mean ?
It means,

849
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,215
that you try to take her out 
or get in the middle of our job,

850
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,877
you're in a world of hurt !

851
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,839
I know what you are capable of
but we are pros too.

852
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,593
We also know that
you're coming now.

853
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,135
Do you know what I wanted 
to be when I was your age ?

854
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,773
I don't either.

855
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,814
I like you, kid.

856
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,862
You're in over your head

857
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,238
and you're scared yet you look death 
in the eye without blinking.

858
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:18,450
It's admirable
but it won't save you.

859
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,574
It won't save your partner

860
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,370
and it won't save your new pal.

861
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,081
Finish the job 
or face the consequences.

862
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,251
You got an hour.

863
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,673
Sorry about that stuff
I said before.

864
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,016
What stuff?

865
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,763
When I called you 
stupid and stuff.

866
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,980
That's okay.

867
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,692
Did you find anymore 
bullets all around?

868
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:55,949
Hey.

869
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,576
Want to hear something?

870
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,208
Your daughter doesn't hate you.

871
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,793
How do you know?

872
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,296
I know.

873
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:15,423
How could you?

874
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,135
You never even met her.

875
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:21,975
It don't matter.

876
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,689
I still know
she doesn't hate you.

877
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,108
How ?

878
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,446
I'm a daughter too.

879
01:06:49,130 ??--> 01:06:50,086
Vi ?

880
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,254
She left.

881
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,381
Where did she go ?

882
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,009
To get more bullets.

883
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,731
Listen carefully, Daisy.

884
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,351
When she comes back,

885
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,572
I need for you 
the one to put me down.

886
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:19,817
It's very important.

887
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,661
Why me ?

888
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,211
Because you and I
are friends, right?

889
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,131
I guess, but ...
Will you promise me then?

890,
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,721
I can't.
I need you to promise me.

891
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,520
But I can't .
I need you to do this for me.

892
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,938
I can't!
I need you to do this for me !

893
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,562
No, I can't!
Don't argue with me, April !

894
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,110
But I'm Daisy.
Just don't argue with me, girl !

895
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,664
You promise me!

896
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,084
Say it.

897
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,045
I promise.
You promise ?

898
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,962
I said I would, didn't I ?

899
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,809
I've something to show you.

900
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:48,073
I tried to give it to my daughter
but she...threw it back at me .

901
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,959
I think you're about her size.

902
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,328
Would you try it on ?

903
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,797
I'll wait in the other room.

904
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,429
Immortality

905
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,701
Got the bullets.

906
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,583
You'll be surprise 
how many places I...

907
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,792
What's going on?

908
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,295
How do I look?

909
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,596
Okay.
Where did you get it?

910
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,845
He gave it to me .

911
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,728
What for?

912
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,732
I don't know, Vi.

913
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,065
Can I talk to you a minute?

914
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:11,822
Have you lost your mind?

915
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,407
What is your problem?
You're my problem!

916
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,785
I'll let you borrow it some time
if that's what this is about.

917
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,665
Well it's not about the fucking dress!

918
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,621
Yeah, right.
That's exactly right!
 
919
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:22,841
You know what, Violet !
We don't know anybody

920
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,053
or get involved in stuff
or anything like that !

921
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,760
I never went to a prom !
You did but I didn't !

922
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,598
I'm glad you didn't!
Why ?

923
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,267
Because they would laugh at you !
How do you know ?

924
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,100
Because that's what they do,
if you're different.

925
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,853
Everybody isn't like that, Vi.
And so what if they laugh?

926
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,525
So what?
Don't tell me what I know.

927
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,194
You haven't been through things like me.

928
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,647
And I hope I'll never do,
if it makes me so scared!

929
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,608
I'm not scared!
Yes, you are, Violet.

930
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,028
You don't trust anyone
or anything.

931
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,656
You never did.

932
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,577
I trusted you !

933
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:57,959
What?

934
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,088
I said I trusted you !

935
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,085
When did you stop?

936
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,255
The second I saw that
god damn dress on your back!

937
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,766
That's just perfect then.

938
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:13,975
Why ?

939
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,017
Because now you don't
have anything at all.

940
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,938
So what are you trying to say ?
I just said it.

941
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,569
Say it again ,
if you have the guts.

942
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,234
You heard me !
I'm going to kick your ass !

943
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,133
Cut it off, bitch !
You're going to mess up my new dress !

944
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,565
My landlady was coming up the street.

945
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,698
I was just...

946
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,239
just messing with her .

947
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,156
Never shot a gun before.

948
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,708
How was it?
What you aiming for some new shoes now?

949
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,497
Shut up about it !
You shut up about it !

950
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,998
Make me !
I just did !

951
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,001
Oh, is that what you called it ?
Violet !

952
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,172
What?

953
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,969
I almost forgot I got...
something for you too.

954
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,262
Really?

955
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,321
Why are you giving this to me ?
You have a unique world view .

956
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,122
Now you can share it with others,

957
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,575
in a new way.

958
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,628
Thanks a lot, mister.

959
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,133
I need the police.

960
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:13,257
Yes, that's my address.

961
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,673
What are you doing?

962
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,133
He's writing a letter.

963
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:19,892
To who?

964
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,595
To " whom ".

965
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:22,895
To whom?

966
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,188
His daughter.

967
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,616
I'll do it.

968
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,077
What?

969
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,197
I'll write it for you.

970
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,291
Alright .

971
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,085
Thank you.

972
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,269
So, where was I?

973
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,063
" Dear April... "

974
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,142
That's it?

975
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,772
So far, yeah.

976
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,613
" Dear April,

977
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,199
I don't know
if you'll ever read this,

978
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,082
but I hope do.

979
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,502
In any case...

980
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,415
It's time we finally talk.

981
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,301
Please, take good care of yourself.

982
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:41,349
I managed, to put some money 
in your bank accounts.

983
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,557
Please use it
to continue your education.

984
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,973
Your mother would've wanted that too.

985
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,269
Don't worry about 
the dead men in the bathtub.

986
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:58,025
Is not... what it looks like

987
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,283
and a long a story 
to tell rihgt now.

988
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,292
Sometimes...

989
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,578
for no particular reason,

990
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,629
I think of you

991
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,541
and smile.

992
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,341
Usually about that day that...

993
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,891
we drove out to the mall

994
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,551
for your birthday.

995
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,354
Your mom had the flu,

996
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,558
and she said
to go on without her.

997
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,232
I remember you wonder off,

998
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,817
got lost,

999
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,030
and two hours later

1000
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,204
we finally found each other.

1001
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,953
We hugged,

1002
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,169
you didn't want to let go.

1003
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,218
Then we had ice cream

1004
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:06,636
and we talked
all the way home.

1005
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,564
I think that was
the happiest day I had.

1006
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,322
I know I probably wasn't 
the best father in the world,

1007
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,457
but I tried the best I could.

1008
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,423
Anyway,

1009
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,554
I loved you all
the the possibe way I can.


1010
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,723
Love, Dad. "

1011
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,346
Uh, " PS :

1012
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,229
This isn't my handwriting,

1013
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,063
because a friend of mine

1014
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,562
wrote it out for me. "

1015
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:06,370
If you just leave that in the...
apartment where you go, 
sure to get to her.

1016
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,036
Glad you girls came by.

1017
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,086
I wouldn't have
written that otherwise.

1018
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,119
Daze...

1019
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,159
We got to go now, Daze.

1020
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,627
He never even
said his name, Vi.

1021
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:07,972
Come on now.

1022
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,715
The bike is gone.

1023
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,342
I know.

1024
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,201
Barbie Sunday Dresses Have Arrived!

1025
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,964
Well, we got them.
Yeap.

1026
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,847
It was off the menu.
Yeah, so is yours .

1027
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:39,686
Hey, I know we never really talked
about stuff since that day .

1028
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,936
Are we cool ?

1029
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,277
Yeah, of course.

1030
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:46,987
Precious.

1031
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,952
Hey, you hungry or anything?

1032
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,118
Not really.
I'm just going to take a walk .

1033
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,120
Yeah, screw food.

1034
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,043
I could use a nap
if you want to know the truth.

1035
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,247
You want me to take your bag home ?

1036
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:04,380
No?

1037
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,387
This better not be Russ.

1038
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,182
It's my dad.

1039
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:15,974
Really ?

1040
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:20,139
I tried to get the pizza place
but I...I pressed his number instead.

1041
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:22,940
Long story.

1042
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,730
Hang on a sec, Phil.

1043
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:38,660
See you, Daze !

1044
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,591
Hey Dad.

1045
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:01,229
One More Thing

1046
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,281
April ?

1047
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,030
Are you umm...April ?

1048
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:37,723
Hi. 

1049
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,391
Hi. 

1050
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,854
I was a friend of your father's.

1051
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,728
I just want to tell you know that...

1052
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,648
I was a friend of his and...

1053
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,522
that he talked about you a lot.

1054
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:59,742
He wanted me to give 
something to you too.

1055
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,040
What's it?

1056
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,623
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.

1057
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,334
For real ?
Yeah.

1058
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,965
I think it should fit.

1059
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,586
There's something else in there too.

1060
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:17,971
Thanks.

1061
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:19,507
You're welcome.

1062
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,684
Your father was a good guy, April.

1063
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:30,064
He told me how you two got lost 
in the mall one day and then had ice cream.

1064
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,157
Well,

1065
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,284
see you.
