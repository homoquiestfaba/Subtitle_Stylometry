[Poppy]  Without a doubt,
this has been a strange day.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,013
What was supposed to be
a harmonious pillow harvest

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,724
led to an all-out pillow war,

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,185
which got a tiny bit out of hand.

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,189
[Troll monster roars]
[Trolls scream]

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,358
But when we discovered a mysterious box,

21
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,696
we realized the craziness had just begun.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,701
It's a wooden chest filled with Troll wigs
and masks of us.

23
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,539
And look, some sort of journal,
detailing our habits and routines.

24
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,665
That's silly.

25
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,586
Why would anyone hide a box like that
out here in the middle of nowhere?

26
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,754
I'll tell you why.

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,800
Because someone's pretending to be a Troll
to spy on us.

28
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,302
There's an imposter in our midst.

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,138
And based on this journal,

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,517
I'd say he or she is learning
our weaknesses,

31
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,896
maybe to steal something,
or maybe lead a full-scale invasion!

32
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,695
There's not an imposter.

33
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,156
This is Branch, remember?

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,409
He's always spouting off
paranoid conspiracy theories.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494
No, I don't.

36
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,124
Satin is actually Chenille.
They were switched at birth.

37
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,172
The Man in the Moon
is actually a little boy fishing.

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,971
The birds have formed an alliance.
They're teaming up against us.

39
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,931
[Trolls roar with laughter]

40
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,141
You'll regret this!

41
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,104
And remember that time he told us
eating too much sugar

42
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,480
would make our teeth fall out?

43
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
What a kook!

44
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,235
Oh, that was for real?

Oh, Mr. Dentist!

Guys, I'm not paranoid!

47
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,741
This is clearly
a hidden chest of disguises

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,702
that someone
didn't want us knowing about.

49
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:46,916
You say "chest of disguises".
I say "emergency costume party box".

50
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,711
An emergency costume party box?

51
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,713
Who on earth
would have something like that?

52
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,923

As much as I like teasing Branch,

56
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,055
it is strange that someone
would hide their costume box

57
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,307
all the way out here.

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,059
Yeah, we all enjoy mocking Branch.

59
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,479

Maybe we should hear him out.

Life is not great, Branch.
There's an imposter in our midst.

What? What happened to
"emergency costume party box"?

Get your head out of the clouds.
I said that to put everyone at ease.

But you accused me of being paranoid.

You... You sang an entire song
assailing my character.

I didn't want anyone to freak out.

98

of freaking out.

and make sure
he or she doesn't mean us any harm.

00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,938

-Everyone will be here.
-Meep.

107
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,531
The imposter is likely wearing a wig,

108
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,994
so we just need to give everyone
a little hair tug on the down-low

109
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,620
to find out who's pretending,

110
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,832
assuming he or she
is still here in the village.

111
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, they are.

112
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,503

of making something like this

and won't stop until every head is tugged.

-What?

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,915
Well, maybe we should try
looking at this more...optimistically.

174
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,792
Whoa! Sorry.

175
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,213
You being optimistic,
my whole world just turned upside down.

176
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
Very funny.

177
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,884
Seriously,
maybe I was being paranoid earlier.

178
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:34,263
Yes, the box we found is really weird,
but Troll Village is a weird place.

Well, that was odd.

But, yeah, he's right.
Look at all the great stuff happening:

Archer Pastry took the journal
and tied me up.

He's not a Troll.

195
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,392
He is a master of disguise

when our courage fails,

when we stop partying
and make that face Branch makes sometimes,

is why.

I was spying on you because I'm a scout.

We're not Trolls.

until we've drained the land
of its party resources,

292
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,692
and then we move on to the next bash.

See? Real fun happens when you don't care
about the consequences.

294
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,078
So you just show up out of nowhere,
and use up everyone's party supplies?

-And without RSVP-ing?

And when I escape,
oh, and I will escape,

00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,045
I'll lead my friends here

of all time,

[gasps] Unless, of course, you let me go,

303
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,477
then, who knows,
maybe I could direct them somewhere else.

304
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,397
Oh, so sell out someone else
to save our own hair?

I'm... [laughs]

310

OK, I see what you're doing here.

311
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,287
[sighs] And I'm not gonna get angry.

312
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,497
Yeah, he's not gonna get angry.

I AM!

315
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
That depends.

316
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,969
Do you want Archer dining
on a Smidge fist casserole?

317
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,763
-Um...
-Then yes.

318
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,473
OK, listen up, guys.

319
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,808
If we wanna make sure
Archer stays locked up,

320
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,810
so he can't lead the Party Crashers here,

321
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,605
we need a guard rotation.

322
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,441
Forgive how crude this presentation is.
I made it on the fly.

323
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,195
As you can see, I broke us
into groups of six by birth date,

324
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,864
not alphabetic order cos, duh, right?
[chuckles]

00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,576
-Anyway, if you look here--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy there, schedule nerd.

-We're not keeping Archer locked up
-We're not?

328
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,666
Of course not.

329
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,168
If Archer's locked in there,
and we're out here,

330
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,419
how can we be friends?

we protect Troll Village.

find a way to win him over.

to persuade me to be your friend?

345
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,008
Oh, Trolls.
Oh, this is sad. It's just so sad.

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,053
See? He's just going to use this
to push our buttons.

347
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,684
I bet you'll change your tune when you see
the super thoughtful gift we got you!

348
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,771
Really?
Well, in that case, I'll just have to

349
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,524
re-gift it.

350
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,531
[cries out]

351
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,119
Your move.

352
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,416
Hi, we're the improv team,
The Split Ends,

353
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,918
your Archer Pastry Day entertainment.

354
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,881
To get started, we need a suggestion
of a thing from our guest of honour.

355
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,965
Poop!

356
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,216
Oh.

357
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,761
Uh, what about something
a little more fun?

358
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,221
-Like clowns.
-OK, a clown.

359
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Made out of poop!

360
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,685
[sighs] Fine. Can we also get
the suggestion of a place?

361
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,021
-Poopville.
-[Trolls sigh]

362
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,440
And scene.

363
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,984
[Poppy]
Time for the Archer Pastry Day Anthem.

364
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,031
-And a one, and a two and a--
-17, 11, one million six!

365
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,116
Honour him by ignoring him.

00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,244

[Archer sniffs]

379
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,765
Archer? Are you...crying?

380
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,976
What? No.

381
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,271
I just never heard
a song like that before. It...

382
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,065
-It... It was...
-Touching?

383
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,567
Ugh, no. Stop.

384
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,154
Why is everyone looking at me?
Don't... Don't look at me!

385
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,615
See? It's working.

386
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,660
Won't be long now
until Archer is a true friend.

387
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,705
-[wind howls]
-Archer? Archer?

388
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,956
[Archer laughs]

389
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,042
Later Trolls.

390
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,127
He's gonna get away!

391
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,462
He'll lead the Party Crashers right to us!

392
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,965
It's OK. I've been preparing
for something like this.

393
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,135
Scramble the jet critters!

394
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
[alarm wails]

395
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,389
It's game time!

396
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,268
-I'll serve up the sundae.
-And I'll put the cherry on top.

397
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,481
[Branch] I've trained lots of Trolls,
and these guys are the best of the best.

398
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,404
[Branch sighs]
Which is still not very good.

399
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,198
[Archer laughs]

400
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,912
[laughing wildly]

401
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,580
-[Poppy gasps]
-[they grunt]

402
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,417
Archer, come back right now.

403
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,919
Or what?

404
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,214
I know all your weaknesses.

405
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,885
Queen Poppy declared a cannonball contest!

406
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,720
[Trolls cheer]

407
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,556
-Cannonball!
-[Trolls] Cannonball!

408
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,850
-[Trolls] Cannonball!
-[Poppy and Branch scream]

409
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,018
[Troll] Cannonball!

410
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,855
[Branch and Poppy scream]

411
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,025
[Bug] Arghh!

412
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,244
Don't worry. I'll be back, Trolls.
With friends!

413
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,248
Well, that's it.
Troll Village is done for.

414
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,335
No. We still have one move left.

415
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,089
-Now we're talking.
-Ready the Smidge for launch!

416
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,009
[Poppy] FIRE!

417
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,344
[shouting]

418
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,350
[growling]

419
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,020
Huh? [screams]

420
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,943
-[Smidge growls in water]
-[Archer screams]

421
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,321
[Trolls cheer]

422
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,492
Hey, we caught Archer. High-five!

423
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,953
Yeah. Whoo-hoo.

424
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,788
-What's wrong?
-[sighs]

425
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,833
I guess we can't make any enemy
our friend.

426
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,674
Poor Twolls.

427
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,094
Did I ruin your dweam
of making me your fwend?

428
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,431
Oh. I'm so sowwy.

429
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,349
You gonna cwy? Huh?

430
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,854
Gonna shed wittle tears to think of me
locked up in here all alone, aw...

431
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,980
Wait. What?

432
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,190
Hey! It's about time you showed up!

433
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,859
Branch? What are you doing here?

434
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,570
It's our shift to spend time with Archer.

435
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,865
Like you said, we can't become friends
with him if we're out there.

436
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,409
So Branch decided groups of us
should take turns

437
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,328
spending time with him in here.

438
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,123
Yep, I worked it all out
on my friendship rotation, see?

439
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,126
Because we can make any enemy our friend.

440
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,462
It just might take more than one day.

441
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,506
Pfft. A day?
I can do a day with you Trolls.

442
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,092
Or, it might take a week.

443
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,304
-I can do a week.
-Or a month.

444
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,100
It could take a whole lifetime
of Troll positivity,

445
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,061
but we will make you our friend.

446
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,277
No! No! Noooo!
