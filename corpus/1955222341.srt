1
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:28,987
<i>Same sex marriages will hurt American
birth rate and the economy... </i>

2
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:31,831
I'll be right with you so sorry.

3
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,377
<i>The government recently
compared homosexuality... </i>

4
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,201
- How is this?
- It's great the color is good.

5
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:45,996
<i>... Revolves around maternity leave.</i>
What about paternity leave?

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,120
<i>At this time American companies
have no legal obligation... </i>

7
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:52,244
<i>To give men any time off
after the children are born.</i>

8
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:55,358
<i>However third world companies
have recently doubled the time</i>

9
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:58,367
<i>Workers can take off for
maternity and paternity leave.</i>

10
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:02,306
<i>new moms getting 16 weeks and
new dads getting eight weeks.</i>

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>Brett, excuse me but... </i>

12
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:08,154
<i>did new dads started lactating
and I did not get the memo?</i>

13
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:09,578
<i>I have no idea </i>.

14
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,102
<i>So what's with the 8 weeks ?</i>

15
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,612
<i>The women are the ones who do
all the work in the pregnancy</i>

16
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,836
<i>Why would men need 8 weeks off?</i>

17
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,446
Oh my God, shut this bitch up!

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,270
<i>... We started lactating too
- Is that so? </i>

19
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,329
Your jump shots improved.

20
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,767
Oh Linda!

21
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,491
One day you will die.

22
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:34,415
And we will take you and
 we will have your corpse ...

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,439
Burned at eighteen hundred degrees
for approximately twenty minutes.

24
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:45,663
And then we will gather your remains
and we will put them in a pretty vase.

25
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,638
Morbid.

26
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,961
Hey! Connie.
- Greg?

27
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,962
The fucking babysitter
just canceled!

28
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:58,886
My date is gonna be here
in like 1hour and 45 minutes.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,610
Would you please come over?

30
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:03,834
No, Connie today is our anniversary
and Ken's in the shower right now.

31
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,858
Oh shit, goddamit!

32
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:09,182
Greg, please! I would
not ask, but I'm just...

33
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,906
I'm in a jam here.

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,630
No! Connie we have
 reservations, we....

35
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,318
Wait.

36
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,042
Hi!
- Hi! Hey!

37
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,566
I'm sorry. My house smells
like the chicken market.

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,790
Oh dear

39
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:32,114
Alright how do I look?
And nobody says fat.

40
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,438
- Good.
- Astonishing.

41
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:37,162
- So who will you going out tonight?
- My neighbor.

42
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,568
What's he like?

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,190
He's really nice and we're not that worried
we're not interested in each other.

44
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,014
It's just a friendly neighbors
kind of date. He is old.

45
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,738
Sexy but old.

46
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,962
- How old?
- Seventy...?

47
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,786
- Connie! 70 years?!
- I know!

48
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,010
He could be in the sixty and it would be nasty!
All I know is he's got to be active because ...

49
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:58,634
He was in the FBI
like 40 years ago.

50
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,458
The Federal Bureau of Narcotics?

51
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:03,482
You sure he's not just
 some age down druggie?

52
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:08,996
Oh honey! What is
 that? It came out?

53
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,611
You know what you need to do?

54
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:13,735
Put under your pillow so the Tooth
fairy comes at night. Okay?

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,740
- Bye, Matt!
- I'll leave you some money for that.

56
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,842
Matt still believes
in the Tooth Fairy?

57
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,066
Tooth Fairy, Santa
 claus, all of them.

58
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,090
Thank you.

59
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:27,778
- One dollar?
- Ciao. Don't worry about a thing.

60
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,562
You know it's ridiculous.

61
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:39,386
What?

62
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,471
My sister dating 
a septagenarian?

63
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:47,028
No, she fillling Matt's
head with that stuff.

64
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:50,252
Santa Claus, The Easter
Bunny, Tooth Fairy?

65
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,765
Not to mention the fact that
she's ripping the kid off.

66
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,989
I mean, why force him
to believe in that stuff...

67
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:00,513
If then she's gonna make the Tooth
Fairy out to be a cheap bastard?

68
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:04,437
Listen, I agree with you, that's why I gave
him $ 5 dolars as opposed to one dolar.

69
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,461
- But....
- Nice work.

70
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:09,285
What should be for Mother Goose? Mother
Goose is never perceived to be real.

71
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:12,509
- Whatever.
- That's why they appear at night.

72
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:18,233
It's why adults had such a hard time separating
themselves from myths and religion.

73
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:22,257
You know, they never learn to tell the
differences between truth and fiction.

74
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:26,181
I believe in myths.
- I know you do.

75
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:30,205
What you're saying is that
if we have kids some day

76
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,629
You wouldn't want them to believe
in Santa claus or Easter Bunny?

77
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,253
I don't know, I mean.

78
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,977
Look, maybe my reasoning
will change with time.

79
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,501
Besides we said we wouldn't even
talk about adoption for ten years.

80
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:47,225
I know and we've been
together for four.

81
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,849
So check back with
 me in five and a half.

82
00:04:56,342 --> 00:05:00,042
- I'm sorry about tonight.
- No, don't be.

83
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,266
Matt is great and we're together.
That's all that matters.

84
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,459
- I got you something.
- You did?

85
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,483
- I did.
- A present?

86
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:12,507
For me?

87
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,194
Greg...?

88
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,172
Scales of Justice cufflinks?

89
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:35,896
- Do you like it?
- My Gosh, yes I love them!

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,620
All my clients are gonna be so jealous
they gonna want to steal these.

91
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:40,843
Good.

92
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

93
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:46,368
- I got you something too.
- Really?

94
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,392
It's In the bag there.

95
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,516
- You sneaked into my bag?
- Maybe.

96
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,840
You're so sneaky, yeah it's one of
my favorites things about you.

97
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,864
- Super Spy.
- What is it?

98
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:09,068
A Rose Anne biography

99
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:13,792
Remember when we've been
through the entire series?

100
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:18,116
We did not leave the
bedroom for a week.

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Dan!

102
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:28,135
Oh my God, four years...
- I know... Makes you think.

103
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,288
FOUR YEARS BEFORE

104
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,167
It's hot out there.

105
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,099
- Yeah?
- Yep.

106
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:46,141
You're up for a run?

107
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,765
What?

108
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,389
You said you thought you gained some
weight, maybe we should go for a run.

109
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:56,413
I love how you waited for me
 to disrobe to say that but...

110
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:00,337
Come on, I'm getting chubby
too, let's go for a run.

111
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,361
What's wrong with chubby?
Now I'm chubby?

112
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,985
Here, look at this
 here, look at this.

113
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,109
This is going to check the mail,
that's all that this is from.

114
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,733
It's 102 degrees outside
and this is human.

115
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,257
Greg, come on we're just
walked there, I mean

116
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:18,381
Look at us, all we ever do is
watch movies and order in.

117
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,521
Baby it's so hot!

118
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:31,045
Let's turn back around
and go get some lunch?

119
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
No momma.

120
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,844
Yes.

121
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:45,068
It was just from
 checking the mail.

122
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,113
No.

123
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,937
He got so fat.

124
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,561
Yeah.

125
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,343
No, I'm eating.

126
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,561
I love you.

127
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:11,985
I love you more, okay.

128
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:14,009
Okay, bye.

129
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,233
Okay.

130
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,328
Dan!

131
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,852
- Dan!
- What?

132
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,176
What is the second
part to this song?

133
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,551
"It's alarming how
 charming I feel."'

134
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,561
Okay.

135
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:58,311
It's alarming how
 charming I feel.

136
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:10,137
There's nothing to watch.
- That's not true, you just passed by like...

137
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,851
five things that I would watch or
I have watched and I love.

138
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,785
Like what?

139
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,409
<i>Soapdish </i>

140
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,033
- Never heard of it, who's in it?
- Sally field!

141
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,736
The woman with the cookies?

142
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
Cookies ?!

143
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:33,305
The cookies with the red and white
wrappers in the airport newstands.

144
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,007
- Airport newstands?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:44,608
Like <i>"Everything that you were
saying is wrong" </i> Gidget?

146
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:48,732
She won an Oscar! <i>"You like
 me you really like me!" </i>

147
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,898
She was the mom 
in Mrs Doubtfire.

148
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,341
<i>I don't "werk" with the males,
 'cause I used to be one.</i>

149
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:00,999
What?

150
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:03,556
You're a masochistic.

151
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,280
Explain.

152
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,004
How do you even find the time...

153
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,028
For this little lovely and
deceivable sexy kitten?

154
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:13,552
Why would you even want to after
the picture you painted of him?

155
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,276
Is this the way you
talk to your patients?

156
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,800
- No.
-That is really good.

157
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,123
Thank you, but...

158
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:21,324
I'll tell you what's
 good for you.

159
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,848
A healthy dose of
 breaking it off.

160
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,068
Would you bring another glass?

161
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,092
The heart wants what
it wants you know?

162
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:32,116
Sometimes you meet someone and you
fall in love, and that's all that is to it.

163
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,440
Yeah, but you're not in love...

164
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:38,164
You're tortured. And not
even in the good way.

165
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,188
But I'm sure the
sex is great, right?

166
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,249
But a healthy and equal
relationship this is not.

167
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,473
You are clearly doing
all the heavy lifting.

168
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:48,925
Gregory...

169
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,885
What you need from a man
 is an intellectual equal.

170
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,938
Not some junior sales associate...

171
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:59,462
Who knows all the defining characteristics
of the washes of denim.

172
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,786
But if you're now interested in
servicers level right now

173
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,810
I should be pursuing
 dermatology.

174
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,296
Hey, I resemble that remark.

175
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,420
Now it is serious.

176
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:11,344
You avoid the psychiatry 
rotation like the plague.

177
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,868
There's obviously no room
for crazy and you know it.

178
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:16,092
And you wanna place
in radiation and oncology

179
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:18,216
Because you have this
Mother Teresa complex.

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,740
You love curing people but
you can't cure this kid

181
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,163
of his narcissism, Greg.
It's incurable.

182
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,688
-He might as well be mentally retarded.
- You know, Ernie?

183
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:28,312
You might have avoided your
 psychiatry rotation too

184
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,736
If your very first patient 
on the rotation

185
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,560
Her problem was
"I am the queen of Africa...

186
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,284
And I have the papers
 to prove it.

187
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,208
Followed by her shouting:

188
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:41,784
"You can't have my pussy!"

189
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,176
So I have this friend I'd
like you to meet...

190
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
- Ernie... 
- What?

191
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,033
I appreciate your concern

192
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,157
But I'm very much with
Alex for the moment.

193
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,681
You're very much tolerating
Alex for the moment.

194
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,305
And besides
all I said was,

195
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,129
I have a friend I'd like you to meet

196
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:01,453
Not that I have a friend that I necessarily
want you to go out and fuck.

197
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,786
Just have a coffee and
see what happens.

198
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:09,184
- Who is he?
- His name is Ken.

199
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:12,326
He is a criminal defense attorney,
he's very good looking and...

200
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,850
I just texted you his number
like two minutes ago.

201
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:18,374
You were saying something...?

202
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,879
I shouldn't...

203
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:23,303
Look, I already talked you up to him you
would only disappoint by backing up now.

204
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,527
I wouldn't be backing out I haven't
made any plans with him so...

205
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:29,251
- There's not backing out.
- Greg, listen.

206
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:32,075
I know you. You're not happy.

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And besides I'd rather
 see you single than...

208
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:37,424
With someone who requires
a trip to the diamond district

209
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,648
Just so you can translate
his terms of endearment.

210
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,072
Okay, okay so talking
isn't our strong point

211
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,195
You think?

212
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,896
You gonna be a MD!

213
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,320
This kid can't even pronounce
the word anxiety.

214
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:48,644
Oh God...

215
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,968
Orchide no really, is orchide.
- Guys, give me a break, okay?

216
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,309
- You guys just don't know him.
- So really, what is it?

217
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,333
What is it? Wait...

218
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,657
What is the thing?
Yeah he's pretty.

219
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,781
What is it?

220
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,466
Well he got a 8-pound dick.

221
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,890
Jesus, were you shop
 for a porn star?

222
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,060
- Why was the door locked?
- I don't know, habit?

223
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:34,422
... having such a good time.
I think that we should-

224
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,720
- Hey, Tad.
- Hey.

225
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:48,742
What was he doing here?

226
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,766
Well, watching the 
Drags Race marathon.

227
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,390
Oh, yeah with the
deadbolt locked.

228
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,714
Oh my God would you drop
 it? I said it was a mistake.

229
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,691
Okay.

230
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,547
Why did't you tell me
he was coming over?

231
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,471
I figured it wouldn't matter.

232
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:07,995
Not matters? It matters,
a lot Alex, I mean I...

233
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,019
Fuck... It's one thing
to come home

234
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,229
Expecting to see your boyfriend and
is another thing completely

235
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:20,953
Come home and see some guy that I
barely know sitting on my couch

236
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:23,363
With his feet up on my
furniture, eating my food.

237
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,487
Okay?

238
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,311
I own, all of the things in this apartment,
and that includes the leftovers.

239
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,448
Okay.

240
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:37,512
Well, you know what?

241
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:41,236
If that's how you gonna play maybe
I should just go home tonight.

242
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,666
Yeah, maybe you should.

243
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:53,311
- I wasn't being serious.
- Maybe I was.

244
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:56,435
It's like really late and I'll
probably wake my parents

245
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,745
- If I went home right now.
- So why did you suggested?

246
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,669
Is this your way of scolding
me like I'm your child?

247
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,693
I'm not scolding you but-

248
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,017
Fuck I hope this
is a wake up call.

249
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:11,427
No, of course obviously I don't wanna
to send you home at this hour but...

250
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,651
This is my place, okay?

251
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,475
And you can't just have people
coming in without me knowing

252
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:19,585
And you can not lock me out
in the middle of the night!

253
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,695
I did't lock you out!
- You locked the deadbolt with someone else here!

254
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,719
You know what? I don't
wanna stay here tonight.

255
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,825
You always get like this after
hanging out with your friends.

256
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:33,149
Like what? How do I get?

257
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:37,273
You talk to me like you
were better than me.

258
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,097
Alex, I don't think
that I am better...

259
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,121
... Than you.
- No?

260
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,836
I just think that
we're different.

261
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:50,301
I think that we
are too different.

262
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:55,592
- This isn't working.
- Fucking, I knew it!

263
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:57,516
Alex-
- What?

264
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,240
Come here let's talk
about this, okay?

265
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,264
No come here.
- Just sit down stop acting like a child.

266
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:05,688
Don't tell me I'm acting like a
child, I'm not acting like a child!

267
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:08,712
No, you are behaving like
a totaly mature adult.

268
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,962
I'll come tomorrow
to pick up my shit.

269
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:19,812
You know, if that's
convenient for you.

270
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,186
So Ernie told me you're
a medical student.

271
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,110
Yes, I'm bad Ernie only
told you that because I am...

272
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:09,134
Actually dropped out.

273
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:13,151
- You dropped out?
- Yeah. I haven't told him that yet.

274
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:14,375
I...

275
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,499
I know that's kind of a loser
thing to tell on the first date.

276
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:21,121
This is our first date?

277
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:24,761
I hoped this was
our first date yes.

278
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,685
And I hoped that it's
okay that I'm okay.

279
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:29,595
Hey you! My name is
Greg, nice to meet you.

280
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:32,405
I made a big decision this week.

281
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,329
And I'm probably out of med
school. I'm college drop out.

282
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,353
Sorry I'm a loser.

283
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:39,177
I hope I'm handsome enough.

284
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:43,301
You know, I think if you're feeling
pulled in a different direction

285
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,425
Then you should listen to that.

286
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,138
What?

287
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:51,462
Just what I said,
stick with your gut.

288
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:54,086
You know, instincts are
underrated nowadays but....

289
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,310
You gotta listen to them.

290
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,534
Do you want to...

291
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,858
Break the news to
my mom for me?

292
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:03,082
No, that is all to you.

293
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:34,568
Hey, what you're
thinking about?

294
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,592
Nothing.

295
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,216
Everything you know.

296
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
How we got together
and Sally field.

297
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:46,064
And how much I love fast
food and hate white wine.

298
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:48,788
Lots, lots of things.

299
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:57,115
No, no, no, you
know why.

300
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,125
I don't know why.

301
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,449
- No! No, we can't!
- Yes, I'll be quiet.

302
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,573
- No! Don't
- He's sleeping.

303
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,397
Don't start something
you can not finish.

304
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,521
I always end...
- And you can not finish this...

305
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,845
Because he's up there.

306
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:10,569
Just relax, relax.

307
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:16,303
I'll just kiss all of it, okay?
- Like the French did.

308
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,527
What with a cigarette
in your mouth?

309
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,051
- Baby, let me...?
- No

310
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,775
- Let you what?
- Come on I just want...

311
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,799
What? What do you want?

312
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:28,723
I want to...

313
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:31,047
Put myself inside you...?

314
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:35,511
Where did this come
 from? Born again Top?

315
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:40,535
I don't know, I'm feeling...
adventurous, you know?

316
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
- Like a finger or two or...?
- No I, like with my penis.

317
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,749
Wow! Okay, okay, alright.

318
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,773
- What? Okay?
- Yeah okay.

319
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:55,597
You are gonna need to
get some lubricantion.

320
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,207
Because the last thing that went
up there was a colonoscopy.

321
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,331
When I was eight and before
that a baby thermometer so...

322
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:04,071
I'm gonna need
 some lubrication.

323
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,670
- Happy anniversary.
- Okay.

324
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:09,394
I'm sure Connie has some
lube stashed here somewhere.

325
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,242
Oh, my god, okay.

326
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:38,368
Okay, I couldn't find any lube
but I got some petroleum jelly.

327
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,773
- Did you get condom?
- What?

328
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:43,997
- A condom.
- For what?

329
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,321
We're celebrating four years
of monogamous bliss

330
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,045
I don't think we need a condom.

331
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,069
I think it gets messy. I don't
want stuff get on you

332
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,693
Okay, but let's just
this time...

333
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,817
Okay, but we have to...We have
to do it somewhere else and ...

334
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,341
We have to get some towels,
- Why? why

335
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,765
Because I don't want the couch to get-
- Okay what about the floor?

336
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,189
Okay, alright.

337
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,513
I'll put this down here

338
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:08,536
To be nice and comfy. Okay.

339
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:16,463
Get this off.
Get this off.

340
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:42,454
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Okay.

341
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,591
You feel so good...

342
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,683
Was a good six minutes?

343
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,119
Six minutes? It was
more like two.

344
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:26,887
Well...

345
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:30,643
When you got a dick in
your ass time stand still.

346
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:36,152
Don't I know?

347
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:38,176
What is your fortune?

348
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:44,145
No adventures away
beyond the horizon.

349
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:48,293
You gonna climb many
mountains and be on top.

350
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:52,047
Again? Round two?

351
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,710
- Are you ready?
- I'm in, okay.

352
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,083
I don't know about what
 the conversation was...

353
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:01,631
I just kept going in and out. I didn't
know what he was talking anyway.

354
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:04,355
I was so distracted by...

355
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:07,379
the pendulum swings
 of his neck skin.

356
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,853
It kind of ... get to
a point I just gave up.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,600
So... no second date?

358
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,950
I'm guessing.

359
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,874
Thursdays and Mondays.

360
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,498
Oh, yeah of course we do.

361
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:30,478
Her name was Linda,
she was a drunk pet.

362
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:34,402
She went to school but
just couldn't rack up.

363
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:39,126
Majored in ornithology.
Yes, that bird watching.

364
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,550
But she failed every test
cause she ate them.

365
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:47,974
That is her thing to do,
because she's a cat.

366
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:52,098
But then he went to Hollywood
and married James cameron

367
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:58,256
How is it going there baby?

368
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,780
Swimmingly. What about you?

369
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:04,604
Honestly? I am
ready for a break.

370
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,730
Yeah me too.

371
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,454
- Oh, yeah?
- Hum, Hum

372
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:16,754
- One of these breaks?
- Yeah, I think it's a good break.

373
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:18,978
I like these breaks.

374
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,418
No, don't get it. No, don't!

375
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,642
It might be the client, It might be
the client, It might be the client.

376
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,566
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,590
Hello! This is Greg.

378
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:36,517
Shouldn't you have said are you
sitting down first? Jesus!

379
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,641
No, no I'm in bed,
I'm in bed sorry.

380
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,865
What happened?

381
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,664
- Oh! My God!
- What?

382
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,288
Yeah, we'll...

383
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:53,112
We'll be there soon,
like ten minutes, okay?

384
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:55,336
Yeah, love you.

385
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
That was Richard.

386
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,984
- Ernie had a stroke.
- Oh my God!

387
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,159
- Hey baby.
- Hey.

388
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,510
You okay?

389
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:53,734
Yeah, I just ... thinking
about Ernie.

390
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:57,658
- Have you talked to him lately?
- No, I feel like such an asshole.

391
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,882
Baby, don't... I mean.

392
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:02,592
After the time when you called over that
his parents have turned you away. - True.

393
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:06,616
Max asleep already?

394
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Yes, he's in bed thank you so
much for being cool about this.

395
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,264
It's fine.

396
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:20,725
- You're all sweaty.
- Yeah, I know, it's burning hot in here.

397
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,549
- Are you that hot?
- No, I'm fine.

398
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,773
I can turn on the air
a little bit to cool.

399
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,783
Thank you.

400
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,807
I didn't want to touch it because I
know how cold that you can get.

401
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,428
Bed time for us too.

402
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,752
No, I have to finish this.

403
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:39,176
- Come to bed...
- No.

404
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
- Yes.
- No.

405
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,324
- Yes.
- I can't, I can't.

406
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:45,348
I have to finish my work.

407
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,372
- Pay the bills.
- Fine.

408
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:01,165
Okay, I will.

409
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,277
- Oh, my God! What the fuck!
- I'm sorry.

410
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,401
- What the...
- I'm sorry.

411
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,125
Get off of me!

412
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:42,877
Hey! I....

413
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,501
Why didn't you tell me that
you were weren't well?

414
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,311
Sorry I just didn't 
think it was serious

415
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,235
It was so disgusting.

416
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,259
- I know.
- Seriously I can't-

417
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:11,445
- Hello?
- Hey. How you feeling?

418
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,169
Much better, better.

419
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,493
Well, did you have
anything to eat today?

420
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:20,317
Yes, everything. I had
everything to eat.

421
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,541
Okay, great.

422
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:26,265
So I guess we're officially
out of groceries now.

423
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,689
Well, there might be
some eggs with luck.

424
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,713
Or cans of tuna.

425
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,113
Okay, order in
the drive through.

426
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:41,302
Can we get like Chinese
food on top of the pizza?

427
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,359
- Hey this one looks good.
- What?

428
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:49,307
Oh don't mind it's subtitled.

429
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,331
And guessing you're not
in the mood to read a movie...

430
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,655
I've just take cheese off
of the remote control

431
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,479
Now I'm not on the mood
to read my movie?

432
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,503
Yeah I saw that.

433
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:03,227
How about a documentary?

434
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:08,151
I don't know... it's kind of boring to watch
something that we've seen a million times before.

435
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:09,175
Like Lulas.

436
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:11,985
Baby, we've just watched
that like three days ago.

437
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,123
Fine, watch what
you wanna watch.

438
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:17,547
I'm not gonna be able to pay
much attention my brain is fried.

439
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:21,771
- Hello Helene.
- Hello Helene.

440
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,817
Oh, my God!

441
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:45,241
Seriously, if you roll around
any harder I gonna be sick.

442
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:50,165
I'm sorry but I'm tossing and turning
because I'm trying to keep from puking.

443
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,189
Again?

444
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:55,913
You know what? Tomorrow ...

445
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:59,321
You should really go see a doctor.
- For indigestion?

446
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:03,761
This isn't indigestion, I ate the same
things you ate and I'm not sick.

447
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,585
I don't have health insurance.

448
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:08,709
So what? Go Greg.

449
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,619
A general partition is gonna
cost next to nothing.

450
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,043
Go and see Dr.
Elliot she's great.

451
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,267
Plus she owes me a favor.

452
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,991
I've got her husband
office last year, didn't I?

453
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:21,875
Just go to bed quietly.

454
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,067
Don't move.

455
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:29,554
- Hello Greg, I'm Dr. Elliot.
- Hi Dr. Elliot, nice to meet you.

456
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:31,343
So what's been happening?

457
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,967
I've been dizzy, I get nauseous
have recurring headaches...

458
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,491
Well, something is wrongs.
Let's take a look, shall we?

459
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:50,963
You're fine, Greg.

460
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,887
Your tests came back fine.

461
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:58,011
Your blood test is fine, HIV is negative,
You probably just got a flu bug.

462
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,435
Just gonna have
 to switch it out.

463
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,959
This is not the flu.

464
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:06,883
Of course it's the flu, throwing up is
what happens when you have the flu.

465
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,707
Not only throwing up happens
when you have the flu.

466
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:11,017
But a lot of other stuff
also happens like

467
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,641
Sore throat, and aching
muscles, and coughing.

468
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,765
And I don't have any of those, plus
when was the last time both of

469
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,589
your feet went numb
when you had the flu?

470
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,713
I'm sure Dr. Elliot knows
what she's talking about.

471
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:28,106
What?

472
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,230
What?

473
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:34,154
- Am I fat? Am I hideous?
- What? No!

474
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:37,278
I saw that you looked at me, I know
that that's what you were thinking.

475
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:39,302
Baby, I wasn't even
looking at you.

476
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,726
- You weren't?
- No, I was ...

477
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:46,250
Looking at myself in the mirror, with my
back turned to you much like it is now.

478
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:49,574
I just thought I saw you looking at
me out of the corner of his eyes

479
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:51,898
Honey, I think you're sorrow.

480
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:57,822
You're starting to sound like every
other husband on the face of the earth.

481
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,446
How is that?

482
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,970
You are so agreeable!
"Yes, dear", "No dear"

483
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:08,594
You don't likethat about me?
That I'm agreeable?

484
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:11,018
No I love that 
you're agreeable.

485
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:14,642
But I just wanna make sure that
you're being sincere, okay?

486
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,466
Don't take this the
wrong way, dear but ...

487
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,890
You're beginning to sound like any
other wife in the face of the planet.

488
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:26,414
I thought you were the wife.

489
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:29,738
According to your chart,
everything is normal.

490
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,862
No, everything is not normal.

491
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:35,186
I got heartburn, cramps, almost
constant nausea, swelling.

492
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,010
My feet are swelling inside
my shoes right now, so.

493
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,434
- Any acne?
- Yes, thank you for noticing.

494
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,558
He's also having a
lot of mood swings.

495
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:52,717
- You're hungry all the time?
- Yes. Okay.

496
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:56,641
Greg I'd like to recommend
you seeing an specialist.

497
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:59,165
- An specialist?
- What kind of specialist?

498
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,389
Well, you're not suffering
from any illness.

499
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,213
So whatever it is, it's unusual.
And what you said that means

500
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:08,223
Swelling, blossoming...

501
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:12,247
- It's if you were...
- Becoming doctor Hulk?

502
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:15,471
It's if you were
expecting a baby.

503
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:20,544
- Excuse me, what?
- I know it sounds ridiculous.

504
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:22,468
But Greg what you
are describing...

505
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:26,292
Is what I'd expect to hear from a
woman who was four months pregnant.

506
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:30,016
And outside of that, you
couldn't be in better shape.

507
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,040
So I don't think there's anything
that I can do for you.

508
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,950
But I do want you to consult
with this friend of mine.

509
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:40,174
I'd also like to put
you on a strict diet.

510
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,798
Starting immediately.

511
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:51,371
What...? I was going...

512
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:53,887
It's still good.

513
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,896
Have you made the appointment 
with that especialist yet?

514
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
No, I...

515
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:01,144
Isn't it obvious that she
just thinks that-

516
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:02,368
That's diet okay?

517
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:03,978
- Greg I'm serious.
- Just think that I have

518
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,598
A weight problem, okay?
- I am serious.

519
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:06,912
I'll go on the diet.
I'll go on the diet

520
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:08,836
And then we'll see what happens.
- Yes Yes.

521
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,960
You'll go on the diet and you're also making
an appointment with the especialist , okay?

522
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,384
I'd throw myself out the window
if anything ever happen to you.

523
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:17,408
You can't be that serious.

524
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:22,732
<i>Doctor's Office </i>

525
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:27,056
One possible reason for
Dr. Elliot send me here?

526
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
I don't know.

527
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:33,977
There it is.

528
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,701
What it is?

529
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:45,777
Is that a ... tumor?
- No, it's not a tumor.

530
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,801
This is closer to his
 abdominal cavity here.

531
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:56,164
Thank you.

532
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:04,373
- You two are sexually active?
- Yes

533
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:06,597
Do you use protection?

534
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:10,621
No, not anymore, we've been
together for a very long time.

535
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:19,221
Alright I need to 
make a phone call.

536
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,584
Would you two mind 
waiting in my office?

537
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:31,253
I wonder what he saw? Like, have 
you seen the look on his eyes?

538
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:40,838
- Dr. Elliot? Hi guys.
- Oh my god is this serious?

539
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,840
You are pregnant.

540
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
What?

541
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,344
Okay, alright.

542
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:06,368
- Alright.
- Greg?

543
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:10,829
You guys!!

544
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,171
Greg?

545
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:17,995
I'm gonna say this as plainly
as I possibly can.

546
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:22,719
You have a human fetus growing
withing your abdominal cavity.

547
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:26,143
Just as it would grow
within a woman's uterus.

548
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:30,367
Your baby has fingernails.

549
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:34,491
Okay, guys, like that was,
that was funny but...

550
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:38,015
You're welcomed to seek a second
opinion or third in this case

551
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,339
We... We would encourage that.

552
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:45,163
Is this... I mean, could medication
have caused this?

553
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:49,373
It has taken sleeping pills? Maybe
 we're elegible for legal recourse.

554
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,397
You should really 
look into this.

555
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,921
I've never seen a 
pill create a womb.

556
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:59,645
In fact I've never seen anything
 remotely like this. Neither does he.

557
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:06,569
Greg, at this point you
are a medical miracle.

558
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:10,393
49 million years of evolution and I am the
first man in the history of the world

559
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:14,003
To ever get pregnant! Why?! Why me ?!
- Greg, please just try and relax.

560
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,241
Oh yes! Just try and relax
with a baby inside of you!

561
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,565
Are you in Valium?
Is that an option?

562
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:23,889
You know, technically you're the second.
Don't forget about Thomas baby?

563
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:27,113
Except you know Greg was
actually born a man so...

564
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,837
How could this happen? I could
never do anything right...

565
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,961
That's your mother talking.
- Is it?

566
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:34,985
Stop torturing yourself, you
can't help it, is not your fault.

567
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:38,009
Of course it's my fault! I was
the idiot that let him top!

568
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:40,933
- So now it's my fault?
- Yes! Yes it's your fault!

569
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:44,057
You were the person that just had to
have and you were so insistent...

570
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,781
That we have sex right there on
Connie's living room floor!

571
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:49,505
Wait, what ?! You had
sex in my house?

572
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,629
Oh yeah. Right there, next to the couch.
- Greg stop please!

573
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:55,553
What the fuck! When?
- When you were walking the neighbor!

574
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:57,877
Were in the neighbor...?

575
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,701
Oh my God! You guys had sex
while you were babysitting?!

576
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,665
Where was Max?

577
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,549
We were very quite quiet,
he was upstairs...

578
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,673
I don't have any health insurance! How 
anyone has a baby without health insurance?

579
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:11,197
Greg, we sign up. Come on
I've been you to sign up.

580
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:14,521
What happens if it's deformed?

581
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:15,644


582
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:17,845
- Someone will find that charming.
- That's not charming.

583
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:20,569
It could be a gold medal
 gymnastics. It could be a...

584
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:25,193
Or could bag groceries or could 
be addicted to black tar heroin...?

585
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:29,341
So... So what? Look, anything can
 happen, anything can happen?

586
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:33,865
Yes, I have a girl friend who is a
personal incontinence consultant .

587
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:37,489
She takes orders for adult
 diapers over the phone.

588
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,314
Thank god for baby boomers.

589
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:44,506
What? I'm just
 agreeing with you.

590
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,530
Anything can happen.

591
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:51,661
My friend, she's married,
she has a kid... in a therapy.

592
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:54,285
She's happy!

593
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:58,109
There are so many
great little boy names...

594
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:00,833
Hank Fisher, Matt,
everybody loves a Matt.

595
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,333
I can't be responsible for the way
some kid's life turns out okay?

596
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,057
I can't.

597
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:09,204
That's what you're thinking?
- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

598
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,228
What...

599
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:12,852
What about our apartment? Like
we don't have enough room?

600
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,376
- For what?
- For a kid!

601
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,100
We barely have enough room
for Linda and she is a cat so...

602
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:21,686
Okay, you're right.

603
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,010
Changes are gonna happen
when we have a baby but...

604
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:29,234
I mean, who cares?
 We'll redecorate.

605
00:39:31,629 --> 00:39:33,729
Don't you want this?
Can't you feel it?

606
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:36,053
Yeah, I can feel it. Yeah, 
absolutely I can feel it...

607
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:39,677
I can feel it moving around, and kicking
and sharpening its little fingernails

608
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:43,001
And sending emails and playing cards
because it's living inside of me.

609
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,825
It's living inside of ME!

610
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,049
Baby, it is because you
are a medical miracle!

611
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:49,073
I don't wanna be a 
medical miracle!

612
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,897
I DON'T WANT TO BE
 A MEDICAL MIRACLE!

613
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:54,621
I didn't even want 
to be a doctor!

614
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:00,316
That night, remember?

615
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,240
When you told me that you're gonna
drop out of medical school...?

616
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:04,764
What did I say to you?

617
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:08,588
Said that if I was being pulled
in a different direction

618
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:11,212
I should go with it. I
should follow my instincts.

619
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:12,336
And what is this?

620
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,660
Sure, maybe it is more
of a thrust than a pull

621
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:17,484
But baby, this is a
different direction!

622
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:21,308
And my guts is telling me that
this is what supposed to happen!

623
00:40:21,763 --> 00:40:25,163
You bottom one night
out of hundreds!

624
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:28,187
Okay, thousands and
bam, you were pregnant!

625
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:32,611
- Don't you think that's amazing?
- Yeah, lucky me...

626
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:48,058
<i>I don't think there
is anyone answer</i>

627
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:50,074
<i>It is multilayer ... </i>

628
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,381
<i>A man in Los Angeles,
was the first pioneer </i>

629
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,805
<i>of this revolutionary
social transformation </i>

630
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:02,656
What is this?

631
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:07,845
An overweight gay man, apparently
gave birth to a healthy baby girl

632
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:10,493
In a West Hollywood
toilet last night.

633
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:13,573
What...?

634
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,797
<i>I think the question on everyone's
mind is: What caused this? </i>

635
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:21,421
<i>could be a random genetic strain that
mutates among the male species? </i>

636
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,445
<i>perhaps there is some
common food on the market </i>

637
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:27,969
<i>Some product which would
further this on the males? </i>

638
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:31,093
<i>A sort of counter
contraceptive pill? </i>

639
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,917
<i>Now members of the medical
community like yourself </i>

640
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,941
<i>Are coming forward
saying they see </i>

641
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:38,665
<i>Millions of men
experiencing... </i>

642
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:47,882
It's on every channel.

643
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:50,406
<i>... the very foundation
of what it is to be a man </i>

644
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,830
<i>And what it is to be a woman... </i>

645
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:55,991
What is wrong?

646
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:00,226
Nothing...

647
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:02,669
It's just that I...

648
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:06,622
You know I'm not religious or
spiritual or any of that I just...

649
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,592
I can not help but feel
let down by all of this.

650
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:10,716
Why?

651
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,240
Because I thought what we had
between us was special, you know?

652
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:15,864
Something...

653
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,574
Giving meaning to our lives.

654
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:24,691
Yeah if you're talking
 about our unborn child.

655
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:27,515
Then there is something
special between us.

656
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:31,639
I'm talking about the pregnancy
that it even happened at all.

657
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,063
I mean...

658
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,087
I thought this was a miracle. It turns
out that's a goddamn epidemic!

659
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:38,111
So...?

660
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,835
So?! We're not gonna
matter, okay?

661
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,359
Our baby is not gonna matter.

662
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:46,283
We're just like everybody else.
Anyone can make a baby.

663
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:49,307
Is that... Is that all you
care about? The attention?

664
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,531
You just want people
to come by and-

665
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:56,355
Greg, of course not. No I just...
I thought we were the first.

666
00:42:57,271 --> 00:43:01,171
We were like the Neil Armstrong
of male on male conception.

667
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,665
One small step for a man

668
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:06,189
One giant fucking
leap for mankind!

669
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,013
Well, with great hopes comes
high disappointment.

670
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:10,937
I'm upset. Can't I be upset?

671
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:14,061
Sure, sure. You can be
upset. Absolutely, but...

672
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:16,598
Frankly I'm excited that
we won't have news cameras

673
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:20,122
Pointed at our
door 24 hours a day.

674
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:35,103
Right.

675
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:42,429
Ken has been acting
strange recently.

676
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,910
Well, men have been known to act
strangely in pregnancy.

677
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:48,434
It's too different for them.

678
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,558
They're not actually going through it.
- Yeah, I know, I know I'm through it.

679
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:55,082
Yeah, right, and now 
if you go throught it...

680
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:57,606
You have to.

681
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:02,434
You deal with it, and you'll never
forget what your child mean to you.

682
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:05,354
Yeah, what my
child means to me...

683
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:08,378
It's a completely fucking
pain the ass.

684
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:12,602
No, your children
are meaningful.

685
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:16,026
I don't talk a mere contribution
 to the world.

686
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:19,938
I have an appointment. I need to go
check on my little contribution.

687
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:24,037
- Thanks for the insight.
- You're welcome.

688
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:27,498
- Look at you. Need help?
- No, I'm fine.

689
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:29,922
I would reel you in.

690
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:34,314
Are you here to
pick up your wife?

691
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:35,982
No.

692
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,706
So I just been feeling
a little hot lately.

693
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:41,832
In hot flashes, do you
think that's possible?

694
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:43,856
You're not 32 years old!

695
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,780
Yeah, but the women in my family
we all start things earlier.

696
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,604
I hit puberty at nine.

697
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:51,696
Hormones in chicken? Did you
grew up eating a lot of fast food?

698
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,220
Excuse me? Do I look like I grew
up eating a lot of Fast food?

699
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,401
I didn't mean anything by it I just-

700
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:59,425
You know what Doctor?
I think we are done here.

701
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:02,749
Just forget about it.
I appreciate your time.

702
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Greg, I will see you now.

703
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:21,656
The baby will be
due October 18th.

704
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:24,984
Okay. So what do we
do on the due day?

705
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:28,608
Well it's a surgical procedure
similar to a C- section.

706
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:32,932
Okay, doctor but I saw the guy
on TV and he had his in a toilet.

707
00:45:32,956 --> 00:45:35,756
Why do you have to cut me open?
- Greg, this is so new.

708
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,680
To everyone, to medical
professionals everywhere.

709
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:41,404
And frankly I'd like
to play this safe.

710
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:47,038
I'm sorry I can't help it notice
the hair on your hoodie...

711
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:50,062
- Do you have an animal?
- Yeah, I got a cat.

712
00:45:50,086 --> 00:45:53,986
No, no cats have worms and it
could get the baby toxoplasmosis.

713
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:58,615
Linda doesn't have worms.

714
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,239
Well, a cat could suffocate
the baby or claw the baby.

715
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:07,565
Fuck him! Don't let him make you think for
one second that you need to get rid of that cat.

716
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:09,889
I'm not. I will not. But...

717
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:13,213
All that talk of let's
cut the baby out...

718
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:17,482
- I don't know, it's a downer.
- Don't listen him Greg...

719
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:19,206
Do what you want.

720
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,230
You saw that guy who
gave birth in the toilet?

721
00:46:21,254 --> 00:46:23,754
You think he exactly marked
this way over there?

722
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:25,734
Doubtful.

723
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:29,158
Have the baby however you
want, this is YOUR child!

724
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,953
Thank you.

725
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:33,277
Listen, I...

726
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:37,701
I'm sorry that I've been such an
asshole since this pregnancy.

727
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,625
How's Ernie? How is he doing?

728
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:40,849
Hot mess.

729
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:44,473
He texted me last week and asked
if I thought Oscar the Grouch writers...

730
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:47,597
For living in such a tight conditions.
- Really?

731
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:53,721
His hall of questions had something to do
with the Kate Blanchet being a half breed...

732
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:58,945
Well, I'm glad that this stroke has opened
up Ernie's mind for the bigger picture.

733
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:10,941
Wow! It's quite the breakfast
you got going here baby.

734
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,965
So you have your appetite back.

735
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:17,189
Yep. No more nausea.

736
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:20,313
No more insomnia.

737
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,212
I feel great.

738
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:24,213
- That's great.
- Yeah.

739
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:28,037
Actually... I was thinking ...

740
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:32,061
That we might be able to
fool around a little bit...

741
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,161
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

742
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:39,377
I bumped out against
the oven handle earlier ...

743
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:41,909
And I think I got wood.

744
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:55,517
It's been too long, hasn't been? 
- Far too long.

745
00:47:56,741 --> 00:48:00,141
I'm gonna find that spot
 that makes you growl...

746
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:03,665
You're not on top now.

747
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,724
Wait, wait, wait

748
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:17,548
- What? you're not ready?
- No, no, no,

749
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:19,772
He moved.

750
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:25,796
Yeah it's generally what penises do when excited.
- No, no the baby.

751
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,120
- Where are you going?
- I should clean up the kitchen.

752
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:51,766
He's scared of this baby I can tell you, 
you can see when you look in his eyes.

753
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,990
He's afraid to grow up.

754
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:56,414
Connie

755
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,038
I don't know if I wanna 
have this baby.

756
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,262
Of course you do!
This is a blessing.

757
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:05,186
People spend thousands of
dollars trying to get pregnant.

758
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,810
Or paying for a surrogate or
 paying to buy a baby from China.

759
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,834
Look, I get it.
I know that's hard.

760
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:18,135
- Have you heard of the Doulas?
- No. Who is she?

761
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,859
Not a she. A Doula.

762
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:23,683
It's like a stress therapist.

763
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:28,507
They're there for the expecting mother
during the pregnancy and then at birth.

764
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:31,031
- It may be worth looking into.
- Yeah, that's fine.

765
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:33,141
But what about after the birth?

766
00:49:33,565 --> 00:49:36,765
I just wanna make sure that
this baby has a family.

767
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:39,489
Right.

768
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:47,966
We are going to need to get a new car.
- What?

769
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,790
A new car, we gonna need one.
- Why?

770
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:56,414
Because we have to fit a car sit
into it and we need four seats.

771
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:59,438
- Yours has four seats.
- And mine is also a piece of shit.

772
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:01,462
Greg, come on, you know I bought

773
00:50:01,486 --> 00:50:04,386
That car for myself as a present
when I graduated at law school .

774
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,910
I know you bought that car 
for yourself because you liked

775
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,820
Looking in the park
 lot as the hot lawyer.

776
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:10,844
Excuse me?

777
00:50:11,368 --> 00:50:17,168
Listen, I know that this baby was
unexpected and I know that ...

778
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:19,892
For the last if you even
 enjoyed the ride,

779
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,416
But I just think that-
- Enjoy the ride?

780
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
That's what you think of me?

781
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:26,764
You know how hard I work.
That's what you think?

782
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:31,088
I think that you don't look like someone
who wants to become a father.

783
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:35,912
Okay, maybe I don't know how
to be a dad, maybe I, maybe I...

784
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:39,936
Maybe I can't be a dad. Maybe
 I just don't wanna be a dad.

785
00:50:43,436 --> 00:50:47,436
- There it is.
- There what is?

786
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,560
The truth that we've been waiting
for, you don't want this baby.

787
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:56,084
Maybe I don't Greg.

788
00:50:57,408 --> 00:50:59,408
Maybe I'm scared.

789
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:05,032
Scared? Maybe I'm scared
 too.  I'm scared too and...

790
00:51:05,156 --> 00:51:07,956
And who was the one to
talk me out of that? It was you.

791
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,580
You were the one. Because you said that it
was gonna be a blessing, a new direction.

792
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:15,604
And that's so easy for you to say,
that is so easy for you to say.

793
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:19,128
When you are not you the person
who has to carry it around, okay?

794
00:51:19,152 --> 00:51:24,052
You're not the person who's gotten fat
and is getting fatter every single second.

795
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:28,176
You're not the person who's
 gonna up shoes size and half

796
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,100
You're not the person who bumps up against 
kitchen appliances and gets horny.

797
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:36,624
And you're not the person whose hormones
 had turned the man into a 15 years old girl.

798
00:51:36,648 --> 00:51:41,148
Yes nod your head, go
ahead, nod your head.

799
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:43,172
But you...

800
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:49,989
I don't have the energy to
hold you up okay?

801
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:55,913
I don't have the energy to be
your rock when you didn't...

802
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:58,237
You just go.

803
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:01,161
- Go where?
- Just go.

804
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,454
Okay. Really?

805
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,381
Fine.

806
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:44,411
That's what you want, Greg?

807
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:48,842
Is it?

808
00:52:51,092 --> 00:52:53,292
Is this what you want?

809
00:52:58,025 --> 00:53:00,025
I'll be sleeping at the office.

810
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:41,069
So, what I have here is my Doula
bag. That I have for many years.

811
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:44,393
So if is okay with you I'lI show 
you the kind of things I carry in it.

812
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:45,817
That'd be great.

813
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:49,568
So this right here are hard candies.

814
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:51,292
And I really just carry
this in case you

815
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:54,216
Wanna get a little sugar
buzz during labor.

816
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,540
I don't know, just something
to comfort you.

817
00:53:57,223 --> 00:53:58,323
Let's see...

818
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:01,657
Well my swimming suit.

819
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,781
This is a water birth and
I can get in it with you.

820
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:08,458
Plastic bag for my wet
swimming suit.

821
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,550
- Nice to meet you!
- It's nice to meet you.

822
00:54:11,686 --> 00:54:14,586
Okay, so.... let's see here...

823
00:54:16,193 --> 00:54:18,193
I have...

824
00:54:19,654 --> 00:54:22,354
A pad. If it's those
 days of the month.

825
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:25,755
These right here, these
are essential oils.

826
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:28,079
What are those for exactly?

827
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:31,003
You'll find out which aroma
resonates with you.

828
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:32,825
A mirror.

829
00:54:33,176 --> 00:54:36,076
If you want to see what's
going on down there.

830
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,400
That sounds awful.

831
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:42,701
I have some... gum.

832
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,401
What... what is... that?

833
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:52,571
That's marijuana. Afterwards
you are welcome to use some.

834
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:55,195
That is very kind of you.
- Nice.

835
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:59,619
So did you brought anything that would
 be like... Hey this is helpful!

836
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:03,843
While you're pushing a
human out of you?

837
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,067
Yes.

838
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:07,191
So, would you like one?

839
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:08,915
They're so good.

840
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,614
Good to see you.

841
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:14,615
Well, we usually have just a
few meetings before the birth.

842
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,239
You know, to discuss things
 like your emotional needs,

843
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:20,263
Your mental condition,
 birth plan.

844
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:24,287
Just getting ready to push
 when it comes time to push.

845
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:27,711
Thomas that's the best thing
 that I've heard all day.

846
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:28,935
- Really?
- Yeah.

847
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:33,159
- So you're set for October?
- For the moment yeah.

848
00:55:33,783 --> 00:55:36,283
Okay,then I guess that the
only thing I will need to do is

849
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:38,707
Come by and check out your
place whenever you'd like.

850
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:42,031
Just to access the conditions
of your home.

851
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:44,555
The conditions of my home...

852
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:48,679
Mostly, it's an apartment but
it's not sanctioned for anything.

853
00:55:48,703 --> 00:55:50,703
I have a nice scream maker so

854
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:52,727
That's good, that's good.
- Pretentious.

855
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,251
No, probably it's fine.

856
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:56,375
I would just need to make
 sure it's appropriate.

857
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:59,899
You know, no mould, clean air
filters, planty of  space.

858
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,023
- That sort of stuff.
- Yeah.

859
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,347
No stacks of  dirty
 dishes, I got it.

860
00:56:06,856 --> 00:56:10,856
So? This is it.

861
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:16,380
- Wow! This is great.
- Yeah, thank you, thank you.

862
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:18,804
I should probably
check the boiler.

863
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:21,428
- Oh! Yeah this...
- Back here?

864
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:23,452
Yeah, to the left.

865
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:29,423
Hot water is important.

866
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:32,247
We need a lot of  hot
 water for the birth.

867
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,867
That's what I would go.

868
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,191
You'd neeed a lot space
 in your tub too.

869
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:38,215
Oh! Yeah.

870
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:41,539
I don't know about the tub
I barely fit in it now.

871
00:56:42,163 --> 00:56:43,963
What about your bed?

872
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:45,987
I still fit in it.

873
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:48,411
I know I meant what
size is your bed?

874
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:50,135
Oh, it's a California King.

875
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,459
- It's perfect.
- Yes

876
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:54,983
You can always purchase
an inflatable portable pool.

877
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:03,236
- This is Ken?
- Yeah.

878
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,860
- Handsome guy.
- Yeah.

879
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,784
Where are you guys here?

880
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,208
Ken was deep sea fishing and

881
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:18,332
He thrown his harpoon and it
popped out of the water so...

882
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,029
You're alright?

883
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:37,953
No, no.

884
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:40,877
Not alright.

885
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:43,401
I'm huge.

886
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:47,225
I'm like a brand 
new Greg and I...

887
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:51,049
I got this thing growing
 inside of me...

888
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,959
And my nipples are sore
 and my back hurts...

889
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:57,483
And my feet are swollen
and I am constipated and I...

890
00:57:59,107 --> 00:58:03,007
I haven't seen my
dick... in weeks.

891
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:09,531
And you know, Ken is
basically moved out.

892
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:13,655
Which I get, I don't blame
 him I don't blame him but...

893
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:18,679
He's not ready for this and I'm not
 ready for it either you know...

894
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:26,303
Sometimes I just can't help but
thinking that I don't want this baby.

895
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:28,127
I've been drinking tap water.

896
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:35,051
Because I'd heard that it sometimes
causes miscarriages in women  what...

897
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:38,575
Or maybe you know it's just the single
 isolated incident in West Virginia.

898
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,499
I don't know, I followed so many
news out some social medias.

899
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:43,823
And I'd just been
 looking for someone.

900
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:48,747
Anyone who is not a falling
 complete crazy that could...

901
00:58:48,771 --> 00:58:52,671
Help me through this, through
the delivery at least.

902
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:56,095
Because I'm 31 years old and I am a
 web designer who until very recently...

903
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,719
Did not have any
health care and I'm...

904
00:59:00,743 --> 00:59:04,843
I'm a top usually
by the way and...

905
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:10,067
I just don't know how I'm gonna be a
 parent, how I'm gonna have a family...

906
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:14,691
My family is a complete train wreck,
 my mother is vain and self-absorbed.

907
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:20,315
And my father has never been in the
 picture and my half sister, Connie, she's...

908
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:24,139
She's wonderful actually, she's  wonderful
but has her own problems.

909
00:59:24,163 --> 00:59:26,663
My best friend, Ernie...

910
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:30,587
He is basically in life long
prison sentence for his...

911
00:59:30,611 --> 00:59:34,511
Fucking psychotic christian
 fundamentalist parents.

912
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:37,535
And he is in a wheelchair
right now by the way.

913
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,359
He is confined to one

914
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:42,783
And he has the mental
 capacity a preschool

915
00:59:42,807 --> 00:59:45,406
Constantly tweeting about
like sharp wigs

916
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:49,507
Or whether or not the Cookie
Monster has an ants problem.

917
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,640
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

918
01:00:04,364 --> 01:00:05,964
Look...

919
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:10,388
I know that most of my responsibility
 happens at birth but...

920
01:00:10,812 --> 01:00:12,512
Greg, looks like you're under

921
01:00:12,536 --> 01:00:16,236
A considerable amount of stress and
stress is not good for the baby.

922
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,260
And yes, in some areas
either is tap water.

923
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:26,008
... But hey, why
don't we do this...

924
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:29,332
Why don't we schedule an appointment
 each week from here on now?

925
01:00:31,556 --> 01:00:34,156
That i's very nice of you, Thomas,
but I can't afford that.

926
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,680
I just can't. So thank
 you, thank you, though.

927
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:40,704
It's what, it's what
needs to be done.

928
01:00:40,728 --> 01:00:44,128
And if you still want me to be
your Doula, what I hope you do,

929
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:46,152
That's what we gonna do.

930
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:51,331
Okay.

931
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:53,555
Don't worry about the money.

932
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:58,679
God, I'm happy to help.
So happy to help.

933
01:01:03,842 --> 01:01:06,142
Hormones...

934
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:09,755
Well, today I thought I'd
start off simple.

935
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:10,779
Okay.

936
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:12,303
After your outburst
the other day.

937
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:15,013
I thought it would be a very good idea
for you to get your feelings out.

938
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,151
Awesome.

939
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:18,775
- How do you feel?
- Fat.

940
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,199
I feel fat like Marlon Brandon
in The Island of Dr Monroe.

941
01:01:24,123 --> 01:01:27,023
It's like I have a
gravitational pull.

942
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:30,047
I have a solution, I think.

943
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:33,271
Have you ever seen that music video about
Britney Spears <i>Dear Diary? </i>

944
01:01:33,295 --> 01:01:34,695
No, I haven't.

945
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,219
Well, you gonna Dear Diary
the shit out of this notebook.

946
01:01:38,243 --> 01:01:40,643
A Dear diary, I'm
 fat and disgusting,

947
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:43,467
Dear diary, where my penis go?

948
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,991
And so and so forth, okay?

949
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:48,815
Okay.

950
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:55,167
- Oh you hated it!
- Kind of.

951
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:59,591
It's merely a suggestion,
this is all about you.

952
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:24,972
Hello?

953
01:02:24,996 --> 01:02:27,996
Greg, hi. Brett Roberts
from the Local News.

954
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,820
I just wanted to get back with you
about schedule your interview.

955
01:02:32,344 --> 01:02:35,244
Schedule? I didn't scheduled
 an interview.

956
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:37,268
Well, it must have been
your partner, Ken.

957
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:39,392
Apparently Ken called
 a few weeks ago and,

958
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:43,116
This is the first opportunity I have
 to get back with you, I'm so sorry.

959
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,540
Is this... Is this about
my pregnancy?

960
01:02:46,564 --> 01:02:49,664
Yes, it is! And congratulations
 by the way.

961
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:55,188
You might have won me over by saying my
 condolences, the way that I'm feeling right now.

962
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Hello?

963
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,210
So I brought you two things
that gonna improve your mood.

964
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:05,934
This is a test, 
a bag of essentials

965
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,358
Oh shit! No...

966
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:11,148
This is to watch Clueless.

967
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:13,972
- Whatever the edition...
- That's a better test.

968
01:03:13,996 --> 01:03:15,996
That's a test.
- And...

969
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,420
There's this. Which
 one do you want?

970
01:03:20,056 --> 01:03:23,556
- Dulce de Leche.
- Nice. I'll have the strawberry.

971
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,133
Listen, did you actually...?

972
01:03:27,157 --> 01:03:30,057
The essentials were just a
joke, right? Like you didn't...?

973
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:33,081
Or did you actually intended to bring some essentials?
- I did.

974
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,905
But I... I left it on my
counter before I left.

975
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:38,629
No, it's good to like
soak in absence...

976
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,053
- That's okay.
- It's for...

977
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:41,777
Like most relaxation
 and stuff like that.

978
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,677
Yeah I have some.

979
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:45,701
How many births
 did you assisted on?

980
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:48,725
- Four.
- So I'm your fifth.

981
01:03:49,974 --> 01:03:51,774
Yes, well...

982
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:53,905
Technically...

983
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:57,529
Or the forth I guess. Depending
 on how you  look at it.

984
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:03,304
One of my clients
miscarried, so.

985
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,927
That's terrible, I'm so orry.

986
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:07,451
It's okay. She was...

987
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:09,775
I mean, she was...

988
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:12,299
It was not good but...

989
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,371
So what is you...

990
01:04:18,907 --> 01:04:23,107
What is you do regularly, or
what you wanna do regularly?

991
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:26,136
I like to be making music actually.
- Yeah?

992
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,760
Yeah, I mean, that's what
led me to Nashville, so...

993
01:04:28,784 --> 01:04:31,784
Alright.
- But since I don't have...

994
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:36,453
Anything too cling to just yet.
Like your fortunate sister does.

995
01:04:37,261 --> 01:04:41,961
I mostly do ... figure modeling

996
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,079
For Art classes.

997
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:46,803
Some of the colleges
 around town..?

998
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:48,652
Really?

999
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:52,016
Like... Like figure...?

1000
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,840
Like... figure... like naked...?

1001
01:04:54,864 --> 01:04:57,363
- Naked?
- Nude. They call it nude.

1002
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:01,156
- I did not take you for an exhibitionist.
- I'm not!

1003
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,080
- It seems like you might be an exhibitionist.
- I'm definitely not.

1004
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:07,604
Really? Is it not uncomfortable?

1005
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:12,321
The first or second time...

1006
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:15,745
Yeah, yes, but I...

1007
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,757
I don't know. I guess it grown
 on me. Like most things do.

1008
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:19,881
Ew.

1009
01:05:21,423 --> 01:05:24,923
You know,  just kept
stick with it long enough.

1010
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:28,821
But...

1011
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:32,785
Some of the fucking poses
 they make me do? Suck!

1012
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,709
Suck so bad! It's
 so uncomfortable!

1013
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,733
And I start like...

1014
01:05:37,757 --> 01:05:41,657
Individually resenting each
 and every student in the class.

1015
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,681
Because you know
they're comfortable.

1016
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:46,705
But I don't know
after it passes,

1017
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:49,829
It's pretty freeing.
You should try it.

1018
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:54,149
Belly and all.
- That would be beautiful.

1019
01:05:54,432 --> 01:05:56,932
I just kinda zone out and...

1020
01:05:58,078 --> 01:06:01,078
I write songs in my head. And
 they can't really do that.

1021
01:06:01,102 --> 01:06:03,902
An attempt job or sling drinks.

1022
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,426
Which I've tried before.

1023
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:10,249
I can definitely see
you raking the booze,

1024
01:06:10,273 --> 01:06:11,873
Behing a bar.

1025
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,680
Yeah, I did it for a while.

1026
01:06:15,387 --> 01:06:18,287
But that is definitely something
 that did not grown on me.

1027
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:22,373
I'm just really not
 that social actually.

1028
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,497
Really?
- Yeah.

1029
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:26,921
And that's kind of what
 I like about the art classes.

1030
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:28,044
Yes?

1031
01:06:28,045 --> 01:06:30,545
You don't have to talk
to anybody, you know?

1032
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:35,569
Just sort of... judge
 them on silently.

1033
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,693
But you know, sometimes after
classe I'll get up and walk around,

1034
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:43,317
And look at people's sculptures
 and the drawings.

1035
01:06:43,341 --> 01:06:47,741
And chat a little bit, but inevitably
I just kind of zone out and...

1036
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:52,265
And I play music in
my head, you know?

1037
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:57,089
Unless I have a big
ass cramp in my toe.

1038
01:06:58,113 --> 01:07:01,313
So what's your agenda?

1039
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:05,737
In Pop music?
- Yeah.

1040
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:08,061
Sing a song that stuck.

1041
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:15,185
So what kind of are you trying like...
 Are you trying about Britney or Adele?

1042
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:33,529
You gave me pretty little
 kisses on my face

1043
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:40,253
Your arms enlace me, we
 cuddle in the right place

1044
01:07:40,277 --> 01:07:47,977
In every time I look at
 you, you smile on like

1045
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:52,401
You know what it do to me

1046
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:59,125
It doen't hurt that you have
the most perfect teeth

1047
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:05,249
And when you hold my hand
you sweep me off my feet

1048
01:08:05,273 --> 01:08:12,573
Because every time I'm around
you, I can barely breathe

1049
01:08:12,597 --> 01:08:17,297
You see what you do to me

1050
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:22,621
I won't forget you
 when you leave me

1051
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:27,045
I know it's coming shortly

1052
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:33,769
That I just have to let you know

1053
01:08:34,593 --> 01:08:38,793
It's what you do to me

1054
01:08:38,817 --> 01:08:42,617
It's what you do to me

1055
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:46,765
I can barely breathe

1056
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:50,789
It's what you do to me

1057
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:54,613
It's what you do to me

1058
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:59,437
It's what you do to me

1059
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:04,261
I can barely breathe

1060
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:09,485
It's what you do to me

1061
01:09:09,509 --> 01:09:16,009
It's what you do to me

1062
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,908
Hello.

1063
01:09:23,932 --> 01:09:27,632
Hi Greg, Brett Roberts from the
Local News please don't hang up.

1064
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:36,755
I'll get it.
- Thank you.

1065
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:53,761
- Hi.
 - Hi.

1066
01:09:53,771 --> 01:09:56,371
Brett Roberts good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

1067
01:09:56,795 --> 01:10:00,595
I wanna go over a few bullet points first
before we get started if that's okay.

1068
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:01,719
Sure.

1069
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:04,543
Is paternity leave, it's
that an option for you?

1070
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:07,267
No, no I'm self-employed.

1071
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:11,691
Alright. Well, we'll just
 inscribe as unknow.

1072
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:16,415
What are your
 plans for delivery?

1073
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,839
Greg has decided
 to do a home birth.

1074
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:25,763
And we gonna get an inflatable pool and
do a water birth right here in the livingroom.

1075
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:27,587
Okay.

1076
01:10:28,053 --> 01:10:31,053
Oh, my god Brett
hit me up on Grindr!

1077
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:35,577
When? When he was here
or was after he left?

1078
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:37,601
No! No, yuck! Not gonna happen.

1079
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,725
Ages ago. Like before
 he was on TV.

1080
01:10:40,725 --> 01:10:44,025
Yes, but I doubt
he remembers.

1081
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:47,849
Although he did give me this weird
 look when he walked in did you see it?

1082
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:50,773
He did, he did give you a low weird
 look. But did you two ever...?

1083
01:10:50,797 --> 01:10:53,397
Did you meet him after...?
- No, no.

1084
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:56,221
If memory serves
he was apprehensive.

1085
01:10:56,245 --> 01:11:00,445
Oh, like he was cautious about
 meeting because he's still...

1086
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:02,469
- Yes.
-Yes.

1087
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:06,193
His profile was Brett
spelled backwards and...

1088
01:11:06,217 --> 01:11:10,417
And his profile pic was on that area
 between the neck and the nipples?

1089
01:11:10,441 --> 01:11:13,441
The memory does
 serves I guess...

1090
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,080
Maybe he was new in town
and went hunting, you know?

1091
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:27,704
It was what you were doing?
- No, no.

1092
01:11:27,828 --> 01:11:31,228
I feel like I only ever checked
that stuff when I'm feeling lonely.

1093
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,552
I get.

1094
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:34,076
Hi.

1095
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:36,245
Hi.

1096
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:39,478
Ken this is Thomas
he's my Doula.

1097
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,633
Hi.

1098
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:43,334
Yes, I just came
 by to drop stuff.

1099
01:11:43,358 --> 01:11:47,758
You can stay if you want...
- No, no I can't.  I have a meeting.

1100
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:50,011
Nice to meet you.

1101
01:11:58,946 --> 01:12:02,846
Okay, Greg, today I want
you to pick a room

1102
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,270
Any room in the apartment.

1103
01:12:04,294 --> 01:12:09,294
Walk into it and find five things
that you could live without.

1104
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:10,518
Okay.

1105
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:13,042
And then throw them away.

1106
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:16,404
And what purpose
 does this serve?

1107
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:20,262
Maybe it's just to feel
 a little less overwhelmed?

1108
01:12:20,286 --> 01:12:22,986
And I mean not in the I feel
soft and life is too hard,

1109
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:27,510
There's so much to it, kind of way I mean why
 do we have three lemon shakers by the way?

1110
01:12:28,341 --> 01:12:30,441
How did you know about
 the lemon shakers?

1111
01:12:30,756 --> 01:12:32,256
- A bunch.
- Yeah.

1112
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,638
- So you do know what I mean.
- No I know, I know exactly what you mean.

1113
01:12:35,704 --> 01:12:37,403
My grandparents are...

1114
01:12:37,727 --> 01:12:40,427
They are... They were...

1115
01:12:40,428 --> 01:12:43,928
Richer than Ben Folds. Not
as rich as the Kardashians.

1116
01:12:43,952 --> 01:12:47,252
They had an Antiques
 obsession anyway.

1117
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:48,476
When they passed on...

1118
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,700
I was left in their will so I know
exactly what you're talking about.

1119
01:12:51,724 --> 01:12:52,824
- Nice.
- Yuck.

1120
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,548
-Who got the loop?
- My sister, thank goodness.

1121
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,772
She got the house and
most of the stuff so.

1122
01:12:58,194 --> 01:13:00,894
Alright, I will purge.

1123
01:13:37,217 --> 01:13:41,217
I'm sorry you may not remember me
completely but we've seen each other.

1124
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:43,541
- Greg! Oh my God!
- Hi Alex!

1125
01:13:43,565 --> 01:13:46,865
- Hi! How are you?
- I'm well, I'm well, how are you?

1126
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:47,989
I'm ...

1127
01:13:48,008 --> 01:13:49,908
- I'm good...
- Good.

1128
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:52,732
- Are you ... Are you pregnant?
- Yes, I'm pregnant.

1129
01:13:52,756 --> 01:13:55,856
Oh! my God! Who is the father?

1130
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,280
Ken, Ken is.

1131
01:13:57,904 --> 01:13:59,904
- Wow!
- Yeah.

1132
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:02,433
That... You...

1133
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:05,141
That... that lasted a long time.

1134
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:07,165
- Yeah.
- Good for you...

1135
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:11,189
- Well, not that good for me now...
- Oh, I'm sorry...

1136
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,013
- That's okay. That's okay.
What are you up to?

1137
01:14:14,611 --> 01:14:18,411
I... I don't know I'm ...
A little of this, a little...

1138
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,355
I'm sorry, is that a weird
 question to ask? I'm sorry.

1139
01:14:20,379 --> 01:14:23,479
- I didn't mean to pry.
- No, I... I'm in school.

1140
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:26,927
I'm taking night classes at
the Art college Downtown.

1141
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:31,551
- That's great! Congratulations!
- Yeah I...

1142
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,475
I mean...

1143
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:36,599
I still don't know what I'll be when
 I grow up but it's a start I guess...

1144
01:14:36,599 --> 01:14:37,399
Sure.

1145
01:14:37,423 --> 01:14:39,723
And I never really
had the drive you did.

1146
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:41,747
Yes, my drive...

1147
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:44,771
By the way, I dropped
out of med school.

1148
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:48,895
- So... why? You didn't...?
- Yeah.

1149
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,252
- Because of the baby?
- Oh, no, no, no this happened way before the baby.

1150
01:14:53,276 --> 01:14:54,576
Way long.

1151
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,300
What made you decide to quit?

1152
01:14:56,324 --> 01:14:57,924
You don't care
about this. It's okay.

1153
01:14:57,948 --> 01:14:59,748
Yes I do. Of course I do!

1154
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:01,772
Your future was always
 so important to you!

1155
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:04,473
Well, things change.

1156
01:15:05,974 --> 01:15:08,274
You look great.

1157
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,938
- You, you  look great.
- No I don't.

1158
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:14,562
- Yes, you do.
- No, I am fat.

1159
01:15:16,551 --> 01:15:18,351
You are pregnant.

1160
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,475
That's true, Yes.
Well, I'm pregnant.

1161
01:15:21,799 --> 01:15:23,999
Well...

1162
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:28,023
Hey, do you... what are you doing right
 now? Do you wanna grab some coffee?

1163
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:32,911
- Can you even drink coffee?
- Oh no. Yeah. No. I can't.

1164
01:15:32,935 --> 01:15:35,935
But I can drink tea,
 I can have a tea.

1165
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:37,052
Okay.

1166
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:40,953
Great. Well, good, good. I'll tell
 you, it's so great to see you.

1167
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:42,377
It was great seeing you too.

1168
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,801
Alright I'll gonna check out my albums
and then we head out, sounds good?

1169
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:49,325
Yeah. Alright.
I am so glad I run into you.

1170
01:15:49,349 --> 01:15:53,449
Yeah. It's so sweet,
yeah, wow! Good.

1172
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,801
Hi.

1173
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,248
I...

1174
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:24,347
- Why are you here?
- I just came by to say hi.

1175
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:26,671
See how you were.

1176
01:17:26,695 --> 01:17:30,295
Impressing you .

1177
01:17:35,057 --> 01:17:37,457
I really missed you.

1178
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,839
I really missed you too.

1179
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:44,951
Hey, did you see the new car?

1180
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:49,049
- It's yours?
- Ours.

1181
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:55,310
When I pulled in the
 front I saw a Volvo,

1182
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:58,234
And that the lights were on inside I
 thought I was about to be a victim

1183
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,758
Of middle-class, some
 middle-class crime.

1184
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:08,681
You were right.

1185
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:12,305
I'm sad to say you were
 right about everything.

1186
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:15,929
I was... scared.

1187
01:18:16,848 --> 01:18:19,448
Scared and I...

1188
01:18:19,472 --> 01:18:22,972
I was so wrapped up in how
it was gonna affect me that...

1189
01:18:22,996 --> 01:18:25,696
I acted like the big prick
we both know I can be.

1190
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:30,320
I wasn't even thinking about
how you should be feeling.

1191
01:18:31,785 --> 01:18:34,985
And you deserve a lot
 better than that, Greg.

1192
01:18:35,828 --> 01:18:39,928
So I'm here to be better.

1193
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:44,501
If you let me. I really
 wanna be better and...

1194
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:47,025
I'm gonna be better.

1195
01:18:47,596 --> 01:18:49,996
You know the best news?

1196
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,920
- What?
- I'm really a father.

1197
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:04,996
I'm so glad you're here!

1198
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,520
Me too. I missed you.
I missed you so much!

1199
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:13,731
You know I've been eating like
from snacks machine at work?

1200
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:15,854
- Yeah?
- So like two weeks that count.

1201
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:17,855
That's number one,
it's expensive.

1202
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:21,479
Yeah, and they are loaded with
salted peanuts, it's horrible!

1203
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:34,991
- What?
- I'm just...

1204
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:37,015
I'm afraid I'm gonna
crush the baby.

1205
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,739
People have sex when they're
pregnant all the time.

1206
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:42,407
What if...if I just milked you?

1207
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:46,020
I know that I look like a
cow but that is another.

1208
01:19:46,044 --> 01:19:47,944
I want you to fuck me.

1209
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,635
Listen to you born again bottom.

1210
01:19:52,736 --> 01:19:54,536
Alright.

1211
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,435
Ken?

1212
01:20:10,032 --> 01:20:11,932
Ken? It's time.

1213
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,899
-Time for what?
- Time to get chicken out of  the oven.

1214
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:16,923
- Ken, it's time to have the baby!
- What?!

1215
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:20,447
Time to have the baby, Ken!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1216
01:20:20,718 --> 01:20:22,418
Here we go. Alright.

1217
01:20:22,495 --> 01:20:25,295
I don't... I can walk.
I can walk, I'm okay.

1218
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:31,396
I can't believe
this is happening.

1219
01:20:32,006 --> 01:20:33,306
Yeah...

1220
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:37,909
I had a long time to
get used to the idea.

1221
01:20:38,829 --> 01:20:40,529
Hello!

1222
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:43,865
I've heard a baby is on the way!

1223
01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:57,581
PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB

1224
01:21:03,728 --> 01:21:06,928
Are you ready to come out?
Are you ready to come out?

1225
01:21:07,339 --> 01:21:08,839
Today is the day.

1226
01:21:23,066 --> 01:21:26,566
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1227
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:35,688
Okay, yeah, easy, easy

1228
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:56,070
Yeah, I'm okay.

1229
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,920
- Am I pretty?
<i>- You are beautiful.</i>

1230
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:22,613
Come over here.
Over here, Greg.

1231
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:29,424
Okay, Greg. You're doing well.

1232
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,830
God! Shit!

1233
01:22:59,046 --> 01:23:01,146
Motherfucker!

1234
01:23:04,532 --> 01:23:06,832
Greg, I can see the head.

1235
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,041
- What? What?
- Is he coming?

1236
01:23:22,371 --> 01:23:24,971
You're almost there, sweetie.
You're nearly there, okay?

1237
01:23:24,995 --> 01:23:27,195
- Okay, okay.
- Now, you can push.

1238
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,419
Come on.

1239
01:24:27,282 --> 01:24:28,782

According to medical experts, </i>

1240

 became pregnant, </i>

1241
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:34,530

1242

number of C-sections </i>

1243

<i>Some point in the last
twenty five thousand years.</i>

Today we are here with the
 new Nashville transplant,

1258
01:26:18,499 --> 01:26:20,899
All the way from sunny
west Hollywood California.

1259
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:24,423
Mr. Gino Ollie. He's recently
 had his third baby.

1260
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:27,447
The first which was
 born in a toilet.

1261
01:26:28,269 --> 01:26:31,969
He just came out so unexpectedly.
I was at the club T and I thought,

1262
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:34,293
I had got some food poisoning
 from the crab leg,

1263
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:36,417
I've had on a Chinese
 buffet earlier.

1264
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:39,641
You had no idea at all you were
pregnant. No signs, nothing.

1265
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:42,165
No, no I mean,
I'm a large girl, so...

1266
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:45,981
And everything went smoothly after
that, the baby was good and healthy?

1267
01:26:46,005 --> 01:26:50,505
What I mean, you know,
 he has some issues

1268
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:52,529
But you know he alright,
 he run around,

1269
01:26:52,553 --> 01:26:54,853
He kinda talk sometimes.

1270
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,377
And your second and
third children they...?

1271
01:26:57,401 --> 01:27:00,201
Oh they're fine. Trey,
Trey Trey, and Japanda.

1272
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:02,625
- Lord, days are long.
- Japanda?

1273
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:04,949
- Beautiful, beautiful name.
- Her daddy pick it.

1274
01:27:04,973 --> 01:27:06,073
Her daddy pick it.

1275
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:08,397
We were at that
 japanese restaurant,

1276
01:27:08,926 --> 01:27:11,426
You know what I'm saying?
He picked it right out Japanda.

1277
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,450
- I loved it.
- You sound very proud.

1278
01:27:13,474 --> 01:27:17,074
What about the father or
 fathers of these... babies?

1279
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,098
Well, you know, they're fathers,

1280
01:27:19,122 --> 01:27:22,022
They're there. They're
around. They're around.

1281
01:27:22,046 --> 01:27:24,046
So they're helping you
 take care of your children?

1282
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:27,236
Their pay checks are helping
me take care of my children.

1283
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,560
So they're <i>not raising</i>
 your children...?

1284
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:31,684
Well, you know, I mean...
How... I don't mean,

1285
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:34,408
What does raising children
 really mean anyway?

1286
01:27:34,432 --> 01:27:35,632
You know, I saying...

1287
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:39,556
That's a good question Nashville what
 does raising children really mean?
