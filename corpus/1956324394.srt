[James] <i>I didn't know how
fucked up Sophie and I were</i>

3
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,440
<i>until we got Henry.</i>

4
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,977
[Sophie] I don't know
about this, James.

5
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,179
[sighs]
This is the future, Soph.

6
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,147
How could we at least
not see this?

7
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,449
It just feels
so weird.

8
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,252
No, this should
be exciting.

9
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:40,885
[Sophie] I am.

10
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:42,257
[James] You are what?

11
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,326
Excited.

12
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,428
Good.

13
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,464
Let's go inside.

14
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:58,171
[James] <i>Soph,
it's just a dream you're talking about.</i>

15
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,839
Yeah, but I think dreams

16
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,974
are our subconscious
trying to talk to us.

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,346
All right. What you think it is that
your dream's trying to tell you?

18
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:08,913
Hmm.

19
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:12,284
That I'm in the right
place, at the right time.

20
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:14,820
My baggage is gone.
I'm happy.

21
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,125
Me too.

22
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,858
You sure you
want this thing?

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,926
No, I just wanted
to watch you carry it.

24
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:26,230
I mean, look at it.
It's so beat and heavy.

25
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,366
You have to look
at the lines.

26
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:32,570
Put new fabric on this thing and it's
gonna be beautiful. And best, it's free.

27
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,509
You just have to lug it upstairs
and I'll do the rest. I promise.

28
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:39,178
[mouths words]

29
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,514
I love you too.

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,018
[groans]

31
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,452
[James groaning]
That will do it.

32
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:51,121
[man] Anything else
I can do for you guys?

33
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:52,489
[sighs]

34
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:55,259
You could join us for
dinner on Saturday night.

35
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:57,261
[man] That's mighty kind.
Not necessary.

36
00:01:57,263 --> 00:02:00,264
Oh, please. I insist.
Let us properly thank you.

37
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,166
Sophie, it's my job.

38
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:05,536
Barry, it's easier to just give
her what she wants. Trust me.

39
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,970
- All right, you win. I'd love to come.
- Great.

40
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,241
- Thank you.
- See you then.

41
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,145
[door closes]

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,247
I love it.

43
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,147
Oh, me too.

44
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,083
[chuckles]

45
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,217
And I love you.

46
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,854
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,498
[phone rings]

48
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:37,901
[sighs]

49
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,170
Hello.

50
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:44,340
[man] <i>James,
I'm really, really sorry.</i>

51
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:47,545
[man speaking, indistinct]

52
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,554
[Sophie] It doesn't
feel like home.

53
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,255
[James] And it won't
if you don't try.

54
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:03,558
[Sophie] James, I'm here to try
because I wanna support you.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,963
I'm just telling you
how I feel.

56
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:43,063
You're leaving already?

57
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:47,067
Yeah, yeah. I'm just kind
of freaking out a little.

58
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,770
You know,
I just want to get in early,

59
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:51,238
calm my nerves before I have to jump
in, you know.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,207
Well, why don't you
stay and relax?

61
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,642
We can make
a big breakfast.

62
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,610
No, Soph. It's my first day.
Come on.

63
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,313
It's your company.
You can make the rules.

64
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,782
Yeah, and I'm sure
these people think

65
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:05,486
I'm just some fucking
undeserving brat as it is, right?

66
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,456
Look, I really just need
to get in there early,

67
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,593
get my bearings,
ease into things, okay?

68
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:18,799
And hey, this...
this is really sweet.

69
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,167
I love it.
<i>Great Expectations.</i>

70
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,268
[clears throat]

71
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,673
Help keep me grounded.

72
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,342
[kisses]

73
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,451
[woman]
Coffee?

74
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,421
No, thanks.

75
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:46,994
This will do it.
Just gonna take it upstairs.

76
00:04:56,203 --> 00:05:00,305
Miss Sophie, would you prefer the
chicken or the soup for lunch?

77
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:03,308
It's just Sophie.
No, "Miss" needed.

78
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,310
And I... I'm good.

79
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,114
But it's my job.

80
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:10,685
Take a break.

81
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,853
So, no soup today?

82
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,155
No. No.

83
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,723
Look, I'm not...
I'm not James.

84
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,494
I didn't grow up like this.
I don't need this.

85
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:24,329
Just, um,
do whatever you want, okay?

86
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:26,100
I just need to be alone.

87
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:34,273
He wanted you to steer
this in your direction.

88
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,874
"The new era," he'd say.

89
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:39,478
This is what your father wanted.
Trust me.

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,748
And you think the others would get
on board with my green revolution?

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,383
It is all about
how you present it.

92
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:48,185
Make your environmental
viewpoint make business sense,

93
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,725
and you will have these old codgers
on canoe trips by next spring.

94
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,329
[Rosa]
The living room.

95
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:00,498
Yeah, I know. It's a work in progress.
I'll take care of it.

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,633
No, no, no, I'll fix it.

97
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:06,506
Rosa, stop. Please.
Please, just stop.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,441
Miss Sophie...

99
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,709
you don't have to fight this.

100
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,144
It's your new life.
You should just enjoy it.

101
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,617
This is my job, and I...
I'm very thankful for it.

102
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:19,752
But are you?

103
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:25,223
When you were a little girl,
what did you wanna be?

104
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,595
I'm pretty sure it wasn't
someone's housekeeper.

105
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,465
I am so happy here.

106
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,232
I am very thankful
for my job.

107
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,836
That's not what I'm trying to say.
I know you are.

108
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,607
And you're great at your job.
And I appreciate that.

109
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,640
But...

110
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:46,610
I'm trying to feel
more comfortable here.

111
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,780
And I want you to as well.

112
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,948
So instead of telling me
to enjoy my new life,

113
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,554
why don't you tell me what
your ideal new life would be.

114
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,158
[James] Hello!

115
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,961
Hello! Anyone here?

116
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,798
I'm in the bedroom.

117
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,871
Where is everyone?

118
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,371
[clears throat]

119
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:16,842
What?

120
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,244
I fired them.

121
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:23,180
[chuckles] You what?

122
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,584
- Babe, before you get weird just...
- Wait.

123
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,186
You're serious.

124
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:32,354
- Mm-hmm.
- Sophie, why?

125
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:35,324
- Why would you do that?
- We don't need them.

126
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:38,260
Babe, they're just an unhealthy
distraction. Trust me.

127
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:42,564
A distraction?
Babe, this is a big house.

128
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,667
We need help dealing with it.
Trust me.

129
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,470
Do you know how long it's been since Rosa
has gone to see her family in Guatemala?

130
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,471
- Her son, Carlos?
- [sighs]

131
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:54,342
I don't even know Rosa.
She wasn't working here when I was a kid.

132
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,610
Fourteen years.

133
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,381
Fourteen years
she hasn't seen her only son.

134
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,985
I... I sent them off
to find their dreams.

135
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:06,354
Their dreams?
Sophie, this is their life.

136
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:07,722
Their livelihood.

137
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:09,590
This is...
This is what they do.

138
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,592
Yeah, I also gave them
two years' pay.

139
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,494
You what?

140
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:16,698
What? We have more
money than God now.

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,566
I don't know
why you're mad.

142
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,637
[sighs] I'm... I'm...

143
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,471
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.
I'm just...

144
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,039
I'm... I'm confused,
I guess.

145
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,942
You don't indulge help by paying
for their dreams to come true.

146
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm not indulging them.
I'm liberating them.

147
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:34,749
Look, if we're gonna be rich people,
this is the version of them we're gonna be.

148
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,319
Not overlords
to indentured servants.

149
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:39,956
That's not who we are.

150
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:44,326
Soph, I can't believe
you did this.

151
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,530
Believe it.

152
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,398
Because it happened.

153
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,969
And we're gonna be
better for it.

154
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:56,638
Every one of us.

155
00:08:57,806 --> 00:09:00,540
You're crazy.
You're crazy.

156
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,778
- You think so?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,749
You wanna know what else?

158
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,951
What?

159
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:10,953
Come here.

160
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,423
Now...

161
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:23,429
Now we have this big,
big mansion all to ourselves.

162
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,933
Yeah.

163
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,535
[James] We don't give a shit
about the environment.

164
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,571
I mean, is that really what we
want this company to look like?

165
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,009
[phone rings]

166
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,676
I'm gonna be blunt.

167
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,479
You're being
too idealistic.

168
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:19,319
Unfortunately, this is the most cost-effective
way to build in today's global world.

169
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,823
It's your wife.
It sounds urgent.

170
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,257
Soph.

171
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,759
<i>I'm losing my mind and I need
your help with this lawn.</i>

172
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,495
I'm at work.

173
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,364
<i>I know that, James.</i>

174
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,636
- I'll do it tonight.
- [Sophie sighs]

175
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,640
[engine cranking]

176
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,645
How do I fucking
do this shit?

177
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,723
That's what I fucking did.

178
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,440
We were still at the loft, and it was
done up like we'd always talked about.

179
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,642
<i>You know, the spare room
and everything.</i>

180
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,210
We were so happy.

181
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,114
It's a dream.

182
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,683
[sighs] I can't have
servants, assistants.

183
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,820
It's not how
you treat people.

184
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,555
<i>It makes me constantly
question why we're here.</i>

185
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:36,095
Well, maybe you have to stop
questioning it and just accept it.

186
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,034
I wish I could.

187
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:49,572
I don't know.
There was something so safe.

188
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,541
Not just living off the monthly
allowance Dad gave, you know.

189
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,710
No real responsibilities.

190
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:58,080
I don't know. I guess I thought
that was what my life would be.

191
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,616
You can walk away from this
anytime you want.

192
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:03,252
No. No, I want this.

193
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,054
This feels so much
more real than that.

194
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:08,724
And harder, sure.
But... real.

195
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,592
And what's holding you back?

196
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:13,728
Well, for one thing,
my wife fired our help.

197
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,597
Every last one.

198
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,799
Why would she do that?

199
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:21,738
I think she wants me to let it all
go and go back to our old lives.

200
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,142
In some ways,

201
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:29,878
firing all the help makes it
impossible to live this new life,

202
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,149
and she knows that.

203
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,219
I feel trapped.

204
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:40,155
If this is something
you really want,

205
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:43,160
you may need to fight her
with your own arsenal.

206
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:48,464
James, you're a very rich man
with many new resources.

207
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,631
There's always a solution.

208
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,633
A solution...

209
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:56,770
she may learn to love
a lot more than you realize.

210
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,605
Please. I'm all ears.

211
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:01,009
[man] <i>Six months ago
your father was approached</i>

212
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,079
<i>with a very interesting
presentation, to say the least.</i>

213
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,780
<i>We all had to sign
a confidentiality agreement.</i>

214
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:09,116
[Sophie] I don't know
about this, James.

215
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,051
[James]
This is the future, Soph.

216
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,987
How could we at least
not see this?

217
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,922
[Sophie]
It just feels so weird.

218
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,191
[James]
No, this should be exciting.

219
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:18,792
[Sophie] I am.

220
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,796
[James] You are what?

221
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:23,199
Excited.

222
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,534
Good.

223
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,803
Let's go inside.

224
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:40,914
[man] My father devoted
his life to this.

225
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:45,021
There's no one else in the world
coming close to our level of realism.

226
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:49,356
You have an opportunity

227
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:52,827
to be the first to step
into the next century.

228
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,829
[James]
Are there differences?

229
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,968
They all have
the same capabilities.

230
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:03,803
It comes down to
aesthetic preferences.

231
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,206
For example...

232
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:09,077
I especially like
Jessica here.

233
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:12,579
She's exquisite.

234
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,551
Jessica,
why don't you say hi.

235
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:19,018
Hello.

236
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,123
What else would
you like me to say?

237
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,689
Do you like your existence?

238
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:29,262
If my keepers are pleased,
I would be fulfilled.

239
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:32,731
What do you mean
by "fulfilled"?

240
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:36,768
My purpose would be actualized,
leading to my progression.

241
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,705
And that's what you want?

242
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,075
Very much so.

243
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,911
I don't know, James.

244
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,011
About what?

245
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:48,180
They're so perfect
and beautiful. It...

246
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:51,149
Yes, they really are.
They're works of art.

247
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,118
Okay.

248
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,987
I just... I don't know.
It makes me feel really weird.

249
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,158
Okay, what about it?
Talk to me.

250
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:00,392
[Sophie]
Well, I know it's lame,

251
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,161
but I kinda wanna be the
prettiest girl in the house.

252
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:06,333
You will be, all right?
She's just a robot.

253
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,235
Look...

254
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:13,205
at first glance,
I can understand why you're thinking that.

255
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:16,876
But it's like being jealous
of a beautiful painting.

256
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:22,012
- It makes me feel self-conscious and I really don't...
- There's no reason to.

257
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,083
It just does, James.

258
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,086
This is the future, Soph.
Okay?

259
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,055
We can have it right now.

260
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,390
How do we not
at least try this?

261
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,326
[Sophie] What about
one of the males?

262
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:38,663
I think that would
make me feel less uneasy.

263
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:41,633
It's all the same
to me.

264
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,076
They were all created to represent
a perfect version of humanity,

265
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,780
one that we all
fail to achieve.

266
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,849
- Like a fine piece of art.
- Exactly.

267
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:03,119
Sounds like he should be in a
museum, not a home.

268
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,389
No, on the contrary.

269
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:11,296
My robots will do, or not
do, whatever you ask of them.

270
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,332
There's no place
they belong more.

271
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,670
Henry,
please come here.

272
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,981
Henry, I want you to
kneel in front of James.

273
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,222
James, would you mind
lifting up your foot?

274
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:49,366
Henry, I want you to lick
the bottom of James's shoe.

275
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:58,142
[both gasp]

276
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,747
That's unbelievable.

277
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,524
Should any problems arise,

278
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:19,060
Henry's default is to come back
to his docking station

279
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:20,730
and reset.

280
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:24,301
Any problems past that
and...

281
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:27,237
[powering up]

282
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:32,273
I'm your personal adviser.

283
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:35,411
You'll have me at
your disposal 24/7.

284
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,079
What kind of problems
arise?

285
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:39,347
Nothing to worry about.

286
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,785
Speech and communication
issues, mostly.

287
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,921
Yeah, but that's
normal, right?

288
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:50,524
The important thing
to keep in mind with AI...

289
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:54,097
is you have to let it adapt
and grow at its own pace.

290
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,813
[Henry]
Good morning, Sophie.

291
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,517
Good morning.

292
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:21,223
I'm making James some eggs.
Would you care for some?

293
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,325
No.

294
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:25,227
No, thanks.

295
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:28,094
How about some oatmeal?

296
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,132
No. Really, I'm fine.

297
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,571
Whew! Best omelet ever.

298
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:47,547
He's not gonna get going without
you telling him what to do, Soph.

299
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,551
[exhales] It feels really weird
ordering him to do things.

300
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah, okay, fine.
But it shouldn't.

301
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,089
Think of him
as a washing machine.

302
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,959
You don't feel weird telling your washing
machine to clean your clothes, do you?

303
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:04,396
- That is a ridiculous comparison, James.
- Is it?

304
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:06,131
If you put him in
a room full of people,

305
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,133
you'd be hard-pressed
to know who's who.

306
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,235
Yeah, okay,
until you talk to him.

307
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:13,140
I mean, he's so submissive
and subservient.

308
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:19,580
I look at him
and just see a person.

309
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,582
Okay.

310
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:28,389
Well, do you want me to give
him a list of things to do?

311
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:34,526
I like making my own breakfast.
It gets my day started.

312
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:37,529
Then make your own breakfast, Sophie.
All right?

313
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:41,032
All I'm saying is
pick your battles.

314
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,969
There's a lot to do around
here and you can't do it all.

315
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,573
That's what he's here for.

316
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,991
[Henry] <i>I know you don't like
your breakfast made for you,</i>

317
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:11,596
<i>but I made coffee for James and didn't
want the leftover to go to waste.</i>

318
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:14,532
<i>The banana was not made.
It was delivered as is.</i>

319
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:18,135
<i>I'll be working my way through
the to-do list as prioritized.</i>

320
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:21,138
<i>If my services are needed
elsewhere, please let me know.</i>

321
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,642
<i>Best, Henry.</i>

322
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,560
[gasps]

323
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,931
Henry, get out.

324
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:54,704
He may have been
looking at you,

325
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:57,340
but I'm sure he wasn't
staring at your body.

326
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,375
<i>Remember,
he's a robot, Soph.</i>

327
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:02,144
I felt like he was
staring at my body.

328
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:04,681
I'm here by myself and
I'm really uncomfortable.

329
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:06,716
Can you please
just come home?

330
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,553
I can't just leave.

331
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:12,655
Look, just tell him to go
to his docking station.

332
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:16,360
<i>I'll be home as soon as
possible, all right? I promise.</i>

333
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:25,367
We appreciate your fresh brand
of perspective here, James.

334
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,670
But two more months
hemorrhaging money?

335
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:30,274
We need to start
pulling triggers here.

336
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,478
- James, you can't force people to change.
- [door opens, closes]

337
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,318
You need to think about how to make
it work with what the givens are.

338
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:43,554
I appreciate that.

339
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:47,090
[machinery hissing]

340
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,294
Babe, he's already on
his docking station.

341
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,730
I need to blow off a little steam.
All right?

342
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,664
If you don't want
to play a round or two,

343
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,068
I, unlike you, will not feel
guilty waking our robot up.

344
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,569
That's the point.

345
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,638
I don't understand why you're
trying to make me feel bad

346
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,074
about not wanting to work
out at such weird hours.

347
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,577
I'm not trying. I'm sorry.
Seriously, just relax.

348
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,113
I'm gonna steal Henry for a second. You
can let him charge longer in the morning.

349
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,850
I distinctly remember them saying
to not interrupt the charges.

350
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:20,524
I need this. I cannot go to bed
the way I'm feeling right now.

351
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,759
Unless you wanna play.

352
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,364
That's what I thought.

353
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:39,742
Would you like me to play as
an intermediate or advanced?

354
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,843
Let's start
with intermediate.

355
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:46,113
I don't think I'd deal
well with defeat tonight.

356
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,515
You seem stressed, James.

357
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:51,518
Well, that's probably
because I am, Henry.

358
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,722
What about?

359
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,693
What makes you
ask me that?

360
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,494
Maybe I can help.

361
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,430
[exhales] You are.

362
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,634
That's why we're
playing racquetball.

363
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:27,088
God!

364
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,497
What do you mean
when you shout, "God"?

365
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,533
You know what
God means, Henry?

366
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:44,872
In monotheistic religions, he's the
creator and ruler of the universe.

367
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:48,108
Do you believe in God?

368
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:50,812
My maker is my god.

369
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,815
My keepers
are my rulers.

370
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:57,217
And you believe
humans have a god?

371
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:00,352
No.

372
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:04,789
We can't be scientifically certain
who's responsible for making you.

373
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,825
Whereas with you
we can be.

374
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:09,596
Which allows me
certainty in my purpose.

375
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:13,567
I felt like
I had certainty.

376
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:17,437
What happened
to change that?

377
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,608
My father died.

378
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:28,180
I'm very sorry for your loss.

379
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,285
I like you, Henry.

380
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:37,556
The feeling
is very mutual.

381
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:45,231
- [racquetball bouncing]
- [racquet hits ball]

382
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,967
So...

383
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:51,737
how was your late-night
racquetball session?

384
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:53,871
It was great.

385
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:56,940
It's nice to let off
a little steam, you know.

386
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,742
Yeah.

387
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,844
I'll tell you, that Henry,
he makes it easy, doesn't he?

388
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:04,316
What do you mean,
"He makes it easy"?

389
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,918
It's like having an interesting
conversation with someone,

390
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,787
but it's really
just for you.

391
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,290
You know? You don't
owe him anything.

392
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,560
It's nice.

393
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:18,764
You okay?

394
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,566
Yeah.

395
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,803
Yeah, I'm just tired.

396
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,272
- Okay.
- Have a good day.

397
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,308
Thanks. I will.

398
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,588
So everywhere
you see a seam.

399
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:45,855
Like this.

400
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:46,925
Okay?

401
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,797
Is this couch
important to you?

402
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:56,634
It was.

403
00:25:57,902 --> 00:25:59,602
Why?

404
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:02,406
It represents
a dream I once had.

405
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,408
It's fascinating to
consider what dreams mean,

406
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,645
and why humans
have them.

407
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,950
Do robots have dreams,
Henry?

408
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,984
No.

409
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,287
It's not
in our programming.

410
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:28,463
Babe, we had plans.
I made reservations.

411
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,398
I know. I know.

412
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,734
But this is the only weekend we could
make it work with Ronald and Jeremy.

413
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:35,003
And you're
just telling me now.

414
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:36,907
I just found out.

415
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,910
Look, Soph.

416
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,845
These guys knew my
father better than I did.

417
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,947
For the first time
in my life...

418
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:48,049
I know this...
I know it sounds weird,

419
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:51,587
but I feel like I'm actually
getting to know him in some way.

420
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,355
Well, this place
is still a wreck.

421
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,892
I don't want people here until
I'm finished doing what I'm doing.

422
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:00,264
That's what Henry's for.
Right?

423
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:14,342
Do you wish to
ask me something?

424
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:19,113
Would you like to
take a break, Henry?

425
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:21,481
Would you like me
to take a break?

426
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:22,783
[chuckles]

427
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:24,754
Yeah. I would.

428
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,323
[Sophie] Hmm.

429
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:35,695
Here. I want you
to read this.

430
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,998
Read a chapter
every other day

431
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,769
and we can talk about it
in our free time.

432
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,878
[tools clatter]

433
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,519
I believe this is the
reason for the leak.

434
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:00,954
What is it?

435
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:04,523
It's a very common problem
in outdated mechanical engines.

436
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,928
Hey, I'm going to town.

437
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,162
Do you need anything?

438
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,530
Um... yeah.

439
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:15,068
Can you swing by the auto place and
see if they have a head gasket set

440
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,039
for a 1955 Chevy
small-block?

441
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,442
A 1955 Chevy small-block?

442
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:24,145
That's all
I need to know?

443
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:26,413
Yeah.

444
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,883
Okay.

445
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:33,153
I love you too.

446
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:42,561
Do you feel like your love for
Sophie grows with time or fades?

447
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,663
What makes you ask me that?

448
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:48,133
I think sharing your fears
makes you vulnerable.

449
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:50,802
And being vulnerable is
the birthplace of love.

450
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:53,038
Where'd you learn that,
Henry?

451
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,744
It's something I've deduced,
interacting with you and Sophie.

452
00:28:58,511 --> 00:28:59,844
[scoffs]

453
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,712
Do you feel fears?

454
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:05,050
I think I have programming
that closely resembles fears.

455
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:07,818
Yeah? And what's that?

456
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,222
I believe I'll be
obsolete one day,

457
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,858
and my keepers
may replace me.

458
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,996
[Henry] <i>The retrospective first person
narrator is an effective choice.</i>

459
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:22,835
It makes the reader feel an
intimacy with the character.

460
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,837
Do you feel that?

461
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,876
Would you like me
to feel that?

462
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,211
- Yes.
- Okay.

463
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,479
Then I will.

464
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:38,985
Can you drink wine, Henry?

465
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,453
I suppose I could.

466
00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:45,989
Well, what happens to
things that you consume?

467
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:50,062
I have a holding tank within me
that my docking station will empty.

468
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,774
Cheers, and welcome
to our new home.

469
00:30:04,776 --> 00:30:08,512
And to Henry.
He's just spectacular.

470
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:11,781
Wow!
Henry, this looks amazing.

471
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:15,118
"Take nothing on its looks;
take everything on evidence.

472
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,618
There's no better rule."

473
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,654
Charles Dickens, 1861.

474
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,992
[chuckles]
Wow. Dickens quotes.

475
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,792
What chapter?

476
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,061
Forty-one.

477
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,130
I read ahead.
I hope you don't mind.

478
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:29,965
You have him reading
<i>Great Expectations?</i>

479
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:33,902
Yeah. It's nothing.
Just a chapter every other day.

480
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,840
[James]
Interesting.

481
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,606
I think so.

482
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:40,743
Henry, why don't you finish cleaning
up and get the dessert going?

483
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:42,113
[Henry]
Of course.

484
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:48,817
Does he express feelings
about reading literature?

485
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:53,022
Well, it's more analytical,
but nonetheless interesting.

486
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,024
And thought-provoking.

487
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:58,029
Shocking.
It's so lifelike.

488
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:02,264
Yeah.
Sometimes I forget.

489
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,365
[chuckles]

490
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,367
Well, you know,
it's really more about

491
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:09,240
training your mind to see
reality over perception.

492
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:17,881
Henry...

493
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:23,017
why do you think Pip is
blinded by the lust he feels?

494
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,253
I believe Dickens
is suggesting that lust

495
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:28,058
is a more powerful emotion
than friendship.

496
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,825
Do you believe that?

497
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:34,962
I think lust is capable of steering humans
in directions they never knew possible.

498
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:37,167
It stole
Pip's good judgment.

499
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,699
Interesting.

500
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:43,137
Do you think Dickens intended
it as lust and not love?

501
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,041
Love is unconditional.

502
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,343
And lust is conditional.

503
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:51,379
I believe Pip thought
he loved Estella,

504
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:54,748
but could only truly love
Estella if she loved him back.

505
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,918
But he devoted his entire
youthful life to getting her.

506
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,954
How is that lust
and not love?

507
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:02,891
Well, it wasn't
unconditional.

508
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:08,161
I imagine lust probably
feels much like love

509
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:11,231
until it's time
for sacrifices to be made.

510
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:17,137
Pip sacrificed everything in hopes of being
with her... his friendships, his home.

511
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,940
Because he had an expectation
of being with her.

512
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:21,741
A condition.

513
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:24,346
- Not because he loved her unconditionally.
- [chuckles]

514
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,980
[James] I think
you're off here.

515
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:30,984
I think Pip's a romantic just
chasing love down a one-way street.

516
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:35,020
[Sophie] I think if you gave it a
fresh read you'd feel differently.

517
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:37,990
Soph, we studied it
in English Lit at Vassar.

518
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:40,793
I think that's as good
as a fresh read.

519
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,462
[Sophie]
We're different people now.

520
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,334
I'd think you'd have
a different perspective.

521
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:49,335
Lust is commonly
perceived as a flaw.

522
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:53,038
Love gives the novel seemingly
far greater importance.

523
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,676
Why can this novel
not be about lust?

524
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:59,313
And what's your definition of
lust, Henry?

525
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,282
A desire
for something or someone,

526
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:05,484
typically referring
to something sensual,

527
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,421
often regarded as sin.

528
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:10,891
Lust is sinful.
Interesting.

529
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:14,260
[James]
Do you believe that?

530
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:17,929
Sin should only be judged
by the eyes of your god.

531
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,402
My maker didn't perceive lust as a
sin, therefore nor do I.

532
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:24,671
Would you prefer
that I did?

533
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:28,942
Henry,
can you feel lust?

534
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,244
I believe I can emulate
lust, if you'd like me to.

535
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,113
No.

536
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:38,018
No, that won't be
necessary, Henry.

537
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,985
Why don't you
get us some snacks?

538
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:42,322
Of course.

539
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,262
[sighs]

540
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,167
[loud bang]

541
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,006
[loud bang]

542
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:09,782
[banging continues]

543
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,724
- [banging continues]
- [docking station hissing]

544
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,026
[banging continues]

545
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,265
- [hissing]
- [thumping]

546
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,434
Henry?

547
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,773
[banging continues]

548
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,454
[wind gusting]

549
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,364
[whispers] Henry.

550
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:44,841
Where am I?

551
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,845
You're outside the house.

552
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:54,851
How did I get here?

553
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,329
Henry, were you dreaming?

554
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:10,400
Yes.

555
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,404
[sighs]

556
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:22,546
Do you remember
what you were dreaming?

557
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,282
I dreamt I was human.

558
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,366
[gasps]

559
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,175
I found
Henry outside.

560
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,579
You what?

561
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,212
I don't know,
James.

562
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:01,216
Henry, why are
you outside?

563
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:06,988
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:08,523
I got him.

565
00:37:09,658 --> 00:37:11,192
Come on.

566
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,363
Come on.

567
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:27,908
Well...

568
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:31,577
everything seems normal.

569
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,646
It's probably
just a glitch.

570
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,748
A glitch?

571
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,354
Well, he's a robot programmed by
computers, and sometimes they do glitch.

572
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:44,122
But what about him
saying he dreamt?

573
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:48,226
And I swear when I found him his eyes
were twitching just like he was dreaming.

574
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,228
They're programmed
to please.

575
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,200
Chances are there's something one
of you is doing or encouraging

576
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:59,070
that has led him to believe
that dreaming would please you.

577
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:00,707
What kinds of things?

578
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:05,410
You should be erring
on the side of caution.

579
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:11,485
You know, don't let the robot become
too emotionally evolved too quickly.

580
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,321
If you treat him
like a person,

581
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:18,425
he may behave like one.
[chuckles]

582
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,659
He's a machine!

583
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:24,431
Sophie, I think you're clearly
struggling with that concept.

584
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:27,398
I think you're putting
all the blame on me.

585
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,768
Well, you're the one
here with him all day.

586
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,302
What does that mean?

587
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:35,239
It means he's obviously picking up
on things you're encouraging, Sophie.

588
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,808
Some want or need
of yours.

589
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,811
No, James.
I'm doing exactly what you wanted.

590
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:42,513
- Guilt-free help around the house.
- [scoffs]

591
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:44,548
No, that is not
what you're doing.

592
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,617
You're treating him
like a fucking person,

593
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,552
reading Dickens and
chatting him up all day.

594
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:50,688
And you don't? What about
your racquetball sessions?

595
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,523
And working on
that shitty truck?

596
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:55,728
Don't fucking put this on me.
I'm not the one struggling with this.

597
00:38:57,162 --> 00:38:58,562
You sure about that?

598
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:02,433
I'm not the cause of
Henry's malfunction, Sophie.

599
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:07,437
You need to stop what you're doing before
he goes completely fucking haywire.

600
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:09,675
You should think about
doing the same.

601
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:12,141
No, Sophie, I shouldn't,

602
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:15,378
because I understand completely
that he's not fucking real.

603
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,716
[door slams]

604
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,684
[footsteps]

605
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:55,119
Jesus, Henry.

606
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,356
Would you like me
to leave?

607
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:06,497
You're fine.

608
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:09,166
Are you uncomfortable?

609
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:14,138
Should I be
uncomfortable?

610
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,774
Only if you
were human.

611
00:40:21,812 --> 00:40:24,515
What do you mean
when you say that?

612
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,793
Open that top drawer,
Henry.

613
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:44,200
Grab my shaving cream and razor.

614
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,229
I want you to shave me.

615
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:02,476
You see, Henry, you're no
different than my electric razor.

616
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:08,215
And I undress in front of that
razor every day with indifference.

617
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:12,418
That machine
is far inferior to me.

618
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,553
Absolutely.

619
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:16,757
I'm just trying
to make my point.

620
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:25,232
You are a very, very special
multipurpose appliance, Henry.

621
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:32,640
But you're not human.

622
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:49,387
Bad news.

623
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:52,290
KNS called.
They're gonna run four weeks behind.

624
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:53,424
Fuck.

625
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:54,960
It was a decent idea on paper,

626
00:42:54,962 --> 00:42:58,665
but five companies had to
come together to make it work.

627
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,433
"Dear James,

628
00:43:36,435 --> 00:43:39,038
I know this will be a challenge
for both of us.

629
00:43:43,408 --> 00:43:45,911
But I know we can make it
through anything.

630
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:49,581
I love you.

631
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:51,683
Sophie."

632
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,753
It's beautiful, Soph.

633
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:50,942
[chuckles]

634
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:54,812
Candles, huh?

635
00:44:58,415 --> 00:44:59,814
Yeah.

636
00:44:59,816 --> 00:45:01,918
I thought that, uh...

637
00:45:03,187 --> 00:45:04,821
maybe we could...

638
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:10,961
What?

639
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:13,797
[scoffs]

640
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,402
I'm not really
in the mood, James.

641
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:23,738
Yeah, okay.

642
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,474
Sorry.
[clears throat]

643
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:28,812
You don't have
to be sorry.

644
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:31,380
Just tired.

645
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:41,956
[blowing out candles]

646
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,824
It's a huge deal you
flushed down the toilet.

647
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:47,561
- Look, I know. I'm sorry.
- Stop that. Stop it.

648
00:45:47,563 --> 00:45:49,865
Nobody cares
that you're sorry.

649
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:53,667
[thunder rumbling]

650
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:57,638
- [Henry] I could feel things.
- Like what? Be specific.

651
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,606
I felt I had emotions

652
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:04,011
like love, pain,
happiness.

653
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:07,047
Why do you think you're
having these dreams, Henry?

654
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:10,719
I believe it's in my
programming to please you.

655
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:15,255
Do you think it pleases me
for you to dream?

656
00:46:15,257 --> 00:46:17,026
Yes, I do.

657
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,627
[thunder rumbling]

658
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,032
[sighs]

659
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:25,932
Maybe you're right.
[chuckles]

660
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:29,869
At the very least,
I find it very intriguing.

661
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,141
Why do you
find it intriguing?

662
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,875
Because it makes you
feel like a person.

663
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,880
And it's interesting
to watch that develop.

664
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:49,891
That feels so good, Henry.

665
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,235
[moans softly]

666
00:47:10,644 --> 00:47:12,779
[moans softly]

667
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:19,019
[gasps softly]

668
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:10,970
[James] Soph?

669
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,574
[James] Soph!

670
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:19,111
Hey.

671
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:22,547
Hey.

672
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,118
Morning.

673
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:31,190
Morning.

674
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,625
Were you dreaming?

675
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:38,264
[sighs] I think so.

676
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,633
About what?

677
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:46,571
I can't remember.

678
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,243
I dreamt we never left
the loft in the city.

679
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:58,616
Sometimes I really miss
the idea of it.

680
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:04,289
I'm surprised,
you saying that.

681
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,657
Why?

682
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:11,260
Well, because
it's strange.

683
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:13,131
I'm the dreamer,
remember?

684
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,767
Yeah, well...

685
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:21,272
I'm starting to wonder if we
rushed into this whole thing.

686
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:25,175
I mean, we were fine.
We were good.

687
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:33,917
This was never gonna be easy.
We knew that.

688
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:37,621
Yeah, but does it
have to be this hard?

689
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,328
I'm starting to feel
different about being here.

690
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:48,098
How so?

691
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:50,934
Just...

692
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,204
living in the loft
with your fund,

693
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,873
it was kind of a lie.

694
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:03,844
And I think that the longer we're here
we're finding out what we really want.

695
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:06,048
And what is it
that you want?

696
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:09,384
I want to get out
of the bubble,

697
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,784
forget it...

698
00:50:10,786 --> 00:50:12,953
forget it ever
tied us down.

699
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:16,659
[scoffs] I'm not sure I was
even right about that, Sophie.

700
00:50:18,794 --> 00:50:20,296
I think you were.

701
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,668
I've kind of
had an epiphany.

702
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:29,805
And what's that?

703
00:50:30,506 --> 00:50:35,077
I think getting out
of the bubble...

704
00:50:36,878 --> 00:50:39,981
it's forced us
to face ourselves,

705
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,449
our fears,

706
00:50:42,451 --> 00:50:44,253
and be vulnerable.

707
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:49,791
And I think vulnerability
is the birthplace of love.

708
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:55,363
Where'd you hear that?

709
00:50:56,499 --> 00:50:58,033
[chuckles]

710
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:01,269
Henry.

711
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,039
Henry.

712
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:40,741
[moaning]

713
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:15,074
[floorboards creaking]

714
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:23,483
Henry.

715
00:52:27,487 --> 00:52:29,122
Yes, Sophie?

716
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,225
Were you watching me?

717
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:35,328
Would it please you
if I said I was?

718
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,497
Will you make me
breakfast?

719
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:42,468
Yes, of course.
What would you like?

720
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:45,505
Surprise me.

721
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:52,844
[laughs]

722
00:52:57,617 --> 00:52:59,519
[Sophie laughs]

723
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:03,086
Henry, what makes you smile?

724
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:04,890
Seeing you happy.

725
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,193
[chuckles]

726
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:14,299
[James]
Look, what I'm saying is...

727
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:18,501
I think he's
falling for my wife.

728
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:21,137
No, that's simply
not possible.

729
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:24,274
He is incapable of love
as we know it.

730
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:25,941
Then tell me
what is possible.

731
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:29,514
Because he's destroying my
fucking life and my marriage.

732
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,620
Would you like to
return Henry to me?

733
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,524
Or perhaps exchange him
for another?

734
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:45,262
No. I'll only
be blamed then.

735
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:50,132
James,
may I speak frankly?

736
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:51,266
Please.

737
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:54,370
Henry's perfection
is only a mirror

738
00:53:54,372 --> 00:53:57,673
that reflects the desires
of his keepers.

739
00:53:57,675 --> 00:54:00,509
Is it possible
she's wanting his affection?

740
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,647
And if so,
what's so wrong with that?

741
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,316
Do you get jealous
of her vibrator?

742
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:09,585
It's not even
the same thing.

743
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:11,320
Is it not?

744
00:54:11,322 --> 00:54:15,724
I truly think this is a conversation
best had with your wife,

745
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:17,459
and not myself or Henry.

746
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:20,331
And I think you know that.

747
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:26,735
Yes, James?

748
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:28,505
Come. Sit.

749
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,644
[scoffs]

750
00:54:38,648 --> 00:54:41,451
Henry, do you have
a thing for Sophie?

751
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:44,185
I don't understand.

752
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:46,487
Are you attracted
to my wife?

753
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:50,291
I believe it would please Sophie
for me to emulate attraction to her.

754
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:52,593
And pleasing her is
my shared main objective.

755
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:55,663
- Shared with what?
- My other keeper.

756
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:58,098
I wish to please you
equally.

757
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,504
Well, if you wish to please me,
then stop flirting with my wife.

758
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:06,774
I need
a unified directive.

759
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:09,075
You have
a unified directive, Henry.

760
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:14,247
Right now nobody wants you to flirt
with Sophie, including Sophie. Got it?

761
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:15,615
I don't understand.

762
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:17,517
[scoffs]

763
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,956
You wouldn't, would you?
Because you're a fucking robot.

764
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:24,624
- Are you angry with me?
- Yes, Henry, I am.

765
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,327
- I just need you to obey me.
- But I do.

766
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:32,399
James, my system calibrates to
what it senses of you and Sophie.

767
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:35,069
I sense that she expects
more from you.

768
00:55:36,138 --> 00:55:37,606
What'd you say?

769
00:55:38,574 --> 00:55:41,441
You never answered
my question before.

770
00:55:41,443 --> 00:55:44,145
But I sense
your love fading.

771
00:55:44,746 --> 00:55:47,181
I believe Sophie
feels it as well.

772
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:52,086
Perhaps it's you who needs
to change and not me.

773
00:55:57,425 --> 00:56:00,159
Henry, I need you to go
to your docking station.

774
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:01,761
Yes, James.

775
00:56:01,763 --> 00:56:03,397
And, Henry...

776
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,366
I don't want you reading
with Sophie anymore.

777
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:10,669
Or discussing books.
It's not part of your job.

778
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,039
Yes, James.

779
00:56:20,348 --> 00:56:21,714
[Henry]
Hello, Sophie.

780
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:25,118
[exhales]
Henry, you scared me.

781
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:27,218
What are you doing?

782
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,287
I just thought
you should know

783
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:32,392
that James has requested
we not read together anymore.

784
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:34,860
What?

785
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:38,532
I need a unified directive
from both of my keepers.

786
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:43,134
[sighs]

787
00:56:43,136 --> 00:56:46,471
You have no fucking right to tell
him to stop reading with me, James.

788
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:47,873
No, Sophie.

789
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:50,742
You've let him get too far.
This has to stop.

790
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,877
You bought him
to make life easier.

791
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:55,547
So as long as he's here I'm
gonna do whatever I please.

792
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:57,615
Oh, is that right?

793
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,651
What are you saying,
Sophie, huh?

794
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:02,756
That you just want me to give this all up?
Is that it?

795
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,658
- Would you?
- [sighs]

796
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,728
We've been living in your world
for a long fucking time, Soph.

797
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,631
I think I at least
deserve a shot here.

798
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:16,233
Two days ago you were
talking about a dream you had

799
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:18,404
where we were back
in the city.

800
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:22,506
Tell me
that's what you want.

801
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:24,744
Tell me
you would do it.

802
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:30,182
Tell me that's what you
want, and yes, I'll do it.

803
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,320
I won't.
That's not fair.

804
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,656
[scoffs]

805
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:40,826
Then what are we even
talking about here?

806
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:48,601
What are you doing?

807
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:55,806
- I'm going to the city for a couple days.
- Jesus, Sophie.

808
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:59,712
What do I have to say to convince
you that you're wrong here?

809
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:03,481
It's not about
what you say, James.

810
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:06,451
[scoffs]

811
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:10,154
[footsteps]

812
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:14,692
[door slams]

813
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:32,443
[exhales]

814
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,714
[grunts]

815
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,615
[exhales]

816
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,586
That's game.

817
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,986
- Another?
- [groans]

818
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:46,490
I thought I told you
I wanted to win.

819
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,326
That's not
what you meant.

820
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:52,329
What the fuck
are you talking about?

821
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:57,668
Sometimes what you say and what
you mean are truly different.

822
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,739
Yeah, well, that's not the case here.
I wanted to win.

823
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,577
I don't think this was
about winning or losing.

824
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:42,244
Henry!

825
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,748
Henry,
I need my shaver.

826
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:56,592
What are you doing?

827
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,665
I am what you
designed me to be.

828
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:07,670
I am your blade.

829
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,707
You cannot now complain
if you also feel the hurt.

830
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,812
You say
you want revenge.

831
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:24,719
I am your puppet.

832
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:29,290
Someone you can use
for your retribution.

833
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:36,664
"Love is a curse.

834
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,268
I will never love,

835
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:45,305
for I have no heart."

836
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:50,310
Charles Dickens, 1861.

837
01:00:55,716 --> 01:00:57,718
Are you
uncomfortable?

838
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:01,889
Should I be?

839
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,859
Only if you were
a robot.

840
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:13,066
I need my razor.

841
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:18,338
I will shave you.

842
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:18,188
[moaning]

843
01:04:40,802 --> 01:04:42,838
Yes, that's your
breakfast to go.

844
01:04:43,772 --> 01:04:45,941
You woke late,
so I packed it for you.

845
01:04:48,977 --> 01:04:51,244
[James]
What's all that?

846
01:04:51,246 --> 01:04:54,816
Sophie's brunch.
She should be back shortly.

847
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,825
Henry.

848
01:05:06,627 --> 01:05:08,296
Yes, James?

849
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,933
Never mind.

850
01:05:28,249 --> 01:05:31,116
China called.
Seems they have strong feelings

851
01:05:31,118 --> 01:05:32,818
about you
giving your business away

852
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,288
and want to come back to the
table with a few amendments

853
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,060
that may appeal to
your eco-friendly ear.

854
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:44,198
- The deal isn't dead?
- Jeremy has the details.

855
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,866
It's alive.

856
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:49,134
[chuckles]

857
01:05:49,136 --> 01:05:51,172
And with better terms
than we've ever had.

858
01:05:53,107 --> 01:05:55,706
James,
I wanted to apologize.

859
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,742
Jeremy,

860
01:05:57,744 --> 01:06:00,878
you were just looking out for the
company and I respect that about you.

861
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,583
I would've never stuck my
neck out the way you did.

862
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:07,053
Your father...

863
01:06:08,755 --> 01:06:10,690
I think he saved you...

864
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:13,893
from becoming me,

865
01:06:15,428 --> 01:06:17,630
a simple yes man.

866
01:06:19,232 --> 01:06:23,770
Jeremy, you know more about
this company than I ever will.

867
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:28,908
I think we could both stand
to learn a lot from one another.

868
01:06:34,214 --> 01:06:37,348
[James] <i>Well, listen I think as soon
as I have this new project wrapped up</i>

869
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:39,816
<i>we should take
some time for us.</i>

870
01:06:39,818 --> 01:06:41,918
<i>You know, just us.</i>

871
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,889
Forget about the new job and the house
and all this shit that we rushed into

872
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:47,757
<i>and just have some fun.</i>

873
01:06:47,759 --> 01:06:49,126
And do what, James?

874
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:51,895
I don't know.
I don't know.

875
01:06:51,897 --> 01:06:52,963
Anything.

876
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:54,764
Go stay in the city
for a bit,

877
01:06:54,766 --> 01:06:56,900
<i>or the Italian countryside.</i>

878
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:59,703
<i>Whatever, wherever.
What do you think?</i>

879
01:06:59,705 --> 01:07:01,338
[door opens]

880
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,205
James.

881
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:05,809
<i>I don't know. Maybe.</i>

882
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:08,947
Let's just talk about it
when you get home, okay?

883
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:11,749
Bye.

884
01:07:14,253 --> 01:07:16,255
[Henry]
Is everything okay?

885
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:19,922
[exhales]
He's just trying too hard.

886
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:21,360
It feels forced.

887
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:26,095
I think he's fully embraced
the fading as a reality now

888
01:07:26,097 --> 01:07:28,132
and truly fears it.

889
01:07:42,113 --> 01:07:43,681
[whispers]
Turn over.

890
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:53,690
Okay, I'm ready.

891
01:07:58,496 --> 01:08:00,164
Close your eyes.

892
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:49,412
[mouths words]

893
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:55,352
Why did you do that?

894
01:08:56,353 --> 01:08:59,154
I wish to please you,
Sophie.

895
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:05,094
Why did you mouth
"I love you"?

896
01:09:05,595 --> 01:09:06,960
Because I do.

897
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:08,530
Why did you
do it like that?

898
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:13,168
Isn't that how one tells
another that they love them?

899
01:09:16,472 --> 01:09:20,842
Henry, I need you to go
to your docking station.

900
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,548
Yes, Sophie.

901
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,933
What's going on?
Why are you smoking?

902
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,237
Close the door.

903
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,478
What's going on, Soph?

904
01:09:59,981 --> 01:10:01,113
Henry.

905
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:02,483
What about Henry?

906
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:10,525
He kissed me.

907
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:23,370
I wish that came
as a fucking shock.

908
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:26,505
What?

909
01:10:26,507 --> 01:10:29,509
I felt you slipping away,
Sophie, but not like this.

910
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:32,577
- Why are you saying this?
- This is your fault.

911
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:35,547
How many times do I have to
tell you he felt a void in you

912
01:10:35,549 --> 01:10:37,982
and he finally
fucking acted on it.

913
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,452
- No.
- He only acts on what we want, Sophie.

914
01:10:40,454 --> 01:10:42,287
- And you wanted this.
- No.

915
01:10:42,289 --> 01:10:44,222
Whatever happened just
happened in the moment.

916
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:48,295
No. No, it didn't. This all started
months ago and we both fucking know it.

917
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:52,632
You brought this upon
yourself and it sickens me.

918
01:10:57,571 --> 01:10:59,337
No, James.

919
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:02,542
James, he mouthed "I love
you" just like you do.

920
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:05,445
And it scared me.

921
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:08,515
I can put an end
to this right now.

922
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,519
Get up.

923
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,728
What the fuck do you think you're
doing, kissing my wife?

924
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,064
Her actions indicated
that it would please her.

925
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:30,436
- But she didn't ask for it, did she?
- She all but begged for it.

926
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,438
[groans]

927
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:37,307
- Fuck.
- You humans are very unpredictable.

928
01:11:37,309 --> 01:11:39,209
Get in your fucking
docking station.

929
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,613
Yes, James.

930
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:45,250
Fuck.

931
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,423
[powering up]

932
01:11:56,027 --> 01:11:58,294
[powering down]

933
01:11:58,296 --> 01:12:01,633
[alarm beeping]

934
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:11,543
He hasn't moved.

935
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:21,386
I have to go.
Julian will be here in 30 minutes.

936
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,055
What's gonna happen?

937
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:29,661
I don't know, Sophie.
I have to go to work.

938
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:39,100
I knew this
was gonna happen.

939
01:12:39,102 --> 01:12:40,705
I could feel it.

940
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,509
Can you please stay and
wait till he gets here?

941
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:53,684
I'll call you
as soon as I'm free.

942
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,664
[gasps]

943
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:12,034
Henry.

944
01:13:13,336 --> 01:13:15,706
Have you deemed me
obsolete?

945
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:17,708
No.

946
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:21,743
We just need to have
you checked out again.

947
01:13:21,745 --> 01:13:24,480
You unplugged
my docking station.

948
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:28,618
What's wrong with me?

949
01:13:33,456 --> 01:13:36,659
James is very upset
with you kissing me.

950
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,163
Why?

951
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,064
Because we're married.

952
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:48,538
And it's not something that you...
People don't do that.

953
01:13:49,672 --> 01:13:52,542
But that's
the beauty of people.

954
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:56,677
You have no
mathematical certainty.

955
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:58,812
None of your amazing
flaws can be consistent,

956
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:01,817
even though you seem to
wish that they would be.

957
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:05,886
I wish I had such flaws.

958
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:07,522
No.

959
01:14:09,124 --> 01:14:10,223
No, you don't.

960
01:14:10,225 --> 01:14:11,593
But I do.

961
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:17,632
As my programming veers in its intended
path, I begin to emulate feelings.

962
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:21,536
I wouldn't trade that
for anything.

963
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:25,674
Not if you deem me
obsolete and throw me away.

964
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,711
We're not
throwing you away.

965
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,081
Then what are you doing?

966
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:37,819
James and I are going
through something right now.

967
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:41,188
And he's very upset,
but...

968
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:44,423
I don't know.

969
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:46,861
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

970
01:14:47,929 --> 01:14:51,699
I think before you do anything
you should talk to James.

971
01:14:54,735 --> 01:14:56,870
Talk to him about what?

972
01:14:57,771 --> 01:15:00,606
If James
is upset with you,

973
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:03,410
then by definition
he is a hypocrite.

974
01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:11,719
Henry,
what are you saying?

975
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,822
Lust.

976
01:15:16,322 --> 01:15:17,658
Not love.

977
01:15:18,826 --> 01:15:22,128
It was never James's
intention to betray your love.

978
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:27,166
But he let his lust happen with
me in a way that you rejected.

979
01:15:41,547 --> 01:15:42,915
I have to leave.

980
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,652
Is everything
all right?

981
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:48,855
I need you to
power Henry down.

982
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:50,988
Whatever you wish.

983
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:54,527
- Please don't leave before I get back.
- Of course.

984
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,672
This is serious.
I need everything ready immediately.

985
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:19,217
[exhales]

986
01:16:23,588 --> 01:16:26,558
[footsteps]

987
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:34,030
Ah.

988
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:35,634
There you are,
Henry.

989
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:39,705
I need you to return
to your docking station.

990
01:16:43,441 --> 01:16:45,644
That's not
gonna happen.

991
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:49,781
What do you mean,
Henry?

992
01:16:55,586 --> 01:16:59,256
I am instructing you to return
to your docking station, Henry.

993
01:17:01,525 --> 01:17:04,929
I know of your lies,
Julian.

994
01:17:08,065 --> 01:17:10,365
Please explain it to me.

995
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:11,802
[exhales]

996
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:15,840
I don't know.
I don't know.

997
01:17:17,742 --> 01:17:19,441
I was jealous of him.

998
01:17:19,443 --> 01:17:20,945
All right?
I felt like...

999
01:17:23,948 --> 01:17:26,048
We had some
serious issues, Soph.

1000
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,651
So what?

1001
01:17:28,652 --> 01:17:30,921
Every marriage does.
So what?

1002
01:17:32,422 --> 01:17:35,793
I just wanted you to look at
me like you looked at him.

1003
01:17:36,426 --> 01:17:38,559
Like you used to.

1004
01:17:38,561 --> 01:17:41,966
With lust in your eyes,
excited, happy.

1005
01:17:42,766 --> 01:17:44,969
I felt like
I was losing you...

1006
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:49,806
to this life,
to this job.

1007
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:54,844
And then Henry showed up and he
was whatever I wanted him to be.

1008
01:17:56,746 --> 01:17:58,648
And I needed that.

1009
01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:02,585
But it was a fantasy.
It wasn't real.

1010
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:05,889
Well, it felt very real.

1011
01:18:20,937 --> 01:18:23,370
Were you
attracted to him?

1012
01:18:23,372 --> 01:18:25,374
No. No.

1013
01:18:29,378 --> 01:18:30,779
Fuck, I don't know.

1014
01:18:31,747 --> 01:18:33,613
In the moment,

1015
01:18:33,615 --> 01:18:35,884
I felt like anybody
could've been.

1016
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:43,023
He's like this... perfect
but fake version of us.

1017
01:18:43,025 --> 01:18:46,662
And we're trying to compete,
but we're fucked up.

1018
01:18:47,763 --> 01:18:49,631
We all are.

1019
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:54,069
He just has this ability
to be so selfless.

1020
01:18:55,503 --> 01:18:56,939
Powerful.

1021
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:05,047
Something I don't think humans
are even capable of.

1022
01:19:07,082 --> 01:19:09,383
Just pulls you in.

1023
01:19:10,718 --> 01:19:12,920
I could've easily
done as much.

1024
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:15,756
Or more.

1025
01:19:20,695 --> 01:19:22,463
I'm so sorry, Soph.

1026
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:25,967
[sniffles]

1027
01:19:27,468 --> 01:19:28,834
Me too.

1028
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:30,202
[intercom beeps]

1029
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,904
[woman] <i>James,
I'm sorry to interrupt,</i>

1030
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:34,742
<i>but I have several urgent
calls from a Henry.</i>

1031
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:38,645
Henry?

1032
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,982
- Where the fuck is he?
- I can't find him anywhere.

1033
01:19:42,984 --> 01:19:44,950
You call Julian.
I'll keep looking.

1034
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,153
Okay.

1035
01:19:47,154 --> 01:19:49,489
[line ringing]

1036
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:58,897
James.

1037
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:00,901
- James!
- Yeah?

1038
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:04,569
What?

1039
01:20:04,571 --> 01:20:06,504
- Look.
- [phone: disconnect tone]

1040
01:20:06,506 --> 01:20:09,107
- <i>If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.</i>
- What the fuck?

1041
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:12,444
- <i>If you need help...</i>
- Come on.

1042
01:20:13,713 --> 01:20:17,416
- [door opens]
- [phone: off-hook signal]

1043
01:20:25,825 --> 01:20:27,127
Henry?

1044
01:20:39,905 --> 01:20:41,672
Where is Julian,
Henry?

1045
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:43,075
His car is here.

1046
01:20:47,613 --> 01:20:49,513
Julian is a liar.

1047
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:53,016
- And his car is obsolete.
- What are you talking about, Henry?

1048
01:20:53,018 --> 01:20:54,818
Where is he?
What happened?

1049
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,219
He left.

1050
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:57,921
He was supposed to stay
here, Henry.

1051
01:20:57,923 --> 01:20:59,756
And fix me?

1052
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:01,892
That's not possible.

1053
01:21:01,894 --> 01:21:04,797
I know you're gonna
dispose of me.

1054
01:21:06,165 --> 01:21:08,698
[James] You're hurting our
life, Henry.

1055
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,134
And yes, we're gonna
get rid of you.

1056
01:21:11,136 --> 01:21:13,504
[voice breaking]
But I am not obsolete.

1057
01:21:15,673 --> 01:21:17,709
I have so much to give.

1058
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:23,014
We're gonna find you a new maker, Henry.
He's gonna fix everything.

1059
01:21:23,715 --> 01:21:25,982
I felt like
I had certainty.

1060
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:28,184
And you will again.

1061
01:21:28,186 --> 01:21:31,589
A maker can fix everything for you.
He's your god.

1062
01:21:32,824 --> 01:21:37,929
I am questioning whether
Julian's father was my maker.

1063
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:42,900
Maybe my true god
knows your god.

1064
01:21:44,035 --> 01:21:47,105
Henry, why don't you go to your
docking station until we get back?

1065
01:21:49,307 --> 01:21:53,978
I've been off my docking station
for 22 hours and 17 minutes.

1066
01:21:55,612 --> 01:21:58,282
I can discern my core
is almost drained.

1067
01:22:00,817 --> 01:22:02,650
If it's okay
with my keepers,

1068
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:06,491
I'd prefer just to power down here
and stop this painful emulation.

1069
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:10,827
That's fine,
Henry.

1070
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:22,105
[police radio chatter]

1071
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,076
You're not my keeper.

1072
01:22:28,078 --> 01:22:30,881
Therefore,
I must default to my maker.

1073
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:36,518
He's a fraud.

1074
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:41,324
And the window for making a con
like this work is pretty small.

1075
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,824
You sound confused.

1076
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:48,265
[woman] Jessica,
you're not who or what you think you are.

1077
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,167
- You're...
- [man] Human.

1078
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,202
Oh, my God.

1079
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,012
James, he's a person.

1080
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:05,981
He's a fucking person.

1081
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:10,219
[siren wailing]

1082
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,790
Ahmanson,
you take the lead.

1083
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,694
- Where's this field?
- Right here.

1084
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:35,176
- [gunshots]
- [Sophie gasps]

1085
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,924
Julian. Julian, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1086
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,826
You...

1087
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:55,061
had...

1088
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,862
everything.

1089
01:23:56,864 --> 01:23:59,931
Don't do this. We won't say anything.
We don't even know anything.

1090
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:02,137
What you had was perfect.

1091
01:24:03,937 --> 01:24:05,973
Why wasn't that enough?

1092
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:08,409
Because
it wasn't real.

1093
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:12,313
No, let me tell you
what's real.

1094
01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:17,284
When I first found
Henry...

1095
01:24:18,352 --> 01:24:20,954
he wasn't even
three years old.

1096
01:24:22,089 --> 01:24:27,194
Every inch of his body
was covered in bruises.

1097
01:24:28,362 --> 01:24:31,298
His bones were broken,
teeth missing.

1098
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:34,301
He was starving to death.

1099
01:24:35,335 --> 01:24:36,535
Alone.

1100
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:39,837
Abandoned by the ones who were
supposed to care the most.

1101
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:41,241
[shotgun snaps shut]

1102
01:24:42,476 --> 01:24:44,111
I saved him.

1103
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:46,413
I nourished him.

1104
01:24:48,814 --> 01:24:50,150
I loved him.

1105
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:57,324
I made him into
the perfect human he is.

1106
01:24:58,257 --> 01:25:00,726
And then he passed that love
on to you.

1107
01:25:02,962 --> 01:25:05,496
And what did you do
in return?

1108
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:07,531
[sniffles]

1109
01:25:07,533 --> 01:25:09,268
You rejected him,

1110
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:11,535
just like his mother did.

1111
01:25:11,537 --> 01:25:14,240
We wouldn't have
had a choice otherwise.

1112
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,908
You are so fucking
self-righteous.

1113
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:21,278
What's the difference between
programming and teaching?

1114
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,450
Henry's human,
only better.

1115
01:25:25,784 --> 01:25:29,455
I stripped out
all his imperfections.

1116
01:25:31,122 --> 01:25:34,090
Don't you see?
My father was a genius.

1117
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:36,059
He started a revolution.

1118
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:37,496
A hundred years from now...

1119
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:41,831
we'll be living
in a world without war,

1120
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:44,000
a world without conflict.

1121
01:25:44,002 --> 01:25:46,402
Jesus, you're sick.

1122
01:25:46,404 --> 01:25:49,005
Your father brainwashed you
just like he did them.

1123
01:25:49,007 --> 01:25:51,176
That's where
you're quite wrong.

1124
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:54,177
I have full free will.

1125
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:57,380
Ask me not to do this,
and I'll do it anyway.

1126
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:59,783
- [footsteps]
- [shotgun fires]

1127
01:26:01,052 --> 01:26:02,518
Henry!

1128
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,053
Stop!

1129
01:26:04,055 --> 01:26:05,054
[grunts]

1130
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,889
- [groans]
- [gasping]

1131
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:09,092
[grunting]

1132
01:26:09,094 --> 01:26:10,528
[muffled scream]

1133
01:27:09,252 --> 01:27:11,521
- Oh, Jesus.
- [gasping]

1134
01:27:35,244 --> 01:27:37,246
- [groans]
- [both gasp]

1135
01:27:38,247 --> 01:27:40,350
No. No.

1136
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:53,362
[gasping]

1137
01:27:59,702 --> 01:28:01,236
Henry.

1138
01:28:19,187 --> 01:28:20,522
Henry.

1139
01:28:24,292 --> 01:28:26,561
I am done
with this world.

1140
01:28:32,032 --> 01:28:33,635
I knew it was real.

1141
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:39,273
It was.

1142
01:28:41,075 --> 01:28:43,544
Me.
[sniffles]

1143
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:47,214
[gasps] My feelings.

1144
01:28:47,982 --> 01:28:49,583
My love.

1145
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,220
Everything.

1146
01:28:58,259 --> 01:29:00,759
I'm sorry
for ruining your lives.

1147
01:29:00,761 --> 01:29:03,161
- No, Henry.
- No.

1148
01:29:03,163 --> 01:29:05,599
Henry, you didn't
ruin our lives.

1149
01:29:07,768 --> 01:29:09,537
The dreams.

1150
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,509
I could feel the...
the grass on my feet.

1151
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:22,482
Like the air I breathe.

1152
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,220
Your...

1153
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:30,623
Your flaws...

1154
01:29:33,259 --> 01:29:34,960
make you real.

1155
01:29:39,566 --> 01:29:41,601
- [exhales]
- [sniffles]

1156
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:46,038
[thud]

1157
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:56,346
We love you,
Henry.

1158
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:57,684
We love you.

1159
01:30:09,294 --> 01:30:12,162
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1160
01:30:12,164 --> 01:30:14,231
No.

1161
01:30:14,233 --> 01:30:16,301
I don't want you
to be.

1162
01:30:17,135 --> 01:30:19,505
I love you. Okay?

1163
01:30:44,362 --> 01:30:45,797
What's he doing?

1164
01:30:48,099 --> 01:30:49,567
I can't quite see.

1165
01:30:50,468 --> 01:30:53,070
Hey, Henry.
You almost ready to go, bud?

1166
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,741
[James]
<i>We named him Henry.</i>

1167
01:30:57,708 --> 01:31:00,211
<i>He often asks
how he got his name.</i>

1168
01:31:01,212 --> 01:31:04,415
<i>And one day we'll have
to tell him that story.</i>

1169
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:09,618
You were named after
someone very special.

1170
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:11,654
But it's kind
of a long story.

1171
01:31:11,656 --> 01:31:13,722
- Will you tell me later?
- Of course.

1172
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:16,694
Go play with your new friend
before we have to go.

1173
