and there is a possibility that a
curfew may be imposed tonight

169
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,162

Now,
I know you're probably still sore at me,

176
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,144
but would you call me back
anyway so I know you got home?

177
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,307
I really don't like what's happening
out there. Now you call me!

MALE NEWSCASTER: The mood of
the mob seems to change by the moment.

179
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,344
There is still a great deal of anger,
but there is also fear.

180
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,049
Looting is widespread

181
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,650
and has been reported at
points across Los Angeles County,

182
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,720
including Compton, South Central
Los Angeles and Westwood Village.

by rampaging vandals.

feel any worse.

But I had to tell
her how it was.

was just lying there.

just taken it.

Can you identify them?

No, no. They were, uh... They were
wearing some kind of ski mask thing.

224

And when I came outside,
they just jumped in the car and took off.

225
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,238
I ran after them, but...

226
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,647
Can you believe it?
I ran after them.

227
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,915
Like I could catch
an eight cylinder car.

do they keep us sitting here?

everything that happened.

They're not doing a damn thing.

Mom is dead, okay?

239
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,139
And we've got a
bunch of brown shoes

240
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,708
who are more interested in
what's going down in South Central

241

than what happened here.

not even second string.

who killed her!

look for the two bastards.

you work with all the time, right?

I do. The best.

and I'll pay for it.

this in the morning? No. I...

Not just negotiating
contracts and stuff like that,

but any problems she had,
she depended on you.

This is the last thing you can do for her,
and the most important.

We've got to make 'em pay.

No, thank you.
I see my party.

Okay. Great.

266
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,461
Hello, Jim.
How are you?

267
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,695
Have any trouble
getting here? Not really.

268
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,895
The riot's a mess, isn't it?

269
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,167
ROCKFORD: Yeah. Big time. But
you'd never know it to look around here.

270
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,730
Business as usual.

271
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,937
Yeah. Thanks for the tie.
You didn't have to wear one.

272
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,105
Well, let's call it
a sense of occasion.

273
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,013
It's good to see you again. How
long has it been? Six months?

274
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,381
More like eight.

275
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,578
Are you limping a little?

276
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,382
No. I'm limping a lot.

277
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,684
What happened?

278
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,886
Oh, a couple of months ago,
uh, some guy thought my car

279
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,395
would look better in his
driveway than it did in mine.

280
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,090
So, he screwed
a .38 in my left ear

281
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,860
and I gave him
my car keys.

282
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,402
As a way of saying
thanks, he shot me.

283
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,164
Oh, Jim.

284
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,297
Well, it's not
without its upside.

285
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,341
I mean, what
I've lost in mobility

286
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,071
I've more than made up
with my ability to predict rain.

287
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:17,879
I'd say the barometer right
now was about 29.95 and steady.

288
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,918
I don't know how you can make
a joke out of something like that.

289
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,044
You could have
been killed.

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,421
Oh, not a chance. The guy was a
lousier shot than he was a driver.

291
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,016
You should see what
he did to the Fire bird.

292
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,652
You know what
a great car that was?

293
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,754
I mean,
he trashed the engine. Just trashed it.

294
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,330
Lila Lansing's car
was stolen last night.

295
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,495
Oh?

296
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,471
Why, well, you've probably
never heard of her.

297
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,568
(LAUGHS) Lila Lansing? She
was married to Mickey Ryder.

298
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,806
I got to see him play once.
Rocky took me to the game.

299
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,645
I'll never forget it. The
man was a legend. Still is.

300
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,212
I'm not here to talk
about Mickey Ryder.

301
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,688
He was out of her life years ago.
I'm here to talk about Lila Lansing.

302
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:00,454
Not just a client of the office,
but also a close, personal friend.

303
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,153
I don't remember
meeting her.

304
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,890
Well, you didn't meet all of my
friends. Did I meet all of yours?

305
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,160
Yeah. All my
close friends.

306
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,701
(CLEARS THROAT) Well...

307
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,964
(STAMMERS) I'm
sorry you never met Lila.

308
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,972
She was killed last night in front of
her house. Her kids heard the shot.

309
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,409
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're devastated, Jim.

310
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:24,144
Dorie never stopped crying. And Josh,
he kept raging about the police, and...

311
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,585
He's convinced that they're not
even gonna try and find the killers.

312
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,143
What?
Oh, because of the riots.

313
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,815
That's why he wants
to hire you,

314
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,654
so that somebody
will be working on it.

315
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,423
Well, that's ridiculous. I mean,
a case involving a major star?

316
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,294
The cops are going to be
falling all over themselves

317
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,526
to solve a headline-grabber
like that.

318
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,967
Well, I know,
but when kids lose a parent,

319
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,766
they're reacting from
emotion, not from logic.

320
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,328
How old are the children?

321
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,603
We're talking about a murder. What
difference does it make how old they are?

322
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,043
Lila Lansing was
a star in the '50s.

323
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,412
Let's say she was 20 something then,
that's 40 years ago.

324
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,041
You keep talking
about the kids

325
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,984
like they just came in from
rolling their hoops on the lawn.

326
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,819
Say I'm interested in the job,
are they old enough to hire me?

327
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,553
You know what,
why don't we just forget the whole thing?

328
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,461
Including breakfast?
I mean, you invited me.

329
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,769
Go ahead and order.

330
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,311
Something heavy
and indigestible.

331
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,882
(SIGHING) What are
you having?

332
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,079
Flashbacks.

333
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,882
Now I remember
why I divorced you.

334
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,375
Josh!

335
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,640
Josh?
What?

336
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,149
(DOORBELL RINGING)

337
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,452
Josh. Sorry if we're
a little late, honey.

338
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,926
This is Jim Rockford, Josh.

339
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,465
Halley says you're
the best Pl in town.

340
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,468
If you're not,
you're out.

341
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,265
I'm not in yet.

342
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,273
You're here. Miss
Kittredge asked me to come.

343
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,333
I have a great deal of respect
for her and for her judgment.

344
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,675
We don't always agree,
but we're in synch on the basics.

345
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,448
That's... That's terrific.

346
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,415
I'm going to use that.

347
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,014
I don't know if Halley mentioned it,
but I'm a writer.

348
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,287
Just been working
on my mom's eulogy.

349
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,761
You're going to use that
in your mother's eulogy?

350
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,594
Yeah. Well, uh,
I'll have to make a couple of changes.

351
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,996
Uh, personalize it?

352
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,267
Josh, Mr. Rockford would like
to talk to you about last night.

353
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,898
Oh, God! How... How many
times do I have to tell it?

354
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,000
(SIGHS) Okay.

355
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,345
Last night Dorie
and I were at home.

356
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,280
Mom had gone out to
dinner with some friends.

357
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,943
We heard a shot,
I ran outside

358
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,388
and Mom had just
opened the gates, and, uh,

359
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,925
was lying there
in the driveway.

360
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,790
The gates aren't electronic?

361
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,920
JOSH: Oh,
yeah. But they were on manual last night.

362
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,022
The motors keep rusting out
from the sprinkler system.

363
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:32,731
Anyways, these two
south-of-the-border types in ski masks

364
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,069
jump in her car and
they're out of here.

365
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,438
Well, if they were
wearing ski masks,

366
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,841
how do you know
they were Latino?

367
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,782
They were talking,
yelling back and forth.

368
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,117
You're sure it was
Spanish they were speaking?

369
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,123
I was born in LA,
Rockford. It was Spanish.

370
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,091
Mr. Rockford, can ...
Can I ask you a question?

371
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,460
If a police officer says that he
may have more questions for you

372
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,158
and yet he doesn't come right out
and say that you can't leave town...

373
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,564
Dorie, we've already
had this conversation.

374
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,400
We had it.
We didn't have it.

375
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,835
KIT: You want to
leave town, Dorie?

376
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,840
She wants to
leave the country.

377
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,171
That is a lie. Look...

378
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,405
Look, my friend, Cindy, has
a house in Cabo San Lucas.

379
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,844
I mean, it's actually
her father's house,

380
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,110
but she has it
for a whole month.

381
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,550
I mean, she asked me
to go weeks ago, and,

382
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,056
I mean, after what happened last night,
I really need to get away.

383
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,421
(STAMMERING) I mean,
I'll stay for the funeral,

384
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,756
but after that,
I just have to go somewhere

385
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,023
and not have to
think about things.

386
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,461
I don't even see
what the big deal is.

387
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,931
I mean, would anybody even
care if I went to Pasadena?

388
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,229
Pasadena is part
of the United States.

389
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,827
So is Cabo.

390
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,962
It's Mexico, Dorie!

391
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,304
No. It is Baja,
California. If it was in Mexico,

392
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,241
it would be called
Baja Mexico.

393
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,008
If it was in Mexico,
I would need a passport, right?

394
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,579
You need a passport for Cabo.

395
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,616
Oh, bummer.

396
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,694
Mercury is so
in retrograde.

397
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,861
Well, I think that Mr. Rockford
has probably heard enough.

398
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,490
More than enough.

399
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,730
Well, uh, we'll talk,
and then I will talk with you later.

401
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,337

403

(SIGHS)
All right! What?

404
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,389
Was that really your
idea of distraught?

405
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,450
Dorie came close there
when we nixed her trip to Cabo,

406
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,723
but that was about it.

407
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,321
Well, what do you think
they're gonna do?

408
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,890
Prostrate themselves with grief
in front of you, a total stranger?

409
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,436
Oh, and you're such good friends,
that's why they call you Halley?

410
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,198
Nobody calls you Halley.

411
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,071
Only those who are
very, very close to me.

412
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,204
Well, that lets me out.
I'm just an ex-husband.

413
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,876
You know, I just
can't believe that

414
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,083
those two could have Mickey
Ryder as a father. I just...

415
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,751
He was their stepfather
for five fast years.

416
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,694
Mickey Ryder has nothing to do with this,
Jim. Leave him out of it.

417
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,027
The next thing I know
you'll be giving me his stats.

418
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,930
What are you doing
with these people?

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,195
I mean, Dorie's
all right, I guess.

420
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,236
She's just out there,
somewhere, circling Jupiter.

421

But,
Josh! There's a real piece of work.

422
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,032
Look. If you want
to pass, fine.

423
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,442
If you're not prepared to work for
them based solely on my judgment,

424
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,537
a judgment for which
you recently expressed

425
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,139
such deep and
abiding respect...

426
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,945
All right! All right!
I'll check it out.

I'll let you know.

do you think I might see
somebody work up a small sweat?

Now get that stuff inventoried
and into the garage.

Yes, boss.

that money yesterday...

All right! I came to
put the bite on you,

but if you'd have given me that money,

would've happened!

I don't want your water.

You were on the late
night news, buddy. You!

463
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,543
You were taking three
shopping carts out of a store.

464
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,104
What, shopping's illegal?

it was wide open!

what were the other people doing in there?

you were doing, Angel.

our bargains where we can find 'em.

you punched out and you got paid.

you a very generous severance check.

last until you could find another job.

looked for one!

00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,906
Would you quit
calling it hot?

498
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,136
The only difference between
me and any other retailer

499
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,338
is I sell this stuff
at a righteous price

500
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,813
and I don't give away
little warranty cards.

501
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,010
If you can come up with
a brain-dead idea like this,

502
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,213
I'm not even gonna try
to talk you out of it.

503
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:34,550
You don't know everything, Jimmy.
There's nothing wrong with this plan.

504
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,287
Come on, Jimmy!

505
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,690
What'd you come down
here for, anyway?

506
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,794
You invited me. And I wanted
to see if you were all right.

507
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,002
You aren't.

508
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,700
But there's not a damned
thing I can do about it,

509
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,209
so I'm gonna go to work.

510
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,270
Oh,
if a 1971 silver Corniche convertible

511
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,875
happens to turn up in one of
your holding areas, give me a call.

514

515
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,299

going down.

516
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,424

517
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,402
Oh, hi, Sally.
Uh, you here to confess?

518
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,404
Yes, but if this
is a bad time...

519
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,497
Oh, well,
we're a little bit swamped today.

520
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,372
I don't mind waiting.
I'll tell you what.

521
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,413
Uh, we'll do it tomorrow.
I'll write up the report myself

522
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,106
and we'll have a nice
cup of coffee, okay?

523
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,173
Tomorrow. Thank you.
All right. Goodbye.

524
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,776
Yeah, so what
do you want?

525
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,251
Ah, it's about the
Lansing murder.

526
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,516
I'm doing a little work on it.

527
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,285
What do you mean you're doing
a little work on it? You crazy?

528
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,056
It's a very hot case.
The brass is all over it.

529
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,392
Well, I'm not interfering
with the police in any way.

530
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,161
I'm just asking a few
questions as a favor to Kit.

531
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,496
Oh.

532
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,060
(LAUGHING) You teasing!

533
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,697
Look at that. Like he owns it. Well,
I guess he does.

534
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,138
It's about the
surveillance I was...

535
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,334
Let me ask you
a question, Jim.

536
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,878
Yesterday when the verdict comes in,
what did you think was gonna happen?

537
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,880
I mean, some people are gonna get sore,
right? Real sore.

538
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,542
Some windows are gonna get broken,
maybe some heads.

539
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,051
Hey, nothing we
can't deal with.

540
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,143
That's what we're
trained to do.

541
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,654
Is that the way
you read it?

542
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,519
Well, I didn't hear about
it till late afternoon.

543
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,955
I didn't read it
one way or another.

544
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,322
Well, that's the
way I read it.

545
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,354
Dennis, give me a minute,
I'll get out of your hair.

546
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,794
Guess what his name is?

547
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,525
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

548
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,261
Gig McCool. I mean,
what kind of a name is that for a cop?

549
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,565
And I'll tell you something else,
he doesn't have seniority.

550
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,401
I have seniority.

551
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,577
All settled in? Oh,
no. No. No. Not yet.

552
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,772
(LAUGHS) I haven't even
got my files set up yet.

553
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,905
But, man, that is a
great office in there!

554
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,677
You've been in there?
Oh, of course you have.

555
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,310
You know how stuffy
it gets in here?

556
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,447
But that being a corner office,
you just open the windows

557
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,218
you got cross ventilation.

558
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,226
You open up the windows,
you screw up the air-conditioning.

559
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,922
That's why
it gets stuffy in here!

560
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,398
It's my office now, Becker.
Learn to live with it.

561
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,732
Oh, hey, listen, Dennis,
what I have to say...

562
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,867
Ah, McCool. I heard about
your performance yesterday

563
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,671
and they're talking
about it upstairs.

564
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,907
You read the signs absolutely
right. Good police work, son.

565
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,450
Good police work.
Thank you, sir.

566
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,611
Some of our other officers
could take a page from your book.

567
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,986
Got to pay attention.
You've got to read the signs.

568
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,687
Dennis, listen,
... Do you know how long I've waited

569
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,321
for Henderson to get
kicked upstairs?

570
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,196
I mean, that office had
my name on it for five years.

571
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,668
I mean, I painted the whole
thing myself two months ago.

572
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,897
Why'd they give
it to McCool?

573
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,837
Well, because yesterday he
kept saying all of the right things.

574
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,136
"It's the tip of the iceberg.
It's going ballistic.

575
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,938
"The governor should
call out the Guard."

576
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,706
I think the guy's
going dramatic on me.

577
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,213
I mean, he's got
the name for it.

578
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,544
Well, they gave
the office to McCool

579
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,845
because you disagreed
with him and he was right.

580
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,443
Yeah, well, yesterday I...

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,578
(INHALING)

582
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,647

had a hell of a time rounding 'em up!

Who knew we were
gonna need 'em?

584
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,394
I mean, they're always talking about
no overtime. I took 'em at their word.

585
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,095
Could you get that
for me, Becker?

586
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,602
Sure.

591
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,556
Yes! It helps to
kick something.

592
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,330
Dennis, uh,
you think you can handle a question now?

593
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,454
Shoot.

594
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,522
What'd they get on
the surveillance tape?

595
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,260
What tape?

596
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,498
Well, you know,
the one covering the Lansing driveway.

597
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,629
There was no camera.

598
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,970
Sure there is. It's not
on the Lansing property.

599
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,204
It's across the street. But
it's mounted up on the fence.

600
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,246
It covers the tennis court,
but when it sweeps around,

601
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,281
it also takes in
the Lansing driveway.

602
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,183
Now, if your guys missed it,
chances are the tape's still in it.

603
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,515
Yeah?

604
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,986
Well, get your
butt over there.

605
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,752
You got some objection
to being a hero?

606
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,022
You could wrap this whole thing
up without ever having to go to trial.

607
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,258
You could have the killers
dead bang in action, on tape.

kind of brought it into the '90s.

00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,471
I was in Oliver Stone's outer
office with an appointment,

662
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,675
not just hanging around,
and a cop shows up?

663
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:11,807
And I swear, a cop!

664
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,080
Do you know how long it took
me to get that appointment?

665
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,780
You think Stone's right
for my screenplay?

666
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,949
I have other
clients, you know.

667
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,550
Lieutenant Becker. Sorry
for the inconvenience.

668
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,890
But if you'll have a seat,
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

669
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,327
Oh, no! You'll be
with me right now.

670
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,297
If you think that I'm gonna let
you screw up the rest of my day,

671
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,457
no, no, no, no.

672
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,969
A few minutes or a
whole lot longer. Your call.

673
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,199
You guys are all on
power trips, aren't you?

674
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,538
Hey, you shouldn't talk to
her like she's a junior agent.

675
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,704
She's practically
a partner.

676
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,440
What'd you get her
down here for, anyway?

677
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,710
If you'd just shut up for a minute,
maybe he'll tell us.

678
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,548
Now why doesn't everybody just sit down,
let the man do his job?

679
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,950
Thank you.

680
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,081
Okay, this is what
I was looking for.

681
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,285
Now, before we
go any further,

682
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,259
I'm gonna have to
Mirandize them.

683
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,386
You're gonna what?

684
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,691
Read 'em their rights.

685
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,754
I don't want a translation,
I want an explanation.

686
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,561
We could all use
one of those, Dennis.

687
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,124
Well, let's see. "You have
the right to remain silent.

688
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,466
"If you give up the right to remain
silent..." Halley, what's he doing?

689
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,802
I don't know.
I don't understand this.

690
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,638
He's gonna arrest us. This is what they
always do when they arrest people, Josh.

691
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,270
"...and to have an attorney
present during questioning."

692
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:15,871
Could you kick it
into high, Dennis?

693
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,210
"If you so desire
and cannot afford one,

694
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,717
"an attorney will be appointed for
you without charge before questioning.”

695
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,183
There, that's it!

696
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,085
Before you go any further,
let me get something straight.

697
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,090
Are you seriously
considering charging my clients

698
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,058
with murdering
their own mother?

699
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,221
Because if you are,
brace yourself.

700
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,196
I'm gonna hit you
with a wrongful arrest suit

701
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,789
before you're even
finished booking 'em.

702
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,925
Maybe if we heard
what he's got, Kit.

703
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,266
What can he have?
BECKER: Well, for openers,

704
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,272
we recovered Mrs. Lansing's
car with his prints all over it.

705
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,705
Oh, go... So, what
does that prove?

706
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,335
Mom let me drive
her car all the time.

707
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,140
Miss Kupfer!
KIT: This is ridiculous.

708
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,145
Did you receive
a telephone call

709
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,210
from Josh Lansing
the night of the 29th?

710
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,119
The night that
Lila Lansing was killed?

711
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,487
Yeah. He wanted to know what
the action was on a script of his

712
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,652
that I've been shopping.
There wasn't any.

713
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,786
Do you remember what
time you received that call?

714
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,730
Not really. But, uh,
it must have been after 10:00.

715
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,631
I'd just started
watching the news.

716
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,827
Thank you. That's all.

717
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,427
That'll be all?

718
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:16,031
You dragged me out of Oliver
Stone's office for this? Oh.

719
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,266
Great.
Now she's sore at me.

720
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,108
I fail to see the significance
of his call to Mrs. Kupfer.

721
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,275
She's his agent, he was
concerned about the sale of his script.

722
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,148
BECKER: An hour after
his mother was killed?

723
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,518
(SCOFFS)
He was in shock. Denial.

724
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,216
The call came from
Lila Lansing's car.

725
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,952
Now we've got
confirmation on that.

726
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,155
We also got tape from surveillance
cameras that covered the driveway.

727
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,357
Mom didn't have
surveillance cameras!

728
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,197
No. But there was one
directly across the street.

729
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,260
Oh! So, what are you saying?
That that tape shows us killing Mom?

730
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,863
It couldn't. BECKER: No.
It shows you driving off.

731
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,271
JOSH: Why would we do that?

732
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,672
To make it look
like a carjacking.

733
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,939
When you backed the
Corniche out into the street,

734
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,640
the tape shows your mother
lying there in the driveway.

735
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,116
Now, there was nothing the
matter with the motors on the gate.

736
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,278
Your clients put
the gate on manual

737
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,753
so that their mother would
have to get out of the car.

738
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,290
Now, that makes
it pre-meditated.

739
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,324
That makes it murder one.

740
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,296
JOSH: I've been in
here for 19 months.

741
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,465
You ever been
in jail, Halley?

742
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,635
It's nothing like
I thought it would be.

743
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,269
I thought it would
be like, you know,

744
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,814
trying not to get
raped in the laundry,

745
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:33,181
or guys making shivs
out of silverware.

746
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,619
It's just boring. I feel like
I've been here forever.

747
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,952
I know. But with all the
postponements and everything...

748
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,823
But we are going to go
to court on Tuesday,

749
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,556
and that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

750
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,897
Dorie's been...
What?

751
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,730
She's not sick
again, is she?

752
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,294
No. No, but she's upset.

753
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,168
Understandably. And...

754
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,969
She's not talking, right?

755
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,909
God! Ever since we were kids,
when she gets really upset, she clams up.

756
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,708
You can't get
a word out of her.

757
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,513
I'm worried about going into
court with her this way, Josh.

758
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,246
They're going to ask
for the death penalty

759
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,051
and I don't know what
that's going to do to her.

760
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,592
I do. She'll freak!

761
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,185
How can they ask for the death
penalty when we didn't do it?

762
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:20,527
The evidence is... I don't
care about the evidence!

763
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,430
We didn't kill Mom, okay?

764
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,136
All right. We moved
the car. I don't know why.

765
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,865
I don't remember doing it. I
don't remember phoning my agent,

766
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,202
but I'll tell you
something, Halley,

767
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,073
I would sure as hell remember
shooting my own mother!

768
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,535
KIT: Look.

769
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,147
Excuse me, ma'am. We just got word that
you're wanted over at the hospital ward.

770
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,944
They say it's urgent.
Dorie.

771
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,951
It's Dorie, isn't it?
What happened to her?

772
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,851
They found her in her cell.
She tried to commit suicide.

773
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,356
No! Get out of my way!

774
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,448
(GRUNTING) Get back!
KIT: Josh!

775
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,994
JOSH: Get out of my way!
Josh, please! Stop!

776
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,654
(MEN GRUNTING)

777
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,392
Dorie!

778
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,992
Dorie! Dorie!

779
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,682
Hi, Mattie.
MATTIE: Hey!

780
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,883
Well, looking
pretty good, huh?

781
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,893
Oh,
who cares? Benson isn't gonna live here.

782
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,622
He wants it as
a fishing shack.

783
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,755
Probably keep live
bait in the bathtub.

784
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,300
(LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) He'll
have to keep it in the sink.

785
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,461
I only have a shower.

786
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,733
It may not be top of the line,
but, hey, it's hardly a shack.

787
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,137
He called it a shack?

788
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,142
Who cares what he called it? He's
willing to pay 50 percent over market

789
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,235
and he's got
the cash to do it.

790
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,713
Don't go all sensitive
on me, Jim.

791
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,807
I'm just trying to save you
a lot of unnecessary work.

792
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,114
Thanks, Mattie.

793
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,312
He's driving up
from San Diego.

794
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,980
<i>He'll be here
600, 6:30.</i>

795
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,490
It gets dark at 6:00. He
won't be able to see anything.

796
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,650
He's already
seen the place.

797
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,717
He's just coming by
to sign the papers!

798
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:57,920
(LAUGHS)

799
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,727
You've got one of the
best lots in Malibu.

800
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,630
And you're really just
gonna walk away from it?

801
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,429
As soon as
the check clears.

802
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,029
(LAUGHS) Why? I mean,
what's wrong with LA?

803
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,007
The quality of life.
There isn't any.

804
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,509
(LAUGHING)

805
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,568
I'll see you at 6:00.

806
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:15,943
If I'm a little late,
don't worry.

807
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,642
Um, I've got an open
house in Panorama City

808
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,050
and who knows what the fire's
gonna do to the valley traffic.

809
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,747
What fire?

810
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,385
Is that one of
the canyons?

811
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,394
No. It's way out in Agoura,
someplace like that. I'll see you later.

812
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,355
(PHONE RINGING)

813
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,931
Oh!

814
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,137
Yeah. All right.
All right. All right.

815
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,970
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

816
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,842
Hello? Hello?
KIT: Hello, Jim.

817
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,347
ROCKFORD ON ANSWERING
MACHINE: This is Jim Rockford.

818
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,473
At the tone, leave your
name and message.

819
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,675
KIT: Turn that thing off!
I'll get back to you.

820
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,343
(BEEPS) It'll be
over in a minute.

821
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,750
Is that you, Kit?

822
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,585
What do you mean,
"is it me"? Of course it's me.

823
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,785
Uh, what do you mean, "of course"? I
haven't heard from you since August.

824
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,793
Well,
I know. But I've been meaning to call

to prepare for this trial.

to get into that right now.

827

Just get yourself down to the
Metropolitan Detention Center.

Look, I'll fill you
in when you get here.

831
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,604
But it's big, it's dirty and it's the
answer to a defense attorney's prayers.

832
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,642
I'm bending the rules here.
You understand that.

833
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,418
Now, I'm only going to allow you in
the room for a few minutes to observe.

834
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,925
Under no circumstances
are you to speak,

835
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,691
cry out,
or make your presence known to the patient.

836
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:39,958
It could have
an adverse effect,

we are here to help her.

We're not here to add
any additional pain.

Uh, were her injuries from
the suicide attempt that bad?

840

I was referring to psychic
pain, Mr. Rockford.

841

is very bad.

but this is very
exciting, Jim.

they hired this psychiatrist,

this Dr. Ezso,
to look at Dorie.

Would you please
listen to me?

875

Maybe it was because she was
particularly vulnerable. Who knows?

876
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,684
But anyway,
he managed to uncover this repressed memory

877
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,314
which explains everything
including Lila's death.

What repressed memory?

879
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,787
Both Josh and Dorie
were sexually abused,

while he was married to Lila.

994
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,176
ROCKFORD: Are you sure
this is the right street?

995
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,653
I'm sure.

996
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,281
Hecate's Habitat?

997
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,155
Jimmy, when you're
talking black arts,

998
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,160
these dudes got
this skinny down.

999
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:25,593
I could take you
a half a dozen places,

1000
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,097
you'd just be
wasting your time.

1001
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,893
Now, you got that
photo of the guy?

1002
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,196
Yeah. I don't think we ought
to use his picture, I really don't.

1003
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,633
All right, all right.
Let's see.

1004
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,673
Well,
we'll try something a little more casual.

1005
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,831
Have you got
some of his hair?

1006
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,068
Angel.

1007
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,736
All right, we'll get
'em in a conversation.

1008
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,972
A little of this,
a little of that.

1009
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:43,411
I look for an opening,
then I'll say,

1010
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,846
"Has Mickey Ryder been
comin' in here lately?"

1011
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,941
We definitely shouldn't
use his name.

1012
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,782
Baseball. Could I
mention baseball?

1013
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,652
No, this wasn't
a good idea.

1014
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,281
I'll tell you...
Do you realize

1015
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:57,419
what these guys could do if they had
any idea we're talkin' about Mickey Ryder?

1016
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,587
I mean, they could
turn right around

1017
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,426
and sell it to the
National Enquirer. Oh.

1018
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,399
Next time you go in
to get a chicken pot pie,

1019
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,095
there's Mickey's picture on the front
page with "Satanist" written under it.

1020
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,138
I mean, you can't do that. Jimmy,
would you chill?

1021
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,934
What? You don't think
I can be discreet?

1022
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,236
Now just follow my lead.

1023
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,572
Angel! Angel!

1024
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:17,274
Hey, Dave.
What a delight!

1025
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,309
Dave? You're on
pretty friendly terms.

1026
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,910
You only had that sales
job a fast 15 minutes?

1027
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:26,013
He's watching us. Pick
something up. Look like a customer.

1028
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,918
(WHISPERING) I was hoping
Frank would be here.

1029
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,985
He's a lot easier
to talk to.

1030
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,326
Angel, would you
look at this?

1031
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,336
Great display, Dave.
Very tasteful.

1032
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,307
Give me a minute, Jimmy.

1033
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:51,515
All right. here it is. Is
that Paco or is that Paco?

1034
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,050
Where's the pins?
Where's the pins?

1035
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,585
Let's get out of here,
Angel. Come on.

1036
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:55,676
We just got here.

1037
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:57,847
I have seen enough
of this. This is pathetic.

1038
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,117
I mean, this is for people

1039
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,853
who think a shot of bat juice and a
plastic mojo are gonna give 'em a life.

1040
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:03,917
Keep it down, Jimmy.

1041
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,088
These are not the kind of
people you want to tick off.

1042
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,825
What,
you think Dave's gonna turn me into a frog?

1043
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,698
You're making me
very nervous.

1044
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,535
Angel, if Dave is such
a hotshot at spells,

1045
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:19,543
don't you think he'd own a boutique
on Rodeo Drive instead of this dump?

1046
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,408
Don't you think
he'd have hair?

1047
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,413
(DOOR OPENS) (LAUGHS) Dave. Thanks,
Dave. Thanks.

1048
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,852
You just closed my account at
Hecate's Habitat. I hope you know that.

1049
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,479
You have an
account there?

1050
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,989
Well, I don't use
it that often.

1051
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:35,287
I mean, every now and then
when I'm running a little low...

1052
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,724
On what?
On eye of newt?

1053
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:39,229
I can't believe you'd
go in that joint.

1054
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,355
Can't you recognize
a con when you see one?

1055
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,558
And I'll tell you
something else.

1056
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,796
Mickey Ryder wouldn't get
within a mile of that joint.

1057
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,169
He's about as much of
a Satanist as Rocky is.

1058
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:55,337
(SIGHING)

1059
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,380
I just can't stop Kit.

1060
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,973
She's convinced she's
doing the right thing.

1061
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,949
She isn't, but
she thinks she is.

1062
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:02,884
She's gonna throw
those charges at Mickey,

1063
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,253
and a lot of people out there
are gonna believe 'em.

1064
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,382
You know, Mickey Ryder
is a decent man.

1065
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,190
He doesn't deserve to be
blindsided like this.

1066
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,694
I'd love to warn him.

1067
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,922
I haven't got time
to find him.

1068
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,595
Aaron used to do one of those
"Where Are They Now" features.

1069
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,661
They did one
on Mickey Ryder.

1070
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,709
They had pictures of him up at the
Desert Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.

1071
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,608
Big Al Minette used to use
him as a celebrity greeter.

1072
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:28,770
He'd fly him into town,

1073
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,110
play golf with all the big honchos,
that kind of thing.

1074
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,708
Aaron had some pictures from
the honeymoon mansion with Lila.

1075
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,516
And Mickey still lives
in the same crib.

1076
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,223
And you know where it is?

1077
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,281
For a Hamilton.
A what?

1078
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,794
Jackson?
A Jackson?

1079
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,887
That's cheap at 20.
Where is it?

1080
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:48,295
Brent wood.

1081
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,165
I won't help you,
Mr. Rockford.

1082
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:57,702
Funny thing is,
Lila would want me to.

1083
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,470
She wouldn't want her children to suffer,
even for her own murder.

1084
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,039
Well, I'm not that forgiving.
I hope they fry in hell.

1085
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,151
I'm sorry.

1086
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,451
Did you know Lila?

1087
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,925
Well, I never had
the pleasure. No, sir.

1088
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:19,361
Well, make no mistake,
it would have been a pleasure.

1089
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,659
She was a remarkable woman.

1090
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:29,065
Ever since it happened,
I... I keep wondering how they could do it.

1091
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,807
Why? For money?

1092
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,503
She gave them everything
they needed or wanted.

1093
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,047
They would have
had it all in time.

1094
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,283
I hope she didn't
know who did it.

1095
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:45,310
I pray to God she didn't die
knowing her children wanted her dead.

1096
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,083
You'll have to forgive
me, Mr. Rockford.

1097
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,183
I'm not handling
this very well.

1098
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,284
If you'll excuse
me, I'd like...

1099
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,264
I know this is an intrusion,
but it's important to you.

1100
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,730
I'm not here on behalf
of Josh and Dorie.

1101
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,463
You said... That I was
engaged by their attorney.

1102
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,836
I was.

1103
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,535
But something has
happened, and well...

1104
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,738
This is gonna be
a whole lot harder

1105
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,441
than I thought
it would be.

1106
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,041
I'm very tired, Mr. Rockford.

1107
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:17,554
If you have something to say,
would you please say it.

1108
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:22,955
The defense is going to blame you,
indirectly, for Lila Lansing's murder.

1109
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,085
What?

1110
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:29,929
Dorie claims to have uncovered a
repressed memory from her childhood.

1111
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,560
From the years that
you and Lila were married.

1112
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:36,834
She says that you
forced her and Josh

1113
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:42,004
into repellent and
perverted sexual practices.

1114
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,372
She says I molested them?

1115
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,508
She says you're a Satanist.

1116
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,518
That you practiced devil
worship in the basement,

1117
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,214
you took them down
there and performed

1118
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,283
unspeakable acts with
Lila's tacit permission.

1119
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,591
When they remembered,
they turned on their mother

1120
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,598
and killed her
for not protecting them.

1121
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,136
Come with me.

1122
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,276
Here it is.
What do you think?

1123
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,411
Oh, wow! Look at that.

1124
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,754
MICKEY: Doesn't look much like a
temple for the Prince of Darkness, does it?

1125
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,657
Of course,
I'd have things hidden. I'd...

1126
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,424
(CHUCKLES) Like the whips,
the chains, the sacrificial altar.

1127
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,693
Look around,
see what you can find. Go ahead.

1128
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,632
Hey, come on. You don't think
I believed any of that, do you?

1129
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,035
Look around!
Not out here in the open.

1130
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,004
Come on! Hey! How
about the desk drawer?

1131
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,234
I bet I got things
hidden... ROCKFORD: No!

1132
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,470
...in the damn desk
drawer! Look at that!

1133
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:47,806
Now. Now, look.
Don't do that.

1134
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,243
The bookcase,
I've got books here.

1135
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:51,247
There might be a secret
panel behind the desk.

1136
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,476
Stop it!
Damn it!

1137
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,313
You can handle this.
No!

1138
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,011
Come on, come on.

1139
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,267
When they told me
Lila was dead,

1140
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,769
I didn't think it
could get any worse.

1141
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,270
But this...

1142
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,436
They want people to believe
that Lila was some kind of monster.

1143
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,739
That I'm some
kind of monster.

1144
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,687
They make me ashamed.

1145
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,051
Not because I abused them.
I swear before God I didn't.

1146
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,163
But because I...
I loved them.

1147
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,224
I loved those kids.

1148
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:49,202
They were part of Lila,
so I loved them.

1149
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,579
ROCKFORD: I've been leaving
messages for you all over town.

1150
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:07,556
I left the first message
yesterday afternoon.

1151
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,389
I've been busy.
What is it, Jim?

1152
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,792
I went to see
Mickey Ryder yesterday.

1153
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:18,062
What? I don't think
I find that acceptable.

1154
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,796
Well, I don't think I care.

1155
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,170
There's an ethical consideration here,
Jim, you're working for me.

1156
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,072
I quit. Just before

01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,741
This was not a suicide,
Becker. This was murder.

1322
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:53,374
Give me a name.
Give me a motive.

1323
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,885
Oh, I don't have
one at the moment.

1324
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,386
Look, let me
tell you something.

1325
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,717
When I was here
a couple of months ago,

1326
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,620
there was a photograph
right over there.

1327
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,057
It was taken in Vegas
at the Desert Palms.

1328
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,754
And right next to Mickey was
Sidney Kornblum on one side

1329
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,228
and Big Al Minette
on the other.

1330
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,265
Two very forceful
personalities.

1331
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,926
They don't call him
Big Al since he went legit.

1332
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,629
What makes you think he
went legit? Because he said so?

1333
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:18,470
Mickey told me Sidney Kornblum
asked him to do a favor for a friend.

1334
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,600
That's how he got
into this mess.

1335
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,304
Now, say that friend
was Al Minette?

1336
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,904
Jim, Sidney Kornblum is
a highly respected attorney

1337
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,915
and Al Minette
operates legitimate

1338
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,179
and profitable enterprises
in Las Vegas.

1339
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,846
Why would either one of those
men try and kill Mickey Ryder?

1340
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:35,118
I don't know. I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

1341
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,250
And you watch how
you write this one up, Dennis.

1342
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,627
Don't close the book on it. You
never will get into that corner office.

1343
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,764
Why do you always have
to complicate everything?

1344
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,775
Why can't you just accept
the fact that it's over?

1345
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,074
It's not over, Kit. Not as long as
the cops are calling it a suicide.

1346
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,877
You're the only one that's
calling it anything else.

1347
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,008
You know, you accused me
of having a blind spot.

1348
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,713
You're the one that has
a blind spot in this, Jim.

1349
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:08,280
You bought the whole package, peanuts
and Cracker Jack and 30 years of hype.

1350
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,089
You're really sore at me,
aren't you? You're royally ticked off.

1351
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,356
As a matter of fact,
yes. Yes, I am.

1352
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,490
Well, fine, this is probably as
good a time as any to tell you.

1353
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,534
It's been on my mind.
I've been thinking about it.

1354
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,569
I'm the one that found
the surveillance camera

1355
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:22,196
that put your clients
in the slammer.

1356
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,398
You found it?

1357
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:26,067
Yeah, I told Dennis and the rest,
as they say, is history.

1358
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,701
You mean to tell me the
whole time I was paying you,

1359
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,506
you were working
to convict my clients?

1360
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,843
That's an oversimplification.

1361
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:34,077
I want my money back.
Every cent of it.

1362
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,709
(LAUGHING) Oh,
you're not gonna get it.

1363
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,844
I was scrupulous
in my performance of duty.

1364
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:40,652
That camera was a by-product
of my investigation.

1365
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,351
I didn't set out to find it. I wasn't
looking for damning evidence.

1366
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,758
It's not my fault that
your clients are guilty.

1367
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:49,196
Not only do I want my money back,
but I want your license.

1368
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,666
As a matter of fact,
I might just call the licensing bureau.

1369
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,066
I'm sure you're in
violation of some statute.

1370
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,696
You always are.

1371
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:00,375
This is gonna be
a fun ride home.

1372
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,689
Hey, slow down, will you?

1373
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,891
I gotta make a phone call,
then I'll follow you home.

1374
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:24,627
I don't need to
be followed home.

1375
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,999
Well, whether you
need it or not.

1376
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,267
Look, I have to get Kornblum's
home address from Becker.

1377
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:34,277
That is if he's still talkin'
to me. Unless you have it.

1378
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,181
Kit,
you know I'm gonna get it somewhere.

1379
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,182
Why make it any more
difficult than it has to be?

1380
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,048
Then again, why not?

1381
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,958
Kit, you said earlier that I
was your cheering section.

1382
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:52,654
Well, I was.
It was easy.

1383
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:56,131
You were always fighting for
truth and justice wearing a white hat.

1384
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,031
That doesn't apply
any more, does it?

1385
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,126
Now, you just want to win.

1386
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,260
That is a rotten
thing to say.

1387
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,534
You didn't talk to
Mickey Ryder. I did.

1388
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:08,805
He loved your friend, Lila. He loved
those two miserable kids of hers.

1389
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,871
(SIGHING) What'd he get
out of it? Hmm?

1390
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:14,576
Humiliation,
shame and dead.

1391
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,713
Well, I don't like it. I'm gonna
find out who killed him and why.

1392
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,688
If I uncover anything in
my investigation

1393
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:25,456
that has a negative impact on your case,
that's just too damn bad.

1394
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:33,528
Jim!

1395
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:38,499
Sidney Kornblum's
at the Landale Country Club.

1396
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,066
It's a party for his
son's Bar Mitzvah.

1397
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,412
Half the LA bar
association's gonna be there.

1398
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,006
I sent regrets.

1399
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:54,652
(CAR STARTING)

1400
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,701
ANGEL: Hey, Jimmy...

1401
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,759
What...

1402
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:09,669
What are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

1403
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:12,003
Well, I could say
the same about you.

1404
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,772
My heart almost stopped.
What are you doing back there?

1405
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,334
Wait till you hear.

1406
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,312
Well, first...

1407
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:22,911
Well, first,
I get two flats.

1408
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,784
Jimmy, I gotta
have new tires.

1409
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,084
Go on.

1410
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,818
Well, naturally,
with two flats, I can't drive.

1411
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,327
So far none of this is
putting you in my backseat.

1412
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:36,332
Okay, I pulled off the side of
the highway and I started walkin'.

1413
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,730
Three miles, easy.

1414
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,531
I figure I'd get to your place,
I'd call the auto club.

1415
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:41,968
You're a member,
ain't you?

1416
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,166
Anyway, you're not there.

1417
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,608
Well, I'm tired, I'm thirsty,
my feet are killing me.

1418
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:51,579
I can't go anywhere. I know
you gotta come back sometime.

1419
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,376
So, I might as well
be comfortable.

1420
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,883
I saw some tires...

1421
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:57,452
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

1422
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,765
Hey, where you going?

1423
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,067
To the party.

1424
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,006
We're not invited.

1425
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,703
Jimmy, look at the place.
Look at all the cars.

1426
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,973
There's over
100 people here.

1427
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,672
You think they're gonna
notice a couple more?

1428
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,306
It's a Bar Mitzvah, man.

1429
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:29,249
I could be the visiting rabbi
from the old neighborhood.

1430
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,047
What old neighborhood?

1431
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,952
Everybody's from
some old neighborhood.

1432
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,217
Who's gonna get technical?

1433
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,349
There's whitefish
right through that door.

1434
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,621
Forget it. I'm gonna sit
here until the host leaves.

1435
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:42,528
Then I'm gonna follow
him home and talk to him.

1436
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,532
Now, that's the plan.

1437
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,863
You could talk
to him right here

1438
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:48,836
and have something to eat
at the same time?

1439
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,670
I need privacy
when I talk to him.

1440
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,607
Now, you can sit here with me,
or you can leave.

1441
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,440
I really don't care.

1442
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,003
And how am I supposed
to get home?

1443
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,048
Take the bus.
This time of night?

1444
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,606
Cab fare would be
a little more like it.

1445
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,619
Unless you don't care
when or if I get home.

1446
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:06,920
(SIGHS) Al right.

1447
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,616
Take the cab.

1448
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,920
No, no, no,
no. I'll take you to a cab, come on.

1449
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,901
MAN: Mark, come on.

1450
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:27,868
What about the tires?

1451
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,742
Oh, it'll come with tires.

1452
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,405
My tires. For my car.

1453
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,074
I don't carry that
kind of money on me.

1454
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,512
Okay. I'll borrow
your credit card.

1455
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:37,610
(LAUGHING)

1456
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,883
You'll have to
shoot me to get it.

1457
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:44,860
Oh, yeah! All the way from
Minette Motors in Vegas.

1458
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,589
Uncle Al sure does
give expensive gifts.

1459
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,392
Big Al Minette?
Yeah.

1460
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,024
Here,
you wanna take him where he wants to go

1461
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,090
and you can
keep the change.

1462
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,465
If Minette's involved,
you might as well give me your credit card.

1463
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:55,868
You ain't gonna
be needing it.

1464
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,344
ROCKFORD: I'm sorry
it's so late, Mr. Kornblum.

1465
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,211
I don't receive strangers
in my home, Mr. Rockford.

1466
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:10,583
Yeah, well,
I wasn't a stranger to Mickey Ryder.

1467
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:14,749
Oh, hey! Last time I saw this,
it was in Mickey's den.

1468
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:17,156
Last time I saw his den,
it was a basement.

1469
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,661
Mickey was hanging from
one of the rafters.

1470
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,527
I've spoken with the police.

1471
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:25,295
Mickey's suicide was tragic
but not unexpected.

1472
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:28,429
He was in a deep state of
depression for some time.

1473
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,030
It was murder, not suicide.

1474
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:32,871
And he didn't sound
too depressed

1475
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,569
when I talked with him
earlier this evening.

1476
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,636
As a matter of fact,
he sounded mad.

1477
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:40,580
Well, I'm mad too,
and I want some answers.

1478
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,481
I want to know how you hammered
a confession out of Mickey

1479
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,781
and I want to know why.

1480
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:46,447
I want to know about
the Vegas connection

1481
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,422
and how Al Minette
fit into this.

1482
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:50,152
I want to know why
Mickey's basement

1483
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,024
was stripped down
to the bare concrete.

1484
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,755
And I want to know what
else you took out of there

1485
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,695
besides that baseball.

1486
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:59,025
Is there an implied
threat in all that?

1487
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:02,765
No, no. No, those
are the questions.

1488
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,465
This is the threat.

1489
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,134
I know you had something
to do with Mickey's murder,

1490
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,144
and I'm gonna keep digging
till I find out what it is.

1491
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,941
I'm gonna give all this
to a friend of mine

1492
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,914
down at the department
in the morning.

1493
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:17,351
So, don't be surprised if
the cops start digging, too.

1494
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:21,681
(DOOR CLOSES)

1495
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,591
Yeah. Get me Sanders.

1496
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,193
Well, find him.

1497
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,696
Jim, I can't believe
you're this stupid.

1498
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,002
Oh, sure you can, Dennis.

1499
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:40,474
I do dumb things
all the time.

1500
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:43,774
Yeah. Not this dumb. You
set yourself up for a hit?

1501
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,905
Well, if I'm right
about Kornblum, I did.

1502
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,746
But how else am I
gonna smoke him out?

1503
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,945
You're the one that's
liable to get smoked.

1504
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,852
Dennis, I don't have time to do
a verse and two choruses on this.

1505
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,014
If you're not in...

1506
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:57,685
Yeah? If I'm not in? You never
thought about that, did you?

1507
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,190
I'm in.

1508
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,755
Ah, good, good.
Now, what we gotta do

1509
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,700
is you move your car
over near the sand castle.

1510
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,703
Get a good, clear
view of the trailer.

1511
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:10,865
And then when Kornblum's
gorillas show up...

1512
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,339
You sure he has gorillas?

1513
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:13,705
Well, he has to.

1514
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:17,508
They're gonna be our leverage. And
don't make any premature moves, huh?

1515
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,309
We don't wanna get 'em
for spitting on the sidewalk.

1516
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,510
We want "em
for attempted murder.

1517
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:24,554
Oh, Jim, how many times
do I let 'em shoot you?

1518
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,783
(LAUGHS) There's the
keys to the Fire bird.

1519
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,450
It is running great.

1520
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,688
That government issue
you're driving is a joke.

1521
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:35,595
I don't want you losing me.
Shall we go?

1522
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:39,396
I don't know why I don't just
don't take an early retirement.

1523
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:41,396
Hi. Hi, Dennis.

1524
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,097
She was just leaving.

1525
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,100
He was just leaving.

1526
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,610
Actually,
I was just leaving.

1527
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,145
Where are you going
this time of night?

1528
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,680
Well...

1529
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,409
Was this something
that couldn't wait?

1530
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,715
An apology. I know I
should have called first.

1531
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:02,247
Nobody ever does. Look,
there's no apology necessary, Kit.

1532
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:05,123
Thank you for coming by.
I'll call you in the morning.

1533
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:06,525
You want me out
of here, don't you?

1534
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:07,892
Well, no.

1535
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,593
Well, hey, hey,
it's a little late.

1536
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,293
And it has been
a long day.

1537
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,529
KIT: Expecting someone?

1538
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,832
Kit, I can't explain
right now.

1539
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,565
Mr. Rockford...

1540
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,477
ROCKFORD: Oh,
yes. I'll be with you in a minute.

1541
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:23,535
My friend was
just leaving.

1542
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,877
Let's not play
any games, okay?

1543
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,610
Who are these people?

1544
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,152
My late date.

1545
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,687
Come on, come on,
let's move it.

1546
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,846
Move it. KIT: Why
didn't you tell me?

1547
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,583
This is who you
were expecting?

1548
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:36,284
SANDERS: Put
a cork in it, lady.

1549
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:38,861
Get in.

1550
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,760
The trunk? I will not.

1551
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,161
Yeah. I'm gonna have
a little trouble, too.

1552
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:43,824
You know, I took
a bullet in this leg.

1553
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,560
How'd you like to take
a bullet in the other one?

1554
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:46,965
Make it a set.

1555
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:50,006
I'll get in first. I'll sort
of cushion it for you.

1556
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,905
I'm gonna need a little help. I'm sorry,
Kit.

1557
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,636
But I asked you to leave.

1558
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,973
Hey!

1559
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,638
Jim!

1560
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,442
Jim?

1561
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:01,210
Oh, gosh!

1562
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,312
I'm gonna suffocate
in here!

1563
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,581
ROCKFORD: No.
There's plenty of air.

1564
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,349
Would you move
your foot?

1565
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,120
KIT: Life is just one big
adventure with you, isn't it?

1566
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,388
(EXCLAIMING)
What are you doing?

1567
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,690
I moved my foot.

1568
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,258
Shut up in there!

1569
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,258
ROCKFORD: That was
your foot?

1570
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,860
KIT: That's my foot.
Oh, come on.

1571
01:17:32,515 --> 01:17:34,005
KIT: This reminds
me of Marin.

1572
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,517
You remember when
we drove up to Marin?

1573
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,951
When was that? '85?
ROCKFORD: '84.

1574
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,988
To go fishing with
those friends of yours.

1575
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,352
They were
friends of yours, too.

1576
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,391
They were never my
friends. I hated 'em.

1577
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:01,641
What the...

1578
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,026
Okay.

1579
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,717
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

1580
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,534
Let's go, come on.

1581
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,195
Easy, easy.
Okay, okay.

1582
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:03,332
(GRUNTING)

1583
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:07,400
Come on, Rockford.

1584
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,205
I can't move.

1585
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,905
What the hell you
talking about? Your leg?

1586
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,072
No, it's my back.

1587
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,377
(GROANING) I've
thrown my back out.

1588
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,645
If you guys are gonna do me,
you're gonna have to do me right here.

1589
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,188
In my car?

1590
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,552
If it's the only way.

1591
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:21,681
Are you crazy?
Hey!

1592
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,021
I'm supposed to drive around
with a stiff in my trunk?

1593
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:28,030
Till when? It gets a little
warmer? He gets a little ripe?

1594
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,325
Help him out of there.

1595
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:30,490
Yeah. Help me.

1596
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:33,331
(GROANING) Oh, easy.

1597
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,771
I'm going to need a little help here,
Sanders.

1598
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,898
He does need
a little help.

1599
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,404
SANDERS: Come on.

1600
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:42,638
ROCKFORD: Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

1601
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,543
Get that leg.
Bring him over.

1602
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,581
Ah, no...

1603
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:48,378
Oh, that hurts.
That hurts.

1604
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,940
Oh, I can't move.

1605
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:51,282
Oh, I can't straighten up.
Put him over here.

1606
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,014
Wait a minute.
Run, Kit!

1607
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,556
(GROANS)

1608
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,920
ROCKFORD: Run!

1609
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,040
KIT: Oh, no! Jim!

1610
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,582
(GROANING)

1611
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:27,214
Jim!

1612
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,391
(GUN COCKING)
Get up! Get up!

1613
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:39,232
I'm gonna tell Mr. Kornblum
this one's on the house.

1614
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:41,332
This one's my pleasure.

1615
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:44,407
Police! Drop it! Now!

1616
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,639
Face down!

1617
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,509
What'd you do?
Stop for a hamburger?

1618
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,641
That hotshot car of yours
is missing two wheels.

1619
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,515
Angel! Damn!

1620
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,019
I had to call in
for air support.

1621
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,318
Helicopter spotted you
and just in time.

1622
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,188
Oh, thanks, Dennis.

1623
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,354
Are you all right?

1624
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,594
Am I all right?
(LAUGHING) You're just fine.

1625
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:24,243
Mr. Kornblum, right? I'm
Detective Becker. This, you know...

1626
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:27,613
I know Miss Kittredge
and Mr. Rockford.

1627
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,515
What is it you want,
Detective Becker?

1628
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:32,179
You said something on the
phone about a Mr. Sanders...

1629
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,551
I don't recall
the other name.

1630
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,420
ROCKFORD: Oh, well,
it's worse than we thought, Dennis.

1631
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,426
He's hired so many hits he can't
remember the names of the mechanics.

1632
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,586
Jim, let me
handle this, okay?

1633
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:42,096
Unless Mr. Rockford is a
member of the police department,

1634
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:43,757
I'd like him
out of here, please.

1635
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:47,393
You can't remove me,
Kornblum. No, I'm the hitee.

1636
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,699
I'm the one that's filing
the charges against you,

1637
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,139
and before you go
pulling on your forelock

1638
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:53,902
and getting all
bewildered on us,

1639
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:57,412
I have to warn you that Sanders
and Warsche have talked.

1640
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,244
You ordered the hit on Mickey
Ryder. You ordered the hit on me.

1641
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,805
So we can start
from there.

1642
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:04,683
I was at last night's
festivities, Mr. Kornblum.

1643
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,778
I was also at the
police interrogation.

1644
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,051
Now, Mr. Rockford
is not bluffing.

1645
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:12,185
Sanders and Warsche are
probably still talking.

1646
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,229
Mickey's death
was not my doing.

1647
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,739
Those were not my orders.

1648
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,208
Oh, so, the hired hands
just went crazy, huh?

1649
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:30,302
Come on! What did you
send them out there for?

1651

(CLEARING THROAT)

1652
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,407
It was a question of a
favor for a client. A friend.

1653
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,681
Oh, Big Al Minette?

1654
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,754
I'm gonna say this much regarding
my involvement, which was minimal.

1655
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:48,889
I did arrange to put the
material in the basement.

1656
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,193
What material?

1657
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,634
Sensitive material.

1658
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:04,178
That concerned certain parties,
certain operations.

1659
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:08,116
The reason Mickey
pleaded guilty to Satanic acts

1660
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,619
was he couldn't let the
police search his basement.

1661
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,918
Will you testify to that in
court? At the Lansing trial?

1662
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,154
Of course, without in any way
compromising client confidentiality.

1663
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:23,222
Now, listen,
about this sensitive material? What is it?

1664
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,823
I don't know.

1665
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,426
Sanders gave me what
he found in the basement.

1666
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,302
A large sealed envelope.
I didn't open it.

1667
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,432
I put it in the safe.

1668
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,143
You've got it here?
Yes.

1669
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,609
Well, get it.

1670
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,242
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dennis.

1671
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,253
I know. I over-stepped
my bounds, Dennis,

1672
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:47,948
but do you believe
how we've lucked out?

1673
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,787
I mean, this could be
the Minette connection.

1674
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,257
It could have drugs.
What do you think?

1675
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:52,987
Drug dealing.
Maybe pipeline?

1676
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,426
Well, Minette's
out of Vegas.

1677
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,396
It could be the
skimming operation.

1678
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:57,626
Or money laundering.

1679
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,464
Counterfeit! Counterfeit's
a growth industry today.

1680
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,904
Minette's got the perfect
operation to pass bad paper.

1681
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,770
Mr. Kornblum... Sorry to intrude,
Mr. Kornblum.

1682
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:12,781
We interrogated Lloyd
Sanders and Phillip Warsche.

1683
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:15,317
You questioned
my prisoners?

1684
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:16,374
Who are you?

1685
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:19,546
I busted 'em. Brought
them in. Lieutenant Becker.

1686
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,020
Well done, Becker.

1687
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,353
Mr. Sanders stated that
he retrieved an envelope

1688
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:26,087
from the basement of
Mickey Ryder's house

1689
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,858
and subsequently
gave that envelope to you.

1690
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,831
Yes. I just took it
out of my safe.

1691
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:34,028
Thank you, Mr. Kornblum. We'll
leave a receipt with your secretary.

1692
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,230
He got that out of the safe
for Lieutenant Becker.

1693
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:37,295
BECKER: That's right.

1694
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:40,398
This is federal, sir.
I'm sure you understand.

1695
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,703
Frankly,
I never understood that.

1696
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,042

about my life. They want my cooperation.

1698
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,253
Unless it's someone like Johnny Depp,
I've got some concerns.

1699
01:24:56,325 --> 01:25:00,057
Josh, you have some very serious
concerns but that's not one of them.

1700
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,563
Sidney Kornblum,
Mickey Ryder's attorney,

1701
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:05,396
is going to testify in court
that Mickey's admission of guilt

1702
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,561
to your charges was a lie.

1703
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:12,234
So, that pretty well takes care of
the recovered memory defense.

1704
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,672
I told you
it wouldn't work.

1705
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:15,471
Shut up, Dorie!

1706
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:19,742
Look, I never heard of Sidney
Kornblum. Who's gonna believe him?

1707
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:23,911
I am. You lied to me.
You lied under oath.

1708
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,383
And I am not willing
to deal with liars.

1709
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,948
Your mother was my friend.

1710
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:32,426
For her sake I tried
to believe you.

1711
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:35,191
Every time a damning piece
of evidence showed up,

1712
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:37,425
I tried to explain it away.

1713
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:41,025
But you not only killed her,
you defamed her.

1714
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:45,671
You defamed Mickey Ryder,
a decent man who loved you.

1715
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:51,245
You're beneath contempt.

1716

1717
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:58,484
Look, it wasn't my idea. I
didn't even want to do it.

1718
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,577
Shut up, Dorie!

1719
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:03,888
No! You're always saying that, like I
don't have a right to say what I want to.

1720
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:06,428
It was Josh who didn't
want to wait for the money.

1721
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,021
I kept telling him Mom was old,
it wouldn't be all that long,

1722
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,360
but you know
how impatient he is.

1723
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,868
And then he comes up with
that dumb story about Mickey.

1724
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:16,603
So, now, what do we do?

1725
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:19,537
I don't know, Dorie.

1726
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:22,943
Innocent or guilty, you're both
entitled to the best defense possible.

1727
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,844
But I'm not gonna be
the one to provide it.

01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:48,059
Yeah. But where else would

1818
01:31:48,136 --> 01:31:51,299
You know, to tell you the truth,
I'd be afraid to move.

1819
01:31:51,373 --> 01:31:53,865
Who knows what I'd miss?

1820
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:55,603
(BOTH LAUGHING)
