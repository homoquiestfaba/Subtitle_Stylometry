Megan!

00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,837
Megan!

00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,014
Megan!

Megan!

00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,906
Megan!

00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,531
Megan!

00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,167
Megan!

9
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,338
Megan!

10
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,930
Get up, get up.

11
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,228
We have to go outside.

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
What's the matter, baby?

13
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,227
OK, sweetheart, go check in the house,
see if she's in there.

14
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:30,451
Megan!

15
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,166
When's she gonna get back?

16
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,497
Oh, buddy, she's gonna come back.

17
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,708
You know, we'll put some, uh...

18
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,510
...some water in her bowl,
you know, and some food.

19
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,384
She's gonna get hungry. She's gonna
have to come back to eat, right?

20
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,385
I'm hungry right now. Are you hungry?

21
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,928
Mm-hmm.

22
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,480
You know, I'm so hungry,
I could just eat your hand.

23
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,484
Yeah. No, no, just let me
have a bite of your hand, OK?

24
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,436
Just one bite.

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,818
How come I can't have one bite?

26
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,023
Just one finger.

27
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,109
- No!
- You've got five of them.

28
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,455
OK, we got to be quiet
when we wake up Mommy, OK?

29
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,417
Do you want to get
thrown or do you want to get dropped?

30
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,996
I want to get next to Mommy.

31
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:29,047
...I'm gonna go on to Mommy,
then jump on the pillow.

32
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,633
No, no!

33
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,138
We're tigers!

34
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,978
I'm sleeping! Stop!

35
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,149
- It's too early.
- We're tigers!

36
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,726
- No.
- Yes.

37
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,150
Stop, stop. Stop.
Come on, I get to sleep in more.

38
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,530
No, make pretty music.

39
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,912
I must get my breakfast.

40
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,442
Here comes your oatmeal.
All right, picky.

41
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,615
That's beautiful. You ready to eat?

42
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,739
You gotta eat up, OK?
You can't be late today.

43
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,904
Blow on it first.

44
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,451
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you like it?

45
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,413
It just yucky. Aah!

46
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,211
Baby, what did you do?
You just put water in that?

47
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,879
- Yeah, it's instant oatmeal.
- Yeah, but you've got to soak the oats.

48
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,259
- They're fine.
- Yeah, it's delicious, you eat it.

49
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,808
Here, come on, let's eat like leopards.
That'll make it better.

50
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,136
Here, just eat the raisins OK?
At least.

51
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,193
Oh, come on. Dean, I don't
need to clean up after two kids.

52
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,020
Frankie, Frankie...

53
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,157
- Use a spoon, honey.
- What do you mean, use a spoon?

54
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,779
Come on, use a spoon.
You know how to use a spoon.

55
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,486
We're eating like leopards.
Hey, that's mine!

56
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,321
Show your daddy how you use a spoon.

57
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,452
You're a big girl now, huh?
You know how to use a spoon.

58
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,784
What do you mean
you're a big girl?

59
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,460
You're a big girl now, sweetheart,
so don't have any fun.

60
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,503
Stick it on your face.

61
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,251
Frankie,
we're leaving in two minutes.

62
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,925
Come on, don't eat like that, come on.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,254
Come on, come on. If that's the way
you're gonna eat, breakfast is over.

64
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,964
No! Dad was doing it!

65
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,175
I know your dad was doing it.
Come on, kiddo.

66
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,931
- I was doing it!
- Daddy,

67
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,011
- you made me in trouble!
- I'm sorry.

68
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,143
Let's go, let's go.
We're late, We're late. Come on.

69
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,775
You wanna wear this one?

70
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,820
- Yes.
- OK, but you have to be fast.

71
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,897
Ready? One...

72
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,985
...two... three... four...

73
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,537
...five... six...

74
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,205
...seven... We're gonna do it.

75
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,660
Eight! You did it in eight!

76
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,627
Whoopsies!

77
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,458
Silly Mommy.

78
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,294
Hey, Frankie, you gonna be good
for Ms. Alex today?

79
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,796
You promise?

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,225
- OK, I love you like crazy.
- I love you like crazy!

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,053
Oh, really?
'Cause I love you like crazy!

82
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,184
CK, guys, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

83
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,975
See you at the recital, Daddy!

84
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,774
Hey, Cin, put your seat belt on.

85
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,238
- Hey, Cindy, put your seat belt on.
- I got it.

86
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,365
Would you please put your seat belt on?

87
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,117
This road is crazy, all right?

88
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,663
Watch out for this guy.
Watch out for this fucking asshole.

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,249
Hey, fuck you! Why don't you
slow down, you fucking jackass!

90
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,506
Motherfucker!

91
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,751
You'll fucking kill somebody, asshole!

92
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,767
See this folder he gave me?
Yeah, I know.

93
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,226
- Hey, there you are.
- Oh, hi.

94
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,516
Sorry, I'm almost done here.

95
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,396
Did you get a...
Do you have a second?

96
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,729
- Yeah, sure.
- Did you get a chance to talk it over

97
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:22,818
- with your family yet?
- No, I mean, you know, I will. I will.

98
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,112
That's OK.

99
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,072
No pressure, it's just, you know,
it's just a good opportunity.

100
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,657
I'll know for sure by Monday.

101
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,289
By Monday? All right. I've got to have
my best nurse up there with me.

102
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,621
- Your first baby?
- So exciting.

103
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,798
Yeah, I know, isn't it?
Do you know what you're having yet?

104
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,625
- No.
- No?

105
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,006
Do you want to know
or are you going to wait for a surprise?

106
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,134
- We want to know.
- You want to know. Yeah.

107
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,181
- Having the baby is surprise enough.
- Yes.

108
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,556
Let's see... It's a girl.

109
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,849
Is that good news?

110
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,475
- It's great news.
- Oh, good.

111
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,267
...but it should
clear up by the afternoon.

112
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,651
This not gonna interfere
with your July Fourth plans...

113
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,482
...clear skies for the
fireworks tomorrow night.

114
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,488
And remember to dress warm, folks...

115
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,070
Fuck.

116
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,269
Excuse me.

117
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,040
OK, we have one more song left.

118
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,963
My Country, 'Tis of Thee.
It will be acapella.

119
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,460
What's wrong?

120
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,505
- You ready, ladies and gentlemen?
- Yes.

121
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,551
- I found Megan.
- ...five, six, ready, sing.

122
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,776
How many times did I tell you
to lock the fucking gate? Huh?

123
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,588
Hey, I had an idea...

124
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,380
I thought maybe you should
go visit your grandpa today.

125
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,591
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

126
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,764
Did you find Megan?

127
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,523
No.

128
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,352
But I was thinking maybe
she moved out to Hollywood,

129
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,654
and she became a movie dog.

130
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,863
You think? You think she moved out
to Hollywood to be a movie dog?

131
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,123
She had the looks, don't you think?
Maybe that's what happened, huh?

132
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,931
- Pa!
- Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

133
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,885
Here, look what I have for you.
Look at this.

134
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,106
Want me to show you a magic trick?

135
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,434
You coming up?

136
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,696
I can't smoke around the oxygen tank.

137
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,447
Oh!

138
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,704
- Honey?
- Hi, Gypsy.

139
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,828
Honey, go say bye-bye to Daddy, OK?

140
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,705
You're not gonna
see him until tomorrow.

141
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,958
Watch out for the water. Oh!
OK, go, you're clear!

142
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,332
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, buddy.

143
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,763
Hey, I love you.

144
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,090
- I love you.
- Have fun, OK, buddy?

145
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,508
OK.

146
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,434
You remember what to do
when Pa snores, right?

147
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,730
- Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
- That's my girl.

148
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,557
OK, go have fun.

149
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,642
All right, run to Mama!

150
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,478
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, sweetie pie.

151
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,777
Yay, that was great.

152
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,318
That was great.
All right, you ready to go inside?

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,738
So what's with him,
you two fighting again?

154
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,243
We'll talk about it later.

155
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,869
Why isn't Daddy
gonna come in?

156
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,992
I don't know.

157
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,730
- Mr. Benatti, good to meet you.
- Have a seat.

158
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,982
What kind of job are you applying for?

159
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,531
- Driver? Helper? Packer?
- Whatever, one that pays.

160
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,608
- Do you have any experience at all?
- Sure.

161
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,781
Where have you worked?

162
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,989
I mean, you know,
I've helped people move before.

163
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,448
You mean, what are my jobs?

164
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,783
But you've never worked
for a moving company?

165
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,992
No.

166
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,170
OK, so that would be "no experience."
Where are you from?

167
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,088
- Florida.
- And how long have you been here?

168
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,337
- Like two years.
- And where are you living?

169
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,340
- I live in Brooklyn.
- Can you get here every day?

170
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,013
- Yeah, I'll get here.
- I need you here by 7:00am.

171
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,340
I'll get here.

172
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,675
- Ready?
- Yeah.

173
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,852
- Hold it. There you go.
- All right, Marshall.

174
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,180
- Good job!
- You're a man amongst men. No homo!

175
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,316
Sit up, son! Sit up, sit up!

176
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,691
Don't worry about it. You ain't
a professional yet, that's all.

177
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,652
How do you meet girls?

178
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,700
I just walk up,
talk to them.

179
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,827
Whatever comes in my mind
at that moment.

180
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,533
- He honks the horn.
- I gets out of the truck.

181
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,539
I get out the truck and talk to 'em.

182
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,461
Or he screams out,
like, "chocolate thunder."

183
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,505
See, I don't know. I feel like
men are more romantic than women.

184
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,757
When we get married,
we marry, like, one girl.

185
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,716
'Cause we 're resistant the whole way,
until we meet one girl and we think,

186
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,552
"I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry
this girl, she's so great. ”

187
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,559
But it seems like girls get
to a place, they just kinda pick,

188
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,140
pick the best option or something.

189
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,067
I know girls that get married, they're
like, "Oh, he's got a good job."

190
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,395
I mean, they spend their whole life
looking for Prince Charming,

191
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,947
and then they... then they marry,
they marry the guy

192
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,741
that's got a good job
and who's gonna stick around.

193
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,115
Take your share and go home,
OK? Let's call it a good night.

194
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,411
Thanks, Jamie.

195
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,276
Lemme tell you something.
When I get old, I'm gonna look good.

196
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,780
When you get old,
you're gonna look like him.

197
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,533
What do you mean "when" you get old?

198
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,955
It's gonna be a long time,
another 50 years.

199
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,122
Damn, it look like
World War III in this motherfucker.

200
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,296
OK, look, box everything in
the kitchen, bag everything upstairs.

201
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,545
Let's get this truck loaded,
up to Pennsylvania and back by tonight.

202
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,255
- This is a small, small room here.
- Here we go.

203
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,009
How's all the stuff gonna fit in here?

204
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,006
it's probably not gonna,
so strip the furniture.

205
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,554
OK, I'll bring you boxes,
you start unpacking, placing.

206
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,849
Flatten all the cartons,
we'll get 'em outta here.

207
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,393
- What happens to all the other stuff?
- Not our problem.

208
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,458
Come on, come on,
speed it up, speed it up.

209
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,132
Gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go.

210
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,299
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

211
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,879
We gotta go.
We got another job to do, we gotta go.

212
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,425
Dean, you ready?
Let's get outta here, OK?

213
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,636
Job's over, here.
I'll give you your pay.

214
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,345
- One hundred...
- Damn.

215
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,898
One hundred and ten...
and 20 is part of your tip, OK?

216
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,648
Let's go, we've got
a two-hour ride back to the city.

217
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,564
Walter!

218
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,117
OK... Don't be mad.

219
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,537
I hung some of your stuff,
I hope it's OK.

220
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,912
You wanna walk in here?
You don't wanna get wheeled in here.

221
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,493
This is your new house.

222
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,712
I hung your uniform. I hope that's OK.

223
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,290
It's just so handsome, you know?

224
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,590
I noticed you had a lot of matches,
so I stuck 'em on the wall.

225
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,517
If you don't like it, you can
just take 'em down. It's tape.

226
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,351
Do you wanna sit down in the chair?

227
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,398
- OK.
- Please.

228
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,272
Here, let me get this out of your way.

229
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,400
You got it?

230
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,026
OK, Walter,
I'm gonna get in trouble, I gotta go,

231
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,736
but I'm gonna show you a few things, OK?
That's your shoes, see?

232
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,492
- Hey, Dean we gotta go, all right?
- Yo. OK.

233
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,323
- I'll meet you in the truck.
- OK.

234
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,792
And... He's not the boss of me,
by the way. What else?

235
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,374
All your stuffs in here.
That's your pants, sweaters, shirts.

236
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,461
Hey, Walter, is this your wife?
Is this you and your wife?

237
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,056
She was a beautiful woman.

238
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,676
OK, nice to meet ya.

239
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,270
- Thank you.
- Good luck here.

240
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,517
OK. I'll see ya down the road.

241
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,472
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,268
I know.

243
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,600
Don't be sorry, baby.

244
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,821
Oh, fuck.

245
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm just tired, you know.

246
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm just fucking tired.

247
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,712
Come here, boy!

248
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,380
Maybe it's because we didn't
make it comfy enough in there.

249
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,547
Maybe we made it too girly.

250
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,392
- Too girly?
- Yeah.

251
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,690
Well, I think it...
Maybe we just need to put something...

252
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,894
...like a nice blanket
in there for him to lay on.

253
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,820
- OK.
- You think that's a good idea?

254
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,068
- Yeah, let's get a blanket.
- OK, buddy.

255
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,368
But don't take
the one I usually do.

256
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,071
OK, you better ask your mom
which blanket's OK to use,

257
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,407
because I don't want to get in trouble.

258
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,244
- OK. Will you open this up?
- Watch your hands.

259
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,671
But close it quickly,
'cause the dog is in there.

260
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,007
Can you take the trash out?

261
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,460
Yeah. Baby, do you know
where we put that...

262
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,132
I got an idea.

263
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,062
Hello?

264
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,357
I'm calling to see if I can make
a reservation for tonight.

265
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,811
- I have a gift certificate.
- No.

266
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,567
What's our options?

267
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,951
They have Cupid's Cove room available.

268
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm not going to some cheesy sex motel.
I'm on call tomorrow.

269
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,827
What else? That's it?

270
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, and there's a Future Room.
Can you hold on one second?

271
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,295
- Baby, will you make the decision?
- I'm on call. I can't go.

272
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,462
Baby, please.

273
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,006
- Listen to me for a second.
- What do you want me to say?

274
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,085
Can you hold on one second?
Listen to me for a second.

275
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,421
Would you stop cleaning for one minute?

276
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,428
- What?
- I'm asking you. Please.

277
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,057
Let's get outta here.
We gotta get outta here.

278
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,689
Baby, we have to get out of this house.

279
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,063
Let's go get drunk and make love.

280
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,321
- Now, do you want the Cupid's Cove...
- Dean, I don't wanna...

281
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,528
...or do you want the Future Room?

282
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,368
Make a decision, baby, please.

283
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,166
I don't want to get in the car
at 7:30 and drive for two hours.

284
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,588
OK. I'll make the decision.
The Future Room.

285
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,841
For two.

286
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,047
- Periera.
- You're crazy.

287
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,807
Thanks.

288
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,814
Pack your bags, baby,
we're going to the future.

289
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,865
Oh, my God.
ls that Cindy Heller?

290
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:53,715
- Bobby Ontario?
- How are you?

291
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,260
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm... you know, I'm hanging in there.

292
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,340
Wow. Wow. it's been a while.

293
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,014
- How about you?
- Yeah, here.

294
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,317
Here. Been here,
stayed here, never left here.

295
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,520
Here's good, here's good.

296
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,072
- Married?
- Married.

297
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,117
- Married.
- That's crazy. Lucky guy.

298
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,159
Have you been faithful to him?

299
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,545
That's a strange question to ask
somebody you haven't seen in forever.

300
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,247
Yeah, well, you know...

301
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,048
- Seriously.
- Yes.

302
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,750
Yes you have, or yes you haven't?

303
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,461
Yes... I have, I mean, I have...
I have been...

304
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,886
Why are you looking at me like that?

305
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,845
I'm not looking at you like anything.

306
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,933
Oh, OK.

307
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,188
- Yeah.
- Uh.

308
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,618
Come on, let's go.

309
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,697
Let's go.

310
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,877
What you thinking?

311
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,049
What's on your mind?

312
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,059
You're never gonna guess
who I saw at the liquor mart.

313
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,523
- Richard Grieco?
- No, but good guess.

314
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,478
Jon Bon Jovi.

315
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,109
Bobby Ontario.

316
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,379
What the fuck was he doing there?

317
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,333
I don't know...
I mean, buying liquor, I guess.

318
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,428
Jesus.

319
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,804
- How come you're just telling me now?
- 'Cause I'm telling you now.

320
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,260
How come you didn't tell me
when we were there?

321
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,347
I don't know, 'cause I was flustered
and I'm telling you now.

322
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,353
- You talked to him?
- No. I mean like,

323
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,187
- "Hi, bye, how are you..."
- How are you?

324
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,775
- Yeah, he asked me how I was.
- And you told him?

325
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:28,202
I mean, I didn't want to,
but we were stuck there.

326
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,281
We were in the same store,
buying things together at the same time.

327
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:38,333
I wish you'd seen him. I wish you'd...
You wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...

328
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,210
- What do I care?
- I don't know.

329
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,041
What do I care if he's fat or not?

330
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,633
What does that mean?
Make me feel better?

331
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,635
I don't know. 'Cause he's a loser.

332
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,726
What does that have to do with me?

333
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,600
Whether he's a loser or he's fat or not?
What the fuck do I care?

334
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,101
I don't... What!?

335
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:02,904
What are you saying that for? That
would make me feel better, he's fat?

336
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,027
So what? If he was in good shape,
I shouldn't feel good?

337
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,154
I said the wrong thing.
I'm nervous, OK?

338
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,826
- What do you mean you're nervous?
- I feel funny, because you feel funny.

339
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,459
You're nervous 'cause I feel funny?

340
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,001
- What does that mean?
- I feel like I said the wrong thing.

341
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,378
I feel like I shouldn't have
said anything.

342
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,335
Really? That's an option?

343
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,549
You run into Bobby Ontario
and it's an option not to tell me?

344
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,269
I feel like you're upset,
and I upset you and I'm sorry.

345
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,062
And I said the wrong thing.

346
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,941
Baby... you can do whatever you want.

347
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,361
OK.

348
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,321
I'm sorry.

349
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,037
Fuck.

350
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,628
- What are you doing?
- I gotta pee.

351
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,176
- Where, in this person's house?
- Fuck you.

352
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,799
Fuck me.

353
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,471
Hi.

354
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,847
- What are you doing?
- Research.

355
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,643
Really, research.

356
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,693
So what, I mean,
you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

357
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,564
No, quads can't use their arms.
I'm a paraplegic.

358
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,483
Really?

359
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,370
Hi.

360
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,253
Why do you have to act like
such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?

361
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,171
Come over.

362
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,546
- Come on.
- I can't.

363
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,844
- I can't.
- You know you want it.

364
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,013
I gotta go get Gramma.

365
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,640
I just came to say hi.

366
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,731
- Call you later.
- Yeah. Whatever!

367
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,270
- Oh! I thought you were Dad.
- Just us.

368
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:35,233
- How was the beauty parlor?
- Oh, lovely, just lovely.

369
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,612
Good.

370
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,949
What did it feel like
when you fell in love?

371
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,868
Ooh...

372
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,286
Oh, dear.

373
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,956
I don't think I found it.

374
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,630
Even with Grandpa?

375
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,762
Maybe a little in the beginning.

376
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,887
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

377
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:05,437
He didn't really have
any regard for me as a person.

378
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,765
You've gotta be careful of that.

379
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:11,728
You've gotta be careful that
the person that you fall in love...

380
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,605
...is worth it to you.

381
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,240
I don't ever want
to be like my parents.

382
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,869
I know that they must have loved
each other at one time, right?

383
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,417
Did they just get it all out of the way
before they had me?

384
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,790
We're supposed to
eat this garbage?

385
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,125
Huh?!

386
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,752
I'm sorry.

387
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,922
- Do you want me to make you some eggs?
- No!

388
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,018
I want you to enjoy
your goddamned dinner!

389
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,309
How do you trust your feelings
when they can just disappear like that?

390
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:59,734
I think the only way you can
find out is... to have the feeling.

391
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,320
You're a good person, honey.

392
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,909
I think you have the right to say,
"Yes, I do trust. "

393
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,786
"I trust myself. "

394
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,322
What?

395
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,991
What, what?

396
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,831
- Fuck!
- Shit.

397
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,667
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

398
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,708
"Somehow, she didn't want to
confess to him that she was still wary

399
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,461
of all those people who'd
seemed to want to care about her.

400
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,260
He touched her cheek gently,
caressing her.

401
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,053
Her heart was beating so loudly
that surely he could hear it. ”

402
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,634
Arms up.

403
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,139
"He smoothed her hair back,

404
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,722
the touch of his fingers sending
waves of awareness through her.

405
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,979
He was going to kiss her.
That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

406
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,562
So why did she feel as if she trembled
on the edge of a precipice,

407
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,693
ready to topple over in an instant?

408
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:07,073
Then his lips found hers
and she stopped thinking at all,

409
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,996
only feeling,
feeling the tenderness of his kiss,

410
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,915
the strength of his arms around her...

411
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:19,002
...the steady beat of his heart under
her hand as she turned into his arms.

412
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,008
There is a precipice,
and she was falling.

413
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,962
Head over heels.
Falling in love with him.

414
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,213
Chapter 11 ..."

415
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,094
Hi.

416
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,096
- Hi.
- Hi.

417
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,349
- I want a cigarette.
- No, Gramma, it's bedtime.

418
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,684
You're in bed.
You can't have a cigarette now, OK?

419
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,940
Do you want me
to keep reading or are you tired?

420
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,442
I need a cigarette!

421
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,477
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

422
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,482
Why?

423
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,815
You think I stole that money, don't you?

424
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,235
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

425
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,912
Look, I've stolen money before, OK?
I know what it's like to get busted.

426
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,285
- That's what it feels like.
- OK.

427
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,412
I didn't steal it. I got a job.

428
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,244
- OK? This is my job.
- All right.

429
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,295
- All right? I make money.
- OK, I got it.

430
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,170
Money I can take girls out
on dates with.

431
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,462
Just so you know.

432
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,052
Good to know. OK.

433
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,645
- What's your name?
- Go away.

434
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,064
- "Go away"?
- Go away.

435
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,732
That's a weird name.

436
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,893
OK, hold on a second.

437
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:10,068
I wanna give you something.
Look at that. That's my business card.

438
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,951
I don't have a phone...
or a phone number,

439
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,954
but if you call
this number right here...

440
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,165
...and then you ask for me...

441
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,417
- ...they'll tell me you called.
- Great.

442
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,169
Who should I say is calling?

443
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,146
Whoa!

444
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,565
Where are we, huh?

445
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,946
We're inside a robot's vagina.

446
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,209
Was this the only one
that they had?

447
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:06,336
I told you, you know...
they had Cupid's Cove or this.

448
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,212
You want me to see
if we can get Cupid's Cove?

449
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,634
I'm gonna make a drink.

450
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,925
There's no windows.

451
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,557
Cool bed, huh? Check this out.

452
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,317
Whoa!

453
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,565
The bed turns.
Hey, did you see this?

454
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,570
Hey.

455
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,156
Hey, look at me.

456
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,661
I don't think that there's a fridge.

457
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,592
Hey, that's how they laugh
in the future. Like this...

458
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,344
Oh, God.

459
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:01,099
I thought the whole point of coming here
was to have a night without kids.

460
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,899
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

461
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,272
Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.
She wants to talk to you.

462
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,780
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie!

463
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,704
Yes.

464
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,249
OK, honey. Don't forget
to go potty before you get into bed, OK?

465
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,416
Bye... Bye, I love you!

466
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,293
Frankie, this is
how they laugh in the future.

467
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,672
Try it.

468
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,632
Huh?

469
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,514
Frankie, are you tooting?
Is that you tooting?

470
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,270
Frankie... I can hear...

471
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,832
I love you like crazy. I gotta go, OK?

472
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,538
Kiss, kiss.

473
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,502
Bye-bye.

474
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,802
What are you doing?

475
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,684
What? What's it look like I'm doing?

476
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,022
Getting all wet and naked.

477
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,531
I'm gonna go order some food.
Do you want some?

478
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,153
You know what I like.

479
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,160
Can you close the door?

480
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,752
Oh.

481
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,972
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

482
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,041
All right.

483
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,460
Come up.

484
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,333
Come up.

485
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,705
What are you so grumpy about?

486
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,499
Oh, I don't know. I don't know why.

487
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,886
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

488
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,922
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

489
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,099
You're Gramma.
It's great to meet you.

490
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,926
Cindy, come on.

491
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,229
Could you talk to me
for five minutes, please?

492
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,977
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

493
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,933
Gramma, you know you have
an amazing granddaughter?

494
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,485
- Oh, of course I do.
- She's unbelievable.

495
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,697
I got these for you.
Would you please take them?

496
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,778
Cindy, come on,
would you give me five minutes?

497
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,739
This is ridiculous.
You're not even gonna talk to me?

498
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,665
Come on, Cindy.

499
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,419
I'm trying to say I'm sorry,
and you're acting like a total bitch!

500
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,630
I don't know, I just
feel like I should just stop...

501
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,221
You know, just stop thinking
about it, but I can't.

502
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,182
Maybe I've seen too many movies,
you know, love at first sight.

503
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,726
- Anyone call?
- No.

504
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,982
Thanks.

505
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,650
What do you think
about love at first sight?

506
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,318
You think you can love somebody
just by looking at 'em?

507
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,112
- By looking at 'em?
- But the thing is, man,

508
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,942
I felt like I knew her. You know?
You ever get that feeling?

509
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,904
Yeah, like, you've seen her
before and you just know her...

510
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,120
- Yeah.
- it's a feeling.

511
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,911
But, actually,
you really don't know her.

512
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,545
- Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?
- That's right.

513
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:35,215
- I felt like I did, though.
- If you get a little pussy...

514
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,510
...I think all the mental-ness
will go away from you.

515
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,266
You think
I'm too much in my head?

516
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,687
Yeah, too much.

517
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,692
You already know
where she live at, right?

518
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,395
No, she was just, like,
visiting her grandmother.

519
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,778
So why don't you go back
to that grandmother...

520
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,612
- ...and ask her where she lives?
- I should go back, right?

521
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,579
Yeah. if you like her; yeah.

522
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,203
She just seems different,
you know? I don't know.

523
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,159
Wait. How different?

524
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,999
I don't know,
I just got a feeling about her.

525
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,296
You know when a song comes on
and you just gotta dance?

526
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,748
- Hi.
- Hi.

527
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,959
Do you know
what happened to Walter?

528
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,966
- Who?
- Walter.

529
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:01,350
He's the gentlemen that just moved in
across the hall about a month ago.

530
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,559
I don't know anything
or anybody named Walter.

531
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,223
Oh.

532
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,814
OK.

533
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,522
Hey, can I ask you something else?

534
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,657
What's the story with that girl
that was in here like a month ago?

535
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,112
The blonde, the young blonde?

536
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,290
I gave her my card,
but she never called me.

537
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,625
What's her name ?

538
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,787
- Cindy.
- Cindy.

539
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,420
- Will you tell her I say hi?
- OK. Why not.

540
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,433
Shit.

541
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,425
Do you think I could sit down,
because all these other seats are taken.

542
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,302
- OK.
- Hey, thanks.

543
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,680
You know, I just talked
to your grandmother.

544
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,025
That sounds weird, huh?

545
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,023
- Yeah.
- OK, let me put it into context.

546
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,448
I went out there to see Walter,
who's not there anymore.

547
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,360
That's why I talked to her.

548
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,866
Do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

549
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,539
Yeah, do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

550
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,290
No, I don't know what happened
to that guy, Walter.

551
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,712
What happened?

552
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,717
You gotta do it like that?

553
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,221
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

554
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,641
They're old.
Would you want to live like that?

555
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,718
- Like what? In that home?
- Yeah.

556
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,897
Well, no but I'm not getting old
and he's a dummy for dying.

557
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,937
- Walter's a dummy for dying?
- Yeah.

558
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,235
What are you gonna do,
wise guy?

559
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,311
Not do it.

560
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,818
- Are you gonna die?
- Definitely.

561
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,984
Hmm?

562
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,455
- What'd you say?
- I said definitely.

563
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,532
Well, with that
kind of attitude, you will.

564
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,456
Don't do it. it's for suckers.

565
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,704
Don't do it.

566
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,624
- What are you gonna do?
- Just not do it.

567
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,883
I went out there to give him this.

568
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,836
Isn't that nice? I found it.

569
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,259
Look at that.

570
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,349
- Is that him?
- Yeah, and his lady.

571
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,178
- isn't he handsome?
- Look at her, she's so pretty.

572
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,893
So she's probably nuts, then.

573
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,565
In my experience, the prettier
a girl is, the more nuts she is.

574
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,323
Which makes you insane.

575
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,865
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.

576
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,659
It's not your fault.
You know, it's just like...

577
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,504
Everybody treats you different.

578
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,458
Like, you make jokes and they're
not funny, but people laugh anyway.

579
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,042
That's gotta make you nuts.

580
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,347
I like how you can compliment
and insult somebody at the same time.

581
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,924
In equal measure.

582
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,725
What's an insult about that?

583
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,561
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.

584
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,436
Well... I don't know if you're
not funny, tell me a joke.

585
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,025
So there's a child molester
and a little boy walking into the woods.

586
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:48,031
The child molester and the little boy
keep walking further and further,

587
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,738
and it's getting darker and darker
and they're going deeper and deeper

588
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,040
into the woods and the child molester...

589
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,244
...and the little boy looks up
at the child molester and he says,

590
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,295
"Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"

591
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,213
And the child molester
looks down at him and says,

592
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,418
"You think you're scared, kid?
I gotta walk outta here alone."

593
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,635
You don't think that's funny?

594
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,274
- No, I'm sorry.
- I do.

595
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,686
You get along
with your grandma, huh?

596
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,487
Yeah, she makes me laugh.

597
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,611
Nobody else talks in my family.
And when they talk, they just yell.

598
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,950
I'm never getting married.

599
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,788
This is a nice place, you live.
You like it?

600
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,999
- It's all right.
- Where you wanna go?

601
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,926
I wanna go away to school.

602
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,968
- What are you gonna study?
- Medicine.

603
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,933
Really?

604
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,931
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, right.

605
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,512
Yeah, right.

606
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:00,566
Girls like you... Girls that look like
you don't go and study medicine.

607
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,143
What do I look like?

608
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,147
Girls like you are Supermodels.

609
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,318
- You got any, like, talents?
- Like hidden talents?

610
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,486
Uh...

611
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,497
That's all the presidents.

612
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,901
That was rad.

613
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,369
Can you dance?

614
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,783
- You can tap dance?
- Can you?

615
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,871
No. Here, I'll play a song
and you dance.

616
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,670
OK?

617
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,344
Come here.

618
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,926
Come here, like this.

619
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,478
Right here, behind the heart.
In front of the heart.

620
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,263
OK.

621
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,815
I can't really sing.

622
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,065
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid.

623
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,230
- OK?
- OK.

624
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,608
You're actually good.

625
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,612
OK, slow dance.

626
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,197
Slow dance to this part.

627
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,186
Whooo!

628
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,324
You're not gonna eat that?

629
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,456
Why don't you do something?

630
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,838
What do you mean?

631
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,541
I don't know.

632
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,595
What does that mean?

633
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,300
- Why don't I do something?
- isn't there something you want to do?

634
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,180
There something you want to do?

635
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,767
- Like what?
- I don't know.

636
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,941
You're so good at so many things,
you could do anything you wanted to do,

637
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,111
you're good at everything that you do,
isn't there something else you wanna do?

638
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,531
Than what? Than be your
husband? To be Frankie's dad?

639
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,404
What do you want me to do?

640
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,451
What... In your, like, dream scenario,

641
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,700
of me, like, doing what I'm good at,
what would that be?

642
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,578
I don't know,
you're so good at so many things,

643
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,785
you can do so many things,
you have such capacity.

644
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,245
For what?

645
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,423
You can sing, you can draw, you can...

646
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,424
...dance.

647
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:01,133
Listen, I didn't
wanna be somebody's husband.

648
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:02,971
OK?

649
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,647
And I didn't wanna be somebody's dad.
That wasn't my goal in life.

650
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,816
Some guys it is... Wasn't mine.

651
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:17,865
But somehow, I've...
It was what I wanted.

652
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,317
I didn't know that.

653
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,576
And it's all I wanna do...
I don't want to do anything else.

654
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,376
That's what I want to do.
I work so I can do that.

655
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,247
I'd like to see you have a job
where you didn't have to start drinking

656
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,957
at eight o'clock
in the morning to go to it.

657
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,214
No, I have a job that I can drink
at eight o'clock in the morning.

658
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,716
What a luxury, you know?

659
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,512
I get up for work, I have a beer,
I go to work, I paint somebody's house,

660
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,140
they're excited about it,
I come home, I get to be with you.

661
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,438
What's... like... This is the dream.

662
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,020
It doesn't ever disappoint you?

663
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,272
Why? Why would it disappoint me?

664
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,355
- Because you have all this potential.
- I could still do whatever I could do.

665
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,862
So what? Why do you have to
fucking make money off your potential?

666
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,659
Look, I'm not even saying
you have to make money off it.

667
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,658
- Don't you miss it?
- What does even potential mean?

668
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,786
What does that mean, potential?
Potential for what?

669
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,169
To turn it into what?

670
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:20,044
We rarely sit down and have an adult
conversation, because every time we do

671
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:24,223
you take what I say and you turn it
around into something I didn't mean.

672
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,599
You just... twist it.

673
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,815
Start blabbing,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

674
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,895
If you're not interested
in what I have to say,

675
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,356
then maybe I just
shouldn't say anything.

676
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,820
That's funny, huh?

677
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,247
What's funny about that?

678
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,838
Good luck. I...

679
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,424
I'd like to see you think
about what you say,

680
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,299
instead of saying what you think
all the time. Good luck, give it a try!

681
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,349
What do you mean?

682
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,482
- You wanna fight me?
- Yeah, I wanna fight you.

683
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,201
- OK, there you go.
- On your back.

684
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,620
On your back, motherfucker!

685
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,330
Ow.

686
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,628
Cheers, you're the best.

687
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,471
You drunk? You drunk, drunk?

688
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,298
Don't go to sleep, hey.

689
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:53,684
Don't go to sleep, OK? Stay awake.

690
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,891
Hey, look at me, look at me,
look at me. You awake?

691
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,020
You awake? Yeah? OK.

692
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,113
I gotta pee my diddy, I'll be back.

693
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,047
Ah!

694
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,170
- Are you OK?
- Come here!

695
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,383
I may or may not have fallen.

696
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,717
Come here!

697
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,145
Come here! Come here!

698
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,975
- Fuck.
- Hey, beautiful, come here.

699
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,652
Give me a hand.
Help me back into the future.

700
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,696
- Come here.
- Give me your hand.

701
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,990
- Get up.
- This is funny.

702
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,611
Come here. Come on down here.

703
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,788
- Ow!
- Probably a big mistake.

704
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,163
- OW.
- That is a... That is a huge mistake.

705
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,457
- Ow!

706
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,835
Come here, you saucy little minx.

707
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,427
You are so beautiful.

708
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,514
You are so beautiful.

709
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,107
Do you wanna have another baby with me?

710
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,564
Hmm?

711
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,277
Will you have another baby with me?

712
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,818
Do you want to make a baby with me?

713
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,117
I want to have a baby with you.

714
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,579
- Stop.
- Stop what?

715
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,911
- Stop. Stop.
- What? Shh.

716
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,751
Shut your beautiful mouth.

717
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,298
Shut it. Come here.

718
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,018
Fuck. Ouch!

719
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,943
What are you doing, huh?

720
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,650
What's the matter with you? Come here.

721
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,074
Baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby...

722
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,593
Would you cut it out?
Would you fucking stop it?

723
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,851
Come on, stop, stop, stop!
What's going...'? What are you doing?

724
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,061
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

725
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,025
It hurts!

726
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,946
What do you want?

727
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,777
How much rejection
am I supposed to take?

728
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,614
You know, I deserve
a little bit of affection.

729
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,621
I'm good to you. I'm good to you
and I'm good to Frankie,

730
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,668
and I love you. I don't deserve this.

731
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,756
What are you doing? What do you want?

732
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,379
That's how you want it?

733
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,597
This is how you want it?

734
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,146
This is how you want it? Come on.

735
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,686
OK.

736
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,860
OK. OK. Come here.

737
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,960
Baby, I can't do it.

738
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:54,132
I can't do it like this, baby.

739
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,138
Baby, baby, baby...

740
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,136
I can't fucking do it like this.

741
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,937
Stop it. Stop.

742
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:07,061
Stop. Don't give me this shit,

743
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,643
this fuckin', like,
"you can have my body," bullshit.

744
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,569
I don't want that. I want you.

745
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,194
I'm not gonna do it like this.
What, do you want me to rape you?

746
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,195
- I want you to stop.
- Is that what you want?

747
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,026
- Stop it.
- You want me to hit you?

748
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,203
- Stop it.
- What's the matter with you?

749
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,155
Fucking stop it!

750
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,412
- You want me to hit you?
- Yeah, hit me.

751
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,743
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

752
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,919
Would that make it OK
for you to treat me like this?

753
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,917
Yeah, that's what I want, baby. Hit me.

754
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,589
- Come on, hit me.
- Is that what you want?

755
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,714
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna fuckin' do it!

756
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,299
OK?

757
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:41,091
I don't give a shit how much
you want it, I'm not gonna do it.

758
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,558
OK, I'm not gonna do it!

759
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,561
I'm not gonna do it.

760
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:53,145
You want me to hit you?
I'm not gonna do it! I love you.

761
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,237
OK?

762
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,940
Let me out.

763
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,444
Open the door. Open the door.

764
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,912
Open the door.

765
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,449
Open the door.

766
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,001
Hey! Open this door!

767
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,922
Hey! Open the door!

768
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,380
Open the door!

769
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,470
Hey!

770
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,131
Open the door!

771
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,509
Can you open the door?

772
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,429
Can you open the door?

773
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,311
Go.

774
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,994
No. No!

775
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,585
OW... ow. OW.

776
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,711
What is going on? What kind
of operation are you running...

777
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,421
- Stop.
- ...around here?

778
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,007
OK.

779
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,324
Do not touch
the young lady in my taxi!

780
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,491
Please, sir!
Don't touch her back there, please?

781
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:33,420
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Come on! Why not?

782
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,544
Sir! Please there's no sex in my taxi!

783
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,297
Do not touch the young lady in my taxi!

784
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,754
I'll have you know that she was
putting the moves on me.

785
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,965
That's not true.
Would you believe a face like this?

786
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,551
- That doesn't...
- Look at that face. Look at that face.

787
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,729
I will not have you trying
something that's wrong in my car!

788
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:51,930
What's wrong?

789
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,107
This is my car,
this is like my home.

790
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,059
You're in my home now, OK?

791
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,895
It's not my business
what you do with this girl,

792
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,072
but you're not gonna do it in my cab.

793
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,839
Oh, God.

794
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,795
God. Oh, no, no, no.

795
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,132
No, no, no, no, no...

796
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,636
No.

797
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,024
Oh, my God.

798
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,818
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

799
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,909
Good job.

800
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,911
Hi.

801
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,386
Hi.

802
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:14,800
You OK?

803
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,348
Yeah, you OK?

804
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,439
Yeah, you OK?

805
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,693
You gonna talk to me or what?

806
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,696
You gonna tell me what's goin' on?

807
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:38,740
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I don't know what you want me to say.

808
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,871
I want you to tell me what's going on.
I wanna know.

809
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,832
You got me feeling sick, you know?

810
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,003
I'm very intuitive.

811
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,963
I know there's something up.

812
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,637
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, you're not gonna tell me?

813
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,311
Stop! Stop, stop! No, no, no, stop!

814
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,109
- You gonna tell me?
- Stop! Come down!

815
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,404
- You gonna tell me?
- Just come down! I'm not kidding you!

816
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,232
- You're gonna tell me what it is?
- Come... Please come down!

817
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,192
Come down. Please... Please stop.

818
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,744
- You want me to go over the edge?
- No, I want you to come down!

819
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,617
- Tell me what it is.
- Come on, it's dangerous!

820
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,698
- You gonna tell me?
- No!

821
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,160
No, stop! Please come on!

822
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,371
Please! I'm pregnant!
Stop, come back, please!

823
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,757
Please come down. Please come down.

824
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,606
Is it mine?

825
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,938
- I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

826
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,944
Maybe.

827
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,573
- Maybe?
- Probably not.

828
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,833
What are you gonna do?

829
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,796
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

830
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,383
I don't know...

831
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,011
You're gonna have it? You're not
gonna have it? What are you gonna do?

832
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,803
- You thought about this?
- I don't know.

833
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:26,439
You don't know?

834
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:44,616
You've opted for our
vacuum-aspiration abortion today.

835
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,997
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

836
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:52,253
They're sensitive in nature,
so if at any time, you're uncomfortable,

837
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,174
you just let me know, OK?

838
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:02,058
At what age were you
when you first had intercourse?

839
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,013
- Thirteen.
- OK.

840
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,103
That's not unusual.

841
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,444
OK, and how many sexual partners

842
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:21,027
would you say you've had
from when you first began?

843
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,326
Maybe...

844
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,871
...twenty... twenty...

845
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,049
- ...twenty-five?
- GK.

846
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,969
Do you know
which partner you were with

847
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,217
at the time that you became pregnant?

848
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,556
CK. And is that partner
supportive to you?

849
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,720
Um...

850
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,812
No. OK.

851
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:05,739
Good, all right, now I'm gonna
put my hand on your belly...

852
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,368
...and then I'm gonna
introduce a finger.

853
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,669
You're gonna feel it.
OK, there you are.

854
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,621
All right...

855
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,253
That's it, OK, good.

856
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,337
Deep breathing. That's it.
All right, I feel the uterus.

857
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,390
Indeed, it's probably
11 and a half, 12 weeks.

858
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,684
It's in a safe position
for the procedure.

859
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:32,107
OK, I'm gonna insert a speculum.
it's gonna cause some pressure.

860
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,977
Here it goes, this is it.

861
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:39,064
That's it. I know it's uncomfortable.
I know it's uncomfortable.

862
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:43,697
But as much as you can relax,
the easier it goes, OK.

863
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,074
It's set right where I need to have it.

864
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:49,157
Good work. Keep that breathing.

865
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,493
- You're making me breathe hard.
- You're doing great.

866
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:56,082
The next thing I'm gonna do is I
want to give you some local anesthesia.

867
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,712
It's a little uncomfortable,
so what I want you to do...

868
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,673
Right now, I'm gonna
give you the first injection.

869
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,754
Take a giant breath and cough.

870
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:07,012
Go ahead. Breath... Cough.

871
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,141
OK, fine, fine, fine.

872
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,226
OK. I'm just gonna
put that down and let it take effect.

873
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:21,781
Breathe deeply, slowly, deeply...

874
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,243
What I'm gonna do
is apply an instrument,

875
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:28,037
so I can hold the cervix still.

876
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,661
Shouldn't feel this.
Maybe a little pressure.

877
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,914
- I can't.
- Oh, sweetheart, are you OK?

878
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,336
Cindy?

879
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,081
- Stop.
- OK. OK.

880
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,134
- Stop.
- OK, I'm sorry and I will stop.

881
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:46,924
All right, you wanna sit up?
OK, all right.

882
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:51,682
You want me to just stop
the whole procedure, is that correct?

883
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,605
All right, I'm gonna step out.

884
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,523
- Felicia...
- Yeah.

885
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,357
- Do you wanna put your things back on?
- Can I see my...?

886
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,319
- Can I see my friend?
- Sure, honey.

887
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,414
Let's do it.

888
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,500
Let's be a family.

889
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,348
Let's be a family.

890
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,288
You don't have to do this,
you know.

891
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,371
It's not your fault.

892
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,961
I love you.

893
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,457
I love you, too.

894
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,486
Hey, it's me Cindy. Hi.

895
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,909
We need you to come in...

896
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,958
Who else did you call?

897
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:22,663
- I called Janet, and I called...
- I'm out of town, too.

898
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,749
What time is it? What time is it?

899
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,132
Six, seven, eight, nine...

900
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,554
Nine o'clock.

901
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,968
If I'm there at nine?
I'm coming if I'm there at nine.

902
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:39,239
Cindy!

903
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,202
Cin!

904
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,163
I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

905
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,256
Yo.

906
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,459
This is your 11:00am wake up call.

907
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,920
OK. Thank you.

908
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:23,832
Cin?

909
01:18:55,522 --> 01:19:00,779
Yeah. Um...

910
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,656
Where's the nearest bus station?

911
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:38,191
Sunday, 11:16 pm...

912
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:43,571
I just want to say to you,
thanks for making all bets off

913
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:47,033
and for freeing me of my human decency.

914
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,335
All your shit is going in the trash.

915
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,754
All your books
are gonna get fucking ripped up.

916
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:54,457
You want to go to war? I mean,
we’ll go to wan we'll see who wins.

917
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,716
I know who the fucker is, OK?
And I'm gonna destroy him.

918
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,344
Sunday, 11:58pm.

919
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,051
You probably don't even know
what you did.

920
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,637
I want you to hear something, OK?

921
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,395
I have never... I have never
cursed at a girl in my life.

922
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,645
Fuck you!

923
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,812
Fuck you, bitch!

924
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,527
Do you understand that?

925
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:22,610
I'm gonna find him
and I’m gonna fuck his ass up!

926
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,321
I hope he looks so beautiful to you...

927
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:29,500
I hope he looks so beautiful
to you when I'm done.

928
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,077
Do you hear me?

929
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,331
End of messages.

930
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,129
Hey.

931
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,471
Hey, I'm looking for Dean.

932
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,097
For Dean. I'm looking for Dean.
You know where he's at?

933
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,050
- Yeah, I'm Dean.
- Oh, OK.

934
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,606
Your little boy's
gonna call me Daddy from now on.

935
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,081
Fuck you! Bitch!

936
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,258
- Such a little bitch. Pussy.
- Piece of shit!

937
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,382
- Fuck him up.
- Bitch!

938
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,010
You fuckin' piece of shit!

939
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,511
Fucking pussy!

940
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,126
Dr. Feinberg's Office. Mm-hmm.
OK, when were you looking to come in?

941
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,137
Oh! Busy! Haven't sat down yet.

942
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,964
What do you have?
Can you walk with me?

943
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,426
I've got a woman in five, Hispanic...
Excuse me.

944
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,308
Doesn't speak much English, and she's
complaining of pain in her left breast.

945
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,937
All right, I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, hey, you know what I was thinking?

946
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:02,987
I realize it might be hard for you to
move the whole family up to Riverdale,

947
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,654
'cause your daughter's
still in school and everything,

948
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,153
and I thought maybe
you get an apartment.

949
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,985
You know, work during the week,
drive home on the weekends.

950
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,706
Wouldn't have to worry about being
lonely. We could hang out together.

951
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,578
You know, get dinner sometimes.

952
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,837
Anyway, that was not a proposition.

953
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,414
- It was just...
- I'm married.

954
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,751
Just trying to... Just trying to help.

955
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,463
I thought you wanted me there
because I'm good at my job.

956
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:29,922
Yeah, I thought...

957
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,843
Anyway... I'll see you in a minute.

958
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,037
I can't do that over the phone.
I can't do it over the phone.

959
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,208
Hold on, please.

960
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:03,539
Sir, could you just fill that out and
when you're done bring it back up to me?

961
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,716
I don't need this.

962
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,589
Could you hold on just
one second, please?

963
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,670
- OK, thank you.
- I was looking for my wife.

964
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,807
- I don't need that.
- OK, and who is your wife?

965
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,477
- Cynthia.
- Oh, you must be Dean.

966
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,566
OK, yeah, let me get her,
she'll be right with you.

967
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,859
Cindy, sweetie,
you have a visitor.

968
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,991
- Who?
- it's your husband.

969
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,536
I think he's been drinking.

970
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,961
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are.

971
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,879
What are you doing here?

972
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:48,716
Oh, well, you're awful friendly
right now, aren't ya?

973
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:53,089
- No, I'm just surprised to see you.
- Oh, this is where the smiles happen.

974
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,674
This the smile room? Huh?

975
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,102
You take off, you leave me,
you don't tell me what's going on?

976
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,807
I was so goddamn worried, I thought
something might of happened to Frankie!

977
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,358
- I don't know what the hell happened.
- Meems, can you give me a few?

978
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,902
- You just take off like that?
- I'll be right here if you need me.

979
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,775
Yeah, Meems, can you give her a few?

980
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,731
I don't know if there's an emergency...
You're just gone!

981
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,658
- Frankie's fine. Come on, lets go.
- Well, good to know.

982
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,361
Cindy, I'm here if you need me.

983
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,867
- OK, come on, let's go.
- Don't let him brainwash you.

984
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,495
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- "Don't let him brainwash you"?

985
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,372
Can you give me a hand?

986
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,502
Oh, God...

987
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,840
Look, OK, I know everything
got fucked up last night.

988
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,096
OK?

989
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,301
Can't believe you'd show up here drunk.

990
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,478
Hey, I'm talking to you!

991
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,315
- Hey. I know that...
- Can you drive?

992
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,392
- What?
- I said can you drive?

993
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,524
What do you mean?
What kinda question is that?

994
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:51,321
Of course I can drive.
I know how to drive...

995
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,444
Take the keys, go home.

996
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,821
You don't even care
if I fuckin' can drive.

997
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,869
You'd love it if I got in
a goddamned accident.

998
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:00,572
Yeah, I'd love it.
I'd just love it, you're so right.

999
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,205
That's the point. You don't
have any goddamned time anymore.

1000
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,910
It all goes to this fucking place.

1001
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,496
And these fucking people
don't give a shit about you.

1002
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,503
- Do they? Hey!
- Just go home!

1003
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,300
Hey, come here for a second,
I'm gonna come in there!

1004
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:16,381
I'm gonna come in!
All right, I'm coming.

1005
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:23,016
Just have a seat and we'll be
with you as soon as we can, OK?

1006
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,597
Thank you.

1007
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,151
- Are you OK? Is he gone?
- I fucking hate him.

1008
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,731
Why don't you just give her
a couple of minutes?

1009
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,532
No. Dean, you can't come back here.

1010
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,200
- Oh, God.
- Dean...

1011
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,572
- You can't be back here.
- It's OK, you're OK.

1012
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,871
I can't do this,
I can't take this shit.

1013
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,203
- Come outside with me.
- Dean, I cannot take this shit anymore.

1014
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,083
- Just come outside.
- I cannot take this shit.

1015
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,132
I am not going outside with you.
I've had it!

1016
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,209
- I've had it. I've had it.
- Come and talk to me...

1017
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,136
I am up to here!
I'm done, OK? I'm done!

1018
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,930
- Let's go outside...
- I'm done. I'm done.

1019
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,474
Look, no... I am done. I am done.

1020
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,520
I'm done with this.
I'm done being angry like this.

1021
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,722
I'm done having you drunk like this.
I am done!

1022
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,228
- Don't close that door!
- I'm closing the door.

1023
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,230
- Don't...
- Don't talk like that.

1024
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,357
- Mimi...
- Hey, don't talk to Mimi.

1025
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:16,190
Hey, Mimi, you know what?
We're gonna take a little minute.

1026
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,025
We're just gonna take a second.

1027
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,406
You know what,
this is why I don't talk to you.

1028
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,579
'Cause you go from here to here
in no time at all.

1029
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,907
This is why you talk to me.
Because I'm here.

1030
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,742
This is the only reason
you're talking to me.

1031
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,920
- You fuckin' asshole.
- I'm a fuckin' asshole?

1032
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,668
I'm so out of love with you.

1033
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,546
I've got nothing left for you,
nothing, nothing!

1034
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,678
Nothing! There is nothing here for you!
There is nothing here for you!

1035
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:42,429
- I don't love you. I don't...
- Don't say stuff you can't take back.

1036
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,386
You fucking asked for it, you
asked me. You asked me. I talk to you.

1037
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:46,937
I couldn't drive you crazy
unless I love you.

1038
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,310
I gave you the goddamn answer
and you don't like it.

1039
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,811
- Are you gonna hit me?
- That's why I don't talk to you.

1040
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:51,938
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

1041
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,894
- You're the bad guy, not me, asshole.
- I'm the bad guy?

1042
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,605
- Yeah, asshole!
- OK.

1043
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,361
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1044
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,442
Yeah, I'm more man than you are,
you fucking cunt.

1045
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,778
- Don't say that shit about being a man.
- I am, I am. I can handle it.

1046
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,863
What is it with this shit
and being a man? What is that?

1047
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,038
What does it even mean?

1048
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,991
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

1049
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:11,123
- What does it mean to be a man?
- You're scaring us, you're scaring us!

1050
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,127
- It doesn't mean you can come here...
- Don't say that stuff.

1051
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,925
- "Be a man!" What is that shit?
- I mean, don't bully...

1052
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,128
I'll be a man.
You want me to be a man? Here you go.

1053
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,134
- Is this what men do?
- Oh, just stop it.

1054
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,307
- I'm a big man!
- Get out!

1055
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,804
- Get out. Stop it!
- Look at me, I'm a big fucking man!

1056
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,477
- I'm being a man!
- No, I'm the man!

1057
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,145
- I'm being a man now.
- Stop it! Stop it, now.

1058
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,599
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hold on. This is what men do.

1059
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,309
I'm tired of talking.
I'm fucking tired of talking.

1060
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,269
- Hey, hey...
- Stop it!

1061
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,196
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1062
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,990
- What are you doing?!
- He's being an asshole.

1063
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,693
- Hey, stop!
- Who are you, by the way?

1064
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:43,993
- Hey, take it easy.
- Who are you?

1065
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,821
Who am I? I'm a doctor.
I'm Dr. Feinberg.

1066
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:49,374
You're fuckin' Dr. Feinberg?
You've been e-mailing my wife?

1067
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,622
- Excuse me?
- You're the guy e-mailing my wife?

1068
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,749
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Stop it!

1069
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,173
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1070
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,501
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds.
- No one is hitting anybody.

1071
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,960
I'm gonna hit you in five seconds...

1072
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,216
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds!
- Mimi, call the cops.

1073
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,343
- Five! Four!
- They're coming!

1074
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,390
- Will you take it easy?
- Get out!

1075
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,719
- Get out!
- Take it outside, my friend!

1076
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,021
- Two!
- Think about your wife, will you?

1077
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,313
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- You fucking son of a bitch!

1078
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:18,771
- I'm sorry... Look...
- I'm so sorry!

1079
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,198
- I'm so sorry.
- Buddy, get up. Just get up.

1080
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,320
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1081
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,743
You got a glass jaw or something?
You can't take one hit?

1082
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,195
- All right, that's enough!
- it's one hit!

1083
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,780
What is wrong with you?

1084
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,991
Oh, my God, you fucking son of a bitch!

1085
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,825
You fucking asshole!

1086
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,251
I'm gonna kill you!

1087
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,953
- You son of a bitch!
- That's enough.

1088
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,504
You son of a bitch!

1089
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,753
- I fucking hate you!
- You two, break it up.

1090
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,550
- That's enough.
- Stop it! Don't. Don't.

1091
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,877
Mimi, please!

1092
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,964
Cindy, would you get out
of here? You are done here, get out!

1093
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,548
- Get out! You're done!
- I'm trying to take him!

1094
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,384
She's done?! You're gonna fire my wife?!

1095
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,770
Hey! This is between
you and me, motherfucker.

1096
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,564
Don't you fucking
blame her for that shit!

1097
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,017
- Yeah, you're going to jail, my friend.
- I'm going to jail?

1098
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,149
- Please, come with me!
- Just get the hell out of here!

1099
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,401
- That's it. Keep moving!
- Come on!

1100
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,115
Give me the keys.

1101
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,333
I fucking want a divorce!

1102
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,911
Where are you going?!

1103
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,039
What the fuck are you doing!?

1104
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,076
- Hey.
- Mr. Heller.

1105
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,785
- You must be Dean.
- Yeah.

1106
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:42,339
I didn't know if it was pot luck,
so I brought an eggplant.

1107
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,001
- Very funny. Come in.
- Thank you.

1108
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:54,516
Let me see. Let me see.

1109
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:55,969
I don't know what you're talking about.
See what?

1110
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,520
- Let me see.
- See me through the flowers?

1111
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,597
- Do you like 'em?
- Oh, babe.

1112
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,102
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

1113
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,607
Like right now, when you're doing that.

1114
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,155
- Sorry!
- Yeah.

1115
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,575
Cindy doesn't usually bring
her boyfriends home for dinner.

1116
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,954
So... I'm thinking
this might be serious.

1117
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,960
- Don't listen to him.
- Well, I hope so.

1118
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,706
- You hope so.
- Yes, sir.

1119
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:27,292
-Mmmm
- I mean, I'm pretty serious.

1120
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,300
What do your folks do, Dean?

1121
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,848
Well... I don't know...

1122
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:38,474
My mother, I don't know,
to be honest, what she does.

1123
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,065
But my father is a janitor...

1124
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:46,111
...and he's a very talented musician.

1125
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,398
- What does he play?
- Everything.

1126
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,735
He can kind of play
a little bit of everything.

1127
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,740
He's one of those people.

1128
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,448
- So you don't see your mother?
- No, I don't.

1129
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,750
Why?
Not that it's my business...

1130
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,499
No, I understand you asking.

1131
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,840
I don't really talk about it very often,
to be honest.

1132
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,595
You know, she just...

1133
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:16,766
When I was ten, she...
my father and her just decided

1134
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,937
that it wasn't, you know, gonna work out

1135
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,185
and she...

1136
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,938
...she met somebody, and I think...

1137
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:28,899
...that was that.

1138
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,607
You graduate
from high school, Dean?

1139
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,159
Well, sir, no, I didn't, I didn't.

1140
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,075
But, you know, I didn't feel like...

1141
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:40,703
...there was a place for me there,
to be honest.

1142
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:45,003
I don't think that high school
is all it's cracked up to be.

1143
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,209
Cindy's... studying.

1144
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:56,466
- I know. She's...
- it's exciting.

1145
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,267
She's about the smartest person
I ever met.

1146
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:01,386
How's it going?

1147
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,935
- It's good.
- Yeah?

1148
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,642
Mm-hmm. It's really good. Um...

1149
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:13,899
There's one teacher in particular that
I've really enjoyed getting to know.

1150
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:18,737
She says that I have a lot of potential.

1151
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,197
What's her name?

1152
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:22,870
- Professor Comstock.
- Comstock!

1153
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:28,001
What's so funny about that?

1154
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,961
Teachers, they just always
have these names you know?

1155
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:36,171
It's never like... I don't know...
They always have these names. Comstock.

1156
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:38,348
- Is that funny?
- Yeah.

1157
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,926
I don't know why, sorry. So you...

1158
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:45,480
- What course is that?
- it's a biology course.

1159
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,520
That's good.

1160
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,102
Cindy wants to be a doctor.

1161
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,356
I know, that's...

1162
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,568
She'd be a great doctor.
I wish she'd be my doctor.

1163
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,870
I'd trust her.

1164
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,494
A lot of these doctors,
they're just in it for the money.

1165
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:06,497
It would make me relieved to know
that someone like Cindy

1166
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,045
was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.

1167
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:13,629
She's got a lot ahead of her.
it's really exciting.

1168
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,469
- You know I'm not good enough for you.
- Stop it.

1169
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,891
- it's true.
- Stop it.

1170
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,718
- Baby, it's true.
- No, it's not.

1171
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,224
- It is true.
- You're hurting my feelings.

1172
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,147
- Don't say that.
- No, but nobody is.

1173
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:34,738
You know, so as long as...
that's the case, I want the job.

1174
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:41,819
Baby...

1175
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,160
- What?
- I got you a present.

1176
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,459
That's it. Hold on... Boom!

1177
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:52,080
- Oh, baby...
- Mmm?

1178
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,299
Did you make it?

1179
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,218
Well, I didn't make it,
but I got us a song.

1180
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,214
You know, like our song
that will just be for you and me.

1181
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:07,270
Because everybody's got songs, but
they're lame and they all share them.

1182
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,188
You know, it's disgusting.

1183
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,650
- Not us. We have our own song.
- We have our own song.

1184
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:16,146
- What is it?
- Do you wanna listen to it?

1185
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,706
OK, turn it up.

1186
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:33,418
- Stop it.
- Take it easy.

1187
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,211
Listen.

1188
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,968
Baby! Hi!

1189
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,013
Look at you.

1190
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,151
Oh...

1191
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,235
Hi.

1192
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,280
- Are you OK?
- I don't want to talk to you.

1193
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,579
I can't play right now, OK?

1194
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,208
What's going on, Dean?

1195
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,345
Dean, leave her alone.

1196
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:53,386
Hey! You can't lock me
out of my own house!

1197
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:57,266
I don't have my oxygen out here! Hey!

1198
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,261
You know, it's not just us.

1199
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,638
We got a little girl
we gotta think about.

1200
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,734
I know, I am thinking about her.

1201
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,983
I can't do this anymore.

1202
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:57,747
Baby, you're just thinking
about yourself. What about Frankie?

1203
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:02,418
You want her to grow up
in a broken home?

1204
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:07,586
- Is that what you want?
- I am thinking about Frankie.

1205
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:09,594
You're not
thinking about Frankie.

1206
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,885
- I am thinking about...
- No, you're not.

1207
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,475
Is this how you want her to grow up?

1208
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,685
I don't want her
to grow up in a home

1209
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,234
where her parents
treat each other like this.

1210
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,609
Don't...

1211
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,403
I'm sorry...

1212
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,615
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1213
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:38,082
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore!

1214
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:41,328
I know.

1215
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:47,671
Baby, I'm just fighting, you know,
fighting for my family.

1216
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:53,264
I don't know what to do.

1217
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:54,966
I don't know what else to do.

1218
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,052
Tell me what to do.

1219
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,562
- Tell me what to do.
- I don't know what to do.

1220
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,640
- Tell me how I should be.
- I don't know.

1221
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,477
Just tell me, I'll do it.

1222
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,314
I'll do it.

1223
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,651
I don't know what to say.

1224
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,871
I'm so sorry,
I don't know what else to do.

1225
01:41:16,946 --> 01:41:20,041
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
Just tell me.

1226
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:22,369
We're not good together,
We're not good anymore.

1227
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,749
- The way that we treat each other!
- Don't say that, baby.

1228
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:27,924
I can't stop, you can't stop!

1229
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,967
I can't stop!
I don't know what else to do!

1230
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:32,340
- I can stop, and I will stop.
- No!

1231
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,553
- No. No.
- Come here, just come here.

1232
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:40,136
- Come here, come here, come here...
- No, no, no...

1233
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,694
Just come here. Just come here.

1234
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:54,693
NO...

1235
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,417
What are you thinking about?

1236
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,969
I just wish they'd hurry up
so you can't change your mind.

1237
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,927
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1238
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,138
Baby, you made a promise to me, OK?

1239
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:09,525
You said for better or worse.

1240
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,274
You said that.

1241
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:16,778
You said it. It was a promise.

1242
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,157
I'm sorry.

1243
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,489
Now, this is my worst.

1244
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:26,076
OK? This is my worst.

1245
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:27,960
I'm sorry.

1246
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,788
But I'm gonna get better.

1247
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,295
You just got to give me
a chance to get better.

1248
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,466
- Up here, please.
- OK.

1249
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,518
- Please face one another.
- OK.

1250
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,566
I'm so sorry...

1251
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,482
I love you so much.

1252
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:00,443
Dean, I give you this ring...

1253
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:01,743
...as a symbol...

1254
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,243
- ...as a symbol...
- ...of my solemn vow...

1255
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,584
- ...of my solemn vow...
- ...and everlasting love.

1256
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,707
...and everlasting love.

1257
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:14,507
For as much as you have
consented in holy wedlock before God...

1258
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:19,174
...I do, by the power vested in me,
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

1259
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,551
pronounce you husband and wife.

1260
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,098
You may kiss the bride.

1261
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:56,208
- Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- You've gotta just give me some space.

1262
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1263
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,585
Hey, Frankie, come back!

1264
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:39,542
Daddy! Daddy!

1265
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:41,756
Daddy!

1266
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:45,673
Frankie, you got to go back, OK?

1267
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:49,389
Daddy!

1268
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,643
- Where is she?
- She ran after Dean.

1269
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,622
Go back to your mom, please.

1270
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,372
Don't go. Stay here.

1271
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:15,498
- Go back to your mom.
- Just come back!

1272
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,748
- You want to race?
- OK.

1273
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,424
One, two, three, go!

1274
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:34,268
Oh, sweetheart, it's OK.

1275
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,394
Who's my big girl?

1276
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:43,363
- I love him.
- I know, baby.

1277
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,947
I got you. Don't cry.

1278
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:49,824
It's OK.

1279
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:57,368
OK.

1280
01:48:57,948 --> 01:48:59,450
I can't really sing.

1281
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:03,379
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid.

1282
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:04,876
- OK?
- OK.

1283
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:49,341
You're actually good.

1284
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:54,930
OK, slow dance.
Slow dance to this part.

1285
01:50:27,746 --> 01:50:29,089
Good job.

1286
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,136
You got some pretty sexy moves.

1287
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:36,305
Hey, shut up.
