It's ridiculous for me to

You know, "Why, why, why?"

904
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,946
You just have to be like,

00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,483
"Okay, I'm attracted
to this, you know,

things that happen in real life

1237
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:52,914
but that don't necessarily
make for compelling,

1238
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,686
you know, commercial books.

1239
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,787
Yeah, I... I can see that.

1240
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:03,658
And I think if we can just liberate
you from the facts of the case

1241
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:08,396
and, you know, sort of free you up
to tie up some of these loose ends

1242
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,431
and strengthen these connections...

1243
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,834
you and the photographer,
for instance...

1244
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,502
you could strengthen up the...

1245
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:15,737
the kind of parallels

1246
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:20,341
that you seem to be
suggesting here, and...

1247
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:23,911
and, you know, really
tie these two together

1248
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,615
in some kind of cohesive,
compelling way.

1249
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,351
Yeah. No, that's...
that's a good idea.

1250
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,097
I'll think about that.

1251
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,589
What's up with this photographer?

1252
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,957
What's this guy up to?

1253
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,859
Billy?

1254
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,161
He's good.

1255
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,232
Is this all right?

1256
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,233
Yeah.

1257
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,934
My tan line looks
kind of weird, but...

1258
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:47,935
Okay.

1259
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,237
Actually...

1260
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,371
Right there. There you go.

1261
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,406
(LAUGHS)

1262
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,541
Can you see the left hand? Maybe
I should just do the right hand.

1263
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,842
- No, do... do both.
- Both? Okay.

1264
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,944
That looks good, yeah.

1265
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,553
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1266
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,383
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1267
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,384
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

1268
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,686
That's good. That's good.

1269
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,728
I'm gonna pull this down as well.

1270
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,457
(BOTH LAUGH)

1271
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,360
Okay, could you just arch up
just a little bit for me?

1272
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,761
- Like...
- Just like...

1273
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,463
Not towards me, just,
like, up, you know?

1274
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,933
Yeah, right there. There you go.

1275
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,936
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1276
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,539
Here, let me... I'm just gonna
position this again real quick.

1277
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,541
Okay.

1278
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,143
Does it look weird when I,
like, point my toe like that?

1279
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,178
No. Do that, actually.

1280
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,613
Okay.

1281
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,350
Look away or... sorry.

1282
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,419
Kind of look... look like how you are,
with your head over your shoulder,

1283
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,755
but kind of be looking
upwards, like, head...

1284
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,724
Yeah, like that and then
eyes up is what I mean.

1285
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,333
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

1286
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,365
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1287
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,135
- Okay, great. Let's just do one more.
- Okay.

1288
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,070
(CLEARS THROAT)

1289
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,638
Hey.

1290
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,009
Hey, what's up?

1291
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,676
All right.

1292
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,979
Same thing, and...

1293
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,081
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1294
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,516
All right.

1295
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,517
That'll do it.

1296
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,119
Awesome.

1297
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,420
Okay.

1298
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:13,955
Hi. (LAUGHS)

1299
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:14,956
How'd it go?

1300
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,124
It was great, I think.

1301
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,825
I don't know. Was it great?

1302
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:18,826
Oh, it was great.

1303
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:19,827
(CHUCKLES)

1304
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:20,895
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

1305
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,563
I'm just gonna go put this on.

1306
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,899
So how was your thing,
your agent thing?

1307
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,768
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,269
I mean, he...

1309
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,739
he seems to think the
book has some potential.

1310
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,574
Might have to switch a
couple things around.

1311
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,575
Uh-huh.

1312
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,576
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1313
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,978
Yeah.

1314
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:41,883
Maybe make my character a little more
proactive than I was in real life.

1315
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,385
You know, that... that
may be interesting.

1316
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,887
Like you...

1317
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,289
- Yeah, like, maybe actually...
- Like you solved the case?

1318
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,590
(LAUGHS)

1319
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,958
Yeah.

1320
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,027
How'd it go?

1321
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,028
Okay.

1322
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,397
You know, meetings with agents
are always a little weird.

1323
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,399
Yeah. I mean, I don't know, but...

1324
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,967
(LAUGHS)

1325
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,270
(WATER RUNNING)

1326
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,195
How's it going?

1327
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,221
Hmm. It's going good.

1328
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,222
Good.

1329
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,192
Still trying to figure
out the ending.

1330
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,228
I have an idea for a
really good ending.

1331
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,063
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1332
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,164
What's that?

1333
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,299
It goes like this.

1334
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,467
Mm-hmm?

1335
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,145
First...

1336
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,408
he puts down the book.

1337
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,642
Mm-hmm.

1338
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:45,880
Second, he takes off her shirt.

1339
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,415
That sounds like a good ending.

1340
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:51,129
Then she gets down.

1341
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,387
Mm, you're a better writer than me.

1342
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:54,522
(CHUCKLES)

1343
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,357
Fourth,

1344
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,729
they turn off the light.
