receive payment.

scientist

182

with this whole experiment.

183

a lot of concerns about this,

186

Is the Purge
a political device?

187

I do not work for the NFFA.

188
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,755
I did not conceive
of the experiment for them.

189
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,991
The NFFA had the courage
to test it,

190
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:46,227
but the conceit
is not a political one.

191
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,229
It is a psychological one.

192
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:51,698
The benefit of acting violently
without worry of consequence,

193
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,000
- that's a freeing violence.
- "A freeing violence."

196
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,706
What is your definition
of success?

197
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,608
Well, the level
of participation

198
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,909
in certain areas is key.

199
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,744
Uh, the Park Hill Towers,
for example,

200
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,080
are the center
of this community.

201
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,681
If there's considerable
participation there,

202
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,050
I think that'll be
a strong indication

203
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,718

is a great success.

was monetary gain.
