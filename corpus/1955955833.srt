00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,808
[woman's voice]
<i>I have this reoccurring dream.</i>

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,806
<i>I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,</i>

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:13,839
<i>and she's singing to me.</i>

5
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,806
<i>I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin</i>

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,376
<i>and the comfort of her arms
around me.</i>

7
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:21,908
[sighs] <i>And I wanna stay there.</i>

8
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:24,906
<i>Forever.</i>

9
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:28,507
<i>When I wake up,
I miss the dream.</i>

10
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,307
<i>I want so badly
for this dream to be real,</i>

11
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,973
<i>but that would be impossible</i>

12
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:37,072
<i>because my mom died
when I was really little.</i>

13
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,040
<i>And I can't go out in the sun.</i>

14
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>Like, at all.</i>

15
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:45,172
<i>I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,</i>

16
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:48,772
<i>or XP, which basically means</i>

17
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,939
<i>a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.</i>

18
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,</i>

19
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:56,008
<i>my brain starts to fail
and I could die.</i>

20
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,506
<i>Pretty fun, right?</i>

21
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:02,372
<i>So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,</i>

22
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,373
<i>hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.</i>

23
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,506
<i>Thank goodness,
because growing up,</i>

24
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,372
<i>kids were, uh,
what you'd expect.</i>

25
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,474
- [girl] No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

26
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,373
That's why they have
special windows.

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,473
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

28
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:21,272
But at night,
stay far, far away.

29
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:23,175
[woman's voice] <i>But not everyone
was afraid of me.</i>

30
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,908
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

31
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,073
She has something called XP.

32
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:38,442
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

33
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:42,207
So she can't ever go
in the sun.

34
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,474
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

35
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:46,972
Can she play at night?

36
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,775
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

37
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh, and I like pizza!

38
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,972
- [acoustic guitar playing]
- [woman's voice] <i>From that point on,</i>

39
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:56,407
<i>it was me, Morgan and my dad.</i>

40
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,406
<i>Until one day, I saw Charlie.</i>

41
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,740
<i>And that was it.</i>

42
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:05,440
<i>I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.</i>

43
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,505
Stupid tree.

44
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,340
[woman's voice]
<i>I saw him every day.</i>

45
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:12,043
<i>And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.</i>

46
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,739
<i>Over time,
watching Charlie go by</i>

47
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:17,375
<i>just became
a part of my routine.</i>

48
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,076
<i>Along with constant
doctor appointments.</i>

49
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,240
<i>Sleeping during the day
and staying up all night,</i>

50
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,940
<i>which, from what I've heard,</i>

51
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,940
<i>is the schedule
of most teenagers.</i>

52
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:33,972
<i>And playing music
every chance I get.</i>

53
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,973
<i>All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.</i>

54
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,439
<i>But I still hold onto my dreams.</i>

55
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,905
Stupid tree.

What are you wearing?

76
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,173
Oh, cap and gown. Huh?

77
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,776
The faculty and staff
always wear one.

78
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:37,873
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

79
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,676
[chuckles]

80
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:41,840
Most importantly,
this is for you.

81
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,373
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,775
I assume, as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared. Yes?

83
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:51,472
Um, yes.
[clears throat]

84
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:52,940
That's me
putting on my glasses.

85
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,405
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

86
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,839
Um, first, I would
like to thank my headmaster.

87
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,972
- Well, I mean...
- My Spanish teacher.

88
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,307
[speaking Spanish] <i>De nada.</i>

89
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,140
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

90
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:06,006
But I really wanna
state for the record

91
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,373
that my gym teacher had absolutely
no idea what he was doing...

92
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,107
What? Oh, you suck.
I lift weights.

93
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,276
Hey, this is for you.

94
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:22,005
This is one of the lamest things
I've ever seen.

95
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:23,906
Yes! [laughs]

96
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:26,140
I had to go to three stores
to find something this lame.

97
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,371
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst.

98
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,439
Yeah. [chuckles]

99
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,140
All right.

100
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:33,140
Are you ready for your present?

101
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,040
- There's a present involved?
- Oh, there's a present, yes!

102
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,773
Of course, there's a present.
It's graduation...

103
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,043
This just keeps getting
better and better.

104
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,308
This is Mom's.

105
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,040
Look, I know
it's kind of old,

106
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,972
so if you want a newer one
I totally under...

107
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,308
No, I love it!
Thank you. Thank you so much.

108
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,808
You look just like your mother.

109
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:19,776
Lucky you.
She was hot.

110
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:21,940
Ew.

111
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,209
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

112
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,775
- [kids howling]

[voices chattering]

114
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,274
- [woman] I can't believe this is happening.
- [kids chatting, laughing]

115
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:04,809
Ooh.

116
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:07,772
That's a good one.

117
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:10,271
Uh, something weird's
going on right here.

118
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:11,308
[chuckles]

119
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:15,939
Hey, Dad, um...
I was wondering

120
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,872
if I could go play
my new beautiful present

121
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,075
at the train station
tonight.

122
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,873
It's 10:00.

123
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,972
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

124
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:27,405
Morgan's busy
with her family.

125
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:30,206
And, Dad, I love playing
for you, I really do,

126
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,338
but I also need
to get used to playing

127
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,305
in front of
other people too.

128
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,772
Please, please, please.

129
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:37,939
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

130
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,439
And I graduated today!

131
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,842
[moans] Isn't that the American
tradition, to extend my curfew?

132
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,872
Okay, I'll extend
your curfew one hour.

133
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:51,072
Which means midnight, okay?

134
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,472
Hey, and text me
right when you get there,

135
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,839
or I'm not
just gonna call Fred,

136
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,006
I'm actually
gonna come down there.

137
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,438
And it will be so embarrassing,
it'll become urban legend

138
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,005
- on why kids should stick to their curfew!
- I love you.

than a full ride to Berkeley.

Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

158
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:56,472
- Charlie... you're in trouble.
- What did I do this time?

159
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:58,039
You didn't get me a drink.

160

I did not know
you were thirsty.

161
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:00,908
Now you do.

162
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,675
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

163
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,676
Is that the bad one?

164
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,006
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

165
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:13,438
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,238
I also have some
extra time for you.

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,172

- You were never swimming, idiot.

You're coming to

171

Yeah, I think so.

172
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:24,341

becomes more serious for her.

the slightest bit of sunlight...

- Notebook first.

00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,971
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

331
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:00,804
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

332
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:01,938
What?

333
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,438
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

334
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,805
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

335
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,938
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

336
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,439
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

337
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,105
Um, anyway, thank you for...

338
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,371

don't know your name.

Uh, just a little. I...

- What?
- What?

349
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,004
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

350
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,838

- This could have been a diary.

You left really quick
the other night,

354
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,972
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

355
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:54,372
so I just
looked through it quickly.

356
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,472
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

357

It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

358

Thanks... for finding it.

359
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,442
Yeah.

Can I walk with you?

Um, yeah.

367
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,738
So, you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

368
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,505
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

369
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,739
My dad's pretty protective.

370
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,872

right now, is he?

tapped into every camera.

of the songs you read?

Without my permission,
I may add.

Um, honestly, I don't know.

I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

True.

to hear you sing them.

Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

383
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,004
I've probably
skated by your house,

384

on the way to practice.

385

something sometime, would you?

Yes, us together.

Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

But... I could be free at night.

I could be free at night.

put your number in here then.

tell someone you're sick,

a disease and less like a person.

It's... I'm gonna tell him,
I promise,

when I'm gonna see him again.

with me at the ice cream shop?

- The nerdy one you hate?
- Yes, Garver.

His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

417
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,938
And he told me to bring friends.

418
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,372
- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

- No.

[horn blowing]

900
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:45,269
[Charlie] Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

901
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:48,970
but you were really,
really good.

902
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,504
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

903
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:54,039
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie. It was amazing.

904
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,902
Are you ready?

905
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:00,837
For what?

906
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,205
To go swimming.

907
00:47:03,805 --> 00:47:06,103
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

908
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:09,204
Yes, you do. You just
haven't swam in a while.

909
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:11,969
And I've never swam
in this water before,

910
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:14,503
so you're gonna take me.

911
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:15,905
Uh-huh.

912
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,369
- Come on!
- No, I'm serious. I'm not swimming.

913
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:21,503
But you made me sing
and I didn't want to.

914
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,403
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

915
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:26,739
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

916
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,106
Charlie.

917
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,104
We could've either come
all the way to the beach

918
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:37,270
under the beautiful stars
and not go swimming,

919
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:41,137
or we could
jump into that water

920
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:44,002
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

921
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:46,439
- I don't have a swimsuit.
- Neither do I.

922
00:47:51,938 --> 00:47:53,172
Katie.

923
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:56,439
You coming?

924
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:04,806
Hurry up!

925
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:07,403
[screams]

926
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:09,039
Oh, my God. It's so cold.

927
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:16,173
Put your arms forward
and then push.

928
00:48:18,506 --> 00:48:21,440
- The breast stroke? It seems like a trick.
- [chuckles]

929
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:27,437
- Kinda.
- [chuckles]

930
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:31,273
See, this isn't so bad.
You don't hate the water.

931
00:48:35,004 --> 00:48:36,738
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

932
00:48:56,106 --> 00:48:58,306
[Katie] <i>Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?</i>

933
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,772
No.

934
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:09,437
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

935
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:11,172
when I couldn't swim.

936
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,006
You know, I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

937
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,373
And neither
did anybody else.

938
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:28,803
All these kids that I've been going
to school with for 15 years, they...

939
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:30,839
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

940
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,440
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

941
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:39,772
You know...

942
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,906
you're not the guy
in the pool.

943
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:49,006
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

944
00:49:56,004 --> 00:50:00,040
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

945
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,839
'Cause now
is all that matters.

946
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,136
You're right.

947
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:12,772
Okay.

948
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,204
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

949
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:21,305
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

950
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,172
What?

951
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:31,040
Charlie, what time is it?

952
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:36,372
It's 4:50.

953
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:41,039
It's not waterproof.

954
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:47,836
- Oh, my God.
- What?

955
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:49,404
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Katie, wait!

956
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:50,504
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

957
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,173
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

958
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,802
[panting]

959
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,272
Katie!

960
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:04,105
Shit.

961
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:13,939
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

962
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,403
- Go, Charlie, go!
- [tires squealing]

963
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:20,970
Katie!

964
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:23,002
- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

965
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:25,404
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

966
00:51:25,406 --> 00:51:28,204
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

967
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,870
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

968
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:30,773
Okay, okay!

969
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:34,905
Oh, my God.

00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,836
Oh. [panting]

976
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:56,736
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

977
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,672
[tires screeching]

978
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:01,471
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- [Jack] Hey!

979
00:52:01,473 --> 00:52:03,836
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

980
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:05,305
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

981
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:09,237
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

982
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,036
What happened?

983
00:52:11,038 --> 00:52:13,369
She not... tell you?

984
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:16,970
- Tell me what? I have no idea what's going on!
- She's sick. She's sick.

985
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:19,737
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

986
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,837
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

- Katie?

This is a nice hospital.

I bet they have
really good food.

Katie Price?

991
00:52:57,305 --> 00:52:58,440
We're ready.

992
00:53:16,072 --> 00:53:18,173
It was like a second, if that.

993
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,203
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

994
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:22,438
We're good, Mr. P.

[footsteps approaching]

00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:28,836
Hey.

997
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,172
Is she okay?

998
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:51,236
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

999
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:54,339
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

1000
00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:00,802
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

1001
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,104
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

1002

<i>But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.</i>

1003
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:10,736
We won't know if
that's what this was

1004
00:54:10,738 --> 00:54:13,106
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

1005
00:54:14,805 --> 00:54:16,837

a triggering event?

unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

1009
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,803
you need to let us know
immediately.

1010
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:30,339
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

1011
00:54:32,805 --> 00:54:36,137
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

[Katie's voice overlapping]

1013
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:40,469

they started the second phase?</i>

last week. No news yet.

Okay. Thanks.

1019
00:55:05,504 --> 00:55:07,439
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

you should at least see what he has to say.

- He's asking if he can come over and talk to you.
- Don't.

Please just delete them.

Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

1027
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:51,769
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

1028
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:53,369
Which we can't.

1029
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:55,170
Why can't you? I...

1030
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:57,470
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

1031
00:55:57,472 --> 00:55:59,435
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

1032
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:02,271
I can't handle it.
Okay?

1033
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:08,070
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

1034
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:09,939
So, please, can you
just delete them?

1035
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,772
Yeah. Okay.

1036
00:56:41,738 --> 00:56:44,838
[gate opening, closing]

1037
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,269
We should do
another set of tests.

1038
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:06,470
The results could
come back different.

1039
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:09,037
Her brain has begun to contract.

1040
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,302
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

1041
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:14,235
They shut it down, Jack.

1042
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:17,338
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

1043
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:33,269
No, I...

1044
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:35,772
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1045
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:42,673
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

1046
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,806
no matter how much she...

1047
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:48,939
cried...

1048
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:52,106
or screamed or moaned...

1049
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:54,371
I wouldn't let her
go outside.

1050
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:02,738
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

1051
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,369
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach. [scoffs]

1052
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,836
And she begged me.

1053
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:11,371
She begged me...

1054
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,136
for things that
she had every right to.

1055
00:58:17,138 --> 00:58:19,372
And I denied her
all of it.

1056
00:58:20,472 --> 00:58:23,135
I mean, for what? Huh?

1057
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:25,773
For this? No.

1058
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:45,737
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

1059
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:47,302
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

1060
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:50,268
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

1061
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,339
She always sees
the good in things.

1062
00:58:55,171 --> 00:58:57,870
And the way
she talks about you?

1063
00:58:57,872 --> 00:59:01,304
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

1064
00:59:05,038 --> 00:59:07,073
You're a good father, Jack.

1065
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,105
How long?

1066
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:15,005
It's hard to say for sure.

1067
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:17,371
[sniffles]

1068
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:33,204
[TV low, indistinct]

1069
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:24,339
[sighs]

1070
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,902
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

1071
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:42,937
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

1072
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,836
- Uh, "yuh."
- Is that a yeah?

1073
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:47,304
- [typing]
- What are you doing?

1074
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:51,004
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

1075
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:53,772
- What?
- Yeah.

1076
01:00:55,105 --> 01:00:58,002
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

1077
01:00:58,004 --> 01:00:59,836
which I think your hair
looks better in.

1078
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,068
- But then in this one you have your camera.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1079
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,937
- This is not happening.
- No, no, no. This <i>is</i> happening.

1080
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:07,837
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

1081
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,269
Oh, I don't know.

1082
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,469
Okay, uh,
here's what I have so far.

1083
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:17,968
- "World's greatest father and handsomest photographer."
- Oh, veto.

1084
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,169
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

1085
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:25,102
interested in art, photography and
nostalgia about the Supersonics."

1086
01:01:25,104 --> 01:01:28,302
- Supersonics is good. That's important.
- I knew you would like that.

1087
01:01:28,304 --> 01:01:32,304
- Um, "a partner in crime to travel the world with."
- I don't travel, honey.

1088
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:35,906
Uh, you will though.

1089
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:41,903
All right,
we're not doing this.

1090
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:44,673
Please, please, please,
I want to.

1091
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,072
You lost Mom and now
you're gonna lose me too.

1092
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:02,002
No. No, there's
always a chance.

1093
01:02:02,004 --> 01:02:05,269
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

1094
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:10,171
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

1095
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:15,336
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

1096
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:17,269
and start traveling
the world again.

1097
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:20,235
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

1098
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,736
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

1099
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:25,738
I just want you...

1100
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:30,336
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

1101
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:34,071
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

1102
01:02:35,204 --> 01:02:37,436
And try and find someone

1103
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:41,169
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

1104
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,839
Because having someone...

1105
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,105
that's the best part.

1106
01:02:50,504 --> 01:02:55,271
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

1107
01:03:00,004 --> 01:03:01,836
Okay.

1108
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:03,204
Okay.

1109
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:06,439
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1110
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:10,673
[sniffles]

1111
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,773
Good.

1112
01:03:17,204 --> 01:03:19,738
Now we can order Chinese food.

1113
01:03:21,805 --> 01:03:25,002
- [Jack] Come on!
- That was so a ball.

1114
01:03:25,004 --> 01:03:27,868
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

1115
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,005
[laughs]

1116
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:36,905
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, food. Finally. What took them so long?

1117
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:46,769
Oh, my God.
Charlie's outside.

1118
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:48,969
I know. I called him.

1119
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:51,402
What? Why?

1120
01:03:51,404 --> 01:03:52,904
Because...

1121
01:03:55,037 --> 01:03:58,002
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

1122
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:02,737
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

1123
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:05,268
He deserves that.

1124
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,004
And so do you.

1125
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:16,304
You exist.

1126
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:19,838
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

1127
01:04:23,205 --> 01:04:25,002
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1128
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:27,968
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

1129
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:32,236
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

1130
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:33,439
That's...

1131
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:41,205
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

1132
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,772
We were never gonna work.

1133
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:49,805
But I wanted us to.

1134
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:53,838
You, me, we...

1135
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,837
we don't win in the end.

1136
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,036
So...

1137
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:02,439
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

1138
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,171
Good-bye.

1139
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:17,403
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

1140
01:05:17,405 --> 01:05:20,969
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

1141
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,368
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

1142
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,269
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

1143
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,868
[chuckles]

1144
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,271
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

1145
01:05:33,338 --> 01:05:34,937
We can.

1146
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,438
What I can't do...

1147
01:05:46,804 --> 01:05:48,836
I can't stop being with you.

1148
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:52,235
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

1149
01:05:52,237 --> 01:05:55,002
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

1150
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:57,869
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

1151
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,104
You knew that before I did.

1152
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,738
[inhales, exhales]

1153
01:06:11,938 --> 01:06:14,235
You've changed my life, Katie.

1154
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,438
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

1155
01:06:17,938 --> 01:06:20,904
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

1156
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:25,001
- [sniffles]
- What's it gonna be?

1157
01:06:25,003 --> 01:06:26,372
[chuckles]

1158
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,369
[whistle blows]

1159
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:55,838
[shouting, cheering]

1160
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,172
[Mark] Go, Charlie! Push it!

1161
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:18,904
Go, Charlie!

1162
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,438
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

1163
01:07:30,938 --> 01:07:33,869
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

1164
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:37,837
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

1165
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,968
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1166
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,436
- Yeah!
- [cheering continues]

1167
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,171
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1168
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:54,769
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

1169
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:58,235
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1170
01:07:58,237 --> 01:08:00,204
- Ahh.
- So good.

1171
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:05,469
Hey, I'll be right back.

1172
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:06,838
Sure.

1173
01:08:09,337 --> 01:08:11,268
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

1174
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,103
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

1175
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:16,772
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

1176
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,171
I couldn't
have stopped her.

1177
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,368
Mr. Price,

1178
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,072
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

1179
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,269
Yeah.

1180
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,001
Yeah, I think
that'd be fine.

1181
01:08:31,003 --> 01:08:32,171
Thank you.

1182
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:14,304
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

1183
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:25,468
- What is this?
- It's for you.

1184
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,769
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

1185
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:30,268
Let's do this.

1186
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,501
- No. Oh, my God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

1187
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,236
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

1188
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,838
Yes.

1189
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:42,302
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

1190
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:45,235
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

1191
01:09:45,237 --> 01:09:47,368
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

1192
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:52,438
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

1193
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,501
I can't play anymore.

1194
01:09:56,503 --> 01:09:58,672

- [Katie] That one.
- [Jack] That one?

1224
01:11:58,737 --> 01:12:00,402
That's Charlinium,

1225
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:04,969
- because it is huge and powerful.

1226

And that one
is my favorite.

1227
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:11,802
That one is Burritorium,

1228
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:13,905
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1229

That one is Procyon.

It's 11 light years away.

1231
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:24,337
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1232
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:32,004
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1233
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:35,837
What?

1234
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:42,437
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

1235
01:12:44,104 --> 01:12:46,135
I already knew you.

1236
01:12:46,137 --> 01:12:48,004
Wh-What do you mean?

1237
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:52,935
In elementary school,

1238
01:12:52,937 --> 01:12:57,301
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1239
01:12:57,303 --> 01:13:00,768
And in fourth grade,

1240
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,036
you started skateboarding.

1241
01:13:03,038 --> 01:13:09,035
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

1242
01:13:09,037 --> 01:13:11,437
for, like, a month straight.

1243
01:13:12,938 --> 01:13:16,234
And in ninth grade,

1244
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:18,936
you buzzed off all your hair.

1245
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:20,469
Uhh!

1246
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:22,005
[chuckles] And...

1247
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,771
every day...

1248
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:33,905
I waited for you
to walk by my window...

1249
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,805
and it was the best part
of my day.

1250
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,772
If I had just looked up...

1251
01:13:47,369 --> 01:13:49,370
I could've been with you
this whole time.

1252
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,204
You were.

1253
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,039
I...

1254
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:06,203
I love you, Charlie.

1255

1259
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,105

Oh, my God.

[Morgan] Okay, there's some more chicken,
but I'm eating the rest of the noodles,

1261

if no one wants them.

1262
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:02,102
Okay. I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

1263
01:15:02,104 --> 01:15:04,367
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

Mm, you're gonna
miss your chance.

It's my last checkup.

- Okay.

1267

send you the schedule?
