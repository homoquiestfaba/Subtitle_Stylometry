00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,166
<i>of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,</i>

169
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:14,136
<i>the government quietly initiated</i>
<i>the superhero relocation program.</i>

170
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:17,833
<i>The supers were granted amnesty</i>
<i>from responsibility for past actions,</i>

171
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:22,277
<i>in exchange for the promise</i>
<i>to never again resume hero work.</i>

172
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,041
<i>Where are they now?</i>

173
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:28,414
<i>They are living among us.</i>
<i>Average citizens, average heroes.</i>

174
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:33,787
<i>Quietly and anonymously continuing</i>
<i>to make the world a better place.</i>

175
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,753
Denied? You're denying my claim?

176
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:41,395
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

177
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,898
I'm sorry, mrs. Hogenson,

178
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:46,163
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

179
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,137
- It states clearly...
- [stammering] i can't pay for this.

180
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,003
Excuse me. Claims, bob parr.

181
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:53,668
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

182
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:56,042
We're now officially moved in.

183
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,910
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

184
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,347
The last three years
don't count because...

185
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,410
because i finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

186
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:07,548
- [Helen] <i>why do we have so much junk?</i>
- Listen, i've got a client.

187
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:10,650
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

188
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,127
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

189
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:16,359
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

190
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:20,426
[Sobbing] i'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

191
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,768
i don't know what i'll do.

192
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,704
[Blows nose loudly]

193
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,773
[Sobbing]

194
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,877
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but i can't.

195
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:37,614
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to norma wilcox on...

196
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:42,990
[whispering] norma wilcox. W-l-l-c-o-x.
On the third floor. But i can't.

197
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,723
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a ws2475 form

198
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,163
with our legal department
on the second floor.

199
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:52,861
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

200
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:55,427
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing i can do.

201
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:59,134
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- [Shouting] sorry. I know you're upset!

202
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,076
- [Whispering] pretend to be upset.
- [Sobbing]

203
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,580
Parr!

204
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,118
You authorized payment
on the walker policy!

205
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,450
Someone broke
into their house, mr. Huph.

206
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,456
- Their policy covers...
- i don't wanna know about it.

207
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:18,358
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping insuricare in the black.

208
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,988
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

209
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:25,091
to every harry hardluck and sally
sobstory that gives you a phone call.

210
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,262
[Over pa] <i>morning break is over.</i>
<i>Morning break is over.</i>

211
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,879
I appreciate you coming
down here, mrs. Parr.

212
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:41,311
What's this about?
Has dash done something wrong?

213
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:45,549
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

214
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:48,022
- He says.
- Look, i know it's you!

215
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:51,151
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

216
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,026
Well... not really. No.

217
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,223
Actually, not.

218
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:57,357
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

219
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,994
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, i've got him.

220
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,072
See? You see?

221
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,773
You don't see it?

222
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:15,081
He moves! Right there!

223
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,747
Wait, wait! Right there!

224
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,517
Right as i'm sitting down!

225
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,353
I don't know how he does it,

226
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,724
but there's no tack before he moves

227
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:28,925
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

228
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,598
- Bernie...
- don't "bernie" me.

229
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:36,764
[Screaming] this little rat is guilty!

230
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,300
You and your son can go now, mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

231
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:44,347
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

232
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:48,043
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, i say, guilty!

233
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:56,557
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

234
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:01,154
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

235
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:04,223
Maybe i could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

236
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,428
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

237
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:11,133
I promise i'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

238
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,472
Dashiell robert parr,

239
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:16,706
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

240
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,907
The last thing you need is temptation.

241
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:22,383
You always say, "do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

242
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,682
Why can't i do the best that i can do?

243
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,087
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

244
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,887
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,656
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

246
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:36,665
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, dash.

247
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,361
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

248
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,942
[Bell rings]

249
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,376
[Boy] rydinger, where you headed?

250
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,014
- [Girl] hi, tony.
- Hey.

251
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:59,214
- Hey, tony, can i carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

252
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,585
Hey, tony, do you play football?

253
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:07,594
[Boy] tony, i thought we were
gonna go swimming.

254
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,334
He looked at me.

255
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:14,597
- [Car horn honking]
- [Dash] come on, violet!

256
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,738
[Horns honking, people yelling]

257
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,250
[Car rattling]

258
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,284
[Groans]

259
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:41,530
[Muttering] darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

260
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,960
oh, great.

261
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,668
[Unintelligible muttering]

262
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:13,962
[Helen and jack-jack cooing]

263
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,968
Mom.

264
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,736
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, i'm not.

265
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,245
You make weird faces, honey.

266
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:33,874
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

267
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,851
Smaller bites, dash. Yikes!

268
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,821
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat.

269
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:45,387
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

270
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:49,262
- [Nervously] well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

271
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,892
- [Distracted] good. Good.
- No, bob, that's bad.

272
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:55,131
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

273
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,070
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

274
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,075
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

275
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:02,805
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

276
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,076
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

277
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,640
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

278
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,310
We are not encouraging this.

279
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm not, i'm just asking how fast...

280
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,250
- honey!
- [Crash]

281
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:19,495
Great. First the car,
now i gotta pay to fix the table...

282
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:21,257
what happened to the car?

283
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:25,297
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

284
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,628
So, how about you, vi?
How was school?

285
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,503
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

286
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:35,237
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

287
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:38,281
We have steak, pasta...
what are you hungry for?

288
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,078
- Tony rydinger.
- Shut up.

289
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:44,143
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

290
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,745
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

291
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:50,224
- Honey!
- [Bob] kids! Listen to your mother.

292
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,986
She'd eat if we were having tony loaf.

293
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:55,588
That's it!

294
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:56,859
Stop it!

295
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,432
- [Dash] you're gonna be toast!
- [Helen] stop running in the house.

296
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,333
[Helen] sit down!

297
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,970
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

298
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,637
You sit down! You sit down!

299
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,078
Violet!

300
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:15,376
- [Shouting in background]
- [Bob muttering]

301
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,982
"Simon j. Paladino,

302
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:24,149
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

303
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:26,588
- Gazerbeam.
- [Helen] bob! It's time to engage.

304
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:29,022
- Gazerbeam.
- [Helen] bob! It's time to engage.

305
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,457
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

306
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:34,121
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

307
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,357
Okay. I'm intervening!

308
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,865
[All shouting]

309
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,163
Violet, let go of your brother.

310
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,793
[Jack-jack] hello?

311
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,400
[Bob] get the door.

312
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,569
- Hey, lucius!
- Hey, speedo. Helen, vi, jack-jack.

313
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:52,273
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

314
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:54,815
- [Gargling] lucius!
- [Lucius] whoa!

315
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:00,048
- [Lucius] ha, ha.
- [Dash] oh!

316
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:02,716
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

317
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,316
- Where are you two going?
- It's wednesday.

318
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,625
Bowling night.
Say hello to honey for me, lucius.

319
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:11,393
Will do. Good night, helen.
Good night, kids.

320
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:18,467
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

321
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,770
Your father and i
are still gonna discuss it.

322
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:23,778
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

323
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:25,780
Other kids don't have superpowers.

324
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:29,375
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- what do you know about normal?

325
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:32,147
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

326
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:36,180
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

327
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:40,217
The only normal one is jack-jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

328
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:43,423
- [Jack-jack laughing]
- [Dash] lucky.

329
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,990
I meant about being normal.

330
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,326
[Laughter]

331
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,394
[Lucius] so now i'm in deep trouble.

332
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,566
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and i'm an epitaph.

333
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:56,873
Somehow i managed to find cover.
What does baron von ruthless do?

334
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:59,937
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

335
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,917
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble i am compared to him.

336
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:08,286
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

337
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:09,790
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

338
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:13,021
[Lucius] i mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

339
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:16,690
- [Radio] <i>municiberg, we have a 23-56...</i>
- 23-56, what is that?

340
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:19,029
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

341
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:21,035
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

342
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:23,628
Tell you the truth,
i'd rather go bowling.

343
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:28,199
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

344
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:29,835
Just to shake things up.

345
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:34,576
[Mirage] he's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

346
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,016
They're just talking.

347
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:40,213
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

348
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,587
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

349
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:46,253
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

350
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:49,820
- you remember gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

351
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:53,095
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

352
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:56,729
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

353
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,035
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

354
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:01,905
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

355
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:05,378
- [radio] <i>we have a report on a fire...</i>
- a fire. We're close!

356
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:08,075
- [Yelling] yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

357
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,742
[Hooting]

358
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,510
[Bob] fire! Yeah!

359
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,792
- [Lucius] is that everybody?
- [Bob] yeah.

360
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,599
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

361
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:31,969
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,167
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

363
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:36,575
- I'm dehydrated, bob.
- You're out of ice?

364
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,045
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

365
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:42,914
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

366
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:45,920
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

367
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:49,116
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

368
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:55,522
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

369
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:08,435
[Coughing, moaning]

370
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,707
[Bob] yeah.
[Coughing]

371
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,613
Uh-oh.

372
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,275
Oh, good.

373
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,917
- [Alarm sounds]
- [Lucius groans]

374
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:19,976
That ain't right.

375
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:25,784
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

376
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:27,351
Freeze!

377
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,292
Freeze!

378
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:36,201
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

379
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:39,138
I'm just getting a drink.

380
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:48,142
- You've had your drink. Now...
- i know. I know. Freeze.

381
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,017
[Police radio chatter]

382
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,711
Police officers!

383
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,529
[Lucius] that was way too close.

384
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:09,297
We are not doing that again.

385
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:15,070
<i>[Over radio] verify you want</i>
<i>to switch targets? Over.</i>

386
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:18,704
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:22,140
[Keys jingling]

388
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:24,913
[Humming]

389
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:47,939
- I thought you'd be back by 11.
- I said i'd be back later.

390
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,671
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

391
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:54,739
...you'd be "back later".
- Well, i'm back, okay?

392
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,517
Is this rubble?

393
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:07,084
[With mouth full] it was just a little
workout. Just to stay loose.

394
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:10,689
You know how i feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

395
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:13,860
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

396
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:15,596
You knocked down a building?

397
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,571
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

398
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,131
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

399
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:24,372
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

400
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:25,879
It is a bad thing, bob!

401
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:30,077
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

402
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:33,087
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

403
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:35,555
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

404
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:39,253
is what's happening now, bob.
And you are missing this!

405
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:42,490
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

406
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:46,125
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

407
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,101
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

408
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,900
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

409
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,906
but if someone is exceptional...

410
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:55,238
this is not about you, bob.
It's about dash.

411
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,143
You want to do something for dash?
Let him actually compete.

412
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:01,011
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

413
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,949
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

414
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,044
This is not about you!

415
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:11,148
All right, dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

416
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,524
Vi? You, too, young lady.

417
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:15,961
Come on. Come on out.

418
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,728
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

419
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:21,564
[Vi] pretty loud discussion.

420
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:25,265
But that's okay. What's important
is that mommy and i are a team.

421
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:31,210
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- pigheadedness?

422
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,839
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

423
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,247
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

424
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,445
- Good night, mom. Night, dad.
- Good night.

425
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,978
In fact, we should all be in bed.

Why are you unhappy?

439

Your customers make me unhappy.

Complaints i can handle.

442

inexplicable knowledge

They're experts. Experts, bob!

Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

445

- No.

447
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,974

- We're supposed to help people.
- [Yelling] help our people!

[Huph] you know, bob, a company...

452
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:25,652

453
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:29,754
...is like an enormous...
yes. Precisely.

454
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:34,495
[Huph] it only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

455
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:39,973
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

456

The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

From now on, you're on your own.

484

Listen, bob. Maybe i could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

485
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:36,282
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:02,139
[Sighs] me, too, kid.

Huh?

495
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:40,641
"Hold still"?

[Family shouting in another room]

529
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:08,798
You are one distracted guy.

530
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,931
Am i? I don't mean to be.

531
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:16,741
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

532
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:21,512
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

533
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,212
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

534
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:26,517
- Something's happened.
- What?

535
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,250
- The, uh...
- what?

536
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:30,952
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

537
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,518
- A conference?
- [Stammering] out of town.

538
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

539
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,362
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

540
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:40,424
[Hesitating] yes.

541
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:43,870
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

542
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,373
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

543
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:48,569
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

544
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,579
[Phone ringing]

545
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:51,909
[Over phone] <i>hello?</i>

546
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,949
This is mr. Incredible.

547
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,945
I'm in.

548
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:06,125
The omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

549
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:09,757
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

550
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,734
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

551
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,397
let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

552
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:20,101
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

553
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:23,737
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

554
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:24,802
How am i going in?

555
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:28,817
The omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

556
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:32,412
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

557
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,787
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

558
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,625
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

559
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,028
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

560
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,623
You are mr. Incredible.

561
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:06,420
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

562
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:10,118
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

563
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:12,457
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

564
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:16,089
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

565
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:32,908
[Grunting]

566
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:47,658
Showtime.

567
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,864
[Bird and insect noises]

568
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:55,567
[Panting heavily, sighing]

569
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:15,186
[Fly buzzing]

570
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:34,141
Huh?

571
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:37,810
- Hmm.
- [Loud crash]

572
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,479
[Cries out in pain]

573
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:49,982
[Satisfied grunt]

574
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,185
Uh-oh.

575
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,017
[Screaming with effort]

576
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,087
[Laughing, loud crack]

577
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,815
Oh, my back!

578
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:20,412
- [Loud crack]
- Oh!

579
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,457
Surprising. We must bring him back.

580
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,365
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

581
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:33,981
[Syndrome, barely audible] most
important, keep things light.

582
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,958
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

583
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:40,623
Am i overdressed?

584
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:43,290
Actually, you look rather dashing.

585
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,395
- [Bob] i take it our host is...
- [mirage] i'm sorry.

586
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:49,802
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

587
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:53,467
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who i'm working for.

588
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:56,444
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

589
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:59,072
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

590
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:03,847
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

591
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,220
with a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am i.

592
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:12,091
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

593
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:15,358
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

594
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,023
[Chuckling] aren't we all?

595
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,829
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on earth.

596
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:23,030
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

597
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:27,371
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

598
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,557
- Jeez.
- [Helen] hurry, honey.

599
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:54,687
Or you'll be late for work.

600
00:42:56,232 --> 00:42:58,291
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

601
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,268
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- bring bacon.

602
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,895
All that jazz.

603
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:04,632
[Laughing]

604
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:12,412
<i>You have an appointment?</i>

605
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,711
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

606
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:18,242
- <i>all visitors are required...</i>
- [e] <i>go check the electric fence.</i>

607
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:20,414
<i>What is it? Who are you?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

608
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:25,693
<i>My god, you've gotten fat. Come in.</i>
<i>Come, come.</i>

609
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:37,635
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My god, no complaints.

610
00:43:37,707 --> 00:43:42,110
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

611
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:44,976
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in prayge... prague?

612
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:47,140
Milan, darling. Milan.

613
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:51,175
[E] supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

614
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,687
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

615
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,281
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

616
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,261
Feh! I used to design for gods.

617
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:06,199
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

618
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,135
E, i just need a patch job.

619
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:12,436
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

620
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:16,842
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, robert?

621
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:19,278
Moonlighting hero work?

622
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:21,373
Must have happened a long time ago.

623
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,578
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

624
00:44:24,653 --> 00:44:27,383
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

625
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,483
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

626
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,723
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

627
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,493
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

628
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:40,057
A new suit? Where the heck
am i gonna get a new suit?

629
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,604
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

630
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:44,866
So ask me now,
before i again become sane.

631
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,841
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

632
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,243
You push too hard, darling!
But i accept.

633
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:54,410
- [E] it will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

634
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:59,750
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like dynaguy!

635
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,121
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

636
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:04,216
[e] no capes!

637
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,427
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember thunderhead?

638
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,331
[E] <i>tall, storm powers. Nice man.</i>
<i>Good with kids.</i>

639
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:15,268
- Listen, e...

640
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:22,074
[E] <i>all was well, another day saved</i>
<i>when his cape snagged on a missile fin.</i>

641
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:24,476
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

642
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:25,571
stratogale!

643

[E] <i>april 23rd, '57.</i>
<i>Cape caught in a jet turbine.</i>

00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,284
You can't generalize
about these things.

[E] <i>meta-man. Express elevator.</i>
<i>Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.</i>

No capes!

Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,191
You know i'm retired from hero work.

649

As am i, robert.
Yet, here we are.

650
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:53,973
E, i only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

651

[Sighs]
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

652
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:02,708

00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,097
[Bob] don't answer it, honey, i got it!

655
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:21,000
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

656
00:46:24,373 --> 00:46:27,900
- [Mirage] <i>how soon can you get here?</i>
- [Bob] <i>i'll leave tomorrow morning.</i>

657
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:29,706
- [Mirage] <i>see you there.</i>
- Goodbye.

658
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:35,312
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

659
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:38,251
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

660
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,151
...duty calls.
[Nervous laugh]

661
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:50,124
- [Helen] bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

662
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,698
- Ha... have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

663
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,204
- I'll call you when i get there.
- I love you.

664
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:01,607
- So much.
- I love you too.

665
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,781
[Ship's computer]
<i>This is your automated captain.</i>

666
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:20,090
<i>Would you care for more mimosa?</i>

667
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:23,325
- [Bob] don't mind if i do. Thanks.
- <i>you're welcome.</i>

668
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:29,431
<i>Currently 78 degrees in nomanisan.</i>
<i>Perfect weather for flying.</i>

669
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:39,208
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.</i>
<i>We're beginning our descent.</i>

670
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,002
[Mirage] hello, mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

671
00:48:07,076 --> 00:48:08,134
Thanks.

672
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,668
Nice to be back, mirage.

673
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,736
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

674
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:44,245
- D wing, room a-113.
- 2:00. got it.

675
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:45,940
See you there.

676
00:49:17,146 --> 00:49:20,081
[Gasps] edna.

677
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,913
- I'd like to speak to edna, please.
- [E] <i>this is edna.</i>

678
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:25,715
- E? This is helen.
- <i>helen who?</i>

679
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:29,053
Helen parr? You know...

680
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:31,014
elastigirl?

681
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:35,325
<i>Darling! It's been such a long time</i>
<i>after all these years! So long!</i>

682
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:37,058
[Stammering] it's been a while.

683
00:49:37,132 --> 00:49:40,795
There's only one person bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

684
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:42,962
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

685
00:49:43,038 --> 00:49:45,802
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

686
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,570
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

687
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:51,078
- [Helen] <i>i'm calling about...</i>
- don't make me beg.

688
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:55,048
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, i'm calling about suit.

689
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,018
[Stammering] bob's suit!
I'm calling about bob's suit.

690
00:49:58,087 --> 00:50:01,921
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

691
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,428
Hmm.

692
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,679
[Creaking]

693
00:50:33,222 --> 00:50:34,917
[Syndrome] it's bigger!

694
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:37,748
It's badder!

695
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:44,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for mr. Incredible!

696
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:48,961
It's finally ready.

697
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:53,064
You know, i went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

698
00:50:53,142 --> 00:50:56,202
but man, it wasn't good enough!

699
00:50:56,278 --> 00:51:00,339
After you trashed the last one,
i had to make some major modifications.

700
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:03,714
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

701
00:51:03,752 --> 00:51:07,916
I mean, after all,
i am your biggest fan.

702
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:12,552
- Buddy?
- My name is not buddy!

703
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:14,855
And it's not incrediboy either!

704
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,559
That ship has sailed.
All i wanted was to help you.

705
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:22,229
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

706
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:24,932
Fly home, buddy. I work alone.

707
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:28,534
[Syndrome] it tore me apart.
But i learned an important lesson.

708
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,874
You can't count on anyone.

709
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:32,880
Especially your heroes.

710
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:36,042
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

711
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:39,451
See? Now you respect me,
because i'm a threat.

712
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,148
That's the way it works.

713
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,953
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

714
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,859
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

715
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:49,625
How do you think i got rich?
I invented weapons.

716
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:53,896
Now i have a weapon only i can defeat.
And when i unleash it, i'll get...

717
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:58,537
[laughing] you sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

718
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:00,575
I can't believe it.

719
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:05,101
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

720
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,274
I save the best inventions for myself.

721
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,113
Am i good enough now?

722
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,179
Who's super now?

723
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,190
I'm syndrome! Your nemesis and...

724
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,820
oh, brilliant!

725
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,193
[Coughing]

726
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,379
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

727
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,762
[Groaning, sputtering]

728
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:16,843
Gazerbeam.

729
00:53:28,263 --> 00:53:30,128
[Bob] "kronos?"

730
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,755
[Scanner] <i>life reading negative.</i>
<i>Mr. Incredible terminated.</i>

731
00:54:03,298 --> 00:54:07,928
[E] this project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

732
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:12,269
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, i must admit.

733
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:16,243
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

734
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:18,404
- E, i just...
- i did robert's suit,

735
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,075
and it turned out so beautiful,
i had to continue.

736
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,109
It's great to see you, but i have
no idea what you're talking about.

737
00:54:26,188 --> 00:54:28,383
- I just...
- yes, words are useless.

738
00:54:28,457 --> 00:54:31,426
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

739
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:33,586
That is why i show you my work.

740
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:35,459
That is why you are here.

741
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:44,234
Edna mode.

742
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,664
And guest.

743
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:05,420
Come. Sit.

744
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:12,595
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

745
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:15,329
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

746
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:19,397
[E] shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

747
00:55:19,474 --> 00:55:22,568
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

748
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:27,347
[e] and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

749
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:31,481
Completely bulletproof.

750
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:36,350
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

751
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:39,292
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

752
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:43,695
Well, i'm sure i don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

753
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:47,030
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so i covered the basics.

754
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,434
- Jack-jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

755
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:51,563
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

756
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:57,236
Your boy's suit i designed
to withstand enormous friction

757
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:01,646
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

758
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:04,276
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

759
00:56:04,352 --> 00:56:09,915
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

760
00:56:13,095 --> 00:56:17,623
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

761
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:20,634
and still retain its shape.

762
00:56:20,702 --> 00:56:22,932
Virtually indestructible...

763
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,902
...yet it breathes like egyptian cotton.

764
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:30,433
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

765
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,778
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

766
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,517
Well, darling? What do you think?

767
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:43,524
What do i think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

768
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:45,287
Our family is underground.

769
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,761
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

770
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,025
Well, i assumed you knew, darling.

771
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:54,000
Why would he keep secrets from you?

772
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:57,061
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

773
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:00,734
Men at robert's age are often unstable.

774
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,141
Prone to weakness.

775
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,612
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

776
00:57:06,681 --> 00:57:10,481
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

777
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:37,692

- [Guard 2] come on, let's go.

782
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:51,035
[Guard 2] are you okay? What happened?

- [over phone] <i>insuricare.</i>
- Oh, hello. This is helen parr.

785
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:44,099
Bob parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

786
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:48,339
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number i have is no good.

787
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:51,279
- <i>mr. Parr no longer works here.</i>
- What do you mean?

788
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,942
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

789
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,953
<i>My records say he was terminated</i>
<i>almost two months ago.</i>

790

[Gasps]

791
01:01:27,843 --> 01:01:30,869
So, you don't know where he is.

792
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:36,215
Would you like to find out?

793
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:44,947
[Relieved sigh]

794
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,680
[Beeping]

795
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,713
[Sobbing] i am such an idiot.

796
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:58,121
I let this happen, you know.

797
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:02,185
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

798
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:05,527
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

799
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,330
Now i'm losing him! What'll i do?
What'll i do?

800
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:12,167
What are you talking about?

801
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,774
You are elastigirl! My god!
Pull yourself together.

802
01:03:17,845 --> 01:03:19,938
What will you do?
Is this a question?

803
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,481
Show him you remember
that he is mr. Incredible,

804
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,575
and you will remind him who you are!

805
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:30,214
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

806
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,124
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

807
01:03:34,194 --> 01:03:36,685
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

808
01:03:36,763 --> 01:03:40,790
Make sure dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

809
01:03:40,868 --> 01:03:42,733
I should be back tonight. Late.

810
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:44,896
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

811
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:47,702
Yeah. But why am i in charge again?

812
01:03:47,774 --> 01:03:50,242
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with daddy.

813
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:54,713
You mean dad's in trouble,
or dad is the trouble?

814
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:58,683
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

815
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:07,486
What's that?
Where'd you get that, mom?

816
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:09,791
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

817
01:04:09,863 --> 01:04:12,388
We all get cool outfits?

818
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:15,128
- Dash! You come back here this moment!
- [Phone rings]

819
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,003
Hey, snug. Thanks for getting back.

820
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:22,633
I know this is short notice,
but i was hoping that i could...

821
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:25,678
- what are these?
- Look, i'm the dash!

822
01:04:25,746 --> 01:04:28,510
- The dash likes.
- [Helen] just a second.

823
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:32,416
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

824
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:35,478
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

825
01:04:35,556 --> 01:04:37,717
- dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

826
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,158
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

827
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,321
What makes you think it's special?

828
01:04:45,399 --> 01:04:48,334
I don't know. Why'd mom try to hide it?

829
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,277
Snug, i'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

830
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:03,839
- [Over phone] <i>what do you need?</i>
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

831
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:06,408
<i>Let me think.</i>

832
01:05:14,795 --> 01:05:17,628
Island approach.
India golf niner-niner checking in.

833
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:21,259
- Vfr on top. Over.
- [Radio static]

834
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:25,270
Island tower,
this is india golf niner-niner

835
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:29,332
- requesting vectors to the initial.
- [Radio static]

836
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:40,912
Easy, helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

837
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:45,584
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

838
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:50,729
At the same time. Yeah.

839
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:07,412
You sir, truly are "mr. Incredible".

840
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:09,415
I was right to idolize you.

841
01:06:09,483 --> 01:06:12,008
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

842
01:06:12,085 --> 01:06:16,021
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

843
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:19,490
I'm still geeking out about it!
[Sighs]

844
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,361
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

845
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:28,424
I mean, mr. Incredible calling for help?
[Mocking] "help me, help me."

846
01:06:28,502 --> 01:06:30,902
Lame, lame, lame.

847
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:35,670
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

848
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,376
[Groaning]

849
01:06:40,447 --> 01:06:43,177
I am referring to last night
at 23:07 hours

850
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,378
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

851
01:06:46,453 --> 01:06:49,547
I didn't know about the homing device.

852
01:06:54,027 --> 01:06:58,396
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

853
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:01,593
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.

854
01:07:01,668 --> 01:07:03,499
Play the transmission.

855
01:07:04,404 --> 01:07:08,306
- [Helen] <i>india golf checking in.</i>
- Helen!

856
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:11,572
So you do know these people.

857
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:14,409
Well, then, i'll send them
a little greeting.

858
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:19,007
- [Violet] ow!
- Violet!

859
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:20,314
It's not my fault.

860
01:07:20,387 --> 01:07:22,753
Dash ran away,
i knew i'd get blamed for it.

861
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:24,381
That's not true!

862
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:27,427
You said, "something's up with mom.
We have to find out what.

863
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:31,089
...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

864
01:07:31,164 --> 01:07:34,156
Wait a minute.
You left jack-jack alone?

865
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:37,032
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, mom.

866
01:07:37,104 --> 01:07:39,470
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

867
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,667
All right, well, who'd you get?

868
01:07:42,743 --> 01:07:45,109
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

869
01:07:45,178 --> 01:07:48,579
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned cpr,

870
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:51,981
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

871
01:07:52,052 --> 01:07:54,213
I brought mozart to play while he sleeps

872
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:57,313
because leading experts say
mozart makes babies smarter.

873
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:58,483
Kari...

874
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:01,459
the beauty is they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

875
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:03,393
I wish my parents played mozart

876
01:08:03,463 --> 01:08:06,660
because half the time i don't know
what anyone's talking about.

877
01:08:06,733 --> 01:08:10,134
Kari, i really don't feel
comfortable with this.

878
01:08:10,203 --> 01:08:13,366
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but i'd rather call a service.

879
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,271
There's really no need, mrs. Parr.

880
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:18,038
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

881
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:20,875
[Cooing] can't i, little baby?
I can handle it.

882
01:08:20,947 --> 01:08:22,938
- [Kari] <i>who can handle it?</i>
- [Beeping]

883
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,325

884
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:35,293
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

885
01:09:05,915 --> 01:09:08,110
Repeat, disengage.
Friendlies...

886
01:09:08,184 --> 01:09:10,448
no! Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

887
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:15,456
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

888
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:18,493
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

889

Angels 10. track east. Disengage.

890
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,826
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

891
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,594
You said not to use our powers.

892
01:09:25,668 --> 01:09:28,000
I know what i said.
Listen to what i'm saying now!

893

Mayday. India golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

896
01:09:40,883 --> 01:09:42,373
There are children aboard.

897
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:46,444
- [Helen] <i>there are children aboard!</i>
- No!

898
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:49,491
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.

899
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:50,547
Do it now!

900
01:09:52,194 --> 01:09:53,286
Abort, abort, abort!

901
01:09:55,765 --> 01:09:57,232
Abort, abort, abort!

902
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:13,876
[All screaming]

903
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:30,327
Brace yourselves!

904
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:39,599
- [Kids] mom!
- Everybody calm down.

905
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:41,666
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

906
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:44,212
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... look out!

907
01:10:55,524 --> 01:10:55,591
- Oh, my god! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

908
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:58,355
- Oh, my god! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

909
01:10:58,427 --> 01:11:00,622
We're dead! We're dead!

910
01:11:00,696 --> 01:11:03,392
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

911
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:05,764
Stop it!

912
01:11:05,835 --> 01:11:07,700
We are not gonna die!

913
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,599
Both of you will get a grip.

914
01:11:09,672 --> 01:11:12,106
Or so help me
i will ground you for a month!

915
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:14,003
Understand?

916
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,569
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

917
01:11:18,647 --> 01:11:20,581
Ah, you'll get over it.

918
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:24,449
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

919
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,284
[Evil laughter]

920
01:11:34,196 --> 01:11:36,630
Release me. Now!

921
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:39,893
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

922
01:11:39,969 --> 01:11:42,665
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

923
01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:45,673
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

924
01:11:45,741 --> 01:11:47,436
[Laughing] show me.

925
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:02,187
[Syndrome] i knew you couldn't do it.

926
01:12:02,258 --> 01:12:05,455
Even when you have nothing to lose.

927
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:07,189
You're weak.

928
01:12:07,263 --> 01:12:09,322
And i've outgrown you.

929
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,664
[Bob sobbing]

930
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:23,340
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

931
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,107
That way is our best bet.

932
01:12:25,181 --> 01:12:28,116
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

933
01:12:28,184 --> 01:12:32,280
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

934
01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:35,585
I expect you to trust me.

935
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:17,889

01:13:27,443 --> 01:13:30,037
[Exhausted breathing]

937
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:38,445
What a trooper.

938
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,647
I'm so proud of you.

939
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:42,814
Thanks, mom.

940
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:51,522
I think your father is in trouble.

941
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,430
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

942
01:13:54,603 --> 01:13:55,831
I'm going to look for him.

943
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:58,669
And that means you're in charge
until i get back, violet.

944
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:00,971
- What?
- You heard her.

945
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:06,948
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

946
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:08,108
Protect it.

947
01:14:08,183 --> 01:14:11,016
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

948
01:14:11,086 --> 01:14:13,748
- But you said never to use...
- i know what i said!

949
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:21,563
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on saturday mornings?

950
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:25,122
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

951
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,727
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

952
01:14:28,804 --> 01:14:32,001
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

953
01:14:32,074 --> 01:14:34,201
Do not give them that chance.

954
01:14:34,276 --> 01:14:36,437
- Mom?
- Vi, i'm counting on you.

955
01:14:36,512 --> 01:14:40,448
- There's...
- i'm counting on you. Be strong.

Dash, if anything goes wrong,
i want you to run as fast as you can.

957
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,445
- As fast as i can?
- As fast as you can.

958
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:51,926
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

959
01:14:55,364 --> 01:14:56,888
[Violet] mom!

960
01:14:57,633 --> 01:15:00,659
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

961
01:15:00,736 --> 01:15:04,137
[Stammering] i wanted to help.
When you asked me to... i'm sorry.

962
01:15:04,206 --> 01:15:05,969
Shh. It isn't your fault.

963
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:09,909
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

964
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:12,345
But things are different now.

965
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:15,540
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

966
01:15:15,617 --> 01:15:18,108
You have more power than you realize.

967

Don't think. And don't worry.

968
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:23,349
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

969

What?

01:16:06,802 --> 01:16:09,100
Valuing life is not weakness.

Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

974
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:14,866
i had everything under control.

975
01:16:14,943 --> 01:16:17,673
And disregarding it is not strength.

976
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:20,476
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

977
01:16:20,549 --> 01:16:23,040
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

979

01:35:07,408 --> 01:35:08,500
Now!

1150
01:35:11,546 --> 01:35:13,070
This is gonna be rough.

1151
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:22,885
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1152
01:35:22,957 --> 01:35:25,255
- Traction avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1153
01:35:25,326 --> 01:35:27,851
- I take seventh, don't i?
- Don't take seventh!

1154
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:30,591
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, i told you.

1155
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,530
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1156
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,295
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1157
01:35:34,368 --> 01:35:36,529
- Not traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1158
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:05,894
Is everybody okay back there?

1159
01:36:05,967 --> 01:36:09,528
- Super-duper, dad!
- [Laughing] let's do that again.

1160
01:36:10,471 --> 01:36:12,098
[People screaming]

1161
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:15,370
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1162
01:36:16,177 --> 01:36:18,873
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1163
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:21,710
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1164
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:24,216
And i'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1165
01:36:24,285 --> 01:36:26,116
I'm with you for better or worse.

1166
01:36:26,187 --> 01:36:28,212
I have to do this alone.

1167
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:30,086
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1168
01:36:30,157 --> 01:36:32,216
- So you can be mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1169
01:36:32,293 --> 01:36:33,851
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1170
01:36:33,928 --> 01:36:35,691
- not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1171
01:36:35,763 --> 01:36:37,731
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1172
01:36:37,798 --> 01:36:39,891
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1173
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:42,435
I can't lose you again!

1174
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:46,338
I can't. Not again.

1175
01:36:46,407 --> 01:36:48,773
I'm not... strong enough.

1176
01:36:57,251 --> 01:37:00,186
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1177
01:37:00,254 --> 01:37:02,085
I don't know what'll happen.

1178
01:37:02,156 --> 01:37:04,920
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1179
01:37:04,992 --> 01:37:06,289
[Screaming]

1180
01:37:09,163 --> 01:37:10,892
Vi! Dash! No!

1181
01:37:20,941 --> 01:37:21,930
Violet?

1182
01:37:25,413 --> 01:37:27,847
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1183
01:37:37,525 --> 01:37:40,961
- I'm okay, mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1184
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:53,138
Frozone!

1185
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:54,367
[Bob] yeah!

1186
01:37:57,445 --> 01:37:58,503
Bob!

1187
01:37:59,613 --> 01:38:00,602
Hey!

1188
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:18,125
Syndrome's remote!

1189
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:30,207
The remote controls the robot!

1190
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,448
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!

1191
01:38:46,627 --> 01:38:47,753
Got it!

1192
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:54,725
Honey, take out its guns!

1193
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:03,638
[Frozone] gotcha!

1194
01:39:41,816 --> 01:39:43,306
[Violet screams]

1195
01:39:48,889 --> 01:39:50,880
Mom, i've got it! I've got the remote!

1196
01:39:52,593 --> 01:39:54,959
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1197
01:39:58,365 --> 01:39:59,354
The robot?

1198
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:11,068
- It's coming back!
- [Bob yells]

1199
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:14,206
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1200
01:40:15,082 --> 01:40:18,415
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...

1201
01:40:21,956 --> 01:40:23,218
...itself.

1202
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:24,780
It's getting closer!

1203
01:40:24,859 --> 01:40:26,952
- It doesn't work!
- [Helen] kids!

1204
01:40:28,596 --> 01:40:30,325
[Frozone] it's not doing anything.

1205
01:40:30,397 --> 01:40:32,661
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1206
01:40:37,571 --> 01:40:38,697
Honey!

1207
01:40:44,812 --> 01:40:47,212
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1208
01:40:48,516 --> 01:40:52,816
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!

1209
01:40:52,887 --> 01:40:55,219
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1210
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:58,019
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1211
01:40:58,092 --> 01:40:59,821
- [Bob] press the button!
- Not yet!

1212
01:40:59,894 --> 01:41:02,385
- [Frozone] hang on!
- What are you waiting for?

1213
01:41:02,463 --> 01:41:04,693
A closer target! You got one shot!

1214
01:41:08,302 --> 01:41:09,735
Everybody duck!

1215
01:41:32,693 --> 01:41:33,819
Hey, zone.

1216
01:41:36,263 --> 01:41:37,753
[Cheering, applauding]

1217
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,264
Huh? No!

1218
01:41:42,336 --> 01:41:46,397
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1219
01:41:46,473 --> 01:41:50,637
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1220
01:41:53,547 --> 01:41:56,812
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1221
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,215
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1222
01:42:02,122 --> 01:42:04,590
We've frozen all of syndrome's assets.

1223
01:42:04,658 --> 01:42:08,253
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1224
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:10,729
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1225
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,698
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1226
01:42:12,766 --> 01:42:14,734
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1227
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:18,329
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1228
01:42:18,405 --> 01:42:19,599
You did good, bob.

1229
01:42:19,673 --> 01:42:21,573
- [Phone beeps]
- <i>hi, this is kari.</i>

1230
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:24,543
<i>I have a question about jack-jack...</i>

1231
01:42:24,612 --> 01:42:26,409
come on. We're in a limo.

1232
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,347
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1233
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:32,283
- [Stammering] yeah, i just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1234
01:42:32,353 --> 01:42:35,015
- Thanks, dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1235
01:42:35,089 --> 01:42:37,614
Not as cool as you running on water.

1236
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:41,218
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1237
01:42:41,295 --> 01:42:44,162
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1238
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:47,064
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- [Kari] <i>it's me.</i>

1239
01:42:47,134 --> 01:42:50,695
<i>Jack-jack is fine,</i>
<i>but weird things are happening.</i>

1240
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:54,332
<i>Jack-jack's still fine,</i>
<i>but i'm getting really weirded out!</i>

1241
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:56,000
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1242
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,510
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us!

1243
01:42:58,545 --> 01:43:02,606
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1244
01:43:02,683 --> 01:43:05,550
[Kari] <i>i'm not fine, mrs. Parr!</i>

1245
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:08,383
<i>Put that down! Stop it!</i>
<i>You need to call me.</i>

1246
01:43:08,455 --> 01:43:10,685
<i>I need help, mrs...</i>

1247
01:43:10,758 --> 01:43:12,419
bob, listen to this.

1248
01:43:12,493 --> 01:43:14,518
[Kari] <i>i'm gonna call the police...</i>

1249
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:16,085
<i>hi, this is kari.</i>

1250
01:43:16,163 --> 01:43:20,361
<i>Sorry for freaking out,</i>
<i>but your baby has special needs.</i>

1251
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:22,459
<i>Thanks for sending a replacement.</i>

1252
01:43:22,536 --> 01:43:25,266
I didn't call a replacement.

1253
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:33,039
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1254
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:37,713
You took away my future.

1255
01:43:37,785 --> 01:43:41,221
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, i'll be a good mentor.

1256
01:43:41,288 --> 01:43:44,587
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1257
01:43:44,658 --> 01:43:48,594
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1258
01:43:52,733 --> 01:43:56,032
He's getting away, bob!
We have to do something now.

1259
01:43:56,303 --> 01:43:57,463
[Jack-jack cries]

1260
01:44:11,618 --> 01:44:13,085
What's happening?

1261
01:44:18,992 --> 01:44:22,155
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit jack-jack.

1262
01:44:26,366 --> 01:44:27,833
Throw me.

1263
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:33,406
Bob, throw me!

1264
01:44:37,678 --> 01:44:39,270
[Jack-jack cooing]

1265
01:44:39,613 --> 01:44:40,705
No!

1266
01:44:43,317 --> 01:44:46,878
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1267
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,285
I'll get your son!

1268
01:44:50,023 --> 01:44:51,217
Oh, no.

1269
01:45:02,536 --> 01:45:06,404
Look at mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1270
01:45:06,473 --> 01:45:09,033
Everything is all right.

1271
01:45:23,957 --> 01:45:25,584
That's my girl.

1272
01:45:26,226 --> 01:45:28,990
Does this mean we have to move again?

1273
01:45:29,863 --> 01:45:32,058
[All laughing]

1274
01:45:32,132 --> 01:45:33,531
[Little boy] oh, man.

1275
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,398
That was totally wicked!

1276
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:44,934
[Pa announcements]

1277
01:45:49,983 --> 01:45:51,780
[Jack-jack laughing]

1278
01:45:53,387 --> 01:45:56,288
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1279
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:59,450
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1280
01:45:59,493 --> 01:46:01,017
- hey.
- Hey.

1281
01:46:01,094 --> 01:46:03,688
- You're, uh, violet, right?
- That's me.

1282
01:46:03,764 --> 01:46:05,664
- See you, vi.
- You look different.

1283
01:46:05,732 --> 01:46:09,065
I feel different. Is different okay?

1284
01:46:09,136 --> 01:46:12,367
Hey, different is... [clears throat]
Different is great.

1285
01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:14,737
[Stammering] would you...

1286
01:46:14,808 --> 01:46:16,435
- yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1287
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:18,375
- [stammering]... you and i...
- yeah?

1288
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:19,776
- Do you...
- shh.

1289
01:46:19,847 --> 01:46:22,645
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1290
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:26,550
[Stammering] a movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1291
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:29,487
- Wait, so friday?
- Friday.

1292
01:46:31,592 --> 01:46:33,287
[Crowd cheering]

1293
01:46:33,493 --> 01:46:36,621
- Go, dash, go.
- Run!

1294
01:46:36,697 --> 01:46:39,097
[Bob] come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1295
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:40,497
[All] run!

1296
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:41,932
Move it, move it!

1297
01:46:42,002 --> 01:46:44,835
[Bob] pace it.
Slow down just a little bit.

1298
01:46:44,905 --> 01:46:47,772
- Make it close!
- Second.

1299
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:50,139
[Bob and helen] close second, yeah!

1300
01:46:53,714 --> 01:46:56,046
[Bob] that's my boy!

1301
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:58,379
Dash, i'm so proud of you.

1302
01:46:58,418 --> 01:47:01,012
[Dash] i didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1303
01:47:01,188 --> 01:47:03,918
[Crashing, screaming]

1304
01:47:12,799 --> 01:47:15,768
Behold the underminer!

1305
01:47:16,303 --> 01:47:18,771
[Underminer] i am always beneath you,

1306
01:47:18,839 --> 01:47:22,400
but nothing is beneath me!

1307
01:47:22,476 --> 01:47:28,381
[Underminer] i hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!

1308
01:47:28,448 --> 01:47:33,044
Soon all will tremble before me!
