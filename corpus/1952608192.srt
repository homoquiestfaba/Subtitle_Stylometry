1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,987
I have a friend, Deborah,
a psychologist...

2
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,316
..who was asked
by the city of Philadelphia...

3
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,552
.,.if she could offer psychological
counseling to Cambodian refugees...

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,254
.. .boat people, 
who had recently arrived in the city.

5
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,560
Deborah was daunted by the task.
These Cambodians...

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,729
...had suffered genocide, starvation, 
relatives murdered before their eyes...

7
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,672
...years in refugee camps,
harrowing boat trips to the West.

8
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,010
How could she relate 
to their suffering?

9
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,841
How could she help these people?

10
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,712
So guess what all these people 
wanted to talk about...

11
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,621
...with my friend Deborah, 
the psychologist.

12
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,561
It was all, 
"I met this guy in the refugee camp.

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,564
I thought he really loved me, 
but when we got separated".

14
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,294
...he took up with my cousin. 
Now he says he loves me...

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,929
...and keeps calling me. They're married now. What should I do?'

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,200
This is how we are.

17
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,570
May I help you?

18
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,406
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing 
a magazine article on Bali.

19
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,047
I wanted to meet a medicine man.

20
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,275
Everyone said I should meet 
Ketut Liyer. Am I in the right place?

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,544
Wait.

22
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:52,054
I mean, here I am with
a ninth-generation medicine man...

23
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,715
...and what do I wanna 
ask him about?

24
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,225
Getting closer to God?

25
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,922
Saving the world's 
starving children?

26
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,226
Happy to see you. I am Ketut Liyer.

27
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:09,306
Nope. I wanna discuss 
my relationship.

28
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,136
You are a world traveler.

29
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,407
You will live a long time...

30
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,916
...have many friends, 
many experiences.

31
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,151
You will have two marriages. 
One long, one short.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,289
Am I in the long one 
or the short one'?

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,351
Can't tell.

34
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,488
Also you will loss all your money.

35
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,832
I think in next six to 10 months.

36
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,199
Don't worry. 
You will get it all back again.

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,308
And you will come back to Ball...

38
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:52,781
...and live here for three or four 
months and teach me English.

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,386
I never had anybody 
to practice my English with.

40
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,714
And then...

41
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,295
...l will teach you everything I know.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,963
Wait.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,071
I have this for you.

44
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,698
Keep grounded so it's like 
you have four legs.

45
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,373
That way, you can stay in this world

46
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,916
Also, no looking at world
through your head.

47
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,519
Look through your heart instead.

48
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,814
That way, you will know God.

49
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,486
Which is why you came here, no?

50
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,062
See you later, alligator.

51
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,846
I proofread all of her manuscripts.

52
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,507
My wife is very, very beautiful, but she can’t spell for anything.

53
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,348
Look at Uncle Stephen.

54
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,017
And Auntie Liz

55
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,888
I'm counting the minutes for this to be 
over so I can get in my big girl pants.

56
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,030
You look fantastic. 
You just had a baby.

57
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,187
Oh, you're lying. 
I'm fat, I'm exhausted...

58
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,891
...I can't keep two thoughts. 
I feel like Liza Minnelli.

59
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,730
Stephen, can you hold Jack?

60
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,236
-I'm gonna introduce you to Walter. 
-Yeah .

61
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,441
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer 
or something'?

62
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,305
My new book comes out in April. 
Thank you for asking.

63
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,538
-Great. 
-May.

64
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,046
May. May.

65
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,481
This is Andre. You two are 
Times' Most Notable nominees

66
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,383
-50 glad to finally meet you. 
-Nice to finally meet you.

67
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,086
I fed him nachos. Is that bad?

68
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,751
You look comfortable. 
What'd you feed him, chloroform?

69
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,897
-Give him to his dad.
-l told you, nachos.

70
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,589
Know what? I'd be asleep too 
if I had a dump like that.

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,759
-We'll give him to his mom. 
-Come here then.

72
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,498
-Wanna help me change his diaper? 
-Yes, I do.

73
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,573
Hey, how's the vintage car 
thing going?

74
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,507
Oh, no, ho, ho. I changed jobs. 
I'm a pastry chef now.

75
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,806
-You mean you're a baker 
-Yeah.

76
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,744
You wanna get baked?

77
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,845
I know, I know.

78
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,080
It's hard, isn't it?

79
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,355
Oh, no. This is so much fun.

80
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,522
Did you know the exact moment 
you wanted to have a baby?

81
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:23,191
I can't remember, but I've had the box 
since before I got married.

82
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,926
What box?

83
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,197
It's girly and embarrassing, 
and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,666
I will laugh at you, 
but you still have to tell me.

85
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,006
Come on.

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,170
Under the bed.

87
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,284
I’ve been filling it with baby things...

88
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,289
...waiting until Andy 
was ready to be a father.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,229
So sweet.

90
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,059
Does this come in my size?

91
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,631
I have a box just like this, except 
it's filled with National Geographic.

92
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,971
...and The Times travel section.

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,239
All the places I wanna see 
before I die.

94
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,874
Liz, having a baby is like 
getting a tattoo on your face.

95
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,482
You kind of wanna be 
fully committed.

96
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,828
So my trip to Aruba next week, 
which is just a basic, you know...

97
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,592
..."where to sleep, swim 
and stuff your face" piece....

98
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,234
I got a new bikini.

99
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,894
And it turns out, 
I have unlimited mini-bar access.

100
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,903
-You know what that means? 
-Jet lag?

101
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,770
You, me...

102
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,343
...macadamia nuts.

103
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,938
That was cute.

104
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,346
You know who I was talking to 
at the party who was really inspiring...

105
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,883
-...was Tara's friend. 
-Brian.

106
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,215
Brian. Unbelievable. 
He's a teacher, you know that?

107
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,119
He’s a substitute teacher, isn’t he?

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,352
Yeah. He was talking about the 
budget cuts that are happening now.

109
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,257
There's no money for anything.

110
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,092
There's no music classes 
there's no arts classes.

111
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,235
They're volunteering their time 
to do all of this after school.

112
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,428
They're educating our kids, 
you know?

113
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,472
I think you'd make 
a great teacher, honey.

114
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,872
Thank you, 
but I was thinking more of like"'

115
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,778
...education. Getting my masters, 
going back to school. I don't know.

116
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,610
You know?

117
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,483
I-- You know....

118
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,720
-Going back to school. 
-I'm just thinking out loud.

119
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:38,293
I was getting the sinking feeling that 
Ketut's prophecy was coming true.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,132
Was I in the shorter marriage?

121
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,900
We’d only bought this house
a year ago.

122
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,977
Hadn't l wanted this?

123
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:54,749
I had actively participated 
in every moment of the creation...

124
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,751
...of this life.

125
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,255
So why didn't I see myself 
in any of it?

126
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,600
The only thing more impossible 
than staying...

127
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,633
...was leaving.

128
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,435
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. I wanted 
to slip quietly out the back door...

129
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,101
...and not stop running 
until l reached Greenland.

130
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,109
Instead, I made a decision

131
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,449
To pray.

132
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,124
You know, like, to God.

133
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,354
And it was such a foreign concept to 
me, that I swear I almost began with:

134
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
"I'm a big fan of your work. "

135
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,833
Hello, God?

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,806
Nice to finally meet you. I....

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:03,985
I am sorry I've never spoken 
directly to you before...

138
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,817
...but...

139
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,490
...I hope I've expressed my...

140
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,189
...ample gratitude for all 
the blessings you've given...

141
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,664
...to me in my life.

142
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,002
I'm in serious trouble.

143
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,348
I don't know what to do.

144
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,177
I need an answer

145
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,887
Please, tell me what to do.

146
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,363
Oh, God, help me, please.

147
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,472
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

148
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,040
Go back to bed, Liz.

149
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,402
I don't wanna go to Aruba.

150
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,634
I don't wanna be married

151
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,757
You know, there's a whole 
divorce section downstairs.

152
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,106
-"Pepper grinder." 
-She's having...

153
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,478
-...a nervous breakdown. 
-This is what girls do.

154
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,143
-She’s processing.
-Why doesn’t she get drunk or laid?

155
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,311
That's what I would do if you left me.

156
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,855
No, you wouldn't.

157
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,721
-No, I wouldn’t.
-She moved out, she filed for divorce.

158
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,193
They were together eight years. 
She's got no home.

159
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,204
'Legacy'

160
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:42,644
Every word in Italian is like a truffle. 
A magic trick.

161
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,174
Honey, I get it. 
It's your life raft right now.

162
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,582
When Andy and I broke up 
for two weeks, I bought a loom.

163
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,586
A frigging loom. 
And he tried to start a microbrewery.

164
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,726
I don't know how you guys 
aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.

165
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,158
Are you kidding me? 
We love having you.

166
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,423
It's kind of like having 
a writer in residence.

167
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,090
But you are a writer. 
You should be writing something

168
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:07,432
Maybe I could write about a woman 
who goes to Italy to learn Italian.

169
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,064
Call it 
Carbohydrates and Conjugations.

170
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,768
I'll start looking for a place.

171
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,243
-I'm falling in love with you. 
-I'm not who you think I am.

172
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,906
I'm just your fantasy.

173
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,283
No, that's bullshit. You're real.

174
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,454
Your scars, your talent.

175
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,719
The fact that 
I own a piece-of-crap bar...

176
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,124
...and you accept that 
that's all I'm gonna do.

177
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,696
Okay, this sucks.

178
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,356
-I second that. 
-Don't be rude.

179
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,568
I love your pain.

180
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,270
And I love that when we're together, 
I can make it go away.

181
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,873
-Oh, he's good' 
-You're love...

182
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,714
-He's hot, theres a difference 
-...is like a hot panini.

183
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:01,985
And when I look into your eyes, 
I hear dolphins clapping.

184
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,651
I did not write that line.

185
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,319
Here's what he doesn't know yet

186
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,296
I disappear Into the person I love.

187
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,406
I am the permeable membrane. 
If I love you, you can have it ally

188
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,406
My money, my time, my body...

189
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,069
...my dog, my dog's money.

190
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,410
I will assume your debts 
and project upon you...

191
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:31,749
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've 
never actually cultivated in yourself.

192
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,482
I will give you all this and more...

193
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,491
...until I am so exhausted 
and depleted...

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,494
...the only way I can recover...

195
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,190
...is by becoming infatuated 
with someone else.

196
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,637
-Elizabeth, hi. 
-Hi.

197
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,437
Oh, really?

198
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,442
How you doing?

199
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,478
Cheers.

200
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,586
-Thank you. 
-I owe you an apology.

201
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,657
-For the walkouts. 
-Well, I'm not everyone's cup of tea.

202
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,361
I doubt that.

203
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,085
I, on the other hand, was shit.

204
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,665
-Although I was trying very hard. 
-"Shit" is a strong word.

205
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,531
Thank you.

206
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,674
You seem shorter in person 
than on the stage.

207
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,740
-Really? I hear that a lot. 
-Sorry.

208
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,434
It's okay.

209
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,373
It's unnerving when...

210
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:07,507
...a total stranger sees you 
more clearly than you see yourself.

211
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,914
That's what I mean 
by saying you're short.

212
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,590
Are you hearing dolphins clapping 
right now?

213
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,365
I took a few liberties 
with your material.

214
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,799
I give you full permission to make 
fun of me. I know you're dying to.

215
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,406
You're far too charming 
to make fun of.

216
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,043
I'm still hearing them.

217
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,322
Is that your guru?

218
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,294
You're joking, but, yes, it is.

219
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,497
She's beautiful.

220
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,329
Yeah. A friend told me about her.

221
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:02,138
I was out of work and feeling 
pretty desperate for something.

222
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,139
Not the last time I was out of work, 
the time before that.

223
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:10,577
And I just had this feeling like 
I was looking in all the wrong places.

224
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,976
Looking for what?

225
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,340
God.

226
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,286
She has an ashram in India. 
I'm dying to go, but...

227
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,789
...you know, you have to get, like, 
three stages of hepatitis shots...

228
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,827
...and my insurance always runs out.

229
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,963
I'll go when the time's right.

230
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,293
There's a gathering of her students 
every morning.

231
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,428
If you want, 
I could take you sometime.

232
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:39,942
If you're not unnerved by 100 
crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.

233
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,007
I need to be unnerved.

234
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,575
David. A yogi from Yonkers.

235
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,517
I didn’t exactly fall in love
with the guy.

236
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,584
What happened was 
I dove out of my marriage...

237
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,384
...and into David's arms...

238
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,824
...exactly the same way 
a cartoon circus performer...

239
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,592
...dives off a high platform
and into a small cup of water...

240
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,502
.. . vanishing completely.

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,074
Your underwear, my queen.

242
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,244
He just folded my delicates.

243
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,118
Oh, my God, baby, 
you are in so much trouble.

244
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,575
Thirty-six?

245
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,749
My client is simply not interested 
in a divorce.

246
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,790
Is he serious?

247
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,830
Is he really representing himself?

248
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,093
One semester of law school 
right here, baby.

249
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,999
Great. Well, what would it take 
to interest your client?

250
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,768
Okay, so here's the deal. 
You have screwed up my life...

251
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,809
...but what I wanna know 
is why couldn't you find yourself...

252
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,846
...in our marriage? Why didn't you 
say what you were thinking?

253
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,506
-I did. You never listened to me. 
-No. You never said:

254
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,449
"Hey, you know what? 
You suck. I'm deeply unhappy."

255
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,954
You just took off. You never gave me a chance to address those problems.

256
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,956
That’s not fair. That’s just quitting.
I took vows.

257
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,028
Till death. 
And I take them seriously.

258
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,398
I believe this is just a phase 
and I'm willing to wait it out.

259
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,034
You are always waiting, Stephen.

260
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,466
Waiting for me to come home, 
to wanna have kids...

261
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,300
...to make you dinner. 
I don'! know why we can'! accept"'

262
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,635
...we don't wanna live 
in unhappiness anymore.

263
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,301
I accept the fact that 
I am occasionally unreliable...

264
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,710
...and I often get sidetracked, 
but I thought you liked that about me.

265
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,214
I thought it was okay 
that I had hopes and dreams.

266
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,980
Have a dream. Stephen, great, 
fine. Do that. Just pick one.

267
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,145
Okay, I pick one. I pick you.

268
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,368
I know this is awful.

269
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,402
But I believe with every molecule of 
my body that you will find the person...

270
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,170
...that wants just what you want.

271
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,678
That will give you what you want 
and what you deserve. I'm not her.

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,177
Well, you obviously know nothing 
about what I want.

273
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,520
My client would like to submit
a song he wrote...

274
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,026
...that he believes is relevant to these 
proceedings. Goes something like this:

275
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,622
Are you kidding?

276
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,134
Quitter, quitter, quitter!

277
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,274
How about I take the blame? 
I am the one who couldn't deal...

278
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,434
...with another weekend roaming 
some box-shaped superstore...

279
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,136
...buying appliances on credit...

280
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,477
...and pretending to be a couple that 
neither one of us ever knew how to be.

281
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,050
You wanted that toaster

282
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,555
"You like faking it, fine. You're stellar. 
I'm the failure. I suck at faking it."

283
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,724
-It was not my finest hour. 
-80 where do things stand now?

284
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,295
We're prepared 
to offer half of everything...

285
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,490
...and my client's retirement accounts

286
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,897
Take it all then. Everything.

287
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,402
He still said no.

288
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,671
-He hates me now. 
-He doesn't hate you.

289
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,243
His heart is broken.

290
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,905
I think he hates you.

291
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,018
I'm never letting you 
out of the basement.

292
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,451
Why don't we talk next week 
and we'll see where things stand?

293
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,180
-Okay. 
-These things have a way...

294
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,983
...of working themselves out.

295
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,837
So why'd you become a vegetarian?

296
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,273
I saw some cows slaughtered 
one time.

297
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,276
Barely touched your dinner.

298
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,779
He's 28.

299
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,679
This is hard for him, isn't it'? 
And you?

300
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,188
The meditations help.

301
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,789
Liz.

302
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,221
You remember a couple of years ago, 
when you threw yourself into...

303
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,059
...the renovation of your kitchen? 
You were consumed...

304
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,168
...with being the perfect wife and cook.

305
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,735
I was trying to make it work.

306
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,805
Well, I think chanting and meditation 
is the same thing...

307
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,635
...in a different costume.

308
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,975
Definitely give me that documentary.

309
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,082
I've been thinking 
about vegetarianism.

310
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,218
My triglycerides 
are through the roof.

311
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,716
Yeah. Thanks for everything.

312
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,912
Great to meet you.

313
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,194
-What? 
-Nothing. It's just..'

314
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,332
...you know, 
you used to look like Stephen.

315
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,831
Now you kind of look like David.

316
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,594
You know?

317
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:18,171
What I meant was, you know how 
people start resembling their dogs?

318
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,112
Why would he say that, 
we look like the same dog'?

319
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,839
-He was joking. 
-Not funny.

320
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,541
Well, he had five Heineken's. 
He was bombed.

321
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,913
Well, not funny.

322
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,555
We don't look like the same dog.

323
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:38,795
If anything, you're a collie 
and I'm a Tibetan mastiff.

324
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,966
Don’t you wanna give me a chance
to miss you?

325
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,824
It begins when 
the object of your affection...

326
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,561
...bestows upon you 
a heady hallucinogenic dose"'

327
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,729
...of something you've never 
even dared to admit you wanted...

328
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,809
...an emotional speed-ball 
of thunderous love and excitement.

329
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,277
Soon you start craving that attention 
with the hungry obsession...

330
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,074
...of any junkie.

331
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,741
When it's withheld, you tum sick; 
crazy, not to mention resentful.

332
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:39,082
...of the dealer who encouraged 
this addiction in the first place...

333
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,623
...but now refuses to pony up 
the good stuff.

334
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,761
Just frustrated, I'm concerned. 
I don't understand.

335
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,419
What don't you get?

336
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,656
What's going on? 
You don't look me in the eye.

337
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,199
-You don'! finish your-- 
-Nobody's asking you to make the bed!

338
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,133
-You don't have sex with me! 
Sometimes I'm not in the mood!

339
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,933
Goddamn him, and he used to 
give it to you for free.

340
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,100
Next stage Ends you skinny, 
shaking in a corner...

341
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,267
...certain only that 
you'd sell your soul...

342
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,505
...just to have that one thing 
one more time.

343
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,310
Well, then why don't we discuss it? 
Why don't we sort it?

344
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,818
-Why don't we act like adults? 
-Okay. Can I have a little space?

345
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,614
-How about that? 
-Meanwhile...

346
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,191
...the object of your adoration 
is now repulsed by you.

347
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,227
-You don't always make me miserable. 
-There's a comfort.

348
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,855
I just-- Sometimes I need to 
come home...

349
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,297
...and have a little David time.

350
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,802
He looks at you like someone
he’s never met before.

351
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,702
-Is that okay? 
-Yeah. No, it's fine.

352
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,969
And not have to, like, you know, 
justify it.

353
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,239
The irony is
you can hardly blame him,

354
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:40,816
I mean, check yourself out. 
You're a mess.

355
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,476
Unrecognizable
even to your own eyes.

356
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,644
You asked me to come here? 
Here I am.

357
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,654
And it turned into something else.

358
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,259
-Didn't it'? 
-You are such a child.

359
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,833
-Right. I can't take this anymore. 
-Great. Perfect.

360
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,335
That's a great response 
to a conversation.

361
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,528
Goddamn it.

362
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:07,609
• You have now reached infatuation’s final destination

363
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,451
The complete 
and merciless devaluation of self.

364
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,051
You wanna go away for a year?

365
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,314
Do you know what I felt when I woke up, Delia?

366
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:57,086
Nothing. No passion, no spark, 
no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.

367
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,458
I've gotten past the point where 
I can be calling this a bad moment.

368
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,964
• And it just terrifies me. Jesus,1 this is like worse than death to me..i

369
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,967
...the idea that this is the person 
I'm gonna be from now on.

370
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,434
This happens to people.

371
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,665
They fall in love in their 20s, 
get married...

372
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,810
...do the granite counter-top, 
white-picket fence in their

373
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,344
...and somewhere they realize, 
"This is not for me."

374
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:20,006
So they fail and they fall down, 
they hurt like hell, they straighten

375
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,448
...and march their asses 
to the shrink's office.

376
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:26,112
-They can’t just check out.
-I am not checking out.

377
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,780
I need to change.

378
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,187
You have a support system 
here, Liz.

379
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,192
You have friends and family 
who love you.

380
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:36,026
And do you feel my love for you? 
My support for you? No.

381
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,691
There's, like, nothing. I have no pulse.

382
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,672
-l am going to Italy. 
-Italy. Why Italy?

383
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,309
-What did you have for lunch? 
-I don't know. A salad.

384
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:51,676
Exactly. I used to have this appetite 
for food, for my life...

385
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,975
...and it is just gone.

386
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,852
I wanna go someplace
where I can marvel at something

387
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,458
Language, gelato, 
spaghetti, something.

388
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,527
-You're talking like a college kid. 
-I've been acting like one.

389
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,222
Since I was 15, I've either been 
with a guy or breaking up with a guy.

390
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,369
I have not given myself two weeks of a breather...

391
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,835
...to just deal with, you know, myself.

392
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,040
What's going on 
with you and David?

393
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,744
What, did you fall out?

394
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,146
I don't know how to be here.

395
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,918
You wanna know how to be here'? 
Stop constantly waiting for something

396
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:45,331
I'm going to Italy and then I'm going 
to David's guru's ashram in Indian.

397
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,904
...and I'm going to and the year 
in Bali.

398
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,441
That's what I'm gonna do.

399
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,273
That's harder to argue with. 
The beaches are nice. But why?

400
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,437
-Ketut told me I would. 
-Guy with no teeth.

401
00:28:58,604 --> 00:28:59,708
When you're desperate...

402
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,375
...and some guy who,
yes, looks a little like Yoda...

403
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,784
...hands you a prophecy, 
you have to respond.

404
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,117
-Do you need a Xanax? 
-Always.

405
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,459
Okay, I'm just gonna say it. 
I'm gonna say it and be done with it.

406
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,722
What if it doesn't work?

407
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,067
My whole life 
fits in a 12-foot-square box.

408
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,468
You know how many times 
I hear that in a day?

409
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,941
Most of them never come back
for their whole life.

410
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,977
-Hello? 
-Liz.

411
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,120
Good news. Stephen just signed 
the divorce papers.

412
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:50,061
I'll probably be back in a weak, 
penniless with dysentery.

413
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,099
You're my hero.

414
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,181
Hey.

415
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,311
If you stay, 
we'll go out for Indian every night.

416
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,289
You never asked me to stay.

417
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,464
Go, go, go.

418
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,180
You know what's funny?

419
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,985
This is the first time in my life 
there's no one waiting at home for me.

420
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,024
I don't even have a home 
to come back to.

421
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,526
Oh, God. You'll make friends.

422
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,823
You'll make friends with a backpack, 
of course.

423
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,466
It'd be great to get away.

424
00:30:56,622 --> 00:31:00,798
Andy and I were talking about getting 
a little villa in Florence for a month.

425
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,633
You know, and in 10 years, 
when Jack is older....

426
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,973
What?

427
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,980
You know why I was giving you 
such a hard time'?

428
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,708
I love my job, my guy and my kid, 
but....

429
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,645
I wish I could go'

430
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,322
I love you and I'm proud of you.

431
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,859
Now go.

432
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,359
There is a wonderful 
old Italian joke...

433
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,861
.,.about a poor man
who goes to church every day...

434
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,365
...and prays before the statue 
of a great saint, bagging:

435
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:12,131
"Dear saint, please, please, please 
let me win the lottery."

436
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,775
Finally, the exasperated statue
comes to life...

437
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,141
...and looks down at the begging man
and says:

438
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,752
"My sun, please, please, please 
buy a ticket. "

439
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,385
So now I get the joke.

440
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,151
And I've got three tickets.

441
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,672
You heat the water on the stove.

442
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,916
So if I want to bathe".?

443
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:02,081
You put the water in the tub.

444
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,429
Okay

445
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:13,169
Yeah. It doesn’t really seem like
enough water to bathe in.

446
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,763
Not enough.

447
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,670
Yes, ifs enough.

448
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,210
Fill it up three, four, five times.

449
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,945
Everything that's important 
gets cleaned.

450
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,635
Is this safe? This..'

451
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,134
...scaffolding? Scaffol...

452
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,296
It holds up the ceiling.

453
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,672
Otherwise it will fall apart.

454
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,971
Everything falls apart, my dear.

455
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,811
The only thing permanent in life 
is family.

456
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,083
You're not married.

457
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,226
No, divorziata.

458
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,253
Why divorced?

459
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,598
We broke it.

460
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,162
You're more happy now'?

461
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,102
I have one rule.

462
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:34,845
No strange men spending the night.

463
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,714
You American girls 
when you come to Italy...

464
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,220
...all you want is pasta...

465
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,415
...and sausage.

466
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,356
I'll take it.

467
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:49,961
Good. You chose well.

468
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,226
Cappuccino.

469
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,564
-It's a zoo in here. 
-And my Italian sucks.

470
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,230
-How long have you been here? 
-Two weeks. You'?

471
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,307
Six weeks. You'll get better.

472
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,239
Two cappuccinos, please.

473
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,107
And warm the milk this time.

474
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,306
Yesterday it was too hot 
and burned my tongue.

475
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,781
-You like Napoleons? 
-Of course.

476
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,318
And two Napoleons, please

477
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,147
Your Italian is fantastic.

478
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,691
I have a wonderful tutor. 
I'll give you his number if you like

479
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,455
-He's really good and he needs work. 
-Oh, great.

480
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,529
Are you Dutch? German?

481
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,328
Swedish. Even colder people, 
if you can imagine.

482
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,870
-I'm Liz, by the way. 
-8011.

483
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,683
You can say:

484
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:35,924
It's past

485
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,042
Too fast, but okay.

486
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,304
You can say:

487
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,549
Yeah.

488
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,226
What a beautiful word

489
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,727
Come on, it's "let's cross over." 
It's so ordinary.

490
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,899
No, it's the perfect combination 
of Italian sounds.

491
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:17,234
It's the wistful "ah," the rolling trill, 
the soothing "ess."

492
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,405
-That's true. 
-I love it.

493
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,108
All right, let me teach you a word.

494
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,741
Therapist.

495
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,013
Therapist.

496
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,986
-Come on. 
-Good. You gotta learn humor.

497
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,647
-It's not. 
-Come on. Cheers.

498
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,261
-Shall we continue Tuesday at 5? 
-Yes.

499
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,598
-With another bottle of the therapy? 
-of course.

500
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,139
-You're doing very well, Liz. 
-Thank you.

501
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,470
And you must be very polite 
with yourself...

502
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,134
...when you learn something new.

503
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,110
Yes. Grazie, I agree.

504
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,807
But your English-- How are you 
even talking to me like this right now?

505
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,510
I think you're gonna teach ma 
more than I teach you.

506
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,622
You have good Italian. Very good.

507
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,219
All right

508
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,826
I am alone.

509
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,281
I feel so guilty. 
I've been in Rome for three weeks...

510
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,950
...all I've done is learn 
a few Italian words and eat.

511
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,960
You feel guilty 
because you're American.

512
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,996
You don't know 
how to enjoy yourself.

513
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,361
-I beg your pardon? 
-It's true.

514
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,800
Americans know entertainment, 
but don't know pleasure.

515
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,202
This is Luca Spaghetti, by the way, 
you know.

516
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,902
Your name is Luca Spaghetti?

517
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,977
Yes, that's what our family is called.

518
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,979
We invented it.
I’m serious. Listen to me.

519
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,516
You want to know your problem? 
Americans.

520
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,081
You work too hard. 
You get burned out.

521
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,917
Then you come home
and spend the whole weekend...

522
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,719
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.

523
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,657
That's not far off, actually.

524
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:36,993
But you don't know pleasure. 
You have to be told you've earned it.

525
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,068
You see a commercial that says, 
"It's Miller time"...

526
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,331
...and you say, "That's right. 
Now I will go to buy a six-pack."

527
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:49,342
And drink the whole thing and wake up 
the next morning and you feel terrible.

528
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,344
But an Italian doesn't need 
to be told.

529
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:56,713
Ha walks by a sign that says, 
"you deserve a break today"...

530
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,353
...and he says, "Yeah, I know.

531
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,355
That's why I'm planning on 
taking a break at noon...

532
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,756
...to go over to your house and sleep with your wife.”

533
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,855
We callit "dolce far niente"

534
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,432
It means".

535
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,533
...the sweetness of doing nothing. 
We are masters of it.

536
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,252
He's right. He says...

537
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,149
...you can't learn Italian like this.

538
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,759
You don't speak the language just with 
your mouth, speak it with your hands.

539
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:37,949
Like this?

540
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,226
Okay. ls yelling.

541
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,466
'THAT MEAL WAS EXCELLENT'

542
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,082
'SUCK IT'

543
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,016
All this gives me a stomachache.

544
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,451
'SCREW YOU'

545
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,259
-I think that's my neighbor Lorenzo. 
-Charming.

546
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,198
ANOTHER WAY 
TO SAY 'SCREW YOU'

547
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,544
So anyway, to start off I'd say....

548
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,374
Excuse me.

549
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:33,972
Come here.

550
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,676
For the table...

551
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,948
...a big platter 
of artichoke alla giudia...

552
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:42,622
...prosciutto with melon...

553
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,158
...and eggplant
with ricotta affumicata.

554
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,030
Then spaghetti alla carbonara...

555
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,791
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...

556
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:52,901
...and Iinguini with clams.

557
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,298
Then trips alla romana...

558
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,461
...and saltimbocca.

559
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,631
And two more liters 
of the vino sfuso from Genzano.

560
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,071
Thank you.

561
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:06,311
You did it. Yes.

562
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,473
Liz Gilbert,
you are a Roman woman now.

563
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,915
No, only honorary.

564
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,055
That is a real Roman woman.

565
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,425
Yeah, with a lot 
of international friends.

566
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,154
That one, I'd bite.

567
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,860
Maybe you and Rome 
just have different words.

568
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,660
-Different words? 
-Yeah.

569
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,499
Yeah. It's like each city has a word, 
if you really think about it.

570
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,505
Like, what is the word for London?

571
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,110
-I would say "stuffy." 
-I would agree with that.

572
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:39,675
-What's the word for Stockholm? 
-Are you kidding? "Conform."

573
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,111
And New York?

574
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:44,685
"Ambition" or "soot."

575
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,182
What's the word for Rome?

576
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,421
It's kind of difficult to think about.

577
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,786
It's classic.

578
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,450
'Sex'

579
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,690
Of course.

580
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:26,722
So, what's your word, Liz? 
I'm curious. I can't figure it out.

581
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,557
Well....

582
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,394
It might be....

583
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:39,073
It started as "daughter." 
I was good at that. And then".

584
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,410
..."wife.“ Not so good.

585
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,410
"Girlfriend."

586
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,076
Not so good.

587
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,683
My word's writer."

588
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,343
Yeah, but that's what you do. 
That isn't who you are, no?

589
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:55,017
Maybe you’re a woman in search of her word.

590
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:12,604
Hey, Sch, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples. 
Maybe my word is 'pizza.". "

591
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:30,684
Listen, lady, I am only 7, but I 
can tell you're a complete moron".

592
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,192
...because I am from Naples.

593
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,060
I love this place, 
but Giovanni said to watch out.

594
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,791
His cousin got mugged here 
in a museum.

595
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,459
-Are you serious? 
-Watch out for the scooter. Yeah

596
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,981
I'm in love. I'm having 
a relationship with my pizza.

597
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,415
You look like you're breaking up 
with the pizza. Whats the matter?

598
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,820
I can't.

599
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,427
What do you mean, you can't? 
This is pizza in Napoli.

600
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,757
It is your moral imperative 
to eat that pizza.

601
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:13,260
I want to, 
but I've gained, like, 10 pounds.

602
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,426
I mean, I've got this....

603
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:17,834
Right here. What's it called? 
What's the word?

604
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,336
A muffin top.

605
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:22,838
I have one too.

606
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,742
I unbuttoned my jeans
five minutes ago just looking at this.

607
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,211
Let me ask you a question.

608
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,443
In all the years you've ever 
undressed in front of a gentleman....

609
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,286
-Hasn't been that many. 
-All right, well...

610
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,350
...has he ever asked you to leave?

611
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,290
-Has he ever walked out? Left? 
-No.

612
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,129
Because he doesn't care.

613
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,027
He's in a room with a naked girl. 
He's won the lottery.

614
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:48,034
I'm so tired of saying no 
and then waking up in the morning...

615
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:51,139
...and recalling every single thing 
I ate the day before.

616
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,366
Counting every calorie 
so I know exactly...

617
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,478
...how much self-loathing 
to take into the shower.

618
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,540
I'm going for it.

619
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,048
I have no interest in being obese. 
I'm just through with the guilt.

620
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,979
This is what I’m gonna do I’m gonna finish this pizza...

621
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,986
...and then we're gonna go 
watch the soccer game.

622
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,591
And tomorrow we're gonna go 
on a little date...

623
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,161
...and buy ourselves 
some bigger jeans.

624
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,832
Giovanni likes a muffin.

625
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,230
Attagirl

626
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,918
He's saying, 
"For whom are you playing?"

627
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,316
Per chi, for whom.

628
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,123
Pull, pull. I'm sucking it in.

629
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,529
Put some Swedish muscle into this.

630
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,930
You think this happened 
to Sophia Loren?

631
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,542
There it goes. Almost got it.

632
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,436
Go, go, go. You're not trying.

633
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,045
I've almost got it. I've almost got it. 
I did it.

634
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:36,073
Oh, that's beautiful' 
You should get it.

635
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,374
For whom?

636
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,647
For you, Liz. Just for you.

637
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,982
• No, I’m happy just with my big lady pants.

638
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,399
Thanks for the day. 
And the leg room.

639
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,342
It was fun.

640
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,112
We're gonna go for food. 
Wanna come?

641
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,843
No. No, I'm

642
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,673
The sweetness of doing nothing

643
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,760
Please. Please get off the Noon

644
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,041
Will you please just".? 
Will you come up here?

645
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:02,517
What if we just acknowledge that 
we have a screwed-up relationship".

646
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,559
...and we stick it out anyway?

647
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:10,130
We accept that we fight a

648
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,131
...and we hardly have sex anymore...

649
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,033
...but that we don't wanna 
live without each other.

650
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:20,669
And that way we can spend 
our lives together...

651
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,868
...miserable...

652
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,982
...but happy not to be apart.

653
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,720
Dear David:

654
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,985
We haven't had any communication 
in a while...

655
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,153
...and it’s given me time
I needed to think.

656
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,897
Remember when you said we should 
live with each other and be unhappy...

657
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,399
...so we could be happy?

658
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,834
Consider it a testimony to how much I love you...

659
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,668
...that I spent so long
pouring myself into that offer...

660
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,003
...trying to make it work.

661
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,346
But a friend took me to the most 
amazing place the other day.

662
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,004
It's called the Augusteum.

663
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,917
Octavian Augustus built it 
to house his remains.

664
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,521
When the barbarians came, they 
trashed it along with everything else.

665
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:11,182
The great Augustus,
Rome’s first true great emperor...

666
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,292
...how could he have imagined 
that Rome...

667
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,023
...the whole world, as far as he was 
concerned, would be in ruins?

668
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,930
During the Dark Ages, someone came 
in here and stole the emperor's ashes.

669
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,594
In the 12th century, 
it became a fortress...

670
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,137
...than a bullring'

671
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,297
They stored fireworks in here 
after that.

672
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,705
Nowadays, it's a bathroom 
for the homeless...

673
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,711
...so you better watch your step 
going down.

674
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:40,722
It’s one of the quietest
and loneliest places in Rome.

675
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,325
The city has grown up 
around it over centuries.

676
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,483
It feels like a precious wound...

677
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,393
...like a heartbreak you won't let go of 
because it hurts too good.

678
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,727
I like it messy.

679
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,066
We all want things 
to stay the same, David.

680
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,900
I guess the guy before me 
must've been some angel, huh?

681
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,440
Settle for living in misery...

682
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,669
...because we're afraid of change, 
of things crumbling to ruins.

683
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:08,408
Than I looked around in this place, 
at the chaos it's endured...

684
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,416
...the way it’s been adapted,
burned, pillaged...

685
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:15,819
...then found a way to build itself 
back up again, and I was reassured.

686
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,257
Maybe my life hasn’t been so chaotic.
It’s just the world that is...

687
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:23,023
...and the only real trap 
is getting attached to any of it.

688
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,256
Ruin is a gift.

689
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:29,597
Ruin is the road to transformation.

690
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,433
Hey.

691
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,599
You ready?

692
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,338
Yeah.

693
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,211
Even in this eternal city, 
the Augusteum showed ms...

694
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:50,792
...that we must always be prepared 
for endless waves of transformation.

695
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,526
Both of us deserve better than staying together...

696
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,897
I ...because we’re afraid well be destroyed if we don’t.

697
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,723
My mother's stuffing. 
Stale bread, walnuts, got those.

698
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,126
Will you get me 
some more potatoes?

699
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:06,359
Oh, I'm always getting you 
more potatoes.

700
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,795
It's my dream, 
a real American Thanksgiving.

701
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,206
The perfect way to say goodbye 
to our Liz.

702
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,372
50...

703
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,574
-...you leave this week, huh? 
-Yes.

704
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,815
And where are you going? Iran?

705
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,711
India.

706
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,455
Liz is making us 
an American meal tonight.

707
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,594
-You are not married, yeah? 
-No.

708
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,494
What's wrong with your friend, 
is she a lesbian?

709
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,564
No, Mama, she’s not a lesbian And she understands Italian.

710
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,899
How’s she going to find
another husband and start a family...

711
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,736
...when she's on the other side 
of the world?

712
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:53,581
If a man said, "I'm going to travel for 
a year and meet wonderful people...."

713
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,239
But she's not a man.

714
00:57:55,773 --> 00:58:01,018
It’s more difficult for a woman to feel that she has the right to make choices.

715
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,920
-It takes a lot of courage. 
-Exactly.

716
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,251
You call it courage, I call it stupidity.

717
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,192
Mama, enough.

718
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,626
I know a number of people 
who would agree with you.

719
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,259
Luca?

720
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:17,428
What time will the turkey be ready?

721
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,698
The turkey....

722
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,273
I haven't defrosted it yet.

723
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,648
Oh, shit.

724
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,439
You only had one thing to do 
and you screwed it up.

725
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,883
I was distracted! It can happen!

726
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,886
Too much good food!

727
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,888
Too many women!

728
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,993
And I forgot!

729
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:41,288
Now, before we eat, everyone...

730
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:44,399
...it is Thanksgiving, 
so let us give thanks.

731
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,296
-Yeah. Come on, join hands. 
-Okay.

732
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,563
So we just say what we....

733
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,668
What we thank God for tonight 
Sofi, why don't you start?

734
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,474
I am grateful for you, Liz...

735
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,985
...for helping me appreciate life...

736
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,480
...with all that comes with it...

737
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,220
...muffin tops and bad times.

738
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,922
And for Giovanni...

739
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,063
...for making me feel...

740
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,824
...loved and secure.

741
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,659
And Giulia

742
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:25,705
Me, I'm grateful for 
my beautiful family

743
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:28,241
My two little daughters and my wife.

744
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,744
I thank God and the Holy Virgin...

745
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,905
...for this very, very special day.

746
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:39,016
And for this beautiful family...

747
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:40,922
...that today is so much bigger.

748
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,517
Very much bigger.

749
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:52,524
I thank you all for this new custom 
of celebration.

750
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,260
And Liz's stuffing.

751
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,395
...and God...

752
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,871
...for my sexiness.

753
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,435
And you, Ruffina?

754
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,549
I thank God for...

755
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,551
...my sexiness.

756
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:19,819
Go ahead. Giovanni.

757
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,486
I thank God for...

758
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,332
...fear...

759
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:29,402
...because for the first time...

760
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,104
...I'm afraid the person next to me...

761
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,167
...will be the one who wants to leave.

762
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,445
Liz?

763
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:50,185
Well, this all makes me so grateful.

764
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,586
Seeing all you happy people...

765
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,288
...who know how to love each other 
and take care of each other.

766
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:03,195
I look at the amazing women I've met 
who I admire so much...

767
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,469
...and the great men, 
taking care of their women...

768
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:11,476
...and putting their children to bed.

769
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,313
I just feel happy...

770
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:19,481
...to see it and to be part of it

771
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:27,320
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

772
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,574
It's a good breakfast, huh?

773
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,967
I will take this to your room.

774
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,977
It has already started.

775
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,955
-I fell asleep. 
-Yeah. Pity.

776
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:25,361
Probably the only person in the world 
who ever fell asleep during meditation.

777
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:36,570
-This leads to the meditation garden. 
-Is the guru here?

778
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:40,112
-She's always here. 
-I know, but is she "here" here?

779
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,375
She's at her ashram in New York

780
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,917
But I came from New York 
to see her here.

781
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:47,749
Sounds like one of her little tricks.

782
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:53,759
The meditation cave.

783
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,956
It’s open 2417
and it’s air-conditioned.

784
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,473
Corella?

785
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:12,474
-This is Liz Gilbert. 
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

786
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:19,451
-Where did you get that button? 
-They sell them in the bookstore.

787
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:23,182
That is exactly what I need. I need 
something like that. I don't listen.

788
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,293
I never have. My mom used to 
call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...

789
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,360
...because I just ramble.
I am a rambler.

790
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,431
I am rambling now. I'm sorry.

791
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:34,124
Silence is a wonderful 
spiritual practice...

792
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:38,102
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell 
you it's more challenging than it looks.

793
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,140
-Wait till you've been here for a while. 
-Okay.

794
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,153
Thank you, Corella. 
I'll be sure to tell her.

795
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,656
-What did she say? 
-No idea.

796
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:01,489
Change into your work clothes. 
I'll take you to your seva.

797
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:04,325
It's a Hindu word 
for "selfless devotional work."

798
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:08,526
-It's required of everyone who stays. 
-Okay. Thank you.

799
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,688
Is there anything in this world skinnier 
than an Indian teenage boy?

800
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,168
-I'm Tulsi. 
-Liz.

801
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:44,865
Where are you from?

802
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:48,999
The next town. My parents have been devotees of the guru for many years.

803
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,542
We spend a lot of time here.

804
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,373
But...

805
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,948
...they are trying to marry me off' 
That's the custom.

806
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:00,520
-That's not what you want? 
-No way. It sucks.

807
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:10,228
I want to study psychology, just as our 
guru did when she attended college.

808
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,568
I prefer to be with God 
than boys my age.

809
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:17,364
No one in my family understands 
my coming all the way to India.

810
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:21,865
Do you ever look at them and wonder, 
"What am I doing in this family?"

811
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,243
You have no idea.

812
01:08:50,994 --> 01:08:55,602
The Guru Gita is an ancient text 
182 verses long.

813
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,905
In it, the goddess Parvati 
is asking Shiva, or God...

814
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,279
...for the secrets of fulfillment.

815
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,476
It's said to have 
transforming qualities.

816
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:09,321
I would just like to take a risk here 
and say....

817
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,689
Me and Guru Gita, 
we just do not get along.

818
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,694
-What is it you have trouble with? 
-Everything.

819
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,990
It’s long, it’s tedious,
I can’t keep up...

820
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:25,003
...and I get these insane anxieties 
about everything in my life...

821
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,936
...and I've lost my place.

822
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,007
Sounds like it has a positive effect...

823
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,612
...if you're having such strong 
emotions and physical reactions.

824
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,880
You keep trying.

825
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:46,191
It is most commendable 
that you ended your marriage.

826
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:49,295
You seem like such a 
happy, free person now.

827
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:52,490
I think my ex-husband 
would describe me as selfish.

828
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,169
You mustn't be angry with yourself 
or disappointed.

829
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:01,332
You don't have to make children 
or be married to have a family.

830
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:06,177
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes 
here big enough...

831
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:08,680
...to stand flat-footed 
and screw a chicken.

832
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,179
-I love you. 
-Liz, have you met...

833
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,686
-..,Richard from Texas? 
-Hello, Richard from Texas.

834
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:17,188
-Nice to meet you, Groceries. 
-Groceries'?

835
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:20,521
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you eating 
before I saw you.

836
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,527
I never seen anybody 
eat so much at one time.

837
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,030
You sure do enjoy your groceries.

838
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:30,829
You know, it’s been a rough day, and if no one takes it personally. J

839
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:34,840
...I'm going to take my large meal 
someplace else to eat it in silence.

840
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:37,171
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.

841
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:43,677
Looked like you were 
working through some...

842
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,514
...pretty rough stuff this morning.

843
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,553
Stuff with your ex-husband?

844
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,518
I got an ex-wife.

845
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:55,187
She thinks I changed my name 
to "Motherfucker."

846
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:00,398
I...

847
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:05,896
I just spent some time in Rome 
and I came here feeling so great.

848
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:09,532
And now here I am, at the source...

849
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,578
...and I feel more disconnected 
than ever.

850
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,041
Why'd you come here?

851
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:17,916
I just want some peace.

852
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,250
Peace?

853
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,552
You wanna get 
to the castle, Groceries...

854
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,284
...you got to swim the moat.

855
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:32,590
Here, you can finish that.
I know you can.

856
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,099
Okay.

857
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:44,306
Simply empty your mind.

858
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,939
Breathe.

859
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:51,407
What am I going to do 
when this year is over?

860
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,281
Where am I going to live?

861
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:54,751
Well, maybe Chicago.

862
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,419
Oh, my God.
I could build a meditation room--

863
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:03,587
No. Stop thinking. 
Why is this so hard?

864
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:11,762
Screw you, Corella. 
How the hell does she do this?

865
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,534
She looks like 
frigging Mother Teresa.

866
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,473
Oh, my God, kill me.

867
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,143
-Who's in the moat today? 
-Shut up.

868
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,479
Sounds like you wrestled 
some big-ass crocs.

869
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,885
You know what? If you're so goddamn 
smart, what are you doing here?

870
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,992
If you're here, 
it makes you smart already.

871
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:35,459
-Do you wanna talk about what--? 
-No, not to you. Thank you.

872
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:38,656
I'm the only one here. You're gonna 
talk about it sooner or later.

873
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:39,959
I cannot focus in there.

874
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:44,367
All I think about is my meditation room 
and how to decorate.

875
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:47,501
Are you shitting me?

876
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,332
Are you kidding me?

877
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:52,844
The meditation room is within, 
Groceries. Decorate that.

878
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:54,811
Do you always talk in bumper sticker?

879
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,348
I do, and here’s another one.

880
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:59,510
You have to learn to select 
your thoughts the way you select...

881
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:02,520
...your clothes every day. 
That's a power you can cultivate.

882
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:05,922
You wanna come here and control 
your life so bad, work on the mind.

883
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,993
That's the only thing 
you should control.

884
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:10,825
If you can't master your thoughts, 
you're in trouble.

885
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,022
I am trying.

886
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:15,192
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem. 
Stop trying. Surrender.

887
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,861
Go out into the garden 
and just sit there and still your mind...

888
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,530
...and you watch what happens.

889
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,539
Why don't you just let it be?

890
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:27,037
Has anyone ever told you 
you look like James Taylor?

891
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:32,914
Every day.

892
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,089
God, he really does.

893
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:48,896
My prayers were always the same.

894
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:53,234
"Please, God, please. 
Open my heart, send me a sign".

895
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,138
...because we both know 
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed."

896
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,245
Look at you, 
floating through Calcutta

897
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,043
Locks like you had 
a great meditation.

898
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,914
I probably have malaria now.

899
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,553
The bites will go away.

900
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:09,920
Eventually everything goes away.

901
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,753
You ever done that, Groceries? 
Bagged for a sign?

902
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,093
That sounds vaguely familiar.

903
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:18,732
Be careful what you wish for. 
You just might get it.

904
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,094
What is your problem?

905
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:24,102
Did you fall in love 
with the wrong woman or something?

906
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,262
Excuse me, Miss Gilbert.

907
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,601
You have a phone call.

908
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,278
How's the Guru Gita treating you?

909
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:36,109
Fine. You'd like her.

910
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:39,685
Did you get my e-mail?

911
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:44,357
Yeah. I’m sorry I didn’t call sooner.

912
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,959
Why didn't you?

913
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,458
Because if! didn’t respond...

914
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:51,622
...we were still having a conversation. 
I was still in it.

915
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,995
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.

916
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:04,638
I just wanted things to be easy. 
We were good when things were easy.

917
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:09,147
It's not that I need "easy" right now. 
I just can't have "so hard."

918
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:12,511
Well, you sound good.

919
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:14,821
Stronger.

920
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,319
So do you.

921
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,652
Yeah, well, I'm an actor, Liz.

922
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,032
I got a part.

923
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,163
It’s off-Broadway, but it’s pretty cool.

924
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,499
I'm happy for you.

925
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:36,171
All right

926
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:38,835
Well, I'll see you around, kid.

927
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:06,865
Check you out.

928
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,067
I have never seen you so focused.

929
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,216
You need a Thums Up.

930
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,893
No, no. No lips on the bottle.

931
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,862
First rule in India is never 
touch anything but yourself.

932
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:41,542
Oh, good God. That's, like, 
five times sweeter than Coke.

933
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:48,412
I think it might have 
methamphetamines in it.

934
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,149
We can only hope.

935
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:56,087
I know you feel awful.

936
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,890
But your life's changing.

937
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:02,256
That's not a bad thing.

938
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:06,059
And you're in the perfect place for it. 
Surrounded by grace.

939
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:11,233
I thought I was over him, but...

940
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:12,929
...I love him.

941
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:14,431
Big deal.

942
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,110
-So you fell in love with someone. 
-l really miss him.

943
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:18,768
So miss him.

944
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:22,644
Send him some light and love every 
time you think of him, then drop it.

945
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,182
You know, if you could clear out 
all that space in your mind...

946
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:29,448
...that you're using 
to obsess over this guy...

947
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,956
...and your failed marriage, 
you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.

948
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,289
And you know what the universe 
would do with that doorway?

949
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,965
Rush in. God would rush in.

950
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:46,300
Fill you with more love 
than you ever dreamed of. Man.

951
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,310
Groceries.

952
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:56,814
I think you have the capacity someday 
to love the whole world.

953
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,317
What do they sell over there?

954
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:13,323
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles

955
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,867
I'm gonna need a lot of these.

956
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:22,669
Speaking of elephants, there's a rogue 
elephant on the loose in the area.

957
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,342
He was with carnival.

958
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,141
They say he is very, 
very unpredictable and volatile.

959
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,375
That just makes him more attractive 
to her.

960
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,520
How'd you get to be so smart? 
I'll bet it was the hard way.

961
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:34,882
Don't change the subject

962
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:39,752
Well, when is this grieving phase 
going to pass?

963
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,260
You want a day on a calendar 
you can circle?

964
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:45,365
-Can you give me one?
-No. You got to do the work.

965
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:48,195
Meditate and go to seva..

966
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,566
...and most important, get your butt 
down to the Geet every morning...

967
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,035
...and something'il change.

968
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:57,200
I just cannot get through the Guru Gita. 
I can't find that feeling of devotion.

969
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:01,439
Okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody 
or something you wanna devote it to.

970
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:04,881
It doesn’t have to be the guru.
It’s all the same to her.

971
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:07,248
This is about you.

972
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:13,556
Can I tell you something, Groceries? 
You got some serious control issues.

973
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:15,559
Is it obvious?

974
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:19,689
All right, Richard, 
get out from inside my head now.

975
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:20,890
Shut the door.

976
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,067
-That's him? 
-That's him.

977
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:31,238
-He's hideous. 
-No, he's not. He's cute.

978
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,777
He's a Sagittarius.

979
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,382
He studies computer programming
in Delhi.

980
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,381
He has very good grades.

981
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,919
And his family is very, very wealthy

982
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:46,925
He will be very conceited 
and dictatorial.

983
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,926
My life is over at 17.

984
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,803
Tulsi.
