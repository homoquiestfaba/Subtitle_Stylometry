487
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,757
That'd be
a good thing, right?

488
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,559
Hey, boss...
(Whispers)

489
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,076
See, Ernie...

490
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,112
Ernie here is different.

491
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,114
- (Chuckling)
- He has needs.

492
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:53,817
- He needs to feel important.
- Yeah, fuck right, he does.

493
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,621
See, Ernie,
Ernie needs

494
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,257
to be more than just
a chauffer.

495
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,593
That's why he's
brought you to me.

496
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,629
And Ernie needs to be
more than just my collector,

497
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,666
and that's why he's introduced me into your world.

498
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,701
- That's right.
- That's right.

499
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:14,038
He also needs
to prove to the FBI

500
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,073
that he knows all
about my operations,

501
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,741
and that is why
Ernie's a dead man.

502
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,310
Simon--
(Groaning)

503
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,347

- (Mocking stammer)

508
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,698
No. See, Dylan--

509
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,335
you didn't think.

510
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,070
You just desired.

Shit, man.
Dude, you can't do this.

513
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,011
No, see, i can

514
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,946
because this is my world

515
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,681
and my desires rule.

516
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,651
- I can-- i can pay you.
- Look-- what?

517
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:03,754
- Let me pay you, man!
- I'm sure you can.

518
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,689
(Sobs)

519
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,625
Kill him.

520
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,861

go out of his eyes.

Tell her.

your friend died.

No.

1023
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:20,169
It was so Dylan could
have a little sit-down

1024

with delacorte and his gang to
peddle their filthy fucking drugs

Oh, Dylan, no.

1027
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,114
- No.
- You and me, man.

1028
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,452
You and me, we were born
with everything.

Everything!

- I'm sorry, all right?

No, this is way too much, Dylan.
