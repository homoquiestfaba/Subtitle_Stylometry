1
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,834
Think we'll catch something today?

2
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,834
I think if we keep thinking so much,
it's gonna be a long day.

3
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,375
- Look!
- Yeah, buddy, there you go.

4
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,166
Okay, well, that one got away.

5
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,750
Go ahead. Cast again.

6
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,625
Yeah, buddy.

7
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,083
And now we wait, quietly.

8
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,959
That thing's almost bigger
than you, buddy.

9
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,542
I know, it's so big.

10
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,433
We'll cook up some bass
when we get home, how does that sound?

11
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,625
Yes, I think I got a chance to place
if I catch one that big on Monday.

12
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:55,000
You okay, Dad?

13
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, buddy, yeah.

14
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,292
Monday, what's Monday?

15
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,834
The tournament, North Texas Young Anglers.

16
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,792
Oh, yes, yes, no, of course.

17
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,183
- Come on, Dad.
- I'll tell you what,

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,834
you catch a bass that big on Monday,
you're gonna win a trophy.

19
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,834
But if you reel in some tin cans,

20
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:17,876
you and I can collect some cash
at the recycling center.

21
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,500
How does that sound?

22
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,417
- Very funny.
- No, I'm serious.

23
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,667
The decorations are great,
the food is perfect.

24
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,667
You have out done yourself, honey.

25
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,709
And you know,
you never should have given up

26
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,208
- on event planning.
- I know, Mama,

27
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,083
you've mentioned that
a time or two or six.

28
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,041
- Right, I know...
- But life has other plans.

29
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,834
I'm just saying, I'm saying.

30
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,000
- Now, it's time, all right, come on.
- Okay.

31
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,625
He's here, he's here, guys, he's here.

32
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,459
Yeah, he's here, he's here.

33
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,167
- What's your mom got up her sleeve?
- Nothing.

34
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,917
- You sure he's here?
- Yeah, I think so.

35
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,167
- Right, you heard the car?
- He should be here any minute.

36
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,834
- Oh, surprise, wow.
- No, he did not.

37
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,292
We got them.

38
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,292
I cannot believe this guy.

39
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,417
No way. What in the world?

40
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,792
You feel like you have a heart attack?
I get you? Yeah?

41
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,208
How...? Get outta here, honey.
I cannot believe you.

42
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,625
You, I thought you had this under control.

43
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,083
I mean, I tried.
I told him there was nothing going on.

44
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,083
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
- Step aside.

45
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,876
Happy birthday, man.

46
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,250
Good to see you.

47
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,584
Oh, my gosh, you guys are
just like standing this way,

48
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,208
- just like...
- Happy birthday, Bobby.

49
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,584
Good to see you.

50
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,917
Oh, man, I got a good one.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A few years back,
me, Bobby, Derek, and Doug,

52
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,959
we all head up
to Great Bear Lake in Canada

53
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,500
for a nice little guys'
camping/fishing trip,

54
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,208
you know, good bonding time.

55
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,083
So we get up there, only to find out

56
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,375
that there had been
a massive storm and flooding

57
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,584
that wreaked havoc on the land
for like an entire week.

58
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,208
All the boats busted, washed away.

59
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,417
There is no way for us
to get out on this lake,

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,292
and we spent the next five days
dissecting the contents

61
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,959
- of Derek's wallet.
- Yep, pocket jacks never hold up.

62
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,625
I told you, don't play the jacks,

63
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,375
but the whole time,
Bobby here, he is shouting.

64
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,459
I mean, he's going mad
because he has to go commando

65
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,959
because Cyndi forgot
to pack him his underwear.

66
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:59,208
- Well...
- He ranted and raved about it all week.

67
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,667
Oh, did you remember?
Remember? 'I'm chafing, man.

68
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,334
I'm freaking chafing.'

69
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,000
So anyway, we finally head on home

70
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:12,334
and Bobby instantly starts going off
about his whole lack of drawers.

71
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:16,667
I mean, he's like, 'Of all things,
how was she gonna forget about that?'

72
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,626
So Cyndi, being the saint that she is,

73
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,626
she stops him dead in his tracks,

74
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:26,417
she goes over, grabbed his tackle box,
pops that sucker open,

75
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:32,626
- and it is crammed full of underwear.
- Underwear!

76
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,167
I guess he didn't find that one
as funny as I did.

77
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,709
Hey, are you okay?

78
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:56,918
Hey, come here, come here.
Honey, honey, honey, what's going on?

79
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,167
- Shh, it's okay, it's okay. Breathe.
- You're the man, Bobby.

80
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,208
Honey, look at me.
Honey, look at me. Look at me, baby.

81
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:06,375
You're all right,
you're all right, it's okay.

82
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,000
Breathe, honey. Honey, what's going on?

83
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,167
Honey, what's going on?

84
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,626
Please tell me,
talk to me, what's going on?

85
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,667
Honey, I'm right here, look at me.

86
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:19,584
Breathe, it's okay. It's okay, honey.

87
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:21,584
Are you all right?

88
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,125
- No.
- You wanna go inside?

89
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,167
No, no, no,
maybe we should go inside, okay?

90
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,083
Let's go, let's go, come on, come on.

91
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,959
Let's go inside,
lay down for a little bit.

92
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,417
Hey, we'll be right back, y'all.

93
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,459
- Can we talk?
- I'm exhausted, Cyndi.

94
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,042
Could we please do this tomorrow?

95
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,500
It's happening again, isn't it?

96
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:14,918
It's fine.

97
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,334
Have you stopped taking your medication?

98
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,751
Bobby, honey.

99
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:44,501
Hey, it's okay.

100
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,042
It's okay.

101
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,542
So what do you think Saul felt

102
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:59,250
the moment after God spoke to him
on the road to Damascus?

103
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:05,292
Guilt, remorse, shame?

104
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,709
Well, I would hope so.

105
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,918
You mess with good Christians,
you better feel pretty darn bad.

106
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,793
Now, I'm sure he felt all of those things,
as we all would,

107
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,918
but he didn't let that shame or pride

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,501
get in the way of what he needed to do
to make things right.

109
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:33,459
We all have our failings,
the cracks in our armor,

110
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,250
but if we keep moving forward,

111
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:41,584
as Saul did, it doesn't matter.

112
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,250
We can let it go,

113
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,125
as I am gonna let this sermon go

114
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,751
because, yeah,
Cowboys are on in half an hour.

115
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,250
Bobby, you gotta talk to me.

116
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,584
You can scream,
you can mumble, I don't care,

117
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,167
but you gotta talk to me.

118
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,292
Please.

119
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,542
Sorry.

120
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,584
What are you doing?

121
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,459
- Phillip, roll up your window.
- But, Mom...

122
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,751
Phillip, roll it up now!

123
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,292
God bless you, son.

124
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:47,000
I know it's not nothing,
but I don't know what it is.

125
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,125
And I think putting it into words
makes it more terrifying.

126
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,960
Did he hurt you?

127
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that.

128
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,459
It's like before, but it's different.

129
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:06,501
There's like this darkness
hanging over him.

130
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,834
Sweetheart, you've been
through this battle with Bobby before.

131
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,376
It wasn't easy for you then, I know that,

132
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,376
but you tackled it head-on.

133
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,292
And I always, always admired that.

134
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,042
What if this time it's worse?

135
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:25,668
What if I can't help him?

136
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,542
Gotta trust
that God knows what's best for you

137
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,417
and your family, sweetheart.

138
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,417
He has filled your heart to the brim

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,793
and he's put people in your life
who love you,

140
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,542
who want to help you.

141
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not all up to you, baby girl.

142
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,209
Ready to come in second?

143
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,417
With this bait?

144
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,292
I've won so many competitions with this,
can't even count them.

145
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:05,584
Hey, catch a good one! You got this.

146
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:12,376
Hey, Phil, where's your dad?
Too embarrassed to admit you're his?

147
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,543
Well, look it,
no doubt every scaly critter

148
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:19,876
in Lake Lavon is trembling
at the sight of you lot.

149
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:23,251
Check your lines, ladies and gents,

150
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:27,459
and we're gonna get started
in five spins of that ole clock face.

151
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:02,876
You're the man, Bobby.

152
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,960
You're the man, Bobby.

153
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,835
Hey, Bobby...

154
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:20,251
Hey, what's going on?

155
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,417
Hey, I need your eyes
on something out here, buddy.

156
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,167
Come on.

157
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,251
- Yeah.
- Come on.

158
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,292
Hey, honey, are you ready to rock it?

159
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,459
Yeah.

160
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:46,543
Okay, well, you better catch a big one
'cause I'm really, really hungry.

161
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,668
You don't keep it, Mom.

162
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,126
What? Well, what kind of a deal is that?

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,292
Well, you better get that trophy,
so we can pawn it for some enchiladas.

164
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,084
- Okay, okay.
- Good luck.

165
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,584
Aw, did mommy teach you how to fish too?

166
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,543
Alrighty then, it's time to go get it.

167
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:09,709
First heat is 45 minutes, go get them!

168
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,251
Well, don't you worry about it,

169
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,309
we're gonna get this
all sorted out for you, all right?

170
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,334
Keep you posted.

171
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,209
It's not a big deal, all right,
just work with the boys here

172
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,459
to try to get things fixed

173
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:22,559
and see if you can
smooth things out with both clients

174
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,945
without having to pony up
too much of a discount, all right?

175
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:26,835
Are you ready to go?

176
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,209
They can't be biting every day,
otherwise it'd just be called collecting.

177
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:35,584
He said he'd be here.

178
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,751
I know, I'm sure there was
an emergency at work or something.

179
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,292
He promised.

180
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:43,918
Sweetheart, your daddy loves you
very, very much,

181
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,084
and he wouldn't not show up
without a really good reason.

182
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,584
You know that, right?

183
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,209
Look, I bet he's calling
to explain it to you right now.

184
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,918
Okay, I have one very unhappy kid
in the car with...

185
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:10,334
Okay, Joe, yeah.
Okay, I'll be right there.

186
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,000
What's going on?

187
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,167
Buckle up.

188
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,710
Stay in the car.
Stay in the car, I'll be right back.

189
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,584
- Is Dad okay?
- Stay in the car!

190
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:33,559
Come on, Bobby, come back here.

191
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:36,459
Bobby, stop it! No.

192
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,710
Look at me, Bobby, please.
Please look at me, love.

193
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,376
- We're here for you, Bobby.
- It's okay, it's okay.

194
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:52,960
I know you're struggling,
and I know you feel alone,

195
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:57,459
but you are not, I'm right here.

196
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,167
Can you hear me, Bobby?

197
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,668
Please tell me you can hear me.

198
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,626
It's okay, it's okay.

199
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,710
Come on, Bobby.

200
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:15,418
It's okay.

201
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,543
You listen to me.

202
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,251
I have seen you fight,

203
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:38,710
and no one is stronger or more brave,

204
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:43,543
and I am here to fight with you.

205
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:53,543
I just need you to come back to me,
Bobby, please, please.

206
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:55,293
No, stop.

207
00:17:55,376 --> 00:18:01,710
Step back to me, Bobby.
Come back to me, Bobby, please.

208
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:04,710
I've got you, just come back to me.

209
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,418
It's okay.

210
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:13,543
It's okay, it's okay, come back to me.

211
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,418
It's okay. It's okay.

212
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:16,585
No!

213
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,876
- Bobby!
- Get your hands off me!

214
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,793
- I won't let you take me!
- Bobby! It's me! Bobby!

215
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,001
Stop, Bobby!

216
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:26,376
- Come on! Hey!
- No! No, Dad.

217
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:36,001
It's okay, Bobby. It's okay, man.

218
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,001
Hey.

219
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,293
Joe, I...

220
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,126
No, don't worry about it, it's all right.

221
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,251
Look, I've known Bobby a long time,

222
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,793
you know, we've been
through some stuff together.

223
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,168
I know what he's been through, I just...

224
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,585
I didn't realize
it had gotten this bad for him.

225
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,626
He's been doing really good
for a really long time.

226
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,960
It's just recently...

227
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,501
He needs to get some help, Cyndi, he does.

228
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:46,376
I had a cousin
a few years ago back in Amarillo

229
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,268
and outta nowhere,
I mean, he just started hearing things

230
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,585
and seeing things that weren't there,
it looked a lot like this.

231
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,293
I'm scared, Joe.

232
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:58,334
He's gonna be all right, all right?

233
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,376
He's gonna be fine.

234
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,877
Just find somebody
that knows what they're doing

235
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,251
to take a look at him,
get him whatever help he needs.

236
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,084
I already called Dr. Bartley,

237
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:09,852
and we're seeing him
first thing tomorrow morning

238
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,668
- and we'll just take it from there.
- Good.

239
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,668
This is crazy.

240
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,501
Phillip, you think
he's gonna be all right?

241
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,376
I hope so.

242
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,501
Okay, good,
why don't you go see how he's doing.

243
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:24,585
Okay.

244
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,428
If you need anything,
I'm here for you, okay?

245
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,126
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

246
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,126
Bobby!

247
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,793
So he's only been missing for four hours?

248
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,835
In that case, he can't be listed
as a missing person yet.

249
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,376
But even if it had been enough time,

250
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,042
you said he left
of his own volition, that right?

251
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,668
My husband is not well.

252
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,668
Do you believe he's dangerous?

253
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:18,418
No.

254
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,626
In that case,
there's only so much we can do.

255
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:26,251
We'll have him in our system,
keep an eye out.

256
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,877
Most of the time,
they show back up at home.

257
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,209
Hello, Hospital Administration, please.

258
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,543
Hi there, my name is Cyndi Saunders

259
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,960
and I spoke with somebody earlier today
about my husband.

260
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:24,626
Yes, I e-mailed the photo of him over
like you asked,

261
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,831
and I was just calling
to make sure that you got that.

262
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:31,501
Okay, good, thank you for your help.

263
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,418
Would it be all right
if I dropped by later with some flyers?

264
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,626
Thank you, mm-hm, bye-bye.

265
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:52,877
Good afternoon,
I'm with Texas Regency Collections.

266
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,543
Sorry to bother you today,
but we've been trying to get a hold

267
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:59,752
of a Robert Saunders for several weeks now

268
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:04,001
regarding some open credit accounts
that are outstanding.

269
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,877
Unfortunately, since there's been
no response to our inquiries,

270
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,084
we're gonna have to report
the delinquencies.

271
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:19,001
That well, huh?

272
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,418
You know, truth be told,
that kitchen's far too big.

273
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:26,710
And who wants to clean all those tiles?
And the stairs?

274
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:30,585
You're not a spring chicken,
your knees will thank you.

275
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:17,168
Cyndi? Cyndi.

276
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,126
Good morning, Marilynn.

277
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,960
I just wanted to check on you
with everything going on.

278
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:25,919
Thank you, that's very kind,
but we're doing all right.

279
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,335
You are so strong, Cyndi.

280
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,143
If I was in your shoes,
I don't know what I would do...

281
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,477
Yes, well, there are a lot of people
who have it way worse than we do,

282
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,585
and this is only temporary.

283
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,668
Why don't you come over Tuesday
for lunch?

284
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:38,251
I stole the tastiest
summer-squash casserole recipe

285
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,627
from my mother...

286
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,268
Thank you so much for the offer,
but we're okay.

287
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:42,293
Right, bud?

288
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,627
- Yeah.
- Sure, if you need something...

289
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,668
Yes, thank you so much, I appreciate it.

290
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,377
Okay, take these, these and donate.

291
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,043
Don't look at me like that.

292
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:21,668
Who are you talking to, Mom?

293
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:24,043
Just the ghost of a former life.

294
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,460
What?

295
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,335
Nothing, nothing, honey.
Okay, I need your help.

296
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,335
I have three piles here.
I have take, donate and trash.

297
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,218
And we gotta be merciless
or your grandmother,

298
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,335
she's gonna flip her lid.

299
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:38,043
So can you put all that
in the trash box right there?

300
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:41,001
Okay, Mom, I will.

301
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,085
Thank you.

302
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:14,919
Honey.

303
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:17,835
Mom.

304
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,377
I know you miss him very much,

305
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:33,043
and I know that wherever he is,
he misses you just as much.

306
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:41,001
He didn't wanna leave us,
he can't help that he's sick.

307
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,543
You know, I never understood
why he likes this stuff so much.

308
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,460
Maybe we should try it.

309
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,669
Love only goes so far, kiddo.

310
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,293
Grandma!

311
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,585
He's sitting there all by himself
with his stupid haircut.

312
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,252
Oh, look at his face.

313
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:54,085
- He's crazy.
- I know.

314
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:01,919
Aw, you need a toy? Are you gonna cry, cry
without your daddy?

315
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,293
Give it back, Bryan, it's my dad's.

316
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,961
Ew, let's hope crazy isn't contagious.

317
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:11,001
Do it again, make fun of my dad again!

318
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:15,085
You're a psycho, just like him.

319
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:34,126
Mom, I'm sorry, Bryan...

320
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,771
You're punching people in the face now?

321
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,460
You nearly broke that kid's nose.

322
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,669
He called Dad a psycho.

323
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:42,544
Yeah, well, what does that kid know
about your father?

324
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,168
- Nothing.
- Exactly.

325
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:48,210
He wanted to provoke you
and you let him.

326
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:51,252
And now because of that,
I have missed two job interviews.

327
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,418
Okay, we didn't ask for any of this,

328
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,335
but we get to choose how we react to it.

329
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:06,418
Will we ever find him?

330
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,335
I believe we will.

331
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,127
But until then we have
to take responsibility,

332
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:22,585
no matter how hard
and no matter if every part of us

333
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,752
wants to punch the world in the face.

334
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:38,961
- Mrs. Saunders.
- Oh, yes.

335
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,168
You misspelled 'attention.'

336
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:56,627
I did?

337
00:31:57,627 --> 00:31:58,627
Right there.

338
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,752
I did.

339
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:05,585
Spell check...

340
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:11,377
I'm gonna be honest, Mrs. Saunders,
there's not a lot to go on here.

341
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:15,585
Yes, I do realize
that my work experience is limited.

342
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:18,669
It says you haven't worked in 10 years.

343
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:21,043
Yes, I have been a mom.

344
00:32:21,877 --> 00:32:23,502
I served full time for 10 years,

345
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:26,460
I've been taking care of my husband
and my son and my home.

346
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:28,794
That has been my job.

347
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:32,168
And a tough one it is, I know that.

348
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:39,085
Mr. Cummings, I know
that my résumé might not be perfect,

349
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,794
but I am dependable,
hardworking and determined.

350
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:48,627
I will always be on time,
and I will never complain,

351
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,168
and I guarantee you, you can count on me.

352
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:58,168
Don't make me regret this.

353
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:01,168
I'm gonna give it a go,
but you have to be quick.

354
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:03,085
I hope you're a fast learner,
Mrs. Saunders.

355
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:10,752
Oh, alrighty then, alrighty, thank you.

356
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:11,836
Thank you.

357
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:16,627
And we get 10% off all groceries,
you're welcome.

358
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,002
Even the seafood?

359
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,293
Even the seafood.

360
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:23,961
Oh, well, it's official, Tuesday nights
are lobster mac-and-cheese nights.

361
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,335
That street fighter you're raising
needs to bulk up.

362
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,335
Don't even get me started on that.

363
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,043
One minute I can't get him to talk,

364
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:34,168
and the next he's a mini Mike Tyson.

365
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:43,836
Hello.

366
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,711
I know this isn't easy, Mrs. Saunders,

367
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,419
we just need you to follow us.

368
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:09,085
Right this way.

369
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:51,711
It's not him.

370
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:03,335
What...?

371
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,210
The jacket he was wearing,

372
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:13,085
it had a dry-cleaning tag
with your husband's name on it.

373
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:15,836
That's Bobby's.

374
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:27,752
Are you okay, ma'am?

375
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,168
Yeah.

376
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:35,377
How did he...?

377
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,335
They get sick, they lay down,
the elements set in,

378
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:42,127
they don't get back up again.

379
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,752
The rainy season's bad enough,
it's only gonna get worse

380
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,294
when the snowstorms come in.

381
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:49,586
What's gonna happen to him?

382
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:53,210
- We're trying to find the next of kin.
- What happens if you can't find anyone?

383
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:02,752
He just disappears, without a funeral,

384
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:05,377
or a way to say goodbye or nothing?

385
00:36:14,544 --> 00:36:15,794
Where did you find him?

386
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,169
You're looking for Keith?
That's his jacket.

387
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:06,627
I'm sorry?

388
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:11,711
You're too late,
he took his final trip last night.

389
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,669
Did you know him?

390
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:17,544
Well, who are you?
And why are you asking?

391
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:22,377
I'm sorry for your loss.

392
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,002
I'm sure you are.

393
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,335
Excuse me?

394
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,700
Well, if you knew Keith was dead,
what are you doing here?

395
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,127
He ain't got nothing worth taking.

396
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,461
I don't know. I don't know and I guess...

397
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,335
One of those.

398
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,919
What, did he chat you up
outside your office,

399
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:44,753
he sing you a tune?

400
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:47,794
You give him some change now and again,
maybe your leftovers.

401
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:52,627
Now he's dead and you feel guilty,
and, you know, that about right?

402
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:57,085
No, that's not it at all, actually.

403
00:37:58,335 --> 00:37:59,586
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

404
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:03,836
Here, this is for your trouble.

405
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,544
Conscience all good and clear now?

406
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:12,210
Don't be a stranger.

407
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,461
Are you hungry?

408
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:20,002
What do you think?

409
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:28,419
Nope, that sounds like you're doing
all the right things,

410
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:30,127
checked all the right places.

411
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,586
You know, and there's a lot of holes
to hide in, in this city

412
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:34,878
if you don't wanna be found.

413
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:38,627
I'm sure he'll show up.

414
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:45,586
It's not worth it.

415
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:54,002
So, Keith,

416
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:56,836
did you know him?

417
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,544
Yeah, I knew him a few years.

418
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:05,753
Think he made his way up here
from New Orleans after the storm.

419
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,377
Did he have any family?

420
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:14,294
Yeah, you know, as a matter of fact,

421
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:17,002
he drew me
this really fancy family tree once

422
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:19,002
with all these branches,

423
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:22,169
and he also gave me
the home phone numbers of his relatives.

424
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,210
You're making fun of me.

425
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,961
Why all the interest in poor old Keith?

426
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:31,878
I'm not buying the good Samaritan routine,
so you can just really cut with that crap.

427
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:37,210
I guess I just wanna know
more about the man

428
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,002
that I thought was my husband
before they pulled back the sheet.

429
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,878
I'm not trying to be an angel here,

430
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:49,169
I'm as flawed as anybody.

431
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,336
But where I'm at right now,
it's getting harder and harder

432
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,669
to ignore the senselessness of it all.

433
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:09,002
Yeah, Keith was a good enough guy,
he never cursed,

434
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:13,836
and always shared when he could,
he used to sing a lot,

435
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,461
he thought he was Marvin Gaye.

436
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:19,544
I will miss him.

437
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,419
And what about you?

438
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:25,377
Nope, I can't sing a lick.

439
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:28,586
I mean, your story.

440
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,085
It ain't much different
than a lot of folks.

441
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:41,544
I served in Kuwait,
I saw some things I wish I hadn't,

442
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,920
I came back to Waco to forget them,

443
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,628
I got a man,

444
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,669
I got a little house.

445
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:57,294
He got sick, he got real sick.

446
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:01,169
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

447
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:06,336
After he passed, I don't know,
I just slowly stopped doing everything.

448
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:09,878
I just stopped caring.

449
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:15,502
I dunno, I can't piece
the rest of it together if I tried.

450
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:18,461
You get caught up
in that current, it just...

451
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:22,586
Don't do that.

452
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:25,377
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

453
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,044
You say that a lot, you know.

454
00:41:32,294 --> 00:41:33,294
Sorry.

455
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:37,461
Apologies are nice,

456
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:44,544
but waffles, now,
that is the real medicine right there.

457
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:48,669
Here, try some.

458
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,044
Thank you for the meal.

459
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,247
Oh, don't mention it.
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

460
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:02,419
No, really, I'm good, I feel like walking.

461
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:04,211
Are you sure? It's no trouble.

462
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:06,169
Yeah, no, I'm good.

463
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,336
I hope your husband's okay.

464
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,419
Thank you.

465
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:29,961
Delia!

466
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,586
Just, I don't know,
maybe it'll help with the cold.

467
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:49,002
- You sure?
- Sure. Yeah, please take it.

468
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:53,961
It'll help, thank you.

469
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,836
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

470
00:42:56,711 --> 00:42:58,336
- Good night.
- Good night.

471
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:17,503
Where were you, Mom?

472
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:21,044
I just had to check
on some things downtown.

473
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:23,377
About Dad?

474
00:43:24,753 --> 00:43:25,753
Kinda.

475
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:29,795
I met a nice lady,

476
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:33,965
and I have to tell you something
and I hope you're not gonna be mad at me.

477
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:35,711
I won't be.

478
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:43,294
Do you remember that blanket
that you had in the car?

479
00:43:43,378 --> 00:43:45,544
The one you got from Lake Fork?

480
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:46,628
Yeah.

481
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:48,711
Well, the lady that I met tonight,

482
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,628
she didn't really have that much,
so I gave her your blanket.

483
00:43:55,795 --> 00:43:56,795
Was she cold?

484
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:01,461
Yes, sweetheart, she was.

485
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:06,461
Sounds like she needed it
more than me then.

486
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,628
Dang, you're a good kid.

487
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:12,920
Who raised you?

488
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:20,669
You think Dad's cold like that too,
wherever he is?

489
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:25,336
I hope not.

490
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,044
I wish we could give them all blankets,
every last one of them.

491
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:09,836
- Good morning, Cyndi.
- Pastor, good morning.

492
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,962
I'm sorry to come by without calling.
I did try, but no luck.

493
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:18,419
I just found out you moved, in fact.
It's beautiful.

494
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:24,211
You both came to me this morning
while I was reading scripture

495
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:27,711
and I felt the need to check in.

496
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,711
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

497
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:39,962
You brew a strong cup.

498
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:44,002
Mountain Roast is a dollar off
with a coupon this week.

499
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:46,711
Well, I appreciate the tip.

500
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:52,628
I got a sneaking suspicion,
you're here to deliver one yourself.

501
00:45:55,836 --> 00:46:00,711
I wouldn't say that necessarily,
more of an invitation,

502
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:04,461
for an ear, for reflection.

503
00:46:05,836 --> 00:46:09,044
I promise I won't start peppering you
with scripture.

504
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:11,670
I read the Bible, I have read it,

505
00:46:12,378 --> 00:46:14,728
and you don't need to worry about us,
we're doing just fine.

506
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:18,586
Every morning I get up and I put
one foot right in front of the other,

507
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,002
and we are getting by.

508
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:23,878
Well...

509
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:27,795
God wants you
to do more than get by, Cyndi.

510
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,211
Really?

511
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:34,169
Oh, well, then maybe
He should have stopped my husband

512
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:35,836
from coming apart at the seams...

513
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:41,378
and leaving us without even two nickels
to rub together...

514
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:44,294
and leaving my son lost,

515
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:46,419
not knowing when he's gonna see
his daddy again...

516
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:49,670
and leaving me.

517
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:55,586
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know that's not how it works.

518
00:46:56,253 --> 00:46:59,586
What you're going through,
the anger and the sadness,

519
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,836
these are hardwired into us,

520
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:06,253
but we're also given the tools
to overcome them.

521
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:10,336
I pray, pastor, over and over these days.

522
00:47:10,419 --> 00:47:16,211
Prayers are excellent tools, they are,
but that's just the start of it.

523
00:47:17,378 --> 00:47:22,419
There's a community at Mercy Valley
that you can lean on.

524
00:47:23,294 --> 00:47:26,711
No matter how big or small the need,
there are hearts open to you.

525
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,044
And that's real nice and all,

526
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:32,503
but there is nobody who can help
with what we need.

527
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:37,169
I see why it might feel that way,

528
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:41,378
but there's strength
to be found in others, in their faith.

529
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:45,086
It can help you find purpose.

530
00:47:47,086 --> 00:47:50,837
Okay, I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

531
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,211
but we got a full day ahead of us, so...

532
00:47:56,336 --> 00:47:58,670
- Of course, Cyndi...
- I'll walk you out.

533
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:04,253
I appreciate you checking in on us.
Phillip, especially.

534
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,128
You know...

535
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:12,336
It doesn't always make sense, the plan.

536
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:15,169
I mean, even hearing
someone talking about a plan

537
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:20,545
feels like a twisting of a knife,
I get that.

538
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:24,419
But nobody, least of all Him,
wants to see you adrift.

539
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:30,461
So just keep your heart open, Cyndi.

540
00:48:31,878 --> 00:48:36,378
Listen, look,
be ready for the call when it comes.

541
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:43,711
Well, you know where to find me
if you need any more tips.

542
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,461
I'm here for you,
the whole church is here for you.

543
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:49,628
- Okay.
- Thank you.

544
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:57,461
Mom.

545
00:49:09,002 --> 00:49:11,711
Now, today, you are in for a treat,

546
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,503
I'm not gonna do all the talking for once.

547
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:19,753
We have a member of our congregation
who would like to speak to you all

548
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,086
about something incredibly important.

549
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,420
You've got this, Mom.

550
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:27,753
Cyndi Saunders, you have the floor.

551
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:46,795
Thank you, Pastor Stevens,
for giving me the opportunity

552
00:49:46,878 --> 00:49:48,461
to speak with everyone today,

553
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:51,044
and thank you all for listening.

554
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:57,378
Many of you know my husband, Bobby.
It's kind of hard not to.

555
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:02,169
He never missed a service,
and he was always there

556
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:04,920
to lend a helping hand
even if he barely knew you.

557
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:10,837
And you probably have heard
a lot of chatter about him lately.

558
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:17,837
And the truth is,
my husband is not well...

559
00:50:20,086 --> 00:50:23,837
and he did, in fact,
disappear on us a few months back.

560
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:31,169
And when that reality settled in,
I just, I wanted to hide.

561
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:35,795
I wanted to hide from the world,

562
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:39,545
and I wanted to hide
from my thoughts even.

563
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:45,586
It was really hard to see
what was right in front of me.

564
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:54,169
But then I was reminded
that even in the darkest of times,

565
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:56,044
we have to keep our eyes open.

566
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:02,712
My son and I are here today
to ask for your help,

567
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:09,336
not for us, but for people like Bobby,

568
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:16,169
people who are out there feeling forgotten
and feeling unseen.

569
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:23,044
There are over 5,000 homeless souls
in this city alone,

570
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:27,044
and from what I hear
it's gonna be a bear of a winter.

571
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,712
So it is Phillip's wish, and my mission,

572
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,003
to reach each and every one of them

573
00:51:36,086 --> 00:51:38,712
with a simple, comforting gesture,

574
00:51:41,169 --> 00:51:42,169
a blanket.

575
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:46,169
Now we are not naive,

576
00:51:47,378 --> 00:51:51,086
we know that the problems
these people face are immense,

577
00:51:52,837 --> 00:51:56,920
but we also know
that a simple act of kindness

578
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:58,461
can be a start.

579
00:51:59,378 --> 00:52:03,837
So please, if you are able to donate,
it would mean the world to us,

580
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,920
and hopefully we can help restore
the faith of those who are lost.

581
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:26,670
That's it?

582
00:52:26,753 --> 00:52:28,003
Two weeks?

583
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,336
This is the best
they could do in two weeks?

584
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,753
It's almost the holidays

585
00:52:31,837 --> 00:52:33,854
and people are probably stretched
really thin right now.

586
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:36,128
I know
a lot of charities are asking for help.

587
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:39,044
Don't make excuses for them,
honey, really.

588
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:42,712
- Maybe we'll get more next week.
- Yes, maybe we will.

589
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:46,044
Wait, maybe there's some money in here.

590
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,211
Spare change?

591
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:21,587
Cyndi, hi there.

592
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,837
Hi, three adults and one child, please.

593
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:29,128
Who are your friends?

594
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:33,044
This is my friend Delia, and this is Paul.

595
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,228
I thought it would be good for folks

596
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,336
to meet some of the people
we're trying to help.

597
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,044
She's a clever one, ain't she?

598
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:41,962
I think it's a swell idea.

599
00:53:43,044 --> 00:53:44,378
Okay, ready?

600
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:52,628
The old ladies from the church
make the best meatballs.

601
00:53:52,712 --> 00:53:55,503
- Yeah? What are we talking, five stars?
- Six.

602
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:57,545
Be wise, little man.

603
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:02,628
Thank you.

604
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,879
Oh, yes. Mighty kind.

605
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:18,086
Southern. My girl, my daughter,
she go to Southern.

606
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,420
Oh, really?

607
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:21,628
Yeah, economics.

608
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:23,712
Civil engineering class of '82.

609
00:54:26,086 --> 00:54:29,253
That was one beautiful campus.

610
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,336
Well?

611
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,462
- 5 1/2.
- What?

612
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:45,086
Excuse me, so this boy here thinks
that these meatballs are six out of five.

613
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,712
I told him I wasn't going over 5 1/2.
What do you think?

614
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:55,962
That kid might be right.

615
00:54:56,587 --> 00:54:57,962
I might even say seven.

616
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,837
Well, thanks, thanks a lot.

617
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,336
I'm never gonna hear the end
of this one, huh?

618
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,253
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

619
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:14,503
- Hey, Marilynn.
- Hey there.

620
00:55:14,587 --> 00:55:15,420
Afternoon.

621
00:55:15,503 --> 00:55:18,712
Hey, question, you still got
some garlic bread left, right?

622
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,128
They bought extra
when they heard you were coming.

623
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:22,420
Jackpot.

624
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:24,253
How are things at the paper?

625
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:27,378
Busy, but I am not complaining.

626
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:30,420
What's going on over there?

627
00:55:31,045 --> 00:55:33,837
Seems Cyndi means business
with the blankets.

628
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,628
Yeah? I hadn't heard anything.

629
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,628
Try not missing service.

630
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:39,587
Funny.

631
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:43,712
What's their story?

632
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,462
Incredibly, incredibly rewarding,
I must say.

633
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,879
- It's an inspirational story.
- Thank you.

634
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:54,337
Thank you.

635
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,837
So what has been the biggest challenge
to everything you've been doing?

636
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,879
Making people see
what they usually try hard not to see.

637
00:56:02,795 --> 00:56:04,920
Wow, is that right?

638
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:06,587
Eh, nailed it.

639
00:56:07,587 --> 00:56:09,503
I mean, starting with myself,

640
00:56:09,587 --> 00:56:11,837
sometimes you can get so caught up
in your own problems

641
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,170
that you forget
that there are people out there

642
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:15,545
who have it a lot worse.

643
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:19,837
And if we can collect 5,000 blankets
in time for Christmas,

644
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,629
then it'll be worth it.

645
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:25,545
Yeah, so what has doing this meant to you?

646
00:56:28,003 --> 00:56:34,837
When my dad left,
I was mad, scared, sad. I still am.

647
00:56:36,003 --> 00:56:39,045
But me and my mom doing this
is helping him

648
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:44,587
by helping other people,
and I think he'd like that.

649
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:47,962
I think he would too.

650
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:50,429
Does the kid read Shakespeare
in his off time?

651
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,045
I think that he would like that too.

652
00:58:49,128 --> 00:58:53,170
You know, if half my employees
had half your hustle, Cyndi...

653
00:58:54,378 --> 00:58:56,979
Well, then you'd have nothing
to complain about at staff meetings.

654
00:58:58,253 --> 00:59:00,504
- Still doing that blanket thing?
- I sure am.

655
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,837
That's real nice,
volunteering and all that,

656
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:05,837
it's a good hobby to have.

657
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:08,879
I'm glad you approve of my hobby.

658
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,796
You know, as you're already
my best employee,

659
00:59:12,879 --> 00:59:16,003
I bet if you took some of that time
and you applied it here,

660
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,170
you could be assistant manager in a snap.

661
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:23,378
It's all about priorities, right?

662
00:59:24,545 --> 00:59:25,545
What's most important?

663
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:29,170
But maybe it's not my place to say.

664
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:33,253
I just wanna see you get
to where you deserve to be.

665
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:37,253
- Thanks, Jim.
- Keep it up.

666
00:59:56,003 --> 00:59:59,337
Hey, look, you're a celebrity.

667
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,462
Whoa, that'll help.

668
01:00:01,545 --> 01:00:03,128
Yeah, it can't hurt.

669
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:04,962
Okay, let's get out there,

670
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:07,545
and let's get these blankets
to where they belong.

671
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:13,462
- How about these people right here?
- Okay, that's a good idea.

672
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:21,253
Hi there, would you guys like a blanket?

673
01:00:22,629 --> 01:00:24,128
We're just giving it out.

674
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:28,045
What about those people down there?

675
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:30,462
Yeah.

676
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:39,212
Hi there, we're from Phillip's Wish

677
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,754
and we're here just giving out blankets.

678
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:45,462
No.

679
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:46,545
'No.'

680
01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:52,379
- No?
- No, I don't want your blanket.

681
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:55,879
Oh, it's free, and it's clean,
and here, please...

682
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:58,337
I said I don't want one,
I don't want your blanket,

683
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,796
I don't want anything from you.

684
01:00:59,879 --> 01:01:00,879
We're sorry.

685
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:02,479
It's okay, I'm sorry,
we were just here to help.

686
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:04,587
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm sorry.

687
01:01:07,504 --> 01:01:09,087
Who do you think you are?

688
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,253
Housing and Neighborhood Services,
this is Trey, how may I help you?

689
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,921
Hi, my name is Cyndi Saunders,

690
01:01:15,003 --> 01:01:16,978
you're the department
in charge of the homeless shelters

691
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:18,379
in town, right?

692
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:21,087
Yes, ma'am,
we oversee all city-owned facilities.

693
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,837
Great, my son and I have
been out collecting blankets

694
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:27,921
and we were going
to hand them out one by one,

695
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:31,003
but for several reasons,
that seems less than ideal.

696
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,295
So I was just calling
to see if there was a way

697
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:37,879
we could just donate them directly
to the city's shelters.

698
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:40,962
Just gather them all up at once
and donate them.

699
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:44,045
Yes, ma'am, that shouldn't be a problem,
you have some scarves?

700
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:46,754
- Blankets.
- If you have some blankets to donate,

701
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,854
you should be able to drop them off
at any city shelter.

702
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:53,003
Oh, great, is there anything else
that we need to do?

703
01:01:53,629 --> 01:01:54,896
There shouldn't be any paperwork

704
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,587
for a blanket donation, ma'am,
you should be fine.

705
01:01:57,671 --> 01:02:00,587
Okay. Excellent, thank you so much
for your help, Trey.

706
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:03,253
- Happy to assist, have a good day.
- You too.

707
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:30,796
Dude, how'd you get a D
on dividing fractions?

708
01:03:30,879 --> 01:03:33,045
My little sister can do this stuff.

709
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:34,546
Forgot you were a genius.

710
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:36,754
I never had worse than a C on anything.

711
01:03:37,295 --> 01:03:39,936
You'll have to let me know
how fifth grade is a second time around.

712
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:51,379
What are you looking at?

713
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,587
What do you want?

714
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:15,295
It's a trick my dad taught me.

715
01:04:15,963 --> 01:04:18,504
- A trick for what?
- Dividing fractions.

716
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:22,921
See, bread times bread,
burger times cheese.

717
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:25,003
Hope it helps.

718
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:49,254
Excuse me.

719
01:04:49,337 --> 01:04:51,687
If you're looking for a bed,
I'm sorry, but we're all full today.

720
01:04:51,712 --> 01:04:54,963
Oh, no, nothing like that thankfully.
We're here with some good news.

721
01:04:55,045 --> 01:04:56,712
We've been collecting blankets.

722
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:57,921
Thousands of them.

723
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:03,212
I know this is gonna sound insane,
but there's not much I can do with that.

724
01:05:03,295 --> 01:05:05,295
A box or two maybe, but thousands?

725
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,546
Come on, they're free blankets.

726
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:09,395
A man from Housing
and Neighborhood Services said

727
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,295
it wouldn't be a problem distributing them
at any city shelter.

728
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:15,712
Ma'am, we wanna help these people too,
but we just...

729
01:05:15,796 --> 01:05:17,003
What are you saying?

730
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:22,212
There's not enough space
to store truckloads of blankets here,

731
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:24,354
and there's not enough of us
to do what we have to do

732
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,838
on a daily basis,
let alone distribute something like that.

733
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:28,587
- Well, that's stupid.
- It is.

734
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:31,379
And honestly,
we are up to our necks in red tape,

735
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:33,379
trying to get the items
we desperately need.

736
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,129
Oh, I'm sorry,
I know that it's not your fault,

737
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,170
but it's just incredibly frustrating.

738
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:43,421
Your heart is in the right place,
not enough people find time to care.

739
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:45,879
We should have enough blankets here

740
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:49,587
for the beds we have available,
which admittedly isn't many,

741
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:53,546
but if you find yourselves
with some hygiene products,

742
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:55,504
razors, deodorant...

743
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:58,170
Okay, we'll see what we can do.

744
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:01,504
Thank you for your time.

745
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:03,003
You're welcome.

746
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:05,295
Come on, buddy, let's go.

747
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:11,587
- They're wrong.
- Well, she sounded pretty confident.

748
01:06:12,003 --> 01:06:13,604
She said
that they would rather have razors

749
01:06:13,629 --> 01:06:15,170
than our useless blankets.

750
01:06:18,129 --> 01:06:19,337
Where's your sandwich?

751
01:06:21,421 --> 01:06:22,421
I had Whataburger.

752
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:25,546
Wait, you had Whataburger
and I'm eating cold cuts?

753
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:27,796
Hey, I had cold cuts too,
and I made them.

754
01:06:27,879 --> 01:06:30,713
I don't think they're that bad, are they?

755
01:06:30,796 --> 01:06:32,379
They're good, thank you.

756
01:06:35,879 --> 01:06:38,462
Should we change it?
Are blankets a bad idea?

757
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:40,421
No, slow your roll, kid.

758
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:43,379
You spend enough nights
out on these pavements,

759
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:47,045
you realize a blanket is more
than just a blanket.

760
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,504
And winters, they are no joke.

761
01:06:52,295 --> 01:06:53,546
Even in Texas.

762
01:06:55,462 --> 01:06:56,546
What is that?

763
01:06:58,129 --> 01:07:00,170
Hmm, that, my friend,

764
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:03,045
is the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment
right there.

765
01:07:04,546 --> 01:07:07,170
- It's cool.
- Looks really nice right there.

766
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:09,295
Thank you, pretty proud of it.

767
01:07:09,379 --> 01:07:11,254
- You stitched that?
- I did.

768
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,295
Can you sew one on mine?

769
01:07:13,379 --> 01:07:15,963
Of course, but I ain't cheap.

770
01:07:19,587 --> 01:07:22,421
Okay, wait, did I count that pile?

771
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,129
I did, I counted that, yes.

772
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:25,938
You keep that up,
they're gonna find us smothered

773
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:28,504
under a pile of wool and polyester.

774
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:31,087
- Have you seen my keys?
- I haven't, but you know what,

775
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,891
maybe we should have
just gone with mittens.

776
01:07:32,963 --> 01:07:34,296
Haha, very funny,

777
01:07:34,379 --> 01:07:37,004
but what's not funny is me being late
for my book club.

778
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:42,296
I love you, I love Phillip,
I love this mission,

779
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:45,671
but I just please, heavenly father,
help my daughter

780
01:07:45,754 --> 01:07:48,838
on her journey
to find somewhere else to store

781
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:51,045
- all the blankets.
- I got it, I got it. Got it.

782
01:08:02,337 --> 01:08:03,754
You got anything bigger?

783
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:05,921
What you storing?

784
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:07,921
A dream.

785
01:08:13,004 --> 01:08:15,087
This just in at the KLX news desk.

786
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,421
It appears North Texas is in
for a rough Christmas.

787
01:08:18,504 --> 01:08:21,504
The National Weather Service
has issued a severe weather advisory

788
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:24,504
beginning this Saturday,
through December 28th.

789
01:08:24,588 --> 01:08:26,963
Freezing rain and sleet
will give way to ice

790
01:08:27,045 --> 01:08:28,379
as we approach Christmas.

791
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:31,254
Wind chills are expected
to reach the single digits...

792
01:08:39,337 --> 01:08:41,254
You've reached Bobby Saunders,
leave a message

793
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:43,129
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

794
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:47,296
Hello.

795
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:23,171
It's all my fault.

796
01:10:23,254 --> 01:10:25,129
It was an accident, sweetheart.

797
01:10:26,838 --> 01:10:27,838
It's okay, Mom.

798
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:32,129
Can you take him home?

799
01:10:32,212 --> 01:10:34,171
I think I just need a little time.

800
01:10:34,254 --> 01:10:36,254
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

801
01:10:36,337 --> 01:10:38,337
Come on, come on, love.

802
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:28,838
I'm sorry,
but we're full up tonight, my friend.

803
01:11:29,629 --> 01:11:31,463
Best you try over by 4th Street.

804
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,171
Hello?

805
01:12:07,254 --> 01:12:10,212
Oh, yes, oh, yes, Mr. Cummings, hi.

806
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:14,546
I'm not so sure, actually.

807
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:18,171
Yeah, I don't think
she'll be in again today.

808
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:19,546
No, I...

809
01:12:19,629 --> 01:12:21,546
Oh, of course, I know, I'll let you know.

810
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:23,046
All right, bye now, bye.

811
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:36,129
Sweetheart, Cyndi,

812
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:41,171
you're gonna have to eat something soon
or I'm gonna start taking it personally.

813
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:49,755
Remember when you told me you hated me?

814
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:59,254
I don't have a lot of regrets,
but I'll never forget that day.

815
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:02,171
Tears streaming down your little face...

816
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:09,046
You had picked out
this pretty pastel dress

817
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:10,504
for Easter service.

818
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:14,171
Oh, you loved that dress
to the moon and back,

819
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:17,338
and I took it to the dry cleaners

820
01:13:17,421 --> 01:13:21,296
on the Monday before Easter.

821
01:13:23,588 --> 01:13:27,921
Your dad left on the Wednesday,

822
01:13:30,504 --> 01:13:35,922
and suddenly my whole world
just came crashing down around me.

823
01:13:36,796 --> 01:13:38,671
I don't think I showered for a week.

824
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,212
So on Easter morning,

825
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,338
when you came to me for your dress,

826
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,504
I just hadn't thought about it.

827
01:13:55,087 --> 01:13:56,671
I hadn't thought about anything.

828
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,338
And you said what you said,
and, oh, I lashed out...

829
01:14:07,338 --> 01:14:10,713
Quite the way
to celebrate the Resurrection.

830
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:27,588
I regret not picking up that dress.

831
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:25,171
And now the very latest
on this dangerous winter storm

832
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,713
that's bearing down
on North Texas next week.

833
01:15:28,796 --> 01:15:31,630
Authorities are encouraging
all residents to brace

834
01:15:31,713 --> 01:15:35,171
for what appears to be temperatures
approaching zero degrees

835
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:37,379
and erratic precipitation.

836
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:39,379
At this time, our experts are predicting

837
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:42,671
the lowest temperatures
will unfortunately hit our area

838
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,922
the night of Christmas Eve.

839
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:47,171
Stay warm and stay safe, Texas.

840
01:15:47,963 --> 01:15:51,338
Thank you. Road crews are dealing
with a lot of ice...

841
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:00,880
Mom, we can't give up.

842
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:03,838
They're all gone, sweetheart.

843
01:16:03,922 --> 01:16:06,213
- So we start again.
- It's not that easy.

844
01:16:06,296 --> 01:16:11,129
Sure it is, those people out there
like Delia, like Dad,

845
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:15,797
he's still out there, they all are,
we can't let them down.

846
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:21,254
It's getting real cold. They need us.

847
01:16:22,463 --> 01:16:25,838
We may not be able to help all of them,
but if we can help even a few...

848
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:32,338
That's one.

849
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,630
You all know it's been
a really hard year for me

850
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:48,755
and my family.

851
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:54,129
And it feels like sometimes stuff happens
and you just don't know how to keep going.

852
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:58,588
Me and my mom wanted
to take a sad thing that happened to us

853
01:16:58,671 --> 01:17:00,505
and make some good out of it,

854
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,004
and a lot of people helped.

855
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:08,922
There was an accident,
so now we have to start all over.

856
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:14,463
But that's okay,
like my grandma always says,

857
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:16,463
we have to put our trust in God.

858
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:19,755
So with this storm coming in a few days,

859
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,797
we're working extra hard
to do whatever we can to help.

860
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:27,046
For Christmas this year,
I have a real short list.

861
01:17:28,088 --> 01:17:29,713
I want my dad to be okay,

862
01:17:31,254 --> 01:17:34,004
and I wanna get a blanket
to as many people as I can.

863
01:17:35,797 --> 01:17:38,755
So if any of you
or your families can help in any way,

864
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:41,296
we'd really appreciate it.

865
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:44,797
And we have to believe
we can make a change,

866
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:47,171
no matter how small.

867
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:52,505
If we stop believing in that,
we stop living.

868
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:06,880
- It's a lot of blankets.
- Not bad, right?

869
01:18:07,713 --> 01:18:09,171
I'm glad I caught you.

870
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:12,088
- My sister dropped these off this morning.
- Perfect timing.

871
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:18,505
How are you gonna get all these out?

872
01:18:18,588 --> 01:18:20,755
Well, Phillip and I,
we gotta get them distributed

873
01:18:20,838 --> 01:18:24,129
on Christmas Eve,
and we need all the help we can get.

874
01:18:24,922 --> 01:18:26,588
Many hands make light work.

875
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:36,630
And the concern right now,

876
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,588
what looks to be
an incredibly frigid night ahead.

877
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:42,672
The entire state
under that winter storm warning.

878
01:18:43,505 --> 01:18:47,713
We also have portions of West Texas
that were under a blizzard warning,

879
01:18:47,797 --> 01:18:51,421
and right now we're looking at an evening
that could get even colder.

880
01:18:52,129 --> 01:18:54,922
In the meantime,
brace for the cold, Texas,

881
01:18:55,004 --> 01:18:58,296
it's going to be a bitter December
and one for the record books.

882
01:19:13,463 --> 01:19:17,255
- You guys sure we got a big enough truck?
- It was the biggest they had.

883
01:19:17,338 --> 01:19:19,630
And you're sure
you wanna do all this tonight

884
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,004
on Christmas Eve?

885
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:24,421
The storm won't wait for a better plan.
Thanks for coming.

886
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:25,964
Happy to help you out.

887
01:19:26,046 --> 01:19:28,171
Besides, Bobby would kick my rear end

888
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,838
if he knew I let you do all this
on your own, so...

889
01:19:31,797 --> 01:19:33,255
Here you go, buddy.

890
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:34,755
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

891
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:36,255
Pastor, you made it.

892
01:19:37,046 --> 01:19:39,588
There's something you should see.

893
01:19:41,755 --> 01:19:43,421
What do you mean?

894
01:19:43,505 --> 01:19:44,588
Come take a look.

895
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:46,838
Okay.

896
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,046
- Where?
- Just up ahead.

897
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:56,964
What is going on?

898
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:07,296
Hey, we heard you could use a hand.

899
01:20:08,213 --> 01:20:09,421
Merry Christmas.

900
01:20:24,922 --> 01:20:28,046
Hey, I don't wanna ever see
any of these blankets ever again,

901
01:20:28,129 --> 01:20:31,338
so let's get out there, let's help
get these people warm, all right?

902
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:32,839
Okay!

903
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,588
Merry Christmas. This is for you.

904
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,171
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

905
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:35,755
Hey, are you all right?

906
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:43,505
Hey, hey.

907
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:50,255
Easy, easy, that's my good leg.

908
01:22:53,338 --> 01:22:54,338
You all right?

909
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:58,964
Oh, you are in bad shape.

910
01:22:59,964 --> 01:23:02,797
Aw, now here, here.

911
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:07,213
That's a little something for you,
all right?

912
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:27,505
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

913
01:23:28,338 --> 01:23:31,255
Go home and get warm,
it's gonna get worse.

914
01:23:31,922 --> 01:23:34,146
I have a few more blankets to deliver
then I'll see you at home.

915
01:23:34,171 --> 01:23:36,130
- Straight there and straight back.
- Okay.

916
01:23:38,588 --> 01:23:39,964
- You ready?
- Yeah.

917
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:22,422
Hey there,
we've got some blankets for y'all.

918
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:24,463
Thanks, honey.

919
01:24:27,255 --> 01:24:29,255
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

920
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:32,088
Merry Christmas.

921
01:24:32,672 --> 01:24:35,171
Merry Christmas. Here's a blanket for you.

922
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,171
Thanks for waiting. Here.

923
01:24:38,422 --> 01:24:39,422
You ready?

924
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,505
Merry Christmas, Paul.

925
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,297
Merry Christmas, little man.

926
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:18,130
Hey, hey, little man, wait!

927
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:23,672
Wait, wait, wait, stop!

928
01:25:25,922 --> 01:25:27,255
This your missing man?

929
01:25:44,714 --> 01:25:45,714
Here.

930
01:25:46,964 --> 01:25:47,964
Here.

931
01:25:51,297 --> 01:25:52,922
He was here.

932
01:25:53,005 --> 01:25:55,297
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

933
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,589
Bobby!

934
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,630
Bobby!

935
01:25:59,714 --> 01:26:00,714
Dad!

936
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:07,755
Do you hear that?

937
01:26:15,463 --> 01:26:16,463
Dad!

938
01:26:19,046 --> 01:26:21,672
- Bobby.
- Dad, please wake up.

939
01:26:21,755 --> 01:26:24,505
- Dad, please wake up.
- Bobby. Bobby!

940
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:26,380
Answer me, Bobby, can you hear me?

941
01:26:27,839 --> 01:26:31,213
Dad, Dad, wake up, please.

942
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:34,881
- Hi, yes, I found my husband.
- Wake up.

943
01:26:34,964 --> 01:26:39,422
I think he's hurt. I'm on the corner
of Hartford and East 3rd.

944
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:40,881
- Hurry, please.
- Dad!

945
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:52,213
So what do you think?

946
01:27:55,005 --> 01:27:57,005
You're offering me a job, kid?

947
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:58,630
I guess so.

948
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:00,554
We've been getting
a ton of secondhand blankets

949
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,797
that need repairs
before we can distribute them,

950
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:06,589
and I was thinking
with that fancy stitch work of yours...

951
01:28:08,547 --> 01:28:10,464
I don't think you can afford me.

952
01:28:10,547 --> 01:28:11,881
How much you charging?

953
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:20,630
- You should think about it.
- I'll definitely think about it.

954
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:22,630
Do you want a ride?

955
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,172
No, now you know me.

956
01:28:35,505 --> 01:28:36,505
Delia!

957
01:29:44,339 --> 01:29:45,505
The real Cyndi!

958
01:29:47,339 --> 01:29:49,464
This is so cool.

959
01:29:49,547 --> 01:29:52,964
Oh, my God, this is so cool.

960
01:29:53,589 --> 01:29:55,964
Oh, wow, it's so nice to meet you.

961
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:57,714
- You're so beautiful.
- You're gorgeous.

962
01:29:59,339 --> 01:30:01,005
You're so pretty.

963
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,547
Look at you.

964
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:05,505
- We're so thankful for your story...
- No, I am.

965
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:08,714
And we are just so happy to be telling it.

966
01:30:08,797 --> 01:30:11,547
And it's just such a beautiful thing
that you guys did

967
01:30:11,631 --> 01:30:13,505
and a courageous thing that you did.

968
01:30:13,589 --> 01:30:16,714
And I am so, so honored to be playing you.

969
01:30:17,964 --> 01:30:22,339
Aw, look at that, here we go,
Cyndi Bunch and Anna Camp.

970
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:25,047
- For reals.
- Real deal.
