00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,223
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,700
- [Narrator] The following
film is based on an

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,222
actual event that occurred
on July 23rd, 1983.

4
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:25,212
Some names have been changed,
composite characters used,

5
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:29,083
and certain scenes were
created for dramatic purposes.

6
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:37,695
(dramatic orchestral music)

7
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,647
- That's the storm front
they warned us about.

8
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,500
Might as well use everything
this beaut can give.

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,550
Ask if we can take her up to 40,000 feet.

10
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,826
- Nothing like being
able to get above it all.

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,301
Winnipeg Center, this is
Canada World 163 heavy.

12
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:03,860
(static hissing)

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,260
Yeah, we see it about 20 miles out.

14
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,240
If we can slip up to 40,000 feet,

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,018
we should be able to ride above it all.

16
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:12,430
(static hissing)

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,460
Thanks, Winnipeg.

18
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,293
Moving up.

19
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,810
(instrument panel beeping)

20
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,643
- That's weird.

21
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,476
How's the fuel?

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,160
- Indicator inop.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,990
Computer says we're loaded.

24
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,500
- Must be the pump.

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,550
Cross-feed the left pump to both engines.

26
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:35,665
(suspenseful orchestral music)

27
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,630
(instrument panel beeping)

28
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,180
- Just what the doctor ordered.

29
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:48,760
(instrument panel beeping)

30
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,810
- Sure the fuel's up?

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,603
- [Copilot] According to
the readout, we're full?

32
00:02:55,863 --> 00:03:00,134
(instrument panel beeping)

33
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,860
(airplane rumbling)

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,210
- Left engine's flamed out.

35
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,880
Winnipeg, this is 163,

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,433
We're having a problem.

37
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,840
(rumbling)

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,540
Right engine's gone too.

39
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,936
Winnipeg, this is 163.

40
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:15,917
We ha--

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,310
- We have a general failure.

42
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,143
Got a dead stick here.

43
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:22,320
Give me range, fuel, talk to me.

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,153
- Glide.

45
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,279
Can you glide her?

46
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,250
- Stick's dead.

47
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,120
Help me out.

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,953
No hydraulics.

49
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:33,205
(grunting)

50
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,384
We're going into free fall.

51
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,163
Free fall.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,957
- Going in!

53
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:43,827
We're going in!

54
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:49,784
(suspenseful orchestral music rising)

55
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:55,761
(alarm buzzing)

56
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,210
- [Computer] Simulation complete.

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,463
Please exit the simulator now.

58
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,620
- Is that some kind of joke?

59
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,080
There's no way you'd land that aircraft

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
the way you guys have got a programmed.

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,480
- Dumb scenario if you ask me.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,830
Impossible set of conditions.

63
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,760
Who ever dreamed that up?

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,813
- It isn't a dream.

65
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,523
It happened.

66
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,664
(dramatic orchestral music)

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,230
- Just look at that.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,490
Some beauty.

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,410
- Yeah, it's brand new.

70
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,070
Just out of the box.

71
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,170
- Who's in the saddle?

72
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,783
- Captain Pearson, Bob Pearson.

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,280
- [Beth] Coffee's ready.

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,983
- As usual you're way ahead of me.

75
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:08,970
- I'm just keeping ahead of a
day that's going to be busy.

76
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,730
- Listen, if you want me to
drive myself to the airport,

77
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,240
I can leave the car in the overnight.

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
- No, there's no need.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,550
I can pick up the
cleaning on the way back.

80
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,820
Besides, it'll help me pass the time.

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,653
- What time?

82
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,620
It's a quick turnaround.

83
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,453
- Oh, I know.

84
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:23,460
It's just that...

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,910
- What's the matter?

86
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,743
- Hmm?

87
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,450
- It's not like you to be worried.

88
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,890
- I'm not worried.

89
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm gonna miss you, that's all.

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,433
Would you drink your coffee?

91
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,953
The sooner you get started,
the sooner you get back.

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,740
- It still doesn't figure.

93
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,530
I know by this record we got
about 11,000 pounds of fuel.

94
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,670
- Pounds or liters?

95
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,285
- Pounds.

96
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,780
No no, no, hold on.

97
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,930
Maybe that's kilograms.

98
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,653
- How much more?

99
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:57,700
I got several thousand gallons left.

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,726
- Gallons?

101
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,195
Don't give any gallons, okay?

102
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,100
You've got the pride of the fleet.

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,303
The first 67 in service
and we are now metric.

104
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:08,319
Speak to me in kilos.

105
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,290
- Sorry, boss.

106
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,580
I don't really know that stuff yet.

107
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,860
I got my work cut out trying

108
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,289
to convert gallons into pounds.

109
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,291
- Yeah, like we don't?

110
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,273
You just standby, okay?

111
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,670
If they at least convert
the entire fleet, you know,

112
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,320
instead of just these new planes.

113
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,850
- Well, I really think
you've got everything done.

114
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,683
- Not quite.

115
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,560
Meg and I are gonna go shopping.

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,130
I want to pick up some fresh flowers

117
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,910
and I've gotta get new
sheets for the guestroom.

118
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,743
- New sheets?

119
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,360
Do you think you're overdoing it?

120
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,913
- I want 'em to feel welcome.

121
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:37,690
They'll notice a little extra care

122
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,020
after they've been
white-knuckling it for five hours.

123
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,050
- White knuckling it?

124
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,914
With me in the cockpit?

125
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:43,027
- You, they'll trust.

126
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,270
It's the plane that
will keep them worried.

127
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,913
- Listen, why don't you drive?

128
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,193
- Bob,

129
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,253
will you keep your wits about you?

130
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,393
- I always do.

131
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,730
- How many kilos in a pound?

132
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,143
- Uh, 2.2, or so it says here.

133
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,853
- Okay.

134
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,558
How many quarts in a kilogram?

135
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:17,391
- I don't know.

136
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,420
I told you, check the on-board gauge.

137
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,253
- It's got inop.

138
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,086
- Well then how does a pilot know

139
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,370
how much fuel's been loaded?

140
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,470
- Computers, state-of-the-art computers.

141
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,120
- I hate computers.

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,550
Gotta be a technical person to run 'em.

143
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,300
- Yeah, well then we both
better check into a seminary.

144
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,907
Come on, let's try the cockpit.

145
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:36,740
- Okay.

146
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,550
(dog barking)

147
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,038
- Listen, Jim, my wife's
not doing so well right now.

148
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,290
(baby crying)

149
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,090
Isn't there some other guy you can--

150
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,633
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

151
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,967
Okay, I'll be there.

152
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,634
(phone beeping)

153
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,220
- You're going off again, aren't you?

154
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,363
- I'm really sorry.

155
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,040
The number two on the
Montreal Edmonton flight

156
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,515
broke his leg, skiing.

157
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:11,450
They need me to take his
place in the second seat.

158
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,793
- But you just got back.

159
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,443
- I know,

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,710
but it's the new 767

161
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,723
and I begged to be one of
the first checked out on it

162
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,520
and now I'm the only one available

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,428
who's cleared to fly it.

164
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:25,750
(dramatic orchestral music)

165
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,350
- Veronica will be here to help.

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,467
I'll be back before you know it.

167
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,300
All right?

168
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,133
Hey.

169
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,214
- Are you picking 'em up at home?

170
00:08:58,214 --> 00:08:59,770
- No, it's a quick turnaround.

171
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,570
They're gonna meet me at
the airport in Edmonton.

172
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,120
You'll meet us on the way back?

173
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,670
- I'll pick you up at the gate.

174
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,729
- Is everything okay?

175
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:07,605
- Yeah, it's fine.

176
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,353
You just worry about
having a safe flight, okay?

177
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:10,186
- Okay.

178
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,799
- [Announcer] The white zone
is for immediate loading

179
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,132
and unloading of passengers.

180
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,330
- Try the switch anyway.

181
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,663
- Great, nothing.

182
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,820
Gotta rely on a computer.

183
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,090
What's it say?

184
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,060
- Whatever we tell it.

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,760
It won't read the fuel load.

186
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,833
We tell it the volume
and it does the figuring.

187
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,483
- Then it's not smarter than you.

188
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,130
Better refigure the volume again.

189
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,297
(sighing)

190
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,134
- You'll be okay, won't you, sweetie?

191
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:50,967
- She'll be just fine.

192
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,791
We'll both miss you, but she'll be fine.

193
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,624
- Are you sure?

194
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:55,163
- You know the maternity
leave would end sooner,

195
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,319
besides really if you
wanted to stop flying--

196
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:00,399
- It's just too good a job
you lose the seniority.

197
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,232
Yes, yes.

198
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,553
Now you take good care of your daddy.

199
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,433
- Bye, sweetie.

200
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,266
- Bye.

201
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,846
- You take care of her.

202
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:10,679
- [Husband] Bye bye.

203
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,520
- Shh.

204
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,353
Bye.

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,623
- Hey, Lynn.

206
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:19,456
What do you got?

207
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:20,630
- 174 to Edmonton.

208
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,270
- Hey, we're together.

209
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,890
Junior employees first.

210
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,723
- Thank you.

211
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,901
- Gotta stop being mad at me, Gloria.

212
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:34,210
You'd hate it.

213
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,460
Hell, I hate it and
it's my family reunion.

214
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,902
- I don't have to do anything.

215
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,860
All I wanna do is go with you,

216
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,343
as if we belong together.

217
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:44,350
Maybe I could even make it fun for you.

218
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,459
- I doubt it.

219
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,990
All they'd start doing is prying.

220
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,960
- What have we...

221
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,010
You, what have you got to hide?

222
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,843
- Nothing.

223
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,210
- You just don't want
me to meet your family.

224
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,150
- Gloria, you know that's not true.

225
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,131
I have a problem with my fam--

226
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,020
- I wish I did, Phil!

227
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,063
Tell me, do your parents
even know I exist?

228
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:04,648
(dramatic orchestral music)

229
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,154
- [Announcer] This is
the final boarding call.

230
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,654
- I can handle it.

231
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,419
- 38.

232
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,870
Hey, didn't you play minor league hockey?

233
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,703
I thought the trade called you up

234
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,391
to play the big team.

235
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,876
What happened?

236
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,163
- I got cut.

237
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,300
- [Norma] Tickets?

238
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,640
- Did you turn the thermostat down?

239
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,550
- Yeah.

240
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,090
Did you get us flight insurance?

241
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,923
- What for?

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,530
- Hey, Dave.

243
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,317
- Mr. Pearson, taking 174 out.

244
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,920
- Yeah, did you just bring her in?

245
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,930
- I did indeed.

246
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,053
Fuel gauges are dicey.

247
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,693
- No kidding.

248
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,883
She's brand new.

249
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,590
What's the manual say?

250
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,423
- Nothing.

251
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,350
But like you say, the 67's
just come into service.

252
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,863
Not much pilot input yet.

253
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,500
- Anything on the minimum equipment list?

254
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,870
- The NEL says to check the load manually.

255
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,500
After that, it's safe to fly

256
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,650
using the on-board computers.

257
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,130
You're handy with those
things, aren't you?

258
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,963
- Well, I'm getting there,

259
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:20,470
but I'd rather have the
gauge that went into a tank.

260
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,910
Can it be fixed?

261
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,070
- Don't know.

262
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,760
You'll Ricky Dion in the cabin with you.

263
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,660
I betcha he can get it right.

264
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,514
- Ricky, well, there you go.

265
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,933
- [Maurice] Dave.

266
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,486
- Maurice, you taking
Bruce's second chair?

267
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,319
- Yep.

268
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,036
- Well, after you get fueled up,

269
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,563
let's make sure the plane is.

270
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,873
- Hey, Mo.

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,090
- Check the reminder file.

272
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,420
Both Haber and Dunbar
have birthdays this month.

273
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,660
Send some trinket from Tiffany,

274
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,200
forge my signature, and remember,

275
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,740
I leave for Hong Kong on the 8th,

276
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,120
so, Alicia, if there are any
details that I have overlooked,

277
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,543
please do not hesitate to contact me.

278
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:06,876
It's very important have
this itinerary completely--

279
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,929
- 11, four, 30.

280
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,520
- [Man] Okay, 1.0 means--

281
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,360
- We gotta multiply by 178.

282
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,550
- Love that high tech operation.

283
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,291
What do you know about metrics?

284
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,124
- Nothing.

285
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,950
I'm still trying to think
how much a quart is.

286
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,109
- Easy.

287
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:30,783
6% smaller than a liter.

288
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:33,651
Ah, jeez.

289
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,379
- Alicia, I will be out of
town for my anniversary.

290
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,670
Have Jorge send some flowers to the house,

291
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,960
roses preferably.

292
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,298
Keep it under $60.

293
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:46,656
Make a reservation at Betina
for the night after my return.

294
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:49,070
- [Announcer] The departure
of Canada World Airways,

295
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,009
flight 174, will be slightly delayed.

296
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:52,949
- [Group] Ah.

297
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:53,782
- [Man] No.

298
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:54,670
- [Announcer] Please stay at the gate,

299
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,673
as we expect to board momentarily.

300
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,822
- Ol' CWA.

301
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:04,130
If there's a way to ruin
my plans, they'll find it.

302
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,613
- At least the weather looks good.

303
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,413
- Yeah, at least for now.

304
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,170
- You know, there was a
time when the decision

305
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,090
to take off was mine and mine alone.

306
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,239
But the new manual for these big birds

307
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,100
says that you have to check me out first.

308
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
So, what's the deal?

309
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
- Well, the way I read the figures,

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,980
we gave you 20,345.

311
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,628
Enough to get you all
the way to Vancouver,

312
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,793
nevermind Edmonton.

313
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:31,597
- What about this inop?

314
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:34,890
- Well, we'd have to rely
on the computer readout.

315
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,190
- What if the computer fails?

316
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,310
- Second one cuts in.

317
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,824
If that goes down,

318
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,309
then there's a third one for good measure.

319
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,014
(chuckling)

320
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,850
- If two of them go down,

321
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,900
I don't think I'll be relying on a third.

322
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,723
I understand Rick Dion's on board.

323
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,250
He must know this machine.

324
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,790
- Forecast looked from here.

325
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,090
Should be a smooth flight.

326
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,000
- It's okay, honey.

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,540
I only looked worried.

328
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,260
Besides, what can go wrong

329
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,690
when the airline's top
mechanic is sitting in the seat

330
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,761
right next to us?

331
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,594
- Hey.

332
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,427
- [Pearl] Huh, Chris?

333
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,315
- [Larry] Rick.

334
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:09,403
- Hey, Larry.

335
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,000
Good to see ya.

336
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,371
- [Larry] Good to have you aboard.

337
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,750
- Let's hope so.

338
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,483
- She hates to fly,

339
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,730
especially after a check delay.

340
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,563
What's the problem?

341
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,360
- Don't know, but Bob Pearson's
in the number one seat.

342
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,130
If he's satisfied, so am I.

343
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,000
Once we're up, you should
go ask him yourself.

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,833
- Oh, he will.

345
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,793
Can't keep him away from the
business end of an aircraft.

346
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,800
Okay, honey, got your seatbelt on?

347
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,497
- Just getting it on.

348
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,746
- "Got your seatbelt on?"

349
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:38,470
(laughing)

350
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,830
- Yes, I do.

351
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,137
- You're smiling, Pearl.

352
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:41,970
Look out.

353
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,803
- [Pearl] It's an aberration.

354
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:43,636
(laughing)

355
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:44,850
- You're in C and D, down to your right.

356
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,249
Have a pleasant flight.

357
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,082
Good morning, sir.

358
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:47,999
How are you today?

359
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,192
You are in 23C, down to your right.

360
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,182
Hi, how are you?

361
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:53,015
- [Woman] Good.

362
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,442
- C, down to your left, please.

363
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,280
23D, down to your left.

364
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,290
Hi, how are you today?

365
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,064
30F, down to your left.

366
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:01,840
Hi, how are you today, sir?

367
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,450
31D, down to your left.

368
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,283
Hello, sir.

369
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:05,249
You're in 3C.

370
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,730
There's only two of you
in first-class today.

371
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,677
- Thank you.

372
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:08,976
Should be a grand flight.

373
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:09,923
- I'm sure it will be, sir.

374
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,547
- [Bob] What are you saying?

375
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:17,480
- I don't know.

376
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,775
Fuel readouts were handled
by the second officer.

377
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,550
I guess it's your call.

378
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,300
- Well, Davis and Coley had
no trouble bringing her in.

379
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:27,570
(door opening)

380
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,500
- We're all charged up and ready to go.

381
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,346
- [Both] Boo.

382
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,502
(laughing)

383
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:33,352
- You're welcome.

384
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,870
- I'd feel better if we
still had a second officer.

385
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,810
Good to have someone to work the manuals.

386
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,643
- The whole point of these birds

387
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,050
is to cut back on the crew,

388
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,250
save the airlines money.

389
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:54,297
We're not saving 'em any money
being parking attendants.

390
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,250
(chuckling)

391
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,590
Clear the deck, lads.

392
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,140
Let's get this bird in the sky.

393
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
- Thought he'd never make up his mind.

394
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,380
- Fussy bunch, pilots.

395
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,330
Good flight, guys.

396
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,530
- [Bob] Thank you.

397
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,230
- Tell Bernie that I will buy a full page

398
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,150
in his tribute book for
muscular atrophy or dystrophy

399
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,983
or whatever.

400
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,960
Then call George and tell
him to get in Bernie's face

401
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,420
about upping his orders with us.

402
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,253
(intercom dinging)

403
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,086
- [Larry] We've been cleared for takeoff.

404
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,670
Will all passengers kindly
fasten their seatbelts?

405
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,239
(intercom dinging)

406
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:34,906
(dramatic orchestral music)

407
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:46,471
(instrument panels beeping)

408
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,081
(engines revving)

409
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,560
- Rather a sharp ascent.

410
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,020
- It's a feature of these 767s.

411
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,260
Sharpest ascent there is.

412
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,750
- Sharpest of any commercial airliner.

413
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,730
I was on a leer jet last month.

414
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,741
We went nearly vertical on takeoff.

415
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,580
(laughing)

416
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,103
I'm a pilot myself.

417
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,120
Perhaps the captain would give
me a view of the flight deck

418
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,260
once we're up.

419
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,653
- I'm sure he'd be glad to.

420
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,748
(light orchestral music)

421
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,581
(intercom dinging)

422
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,730
- [Larry] The pilot has now turned off

423
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,080
the fasten seatbelt sign.

424
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
Please feel free to move about the cabin.

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,940
However, while seated, please
keep your seatbelt fastened.

426
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,863
Thank you.

427
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:54,696
(intercom dinging)

428
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:55,732
- I think that's enough
peanuts for now, honey.

429
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:56,565
Okay?

430
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:57,550
How 'bout a book?

431
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,774
What would you like me to read?

432
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,496
- Can I have another apple juice?

433
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:02,870
- How 'bout Babar, huh?

434
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,810
You wanna go forward?

435
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,480
- You don't mind?

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,650
- I'm amazed you managed
to stay put this long.

437
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,960
Just remember to come back.

438
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,749
Your son likes your company.

439
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,999
(laughing)

440
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:20,513
Um, any 10s?

441
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,501
- [Bob] Great day for it, huh, Maurice.

442
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,334
- [Maurice] Mmm, yeah.

443
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,841
- You okay?

444
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:39,540
You okay?

445
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,373
- Yeah.

446
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,343
(knocking on door)

447
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:44,184
- Mind a visitor.

448
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,250
- Rick.

449
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,600
Get your dead butt in here.

450
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,283
- Simple enough for ya?

451
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,116
(chuckling)

452
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,903
- If it was any easier,
they wouldn't need a pilot.

453
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:54,736
(laughing)

454
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,373
- [Rick] That would make my job easier.

455
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,298
- Hey, speaking of your job, what is that?

456
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,323
- You got an MEL?

457
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:03,533
- Yeah.

458
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:07,100
- It should be okay.

459
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,810
Just have to rely on your computer.

460
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,860
It'll fly her for ya.

461
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,820
There's more information there

462
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,360
than you know what to do with anyway.

463
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,545
- You got that right.

464
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:15,800
(laughing)

465
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,150
- So, how's your hockey, Bob?

466
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,540
Or have you given that up yet?

467
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,201
You know, you should at your age.

468
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:21,050
- Hey.

469
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,191
(instrument panel beeping)

470
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:26,774
(ominous orchestral music)

471
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:45,652
(instrument panel beeping)

472
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,842
- That's not right.

473
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:51,342
You have a manual?

474
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,368
(light orchestral music)

475
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:47,675
(ominous orchestral music)

476
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:52,270
(instrument panel beeping)

477
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,290
- Lads, it can't be this complicated.

478
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,422
- It isn't.

479
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:00,255
- You got something?

480
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,570
- Yeah, could be.

481
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,390
According to the book,
the pump is probably fine

482
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,840
and there is a safety backup.

483
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,910
Either pump, left or right,
can feed to both engines.

484
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,380
- Let's crossfeed the
left side to both engines.

485
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,213
- Check.

486
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:22,700
(instrument panel dinging)

487
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,290
- What would you guys do without me?

488
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,420
- I knew the answer all along.

489
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,909
I just wanted to see if you
guys would figure it out.

490
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:29,430
(laughing)

491
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,080
- Too exciting for my bladder.

492
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,173
I'll be right back.

493
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,232
(door opening)

494
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:39,596
(door closing)

495
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:42,013
- What's the matter with him?

496
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,883
- His wife is very sick.

497
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,435
- Oh.

498
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,377
- They have two young kids at home.

499
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,960
You know how it is.

500
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,973
I don't really think he wanted
to go out on this flight.

501
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,576
Frankly, if I were him, I'd
apply for some sick-leave.

502
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,270
- We don't have enough guys
checked out on these things

503
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,220
as it is.

504
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,417
You know how important
they are to the company.

505
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,540
- And to me.

506
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,721
I need this job.

507
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,193
I gotta buy me some new skates.

508
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:13,933
- A new set of legs is what you need.

509
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,183
(laughing)

510
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:21,202
(keys dropping)

511
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,024
- Oh, damn it.

512
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:26,338
I wanted to give him this.

513
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,557
(sighing)

514
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,210
Way to go, Beth, huh?

515
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,433
Send away for something,
'cause you know it's gonna

516
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:32,660
make him happy and then you...

517
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,756
(tongue clicking)

518
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:35,913
(dramatic orchestral music)

519
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,770
Well, next trip, I guess.

520
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:42,829
Boy, will be glad when this day is over.

521
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:50,971
- Hi.

522
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,837
- Hi.

523
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:53,550
Got a weekend pilot in 3C,

524
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,550
says he'd like to visit the cockpit.

525
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,960
You think Pearson would mind?

526
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,253
- You better wait till
Rick gets back to his seat.

527
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:01,713
- Got that beer for me?

528
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,240
The guy in 30F is knocking 'em back

529
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,718
faster than I can supply 'em.

530
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:08,050
- [Lynn] We're all out of
the brand he's been drinking.

531
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,980
He finished 'em off.

532
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,793
- At this point, he won't notice.

533
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,330
- How's mister macho in 31D?

534
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,490
- On his third Vodka and
tonic and in a deep sulk.

535
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,563
- Oh, how sad.

536
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,983
- I'll take this one.

537
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,573
Give you a chance to sit.

538
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
- So, are these planes so good

539
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,969
it only takes one guy to fly 'em.

540
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:35,890
(chuckling)

541
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,463
- Bob is more than enough.

542
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,403
These things fly by themselves.

543
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,393
Feel like I could've stayed home.

544
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,230
- How is Marie?

545
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,380
- Pretty much the same.

546
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,193
Not good.

547
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,653
- Sorry, Maurice.

548
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:57,573
- It's okay.

549
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,113
Or it'll be what it'll be.

550
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,470
How's things in the cabin?

551
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,438
Busy?

552
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,271
(laughing)

553
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,104
- It's less than half-full.

554
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:09,870
But I prefer it when it's
so busy that you can't stop.

555
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,640
Time goes by faster.

556
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
- Well, you wouldn't get to
enjoy the flight then, hmm?

557
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,643
- That's fine by me.

558
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,513
I hate flying.

559
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,850
- Anything I can get you here, sir?

560
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,547
- [Bob] Vodka tonic.

561
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:25,553
- I know, sir.

562
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:33,814
Everything okay here?

563
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:34,790
Can I get you anything?

564
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,763
- No, thank you.

565
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:38,596
We're fine.

566
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:39,429
- All right.

567
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,520
- You okay?

568
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,738
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:44,571
You?

570
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,890
- [Lynn] How's our littlest passenger?

571
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,290
- I think he needs a change.

572
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,423
Okay if I use an empty row?

573
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,870
- I don't see why not.

574
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,755
When it's this empty it
shouldn't be a problem.

575
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:08,132
Do you mind if I help you?

576
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,230
I have a little baby at home.

577
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,735
This is my first time away from her.

578
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:12,568
Hi, sweetie.

579
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:13,401
- Thanks.

580
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:14,234
That'll be great.

581
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,067
- [Lynn] Is this your diaper bag.

582
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:15,900
- Yes, thank you.

583
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:20,026
Oh, you're gonna feel
better, yes, you are.

584
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:21,109
Yes, you are.

585
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,890
- [Larry] Found your young explorer.

586
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,370
- Is my husband still in the cockpit

587
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,557
or did he leave me?

588
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,390
(laughing)

589
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,624
- I can't imagine he'd ever do that.

590
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:39,164
- You don't know him and airplanes.

591
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,210
If you can, would you remind
him that he promised Chris

592
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,117
a trip up front.

593
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:43,950
- Done.

594
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,470
- Thank you.

595
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,719
So, where were you, huh?

596
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,750
(laughing)

597
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,748
- And as you know, CC the usual suspects.

598
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:53,520
Send it registered,
return receipt requested.

599
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,844
- Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

600
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,873
- Any word on that trip up front?

601
00:26:57,873 --> 00:26:59,010
- We're working on it.

602
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,450
There's an airline official
in there at the moment,

603
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,150
but as soon as he's out, I'll ask.

604
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,120
- And Alicia, remind
those airheads in travel

605
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,430
never to book me on a plane

606
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,863
that doesn't have in-flight phones.

607
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,870
- Lynn needs you to cover the back.

608
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,630
I think Hulk wants another Vodka.

609
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,463
- Again?

610
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:21,513
How many can he manage?

611
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,119
Hope he's not driving when we land.

612
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,300
- Maurice, when you go back,

613
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,540
tell Rick his wife misses him,

614
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,656
the guy in 3C, he still wants a tour,

615
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:31,713
and I'd like a massage.

616
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,450
- [Bob] So, what are
you flying these days?

617
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,280
- Well, I tried a P51
at the Farnham Air Show.

618
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,830
It was fun, but Pearl
and I are talking about

619
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,850
moving to the west coast,
so if that happens,

620
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,783
I'll be looking for a seaplane.

621
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:52,137
- Oh, the ol' pontoons,
laddie, the ol' pontoons.

622
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,220
- [Rick] Hey.

623
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,007
(instrument panel beeping)

624
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,230
- What the hell is that?

625
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,330
- Second pump failure?

626
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,236
(ominous orchestral music)

627
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:02,069
- Can't be.

628
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,256
- You better go off auto.

629
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:08,345
(intercom dinging)

630
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:11,220
- First officer, Quintal,
to the front, please.

631
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,503
- [Rick] I'll hit the books.

632
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:20,048
(door opening)

633
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,253
(door closing)

634
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,650
- Apparent fuel pump failure.

635
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,707
Get the drill.

636
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,703
- Fuel gauge.

637
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,610
- Non-operational.

638
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,060
- Release the pump.

639
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,330
- Check, no help.

640
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,750
- [Maurice] Re-engage crossfeed.

641
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,583
(instrument panel beeping)

642
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,050
- Check, no help.

643
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,400
- [Maurice] Scroll digital.

644
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:01,780
(computer beeping)

645
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,133
- Scroll reads ample fuel and range.

646
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:11,419
(alarm buzzing)

647
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:12,469
(rumbling)

648
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,302
- Ooh.

649
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:14,135
- Oh, God.

650
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:14,968
What was that?

651
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,070
- Oh, probably just hit
a little air pocket.

652
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,910
Nothing to worry about.

653
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,948
Bye, sweetheart.

654
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:20,081
See you later.

655
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:22,377
I'll just take these.

656
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,057
- Let's go sit down.

657
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,933
- What was that?

658
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,303
- I'm sure it was nothing.

659
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:32,964
Pearl, I don't know what that was,

660
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:35,270
but I am sure that
everything is all right.

661
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,691
- Well, would you please
ask Rick to come back here

662
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:38,880
as soon as he can.

663
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,043
- Yes, I'd be glad to.

664
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:40,876
- Thank you.

665
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,287
(suspenseful orchestral music)

666
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:49,530
(knocking on door)

667
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,960
- The weekender wonders whether visit--

668
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,038
- Not now, Larry.

669
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,863
- Okay.

670
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,989
Then Rick, your wife wonders
whether you're still on board.

671
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:57,760
- Yeah, I guess I better
see how she's doing.

672
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,291
- Hey, maybe you can in here
until Maurice figures a load,

673
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:03,520
just in case we need a little
help with our calculations.

674
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,650
- Yeah, you got it.

675
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,251
Tell her I'll be along soon, thanks.

676
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,110
- Okay.

677
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,730
- Larry, take it easy, right?

678
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,197
We wouldn't want to worry anyone.

679
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,503
- Of course not, Captain.

680
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,540
- [Bob] How's it look?

681
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:18,855
- Impossible.

682
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,640
- Whatever it is, it has to be possible.

683
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,440
Otherwise, it wouldn't be happening.

684
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,580
What's your best guess?

685
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,750
(pencil scribbling)

686
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,413
- Try changing the altitude.

687
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:52,990
(instrument panel beeping)

688
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,320
That should prove it.

689
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,390
- Both lights are off.

690
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,720
- Exactly.

691
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,260
It's like the idiot light
on a car's gas tank.

692
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,120
You go downhill, the fuel goes
forward, puts the light off.

693
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,093
You go uphill, the light
turns back on again.

694
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,793
It's not a pump problem.

695
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,350
- Then what is it?

696
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,426
Get the ops manual.

697
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:18,343
(suspenseful orchestral music)

698
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,990
Maurice,

699
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,827
obviously it's not a pump problem, is it?

700
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,750
- No.

701
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,385
- Well, if it isn't a
pump, then it's the fuel.

702
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,218
- Yeah.

703
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:46,933
- And more specifically, the lack of it.

704
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,503
And both the lights are still out.

705
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,405
Here, you check it.

706
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:55,843
These are the ground crew figures.

707
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,430
- [Meg] Bob in the air?

708
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,590
- Yeah, he took the
flight out to Edmonton,

709
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,880
picking up his folks.

710
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,252
- Ah, that's why the big marketing

711
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:07,842
and the big shopping and all.

712
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,574
- I thought I'd show
off my cooking a little.

713
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:11,990
- Good for you.

714
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,480
- I can't remember the last
time we ate in the dining room.

715
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,710
- I guess he's been pretty busy, huh?

716
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,690
- What, this time of year?

717
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,310
Pass like ships in the night.

718
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,490
Goes with the territory, I guess, huh?

719
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,880
- [Meg] Yeah.

720
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,293
- Been married for 25 years.

721
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,073
What we lack in adventure, we
make up for in consistency.

722
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,170
- You okay, kiddo?

723
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:37,586
- Yeah, I suppose.

724
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:39,834
(laughing)

725
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:40,846
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

726
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:42,060
- I'd love a cup of coffee.

727
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,140
- Your house or mine?

728
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,973
- Yours.

729
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:45,189
- Okay.

730
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:49,106
(suspenseful orchestral music)

731
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,260
- Someone screwed up
the metric conversion.

732
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,750
I just can't tell where or by how much,

733
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,510
but one thing's for sure,

734
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,283
there's not enough fuel in
either tank to make Edmonton.

735
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,234
(sighing)

736
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:16,143
- Maurice, chart us a new course, lad.

737
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,290
- Our best bet's probably Winnipeg.

738
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,570
Get there on a couple
hundred gallons or liters

739
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,293
or whatever we got in there.

740
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:33,659
- Winnipeg, is it, huh?

741
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,780
Look at that weather.

742
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,250
- Yeah, they said they're
expecting low clouds,

743
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,680
but you should be able to ride it out

744
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,230
without burning too much fuel.

745
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,440
These things are designed
to fly, not crash.

746
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,665
- True enough.

747
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:53,500
Just need enough fuel to
keep our forward motion.

748
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,853
- Now, that you should have.

749
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,230
(radio clicking)

750
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,393
- Winnipeg Center, this
is Canada World 174.

751
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,640
- See if you can get 'em to
get in touch with my wife,

752
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,473
will you?

753
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:12,183
I want her to know where I
am, in case she needs me.

754
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,203
- Winnipeg Center, Canada World 174.

755
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,620
- Canada World 174, Winnipeg, go ahead.

756
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,550
Loud and clear, 174.

757
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,100
I have you radar identified
140 miles northeast

758
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,430
of Winnipeg.

759
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,860
You're cleared to the Winnipeg
airport for an approach.

760
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,495
Plan runway zero four left, over.

761
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:43,328
(suspenseful orchestral music)

762
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,919
- Two additional things.

763
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,958
Get a crew list and notify the families

764
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,764
of a delay due to diversion.

765
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:53,003
Put Maurice Quintal on
the top of the list.

766
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,683
Right, we'll stay on the air.

767
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,980
(knocking on door)

768
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,420
- Is the problem getting worse?

769
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,820
- Yeah, minor technical difficulty.

770
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,030
We're diverting to Winnipeg.

771
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,750
Better let 'em know, Larry.

772
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,583
- Right away.

773
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,816
(sighing)

774
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,207
- He's gonna be all right.

775
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,707
(instrument panel beeping)

776
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:29,910
Oh, my God.

777
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,123
We're running on fumes.

778
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,507
Winnipeg Center, this is 174.

779
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:41,670
We've got a bigger
problem than we thought.

780
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:54,538
(suspenseful orchestral music)

781
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,632
- Roger, 174.

782
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:04,215
(instrument panel beeping)

783
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:17,830
- [Pearl] Okay, go down.

784
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,663
- [Chris] Right there?

785
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,496
- [Pearl] Then across.

786
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:20,461
Back up.

787
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:23,630
All the way to 23.

788
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,463
Keep going.

789
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:25,446
There, there, there.

790
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:26,279
- [Chris] Right there?

791
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,889
- [Pearl] Yeah, come on.

792
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,836
- [Chris] There.

793
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:29,834
- There, see?

794
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,190
And it's just like the same one we're on.

795
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,430
- Yeah, it is.

796
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,580
- So, how 'bout a book?

797
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:35,365
Oh?

798
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:38,352
- Pictures.

799
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,258
- Be my guest.

800
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:41,091
Pick a color, any color.

801
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:44,664
- Okay, I think I'm
gonna go with this color.

802
00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:45,497
- Fine by me.

803
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:46,330
(intercom dinging)

804
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,940
- [Larry] Folks, we're
truly sorry about this,

805
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,520
but the technical problem
that delayed us continues

806
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,659
to hamper the pilots.

807
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:54,006
They've decided to divert to Winnipeg.

808
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,240
We should land there in a few minutes

809
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,326
where arrangements will be
made to get us to Edmonton.

810
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:01,599
Passengers with connecting flights

811
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,893
should inform the cabin staff.

812
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:09,640
CWA regrets any inconvenience
this unexpected diversion

813
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,473
may cause.

814
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,431
(intercom dinging)

815
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,587
- Come on, I know you
can do better than that.

816
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,650
- Even if the load
estimate is off by half,

817
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,510
you should be able to make it

818
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,090
with a couple of gallons to spare.

819
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,083
You can drive us to the hotel, Bob.

820
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,650
(chuckling)

821
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,200
- Depends on what it takes
to buck this turbulence.

822
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,273
Heavy headwinds.

823
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,053
- Here's how I figure it.

824
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:33,886
Double check me.

825
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
- [Man Over Radio] Canada 174, Winnipeg.

826
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:43,307
- Go ahead, Winnipeg Center, this is 174.

827
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,280
- Roger, 174, you're
within landing range now.

828
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,093
I'll be handing you off
to your approach control

829
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:52,471
and we'll be listening
and hanging in with you.

830
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:55,129
The emergency procedures will be in place.

831
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,633
Contact approach control now on 119.7.

832
00:37:58,473 --> 00:38:00,540
- Good afternoon, Canada World 174,

833
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,120
this is Winnipeg approach.

834
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,220
Got you at about 22,000
feet and 130 miles.

835
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,498
- [Maurice] 22,000 feet.

836
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,240
- [Bob] Thanks, approach.

837
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,220
- [Maurice] 130 miles.

838
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,100
- We're working on our glide path now.

839
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,170
- Ground speed, 335.

840
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,143
Glide path.

841
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,850
Got it?

842
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,530
- Okay, listen, okay?

843
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,000
Loaded, 20,345 units, all right,

844
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,460
but it was pounds, not kilos.

845
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,731
- Are you serious?

846
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:28,564
(suspenseful orchestral music)

847
00:38:28,564 --> 00:38:29,397
- Yeah.

848
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,793
- That's 2.2 pounds per kilo.

849
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,596
You're telling me we're
less than half-loaded?

850
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:41,429
- Yeah.

851
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:44,733
- Let me see this.

852
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,280
- Have Larry report to the
flight deck immediately.

853
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,214
(alarm ringing)

854
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,676
- Make sure the Red Cross is alerted

855
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:56,965
and have a mobile blood
bank get out there with us.

856
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:57,798
Let's go!

857
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,864
- Larry, get your crew together.

858
00:39:03,864 --> 00:39:07,340
Run over the emergency landing procedures.

859
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,820
Don't freak out the passengers.

860
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,830
Do it behind the curtains.

861
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,730
Keep it cool.

862
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,831
(sirens wailing)

863
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:54,770
(intercom dinging)

864
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,170
- [Larry] Would the cabin crew

865
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,870
please report to the forward galley?

866
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,703
(intercom dinging)

867
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,303
- Here's to accurate dental records.

868
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,450
- [Bob] Hey, what the hell's going on?

869
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,283
- Routine, sir.

870
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:05,970
Just routine for us to
meet on long flights,

871
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,010
check the liquor inventory.

872
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,050
- Don't give me that bull.

873
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm a paying customer.

874
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,990
I pay your damn wages.

875
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,100
Now, what's going on?

876
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,669
- If you must swear, could
you keep your voice down?

877
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:14,830
- Hey, hey, hey.

878
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,291
- I knew I shouldn't have bothered

879
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,932
with my stupid family reunion.

880
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:20,765
I knew it.

881
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:23,539
Thank God I didn't bring Gloria along.

882
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:24,976
- At least you're on vacation.

883
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:27,590
I gotta go back to work on Monday.

884
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,914
- What do you do?

885
00:40:28,914 --> 00:40:32,009
- Coach at the local high school.

886
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:35,313
- Well, I guess I pay
your wages then, don't I?

887
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:37,646
(chuckling)

888
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,837
(baby crying)

889
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,690
(dramatic orchestral music)

890
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,523
- We'll be fine.

891
00:40:58,152 --> 00:40:58,985
- Or not.

892
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,346
Either way.

893
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,993
At least there's no kids.

894
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,010
- Well, it's like we've always said,

895
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,860
kids and marriage aren't for everyone.

896
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,600
- No.

897
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,823
Certainly not us.

898
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,270
Wouldn't want to repeat
our parents' mistakes.

899
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,853
- So, how's school?

900
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,553
- It's fine.

901
00:41:36,553 --> 00:41:37,386
Keeps me occupied.

902
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:40,300
Bob's away, kids are grown.

903
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,841
- Tell me.

904
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,748
I've been thinking about
taking classes myself.

905
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:45,621
- [Beth] Yeah?

906
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:46,454
- [Meg] Yeah.

907
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:49,050
Leslie goes off to college in the fall.

908
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,220
Can you believe it?

909
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,053
- You're kidding.

910
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:51,886
- No.

911
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,890
How are you and Bob doing?

912
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,340
- Oh, we're the same as ever.

913
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,940
Things fall into patterns.

914
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,133
You ever notice that?

915
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,221
- Yep.

916
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,130
(laughing)

917
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,390
Lots of years create lots of habits.

918
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,014
- Do you find that you start
taking things for granted?

919
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:13,950
- Like what?

920
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,410
- I don't know, the small stuff.

921
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,210
Little things that are left unsaid

922
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,123
because you think you've
got a lot of time later.

923
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,750
- But there always is,

924
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,690
time later, I mean.

925
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,079
There just is.

926
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,720
(dramatic orchestral music)

927
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,553
- Yeah, I guess.

928
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:37,735
(suspenseful orchestral music)

929
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,650
(pencil scribbling)

930
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,800
- Well, how am I doing?

931
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,683
- Not good news, but not a disaster.

932
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:50,600
(radio clicking)

933
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,150
- Winnipeg Center, this is 174.

934
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,510
We think we have a plan for a glide path.

935
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,713
That is if nothing else goes wrong.

936
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,760
- You'll be fine.

937
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,710
We're clearing zero four left for you

938
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,333
and we'll have a welcoming
party when you're on the ground.

939
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,380
- [Bob] Good idea, both.

940
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,368
- Supervisor,

941
00:43:09,368 --> 00:43:12,274
we're assigning 174 to zero four left.

942
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:14,320
Are the emergency procedures in place?

943
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,823
- [Supervisor] That's affirmative.

944
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:21,485
(siren wailing)

945
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:30,059
- Form into first rank.

946
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,193
Give a path to the medics.

947
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,393
And make sure all the ambulances
are loaded with burn units.

948
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:37,940
Double check it, hurry, hurry!

949
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:43,762
(suspenseful orchestral music)

950
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,790
- Well?

951
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,593
- Fair, only fair.

952
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,750
This front gets any thicker,

953
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,586
it's gonna slow us, significantly.

954
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:59,450
(chuckling)

955
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,000
- If that's our only problem,
we're in great shape.

956
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,893
- Bob only lies when it
comes to hockey, right Bob?

957
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:08,643
I'm gonna go see Pearl and Chris.

958
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,670
- Good idea, leave this to the pros,

959
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,840
but if you feel anything go wrong,

960
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,950
you know where we are.

961
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,693
- Yeah, same here if you need me.

962
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,240
- There's some kids back there.

963
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,990
Make sure the parents know
to put their masks on first.

964
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,260
- Are you the airline
official from the cockpit?

965
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,011
Because if there's room
now, I thought I'd pop in.

966
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:40,870
- We're in a landing mode.

967
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,830
Right now's probably not a good time.

968
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,163
- I've never seen a computerized cockpit.

969
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,330
- Well, landing's all done by numbers.

970
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,313
Maybe when we take off for Edmonton.

971
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,010
- Just bring the Vancouver
people to Edmonton.

972
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,290
Save me half a day.

973
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,620
These idiot delays are
costing us a fortune.

974
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,653
And I don't want to hear
about Bill's junior son.

975
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,263
- We're okay.

976
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,200
There's nothing to worry about,

977
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,190
except we have to go to Winnipeg.

978
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,100
Other than that, we're fine.

979
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,973
- Swear it?

980
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,203
- I swear it.

981
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:28,100
It looked a bit tight there for a minute,

982
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,930
but we'll be fine for Winnipeg.

983
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,130
And Bob Pearson's the
right guy for the job.

984
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:37,908
(light orchestral music)

985
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:41,908
We're fine, Pearl, and
I'll be here all the way.

986
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,567
Just trust that we'll be okay.

987
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,720
- Daddy, is mommy okay?

988
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,990
- Yeah, mommy's fine.

989
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,937
We all are.

990
00:45:56,502 --> 00:45:57,390
- It's okay, hon.

991
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm just being a goose.

992
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,718
So, where were we?

993
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:01,551
- [Chris] Right here.

994
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,634
- [Pearl] Okay.

995
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,300
Socrates stepped inside the flower shop.

996
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,570
- It's vital that people
near the emergency exits

997
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,368
are strong enough to operate them.

998
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,450
(curtain rattling)

999
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,283
I'm sorry, sir.

1000
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:13,670
The Captain has put on the seatbelt sign.

1001
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,503
- Not to worry.

1002
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:16,290
Just using the lavatory.

1003
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,670
I'm an ex-RAF pilot.

1004
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,295
If the Lufthansa couldn't get me,

1005
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:21,133
I'm sure CWA won't.

1006
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:24,330
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1007
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,163
- Runway's clear.

1008
00:46:25,163 --> 00:46:26,573
All emergency vehicles in place.

1009
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,583
- Come on, guy.

1010
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,403
Almost home.

1011
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:35,977
You can make this.

1012
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,313
- Cutting it fine.

1013
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,907
An error in those numbers from Montreal--

1014
00:46:45,156 --> 00:46:46,450
(instrument panel beeping)

1015
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,283
(rumbling)

1016
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:48,966
(all yelling)

1017
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:51,026
(alarm buzzing)

1018
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:51,859
Left engine out.

1019
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:54,323
Left engine gone.

1020
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:55,197
- I'll be back.

1021
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:57,856
Whatever happens, I'll be back.

1022
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,689
- Daddy!

1023
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,637
- Honey, honey, just stay put, okay?

1024
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:02,627
Here, let's go back to the book.

1025
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:03,460
What page were we on?

1026
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,377
Can you remember?

1027
00:47:04,377 --> 00:47:05,210
- This one.

1028
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,780
- What the hell happened?

1029
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,781
- Left engine's gone.

1030
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:11,631
We adjusted the right
thruster to accommodate it.

1031
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,078
(alarm beeping)

1032
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:14,107
(rumbling)

1033
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,357
(grunting)

1034
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,176
- There goes the other one.

1035
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:22,759
(instrument panel beeping)

1036
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,960
(power pulsing)

1037
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
- [Bob] We've got a general failure.

1038
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,233
- It's gone.

1039
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:32,983
I lost it.

1040
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:34,930
It just dropped off.

1041
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,763
174.

1042
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,233
174, this is Winnipeg, do you read?

1043
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,143
It's gone.

1044
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:50,353
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1045
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,933
174, we lost your transponder, return.

1046
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:57,423
174, 174, come in.

1047
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:02,210
Might just be their electrics.

1048
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,223
Going to primary.

1049
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:06,883
(radar beeping)

1050
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,373
Still nothing, Captain.

1051
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,876
Should be an untagged
blip in this quadrant,

1052
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,376
but I got nothing.

1053
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,663
- We need some help here, lads.

1054
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,993
Some hydraulics.

1055
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,650
It's like the power steering in my car

1056
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,050
when the engine goes dead.

1057
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,694
- There's no,

1058
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:48,320
there's no redundancy systems
when the fuel's gone, none.

1059
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,820
Only the emergency ram air
turbine for hydraulics.

1060
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,270
- No hydraulics, no power, no transponder.

1061
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,714
We must've dropped off
the screen in Winnipeg.

1062
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:57,390
- Where the hell's the ram air turbine.

1063
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,260
- It says here the RAT
kicks in automatically

1064
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,143
when it reads two dead engines.

1065
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:02,923
- What the hell's it waiting for?

1066
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,050
- I gather you're a veteran
at this kind of thing.

1067
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,450
- Me?

1068
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,300
Oh, goodness, no.

1069
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,869
Well, um, my husband is
the airline's top mechanic.

1070
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,426
He thinks everything is fine,

1071
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:26,000
as long as there's lights in the cockpit.

1072
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,180
- And there must be power there.

1073
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,174
(laughing)

1074
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:34,128
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1075
00:49:34,128 --> 00:49:35,525
(knocking on door)

1076
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,600
- Some of the passengers have
noticed there are no lights.

1077
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,237
- That's fuel starvation.

1078
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:43,153
The electrics conked out
when the engines went out.

1079
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:45,240
- Oh, God.

1080
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,073
Are we going down?

1081
00:49:46,073 --> 00:49:48,440
- Like hell we're going down.

1082
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,457
This baby'll glide as long
as I can keep the nose up.

1083
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:51,640
- That's the truth, Larry.

1084
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,320
Nobody here is planning on dying.

1085
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,560
- Alert the passengers.

1086
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,960
Use the megaphone.

1087
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,300
- And what do I tell them?

1088
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,720
- Keep them busy with an emergency drill.

1089
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,993
- Larry, tell Pearl I'll
be there no matter what.

1090
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:07,580
- Don't know how long I
can keep this up, lads.

1091
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,410
Gonna need a glide path.

1092
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,220
- Well, without power I can't do that.

1093
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,313
I need altitude and ground speed.

1094
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,560
- Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see,

1095
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,840
we have a further technical problem,

1096
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,311
complicating our final
descent into Winnipeg.

1097
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:26,474
- [Woman] Oh, God.

1098
00:50:26,474 --> 00:50:28,363
- The Captain is confidently
we'll land safely,

1099
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:31,420
but regulations require
we now follow prescribed

1100
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,758
safety drills.

1101
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:35,633
Everyone must remove their shoes,

1102
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,720
eyeglasses, jewelry,
particularly earrings,

1103
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,293
anything sharp from your pockets.

1104
00:50:47,703 --> 00:50:51,420
Make sure your seatbelt
is tightly fastened,

1105
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,043
as low down on your hips as is possible.

1106
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,170
This is all just a precaution.

1107
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,490
We thank you for your cooperation.

1108
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,346
- [Man] Okay, quick, get those off.

1109
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:02,617
You better take off all the others.

1110
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:03,694
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1111
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:04,527
(plane hissing)

1112
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:05,360
- What was that?

1113
00:51:07,713 --> 00:51:09,900
- Must be the RAT hole, popping open.

1114
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,733
- I hope so.

1115
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:12,800
(radar beeping)

1116
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,360
- 174, this is Winnipeg, do you read?

1117
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,713
- Give me a hand with this harness.

1118
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:27,416
(propeller humming)

1119
00:51:28,356 --> 00:51:30,722
(radar beeping)

1120
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:33,639
(group chattering)

1121
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,594
- When instructed, cross your arms

1122
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:42,140
and hold the top of the
seat-back in front of you.

1123
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,362
Then rest your head in your arms.

1124
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,013
Practice this now.

1125
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:48,184
(baby crying)

1126
00:51:48,184 --> 00:51:50,097
Children can put a pillow in their lap

1127
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:52,980
or anything that would provide
a cushion would be fine.

1128
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,208
- Here.

1129
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,840
Now, you make sure you hang onto that.

1130
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,470
Everything will be okay.

1131
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,340
- What's wrong, mommy?

1132
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,173
- Nothing.

1133
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:01,663
I'm sorry, Chris.

1134
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,496
It's all right.

1135
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:05,200
This often happens on planes
and daddy always makes sure

1136
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,021
that everything is fine.

1137
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:07,854
Okay?

1138
00:52:09,615 --> 00:52:13,532
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1139
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:19,618
(radar beeping)

1140
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,740
- I got something.

1141
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,140
174, I think I've got you.

1142
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,973
Do you read me?

1143
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:33,948
(radar beeping)
(static hissing)

1144
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:38,090
(seat thudding)

1145
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:38,923
- What's wrong with this?

1146
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,810
Why can't you people do anything right?

1147
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:43,098
This damn seat's collapsing.

1148
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,070
- It's designed to do that, sir.

1149
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,110
It cushions you if you just rest on it

1150
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,880
and don't try to mash it.

1151
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,166
- What's it matter?

1152
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:53,999
We're all gonna die anyway.

1153
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:54,832
- Would you please be quiet?

1154
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:56,600
I have a little daughter
waiting for me at home

1155
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,773
and I have no intention of dying.

1156
00:52:58,773 --> 00:52:59,606
- Bull.

1157
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:00,439
This plane's going--

1158
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:03,405
- Sir, shut your stupid mouth!

1159
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:07,322
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1160
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,120
- I'm getting a little
help with these hydraulics.

1161
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,037
RAT must've kicked in.

1162
00:53:16,037 --> 00:53:17,067
(panels powering on)

1163
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,240
- Got some juice.

1164
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,870
Giving some power to the electronics then.

1165
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,424
- Thank you, God,

1166
00:53:22,424 --> 00:53:26,023
and Boeing for this ram air turbine.

1167
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:29,811
(radar beeping)

1168
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,400
- Gotcha, 174, you're back on.

1169
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,350
Do you read?

1170
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,660
- Roger, Winnipeg.

1171
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,316
174 is back.

1172
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,753
This is a mayday.

1173
00:53:40,753 --> 00:53:43,260
I repeat, this is a mayday.

1174
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,420
We need a vector to the
nearest possible runway.

1175
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,670
I'm at 22,000 feet and
both engines have failed.

1176
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,480
We're on emergency instruments

1177
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,360
and I only have a limited
amount of information

1178
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,670
to give you.

1179
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,903
Our heading is 230.

1180
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,350
So, if you'd please give
us a vector to the nearest

1181
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,760
possible runway.

1182
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,777
- [Al] Standby, 174.

1183
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:07,212
- No power.

1184
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:08,617
You think you can bring in
a 300,000 pound aircraft

1185
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:10,410
with a dead-stick landing?

1186
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,780
- Never heard of it.

1187
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,613
- Try and talk 'em in.

1188
00:54:12,613 --> 00:54:14,750
Around to the factory over at Everett.

1189
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,583
This can't be the first time

1190
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,680
this kind of thing has happened.

1191
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,470
Now, the crew family's know the crew's

1192
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,770
been diverted to Winnipeg?

1193
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,791
(laughing)

1194
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:23,920
- I don't believe it.

1195
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,843
Do you always keep track of where he is?

1196
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:31,550
- Only when the in-laws
are involved, okay?

1197
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,038
- Oh, right, okay.

1198
00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:35,615
(phone ringing)

1199
00:54:35,615 --> 00:54:37,865
(laughing)

1200
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,460
- Hello.

1201
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,293
Speaking.

1202
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,500
Really?

1203
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,333
Why?

1204
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,606
Oh, no, no, no, I understand,

1205
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:51,447
but as soon as you find out,

1206
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:53,963
would you give me a call, please?

1207
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,080
That's great, thanks.

1208
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,130
- [Meg] Everything okay?

1209
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,230
- The plane's been diverted to Winnipeg.

1210
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,230
- [Meg] Really, why?

1211
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:07,157
- I don't know.

1212
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:11,074
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1213
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,840
- There's a bit of luck.

1214
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,790
That storm's on the other side of town.

1215
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,290
What do you think, lads?

1216
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,053
- I don't know.

1217
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,570
I've never tried a
dead-stick landing before.

1218
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:28,863
- I grew up on it.

1219
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,327
I'm an old sail planer.

1220
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:37,533
The trick is to find your
optimum forward speed.

1221
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:41,573
If you keep the nose
too high, you slow down.

1222
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,496
If you let the nose get too low,

1223
00:55:44,496 --> 00:55:47,520
you become an aerodynamic rock.

1224
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,560
- I tried sail planing.

1225
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,460
Biggest problem's coming in too short.

1226
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:55,883
- Optimum forward speed is 220 knots.

1227
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,400
Winnipeg could you give us a reading?

1228
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,787
- Scattered clouds at 4,000 feet.

1229
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:04,520
Visibility, 15 miles.

1230
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,300
Wind of four knots at 350 degrees.

1231
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,683
And your range is,

1232
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:14,925
your range is 35, no make that 39 miles.

1233
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,940
- Roger, Winnipeg, got it.

1234
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:20,500
I'm holding 220 knots, Maurice.

1235
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,930
Do your thing.

1236
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,487
- 174, can you give fuel
and souls on board, please?

1237
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,320
(chuckling)

1238
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,153
- Fuel?

1239
00:56:28,442 --> 00:56:30,763
We still have fuel starvation.

1240
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,760
Souls on board are 63
passenger, four backend crew,

1241
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,703
and two very determined pilots.

1242
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,260
- It's a fuel problem, so smoke inhalation

1243
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,723
will likely be a bigger killer than burns.

1244
00:56:47,723 --> 00:56:49,010
Where's triage?

1245
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,218
- Sir?

1246
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:52,330
- If there's no burns, lung damage cases

1247
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,420
get first attention.

1248
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,551
- All the units are prepared.

1249
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,384
- Good.

1250
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:57,927
Broken limbs go second unless
there's head or rib trauma

1251
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:01,160
and I wanna 'em in the ambulances
and off the runways, stat.

1252
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,403
- Yes, sir.

1253
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,367
(dramatic orchestral music)

1254
00:57:24,822 --> 00:57:25,655
(crying)

1255
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,210
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1256
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,110
Are you all right?

1257
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,313
- Should I be?

1258
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,587
- You can't help how you feel.

1259
00:57:32,587 --> 00:57:34,340
We're all in this together.

1260
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,087
I am right here for you, okay?

1261
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:39,489
All right?

1262
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,572
Okay?
- yeah.

1263
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,345
- Okay, now, deep breath.

1264
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:44,622
(inhaling deeply)

1265
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:47,212
(laughing)

1266
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:48,852
Better?

1267
00:57:48,852 --> 00:57:49,685
All right, sweetie.

1268
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:50,518
- Yeah.

1269
00:57:50,518 --> 00:57:51,711
- Okay.

1270
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:52,544
- Okay.

1271
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:09,841
- [Larry] How 'bout you?

1272
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:11,174
- I'm all right.

1273
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:16,043
I'm just thinking about my baby.

1274
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:30,620
(sighing)

1275
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,453
Okay.

1276
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:35,733
Okay, we got a lot to do.

1277
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:51,329
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1278
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:57,948
- It's a hell of a lot easier
dead-sticking a sail plane

1279
00:58:57,948 --> 00:58:59,698
than it is one of these big babies.

1280
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,930
How am I doing, Maurice?

1281
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,360
- Need the range.

1282
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,653
- [Bob] Winnipeg, got a range for us?

1283
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:15,535
- 34 miles, approaching 10,000 feet.

1284
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,703
- 10,000 feet?

1285
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,850
I didn't think I was that low.

1286
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,840
- That's okay.

1287
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,610
Without the engines, I don't
know how she can maintain

1288
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:22,790
cabin pressure anyway.

1289
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,830
You don't want the
oxygen masks popping out.

1290
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,334
Might panic the passengers.

1291
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:27,167
(chuckling)

1292
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:28,240
- Might panic.

1293
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,530
I'd be surprised if
they're not back there,

1294
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,290
knitting their own parachutes right now.

1295
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,180
How we doing, Maurice?

1296
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,430
- Not as good as I hoped.

1297
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,090
- I have it figured out.

1298
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:45,903
We'll be fine.

1299
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,213
We have to be.

1300
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,893
- Why?

1301
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:53,705
(dramatic orchestral music)

1302
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:55,205
- Well, because if

1303
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,920
we were to die together,

1304
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,823
there'd be no one to identify us.

1305
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,623
We don't have anyone else, neither of us.

1306
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,900
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1307
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,749
I've never thought of that before.

1308
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,190
Doesn't seem right.

1309
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,023
- It isn't.

1310
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,793
- I don't want it to be too late, Frank.

1311
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,310
We should have something
more to leave behind

1312
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,973
than our personal libraries.

1313
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,233
- Yes, we should.

1314
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,940
It doesn't have to be too late, though.

1315
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,810
- Let's hope not.

1316
01:00:56,757 --> 01:00:59,040
- [Bob] Winnipeg approach,
let's have that range again.

1317
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,520
Could you repeat, please?

1318
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,750
- 174, your range is 20 miles.

1319
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,700
- Winnipeg approach, what was that range?

1320
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,900
Could you repeat please?

1321
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,147
- Make that 20 miles.

1322
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:12,423
Two, zero.

1323
01:01:13,857 --> 01:01:14,860
- [Bob] Well, then we won't make it.

1324
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,750
- Say again?

1325
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,710
- We won't make it.

1326
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,290
There's no glide path that'll
bring us into Winnipeg.

1327
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,300
If I keep this heading,

1328
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,588
I'll not only lose this aircraft,

1329
01:01:22,588 --> 01:01:25,173
but I'll take half of Winnipeg with me.

1330
01:01:26,648 --> 01:01:29,020
Can't let that happen.

1331
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,453
Look bad on our resumes.

1332
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,783
We're open to suggestions, boss.

1333
01:01:34,783 --> 01:01:36,627
- We're working on that, 174.

1334
01:01:50,257 --> 01:01:54,174
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1335
01:01:58,162 --> 01:02:01,495
(passengers chattering)

1336
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,830
- Hey, it's Winnipeg!

1337
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,730
I can see the airport.

1338
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,063
Look, look over there.

1339
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:17,396
- [Man] We're getting close.

1340
01:02:18,588 --> 01:02:19,421
Thank God.

1341
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,028
- Wait a minute.

1342
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:27,500
Wait a minute, there
used to be an airstrip

1343
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,883
between here and Winnipeg.

1344
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,001
It's called Gimley.

1345
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,070
We're 18 miles out of Winnipeg.

1346
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,020
It should be there.

1347
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,120
- If it is, I don't see it.

1348
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,293
- Winnipeg, this is 174,

1349
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:53,480
my first says he did some
air force time out here

1350
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,268
at a place called Gimley,
you ever heard of it?

1351
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:56,301
- Gimley.

1352
01:02:56,301 --> 01:02:57,530
- [Man] Affirmative.

1353
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,620
- Roger, 174.

1354
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,550
I flew out of it a couple of times.

1355
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,630
- Well, it's not marked.

1356
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,570
- [Al] That's because it's abandoned.

1357
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:04,560
- Well, it won't be for long.

1358
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,460
Give us a heading.

1359
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,952
(rumbling)

1360
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:13,393
- [Man] It's just turbulence.

1361
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:20,100
- I don't have it charted either,

1362
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,611
but I remember the place and
I'm reading your position

1363
01:03:22,611 --> 01:03:24,961
and I can give you an
approximate heading only,

1364
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,400
but can you fly there?

1365
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,010
I think you're too high?

1366
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,005
- We'll have to side
slip, a little bit now,

1367
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:34,250
and a whole lot when we get there.

1368
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,350
- [Al] Good luck.

1369
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,870
Here's my best guess on the heading.

1370
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,740
- [Man Over Radio] What's
he mean a side slip?

1371
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,910
- Sail plane technique.

1372
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:42,750
Uses opposing forces, cross
control ailerons and rudder

1373
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,203
and you lose altitude fast, damn fast.

1374
01:03:45,203 --> 01:03:48,890
Turn right, heading 310, got that?

1375
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:49,973
- Roger, Winnipeg.

1376
01:03:52,281 --> 01:03:53,873
I'm gonna give it a try.

1377
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:55,890
- [Al] He'll pull his rudder left

1378
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,031
and bank right.

1379
01:03:57,031 --> 01:04:00,140
That pushes the plane sideways,
giving it a bigger profile

1380
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,700
to the air current.

1381
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,891
That creates drag and slows it.

1382
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:05,329
But if it slows it too much,

1383
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,953
the plane will sink like a rock.

1384
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,563
- I swear we're moving away from Winnipeg.

1385
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:14,300
- That's impossible.

1386
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,133
We're headed--

1387
01:04:15,133 --> 01:04:15,966
- Look.

1388
01:04:17,968 --> 01:04:19,218
- We're banking sideways.

1389
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,513
- Can planes go sideways?

1390
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,343
- This one is.

1391
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:33,263
- If there's a next time,
Gloria, you'll come with.

1392
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,216
Thank God you didn't come on this one.

1393
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:40,883
(dramatic orchestral music)

1394
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,760
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1395
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,380
- How long have I got, Maurice?

1396
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,213
- How do I know?

1397
01:05:04,213 --> 01:05:05,083
I don't know where you're going.

1398
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,500
- Well, while you try and locate it,

1399
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,703
I'll try and keep this baby in the sky.

1400
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,020
Rick, could you hang in here

1401
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,200
till we spot Gimley.

1402
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,920
While Maurice eyeballs
for it, I need somebody

1403
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,783
to keep their eye on my
descent and glide path, okay?

1404
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:23,616
(patting shoulder)

1405
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:24,980
- You got it.

1406
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,790
But when we spot it, I'm outta here.

1407
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:43,150
- I gather you're an experienced flyer.

1408
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:47,053
When we land, can you
manage that emergency door?

1409
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,230
- Pleasure to help however I can.

1410
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,323
- If you're as calm as you
seem, I wish I were you.

1411
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:58,095
- Learned it in aerial combat.

1412
01:05:58,095 --> 01:05:59,200
(light orchestral music)

1413
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,413
Sometimes style is all you have left.

1414
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:16,468
- Alicia, I'd like to
dictate a letter to my wife.

1415
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,697
Actually, if you get to
this point in the tape,

1416
01:06:23,697 --> 01:06:26,297
could you shut it off and give it to Ann?

1417
01:06:28,091 --> 01:06:28,924
Thank you.

1418
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:38,810
- God help me, this is hard.

1419
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:39,643
Maurice?

1420
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,590
- Just keep along the shore line.

1421
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,490
Can't find it yet.

1422
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,892
It's the first time in my life

1423
01:06:50,892 --> 01:06:53,243
I'd rather be on the
ground than in the air.

1424
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:07,361
- All right, Pearl?

1425
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:08,278
- I'm fine.

1426
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,770
I know that Rick wouldn't
leave Chris and me

1427
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:13,550
if there was any real danger.

1428
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:16,043
As long as he's up
there, we're doing fine.

1429
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,580
- You're right.

1430
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,953
You're absolutely right.

1431
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:33,720
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1432
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,750
- I'm supposed to pick
up my folks at Edmonton.

1433
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,350
Wonder if anybody's called them.

1434
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,873
- We need someone,
preferably someone strong,

1435
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:54,023
to help with the emergency doors.

1436
01:07:54,926 --> 01:07:58,140
I assume you two would
wanna stick together?

1437
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,313
- No, I can help.

1438
01:08:02,688 --> 01:08:03,521
It's okay.

1439
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,207
It's all right.

1440
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,360
On second thought, we would
like to stay together.

1441
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,193
- I understand.

1442
01:08:14,193 --> 01:08:15,026
Thank you.

1443
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,293
- 174, come in.

1444
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,233
74, enough with the tea, all right?

1445
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:28,470
- [Man] You okay, Al?

1446
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,800
- I would be if you leave me alone.

1447
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,760
It's gotta be there.

1448
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,370
174, you're on the right heading.

1449
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,420
What's your altitude?

1450
01:08:38,096 --> 01:08:40,013
- 4,000 and dropping.

1451
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,320
Find it, Maurice, in enough time,

1452
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,043
so I don't overshoot the strip.

1453
01:08:49,905 --> 01:08:51,988
- [Maurice] Can't see it.

1454
01:08:53,153 --> 01:08:55,572
- When do we reach Winnipeg?

1455
01:08:55,572 --> 01:08:56,777
- The engine's dead.

1456
01:08:56,777 --> 01:08:57,830
- Of course not.

1457
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,690
These are just very quiet planes.

1458
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,060
- Not that quiet.

1459
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,610
What fell off the bottom of the plane?

1460
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,533
I heard a noise.

1461
01:09:03,533 --> 01:09:04,366
- That was just routine.

1462
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:06,193
- Don't lie to me.

1463
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,608
- Just be cool, okay?

1464
01:09:07,608 --> 01:09:08,441
- Okay.

1465
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:09,490
- You wanna help?

1466
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,830
I need someone strong to
work the emergency doors

1467
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,780
in case we need them.

1468
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,613
Can you do that?

1469
01:09:13,613 --> 01:09:14,446
- Yeah, sorry.

1470
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:24,310
- Hey, what, what'd you
do, close down the engines?

1471
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,460
This plane's awfully quiet.

1472
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,677
- It's just a quiet plane.

1473
01:09:26,677 --> 01:09:28,223
Now keep your shirt on.

1474
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,340
- Wouldn't change seats if I were you.

1475
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,870
That's the only way they
can identify the bodies.

1476
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,320
- Just try to be calm, all right?

1477
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,243
This is real hard on everybody.

1478
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:47,440
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1479
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,330
- 174, do you see small town
along the spit of the land,

1480
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,308
the lakeshore?

1481
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:52,641
- [Bob] Nothing.

1482
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,223
Landfall's fading away.

1483
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,530
- Well, keep going.

1484
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:00,474
It's gotta be there, 174.

1485
01:10:00,474 --> 01:10:02,610
- Easy, Al, you can't fly it for him.

1486
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,860
- I asked you to shut up.

1487
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,353
Sorry, man.

1488
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:07,360
I shouldn't have jumped at ya.

1489
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,193
- Forget me.

1490
01:10:08,193 --> 01:10:09,026
Keep on 174.

1491
01:10:09,026 --> 01:10:09,859
- It's no good.

1492
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:10,692
If they don't see it soon,

1493
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:12,449
he won't have the drag
to drop on the runway

1494
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:15,440
and he'll lose his profile and just drop.

1495
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,273
What about Everett?

1496
01:10:16,273 --> 01:10:17,430
Did you hear from the factory?

1497
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:18,390
- It's never happened before.

1498
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,650
There's no record of a plane
ever running out of fuel.

1499
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,483
- Well, they're gonna make it.

1500
01:10:22,483 --> 01:10:24,643
You just get some emergency
vehicles out there.

1501
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:31,763
- [Maurice] I can't see it.

1502
01:10:31,763 --> 01:10:32,596
I can't see it.

1503
01:10:34,427 --> 01:10:36,089
- It looks like this is it, Ann.

1504
01:10:36,089 --> 01:10:38,490
(dramatic orchestral music)

1505
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:39,973
It all seems silly to me now,

1506
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,320
all the time that I spent making a living

1507
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,103
and never making time to live.

1508
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,460
I should've worked on loving.

1509
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:51,650
(chuckling)

1510
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,103
I never did love working.

1511
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,913
It was just the illusion of winning.

1512
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:04,033
Sweetheart, I love you.

1513
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:07,823
I love you so much.

1514
01:11:10,414 --> 01:11:11,690
(tape recorder clicking)

1515
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,880
- Yeah, have 'em clear
the emergency vehicles

1516
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,011
and reopen the runway.

1517
01:11:15,011 --> 01:11:17,724
And see if there's a
control unit out in Gimley,

1518
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,891
just in case they find it.

1519
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,373
Right, I'll call the
accident investigation board.

1520
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,583
Yeah.

1521
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:36,610
- Ready?

1522
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:38,592
- Yeah, and call the army.

1523
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:40,523
Probably gonna need graves detail.

1524
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,740
- It's gotta be there,
it's gotta be there.

1525
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,610
- Stay calm, Maurice, and keep looking.

1526
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:49,710
We still got a few minutes before we drop.

1527
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,503
- [Maurice] I can't see it.

1528
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,650
It's gotta be there, it's gotta be there.

1529
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,340
- Can you drop it in the drink?

1530
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,496
- I can try, Rick.

1531
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:03,862
I can try.

1532
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,183
- He's gonna put her in the water.

1533
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,740
- Let's just hope this big baby
swims as well as she flies.

1534
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:13,640
- 150 tons hitting at 120 knots.

1535
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,470
I'm not sure there's much chance of that.

1536
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:22,491
(suspenseful orchestral music rising)

1537
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:26,378
(dramatic orchestral music)

1538
01:12:28,063 --> 01:12:29,253
Bob, it's no good.

1539
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,720
We're gonna hit water.

1540
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,373
- Winnipeg, this is 174.

1541
01:12:36,342 --> 01:12:38,693
One thing I have left
is to pull her to port.

1542
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,870
(crowd cheering)

1543
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,034
(remote clicking)

1544
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:46,420
- [News Anchor] The group of
bankers withdrew the notion

1545
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,120
of a rise in the index.

1546
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,993
- [Announcer] We'll be right
back after these messages.

1547
01:12:51,252 --> 01:12:53,919
(phone ringing)

1548
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,432
- There.

1549
01:13:01,432 --> 01:13:02,431
There, I see it.

1550
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:03,264
(grand orchestral music)

1551
01:13:03,264 --> 01:13:04,097
- Yeah!

1552
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:04,930
- [Maurice] I see Gimley.

1553
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:05,763
- Yes!

1554
01:13:05,763 --> 01:13:06,831
Yeah, all right.

1555
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:08,010
- [Bob] Winnipeg, what've I got?

1556
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,160
- Two runways.

1557
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,908
Right is sometimes used
for light aircraft.

1558
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:12,547
Left should be empty.

1559
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:14,389
Can you see the two runways?

1560
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:16,210
- No, but Maurice is dead on.

1561
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:18,678
This has gotta be it.

1562
01:13:18,678 --> 01:13:19,930
- Remember, go left.

1563
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,030
That's the unused one.

1564
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:34,900
(socket wrench clicking)

1565
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,218
- Hey, honey, how's it going?

1566
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:39,443
- Same as usual, you know, nuts and bolts.

1567
01:13:42,512 --> 01:13:46,429
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1568
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,330
- Don't worry, mommy.

1569
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,953
Daddy can fix anything.

1570
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:03,566
- He sure can, but he
may need a little help,

1571
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:04,980
just in case.

1572
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,153
I think we should pray.

1573
01:14:16,675 --> 01:14:17,508
- Go left.

1574
01:14:18,425 --> 01:14:19,350
Go left.

1575
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:20,423
Talk to me, Maurice.

1576
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:25,210
- Too fast, too fast, we'll overshoot.

1577
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,043
Lose altitude.

1578
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,990
- I'm already side slipping.

1579
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,823
- Then we'll overshoot.

1580
01:14:29,823 --> 01:14:31,190
Drag.

1581
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:32,023
Drag.

1582
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,000
- Drop the landing gear.

1583
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,210
That oughta do it.

1584
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,310
- [Maurice] Gear down.

1585
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,033
- Nothing.

1586
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,640
- Alternate gear extension switch.

1587
01:14:59,535 --> 01:15:00,780
- That's it, that's it.

1588
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,093
I feel it.

1589
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:09,335
(instrument panel beeping)

1590
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:10,168
- No.

1591
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,760
- Nose gear isn't locked.

1592
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,760
- It's too late now.

1593
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,897
(seat belt releasing)

1594
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,870
- God be with you.

1595
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:27,706
And all of us.

1596
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,220
- Emergency landing positions.

1597
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,918
(door opening)

1598
01:15:34,918 --> 01:15:37,501
(door closing)

1599
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,123
- [James Voiceover] His face says it all.

1600
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,043
Must be going down.

1601
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,870
Wonder if the boys who
flew with me in 1945

1602
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:52,770
had time to think.

1603
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,500
I was so young then.

1604
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,193
Guess I'm lucky.

1605
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,510
- [Pearl Voiceover] He's
trying to reassure me.

1606
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,803
He's still not thinking about himself.

1607
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,880
- Pretty soon, George, you'll be too fast

1608
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,180
for our little racing cup.

1609
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:49,170
- I don't come for the races, honey.

1610
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:51,093
It's the people.

1611
01:16:51,093 --> 01:16:53,343
(laughing)

1612
01:16:56,081 --> 01:17:00,313
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1613
01:17:00,313 --> 01:17:01,693
- 3,000 feet and closing.

1614
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,050
Hang left.

1615
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:04,883
- Roger.

1616
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,953
Steady, hang left.

1617
01:17:08,855 --> 01:17:10,213
- [Norma Voiceover]
Why aren't I screaming?

1618
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,433
I should be scared.

1619
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,000
It's because I'm with you.

1620
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:18,983
I love you with all my heart.

1621
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,210
Why did it take us
until the end to realize

1622
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,613
how much we had together?

1623
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,660
Just hold me.

1624
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,468
- We've just received reports

1625
01:17:58,468 --> 01:18:01,730
of a Canada World Airways
flight in distress,

1626
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:05,150
originally bound for Edmonton
and re-routed to Winnipeg.

1627
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:08,190
The plane carrying 67
passengers and six crew

1628
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,714
had experienced mid-air
mechanical problems.

1629
01:18:10,714 --> 01:18:13,420
We have no word as yet
whether the aircraft

1630
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,760
has safely landed.

1631
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,635
We'll stay with this story as it unfolds.

1632
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:17,685
(dramatic orchestral music)

1633
01:18:17,685 --> 01:18:18,610
After the break,

1634
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,320
we'll come back with a
full entertainment report.

1635
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,734
- No, I knew it.

1636
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:23,567
I knew it.

1637
01:18:25,445 --> 01:18:26,278
I knew it.

1638
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:29,115
- Find that runway.

1639
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:30,673
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1640
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:32,270
- 2,500 feet.

1641
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,657
Keep your descent.

1642
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:37,603
2,000 feet and closing.

1643
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:38,856
- [Woman] Hey, Joe.

1644
01:18:38,856 --> 01:18:40,720
- Mom, can we sprint okay?

1645
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,480
- Sure, but just one.

1646
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,703
Lunch is almost ready.

1647
01:18:49,518 --> 01:18:52,145
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1648
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:52,992
- [Phil Voiceover] What will they say

1649
01:18:52,992 --> 01:18:53,825
at the family reunion?

1650
01:18:56,816 --> 01:19:01,783
He never reached out,
only thought of himself.

1651
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:12,530
- [Bob Voiceover] Oh
God, get me out of this.

1652
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,961
I'll get it right, I swear I will.

1653
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,294
My God, help me.

1654
01:19:19,657 --> 01:19:21,133
Get me through this, please.

1655
01:19:22,812 --> 01:19:23,645
Oh, God.

1656
01:19:29,105 --> 01:19:32,155
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1657
01:19:32,155 --> 01:19:32,988
(grunting)

1658
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:35,280
- Lower, still lower.

1659
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,910
More drag.

1660
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,375
- Going over.

1661
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:40,625
(grunting)

1662
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:48,230
(dramatic orchestral music)

1663
01:20:12,965 --> 01:20:14,593
- [Lynn Voiceover] No.

1664
01:20:14,593 --> 01:20:15,926
What better way?

1665
01:20:17,305 --> 01:20:18,205
A child in her lap

1666
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:21,635
and her true love's at her side.

1667
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,503
I will see my baby again.

1668
01:20:26,995 --> 01:20:27,828
I will.

1669
01:20:46,726 --> 01:20:48,809
(crying)

1670
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,780
- [Pearl Voiceover] What
have we done to Chris?

1671
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,280
What could his life have been?

1672
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,183
Dear God, take me.

1673
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,453
Spare my baby.

1674
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,163
- Look at that plane, would ya?

1675
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,243
- [Woman] Of course it's a plane.

1676
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:19,993
- Are they landing in that
other air strip over there?

1677
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:24,501
That is one quiet plane, if you ask me.

1678
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:34,868
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1679
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,320
- [Maurice] Bear left.

1680
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:42,656
- Left, left side.

1681
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,489
Damn.

1682
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:45,485
Drop, babe.

1683
01:21:46,576 --> 01:21:47,520
Drop, babe.

1684
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,770
(grunting)

1685
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,130
- Get these cars off the runway.

1686
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,573
That plane's coming down.

1687
01:21:57,493 --> 01:21:58,370
Move it!

1688
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:59,310
Move it, drivers!

1689
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,119
Get these cars off the runway!

1690
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,059
(yelling)

1691
01:22:04,059 --> 01:22:06,892
(engines revving)

1692
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:22,677
- What are all those people doing there?

1693
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:24,760
Look at all those people.

1694
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:28,842
- Jim!

1695
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:30,999
- Kid, kid!

1696
01:22:30,999 --> 01:22:32,520
- Jim.

1697
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,512
Get down, get off the runway!

1698
01:22:34,512 --> 01:22:36,345
Jim, get out of there.

1699
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:39,706
- There's a kid on the runway!

1700
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,438
- Get out of there!

1701
01:22:42,438 --> 01:22:44,239
Jim, get off the runway!

1702
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,072
A plane!

1703
01:22:45,072 --> 01:22:45,968
Get out!

1704
01:22:45,968 --> 01:22:47,931
- Keep it steady.

1705
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:48,764
- Jim!

1706
01:22:53,779 --> 01:22:55,071
- Love you, mom.

1707
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:56,238
Love you, dad.

1708
01:22:58,606 --> 01:22:59,439
Contact.

1709
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,841
(tires screeching)

1710
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:03,237
(crying)

1711
01:23:03,237 --> 01:23:04,280
(nose grinding)

1712
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,613
(screaming)

1713
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:14,177
Brakes, brakes!

1714
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:18,371
Brakes, right brake, right brake.

1715
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,073
Left brake, left brake.

1716
01:23:21,073 --> 01:23:22,389
(screaming)

1717
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:23,222
Brakes!

1718
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,283
Brakes!

1719
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:29,401
(crying)

1720
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:34,244
More brakes, pound 'em.

1721
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:35,541
Come on, stop.

1722
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:36,374
Stop!

1723
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:39,524
(crying)

1724
01:23:39,524 --> 01:23:42,274
(plane grinding)

1725
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:47,437
(heavy breathing)

1726
01:23:53,023 --> 01:23:54,651
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1727
01:23:54,651 --> 01:23:57,490
(electricity zapping)

1728
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,050
Smoke, smoke, we got a fire.

1729
01:23:59,050 --> 01:23:59,924
We got a fire.

1730
01:23:59,924 --> 01:24:01,397
- No, no.

1731
01:24:01,397 --> 01:24:02,230
No.

1732
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:14,837
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1733
01:24:14,837 --> 01:24:16,812
(electricity zapping)

1734
01:24:16,812 --> 01:24:18,812
- Out of here, let's go.

1735
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:22,656
(seat belts releasing)

1736
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,489
(coughing)

1737
01:24:23,489 --> 01:24:24,682
Fire extinguisher.

1738
01:24:24,682 --> 01:24:26,063
We've gotta get this fire out.

1739
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:31,334
(all yelling)

1740
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,598
- [Man] The exit!

1741
01:24:35,598 --> 01:24:39,348
(fire extinguisher spraying)

1742
01:24:41,545 --> 01:24:42,437
- Get out of here.

1743
01:24:42,437 --> 01:24:43,400
The smoke could be poisonous.

1744
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,233
Go!

1745
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,503
You too.

1746
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:47,920
- I'm gonna help.

1747
01:24:51,084 --> 01:24:53,433
- Everybody, fire extinguishers.

1748
01:24:53,433 --> 01:24:56,003
First aid, blankets, hurry!

1749
01:24:56,003 --> 01:24:56,836
Hurry!

1750
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:00,412
- Need someone to catch the others.

1751
01:25:00,412 --> 01:25:01,569
Go, go!

1752
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:03,736
(yelling)

1753
01:25:08,032 --> 01:25:09,133
- Are you okay?

1754
01:25:09,133 --> 01:25:10,883
- Feet first, go, go.

1755
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:19,571
- Wait.

1756
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:20,404
- Come on.

1757
01:25:20,404 --> 01:25:21,237
- Smoke.

1758
01:25:23,335 --> 01:25:24,408
- Okay, go, go.

1759
01:25:24,408 --> 01:25:25,913
Come on, come on.

1760
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,283
- Feet first, go, down.

1761
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:34,323
- Come on, before you burn, come on!

1762
01:25:34,323 --> 01:25:35,336
- Down, feet first.

1763
01:25:35,336 --> 01:25:36,169
Go.

1764
01:25:39,798 --> 01:25:43,280
First, straight to the bottom.

1765
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,530
(laughing)

1766
01:25:47,587 --> 01:25:50,350
(fire extinguishers spraying)

1767
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,588
- Feet first.

1768
01:25:51,588 --> 01:25:53,838
(coughing)

1769
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,733
(coughing)

1770
01:25:58,972 --> 01:26:00,889
Straight to the bottom.

1771
01:26:02,296 --> 01:26:04,260
- The extinguishers are dead.

1772
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,325
Let's get out of here.

1773
01:26:06,325 --> 01:26:09,180
Come on, come on, come on.

1774
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,940
- Sir, feet first.

1775
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,807
Roll with the baby.

1776
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:13,779
It's okay, it's okay.

1777
01:26:13,779 --> 01:26:16,090
Just, okay, here we go.

1778
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:16,923
Sir?

1779
01:26:24,063 --> 01:26:25,447
Pearl, come on, go

1780
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:27,614
it's okay, feet first, go.

1781
01:26:34,912 --> 01:26:35,745
- Hang on.

1782
01:26:35,745 --> 01:26:37,578
- Okay, roll with him.

1783
01:26:43,577 --> 01:26:45,827
(coughing)

1784
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:52,882
- Is that it?

1785
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:53,930
Bob, Maurice?

1786
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:54,850
- Maurice, straight back.

1787
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,873
- Come on back, let's go, come on!

1788
01:26:58,217 --> 01:26:59,050
(coughing)

1789
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,883
Did you check every seat?

1790
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:00,716
- Yeah, let's go.

1791
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:01,549
Out!

1792
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,632
- Keep going, keep going.

1793
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:12,661
- Come on, Mo!

1794
01:27:16,115 --> 01:27:18,365
(grunting)

1795
01:27:26,419 --> 01:27:28,669
(coughing)

1796
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:32,319
- Bob's still inside.

1797
01:27:34,857 --> 01:27:37,107
(coughing)

1798
01:27:48,559 --> 01:27:51,726
(electricity zapping)

1799
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,900
(coughing)

1800
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,236
(extinguisher spraying)

1801
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,069
