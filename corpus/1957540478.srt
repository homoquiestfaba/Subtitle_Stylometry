Are you sure
you don't wanna...

- [laughs] No.

- Why?
- No, no, no.

375

I can't.

[Bubu] Mm.

380

What about you, Martita?

383
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,997
I mean,
it was nothing, really.

384
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,065
It was just a trip.

385
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,967
- Adios.
- Adios.

00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,469

Look at Manchi Sanantonio.

He's adding another building

- No, no.

No, you... you... you sounded sure.

Did he... did he
tell you something?

409
00:25:17,422 --> 00:25:20,858
- What are you implying, Bubu?
- Not implying.

410
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:23,695
You left me for a whole year

from Aruba,

412
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:30,802

of something?

Is that what you're doing?

414
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:33,771
No.

415
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,541

[Manchi] It's more like
a dilemma.

502
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,514
[Chamon] You want an opinion?

503
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,850
[Manchi] Or a decision.

504
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:26,618

[Chamon] Okay.

506

The man or your wife?

509

It depends who's on top.

I don't know.
Who you shoot?

511
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,869
Neither, because if you shoot
someone, you're a criminal.

But you shoot nobody,
you is a pussy.

519
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,821
Just for the sake
of the argument, hmm?

520
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,656
Let someone else be the woman...

521
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:07,526
- You, Bubu Fiel.
- Hmm?

522
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,360
You are the man my wife
is carrying on with.

Mm. Good.
Your wife.

524
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,833
That is, if you don't mind me
being the judge for a moment.

525
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:18,102
You always wanted
to be a judge, Manchi.

526
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:20,104
Chamon,
can you be the woman?

527

Okay, just get
to the point.

Now, don't forget,
the other man is a lawyer.

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,983
who don't speak Latin,
means "red-handed."

542
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:08,052
Ooh, but hurry up now.

543
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:09,955
Otherwise I will come
before you finish.

544
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:12,891
[all laughing]

545
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:14,593
Yeah, Bubu,
you may be a strong man,

546
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:16,160
but you can't
do a thing to me.

547
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:19,396
Of course not, because
he's there on top of your wife.

548
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,999
Yes, I am too busy
fucking her.

549
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:24,669
[all laughing]

550
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:28,172
You can't, because I have
a revolver aimed at you.

551
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,242
[tense music]

552
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,912
[laughs]

553
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:38,415
So, the lawyer asked the judge,

554
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,818
<i>"Can I get dressed?"</i>

555
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:41,586
<i>And the judge answers,</i>

556
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,788
<i>"You did not ask my permission
to get undressed,</i>

557
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,122
<i>did you?"</i>

558
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,157
The point is,
as a judge,

559
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:50,428
I know how to use the law
to my advantage.

560
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,931
So, do I shoot
this young man?

561
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:54,432
No.

562
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,535
Because if I shoot him,
I go to jail for murder.

563
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,670
And why should I do that?

564
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:01,205
I am the innocent party.

565
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:04,208
So the judge says,

566
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:06,945
<i>"Do you understand
the law of property?"</i>

567
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,146
<i>The young lawyer doesn't
know how to answer.</i>

568
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,682
<i>The judge says,</i>

569
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,217
<i>"You are using my property.</i>

570
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,887
<i>"You must pay me compensation."</i>

571
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,222
Or in a more common word,
"rent."

572
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:21,960
So if all this husband
wants is money...

573
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:24,161
- Give him the money.
- [all chuckling]

574
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:27,566
Yes, Bubu,
that's how clever the judge is.

575
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,735
He now has established
that money is to be paid.

576
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,904
And by relentless logic,

577
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:35,306
the woman is a whore.

578
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,842
<i>After a desperate search
through his trousers,</i>

579
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:41,211
<i>he finds five guilders.</i>

580
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:43,982
Five guil...
it's not enough.

581
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:47,318
No, you cannot fuck a monkey
with hemorrhoids

582
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:48,385
for five guilders.

583
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:49,921
Exactly.

584
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,723
That's the point.

585
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:54,993
He will pay the price
for the filthiest whore.

586
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:57,829
A high class whore is,
uh, what, 60?

587
00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,497
Man, I wish I could afford that.

588
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:01,499
Eh, some will do it
for nothing.

589
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:03,735
No, some will do it
for a lift to Campo.

590
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:05,437
- Who?
- Some.

591
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,006
And so the judge

592
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,609
<i>makes the lawyer pay his wife.</i>

593
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,512
<i>And he makes his wife pay him.</i>

594
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:17,048
<i>Five guilders.</i>

595
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:19,784
<i>Takes the note,
puts it inside his wallet,</i>

596
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:22,419
right behind a picture
of that slut.

597
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:27,626
And so,
to teach her a lesson,

598
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,694
he makes her pay him
five guilders

599
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:33,431
every Sunday before
they sit down to eat.

600
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,033
Eternal punishment.

601
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:37,301
[Chamon] A woman like that
will commit suicide

602
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:38,402
unless she leaves that man.

603
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:40,371
She won't leave him.

604
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:42,139
She's too frightened of scandal.

605
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:47,144
All kinds of things happen
in those high circles,

606
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,781
but nothing can ever leak out.

607
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:52,416
[♪]

608
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,755
The wife of the judge,
she's a cultivated woman.

609
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:59,858
You know, someone
of Solema's caliber.

610
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:03,227
Is that the end of the story?

611
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:06,698
Can we play dominoes now?

612
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:11,335
Okay, so it's three to two,
to one to zero.

613
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,737
Mm-mm.

614
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,005
No, no, no, no, no,
it isn't, no.

615
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,140
- [Chamon] Yes, it is.
- No.

616
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,675
You have zero.

617
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,843
Chamon and Ernesto have one,

618
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,310
and I have three.

619
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,580
No, I just say I have two.

620
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:24,181
Bubu, tell him now.

621
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:26,918
I... I... I... don't know.

622
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:29,186
We have to find a better way
to keep score.

623
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,855
Where is Nora?
[clears throat]

624
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,624
[gulls squawking]

625
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:35,694
[♪]

626
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:54,179
[bell ringing]

627
00:37:58,248 --> 00:38:01,385
[ship droning]

628
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:08,526
[Old Ostrik] How long has
she been like that?

629
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,162
[Vera] It started
about seven years ago.

630
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:14,499
Forgetting names, words,

631
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,468
mixing up stuff.

632
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:20,572
Then three years ago,
it went downhill fast.

633
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,641
It always happens like that.

634
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,479
But with the money I sent you,

635
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:29,614
why didn't you get
the proper treatment?

636
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:35,487
Typical Ostrik.

637
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:49,934
Ah, who likes soup?

638
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,604
So why did you come
back here now, Ostrik?

639
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:56,941
Liza left me.

640
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:01,946
- I'm sorry.
- After 20 years...

641
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:07,384
she said she had
had enough of my schedule.

642
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,921
She also said...

643
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,724
she couldn't bear my
"inability to show emotion"

644
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:16,928
<i>and</i> she considered me
a control freak.

645
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,131
That coming
from a Dutch woman.

646
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:22,000
[laughs]

647
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,271
I think she resented the fact
I didn't want children.

648
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:27,639
I needed to get away.

649
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:29,440
So I came down here.

650
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:36,981
Do you check her cholesterol
regularly?

651
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,617
[dishes clanking]

652
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,653
Yes, Ostrik.

653
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:42,821
Good.

654
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:45,256
Wait, wait, wait.

655
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,825
Salt is poison.

656
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:49,894
Who do you think you are?

657
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:52,230
We don't see you for
I don't know how many years,

658
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:53,832
and you show up
just like that?

659
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:55,399
No warning whatsoever.

660
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,101
And you have the nerve
to criticize

661
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:58,670
the way I take care of her?

662
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,772
Coming here, expecting pity!

663
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:02,307
Me, pity you?

664
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:05,443
You were the only one
she ever really cared about.

665
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:08,012
Her big hope of salvation.

666
00:40:08,046 --> 00:40:10,281
Having a doctor for a son,

667
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:12,317
only to see him
flee to Holland

668
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,719
without a word of gratitude.

669
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,190
Did you ever thank her for all
the sacrifices she made for you?

670
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:21,425
- Sacrifices?
- Yes!

671
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:26,363
This, uh, this was a mistake.

672
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:28,032
I shouldn't have come back.

673
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:33,438
Go on!

674
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:34,939
Leave!

675
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,876
- You selfish, arrogant...
- [car engine rumbles]

676
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:40,945
ungrateful coward!

677
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,548
What is wrong
with these people?

678
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,550
How in God's name
can they stand it?

679
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,951
There's no progress.

680
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,721
Nothing changes.
Nothing ever changes here.

681
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:53,291
Yes, but we have
our own Parliament.

682
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,894
The Dutch no longer rule us.

683
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:58,529
We have control
of our own resources.

684
00:40:58,563 --> 00:41:02,300
Coco, you really believe
that will make any difference?

685
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:03,334
Look at them.

686
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:04,502
Do you think they really care?

687
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,904
[Coco] Ah, shon.

688
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:08,840
We do the very best
we can, huh?

689
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:10,975
We don't have much, but, uh...

690
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:14,312
we have the sun.

691
00:41:14,345 --> 00:41:15,713
Which is free.

<i>Considered the most beautiful

00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:42,900
There is talk.

723
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:35,887
That's very good, Ostrik.

724
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:39,123
Please continue practicing
the same measures.

725
00:43:39,157 --> 00:43:40,691
I have to go now.

726
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,089

Your leg.

736
00:46:34,265 --> 00:46:35,467
Please.

737
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:39,571
It's a terrible mess.

738
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:41,573
Please.

739
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:43,140
I'll take care of it.

740
00:46:58,923 --> 00:47:00,659
You said there was talk

741
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,393
at the domino game.

742
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:06,831
Who was talking?
Manchi?

743
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,335
I suspect that he is abusing you
in a terrible way.

744
00:47:12,803 --> 00:47:15,273
Perhaps you made
a mistake once.

745
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:17,275
I don't even know why
I'm saying this.

746
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:19,745
I don't care.
It is not my business.

747
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,581
You know.

748
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:29,954
I only suspected Manchi
was trying to drive you mad.

749
00:47:29,987 --> 00:47:32,356
I thought it unjust
that he would paint you...

750
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,726
As a whore?
[catches breath]

751
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,296
This is quite possibly
his only original thought.

752
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:42,133
He must be
extremely proud of it.

753
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:44,802
I see now.

754
00:47:44,835 --> 00:47:48,239
Manchi is crazy,
and he wants to make you crazy.

755
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:50,207
That is why I came
to warn you.

756
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:52,376
No one has the right
to treat another person

757
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,178
the way Manchi does you.

758
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:57,114
Has he ever
done anything to you?

759
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:58,382
[Ernesto] No.

760
00:47:58,416 --> 00:47:59,618
I just don't like the fact

761
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:01,787
that he thinks
he's always right.

762
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:05,757
When two people
cannot get along anymore,

763
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:09,293
the best solution is for them
to simply let each other go.

764
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,630
You're right.

765
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:15,032
It would have been better.

766
00:48:17,301 --> 00:48:19,003
He thinks he's got
a hold on you,

767
00:48:19,036 --> 00:48:21,172
but his hold is slipping,

768
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:22,674
isn't it?

769
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:25,510
I better go.

770
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:30,981
Let me say, I... I really like
the way you carry yourself.

771
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,685
Do you mean that?

772
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,086
Yes, I do.

773
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:39,190
Even after my mistake?

774
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:42,026
Anyone can make mistakes.

775
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:44,929
I was born out of wedlock,
myself, as they say.

776
00:48:44,962 --> 00:48:48,299
[laughs]

777
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:51,536
Well, maybe I'll come visit you
from time to time.

778
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,003
Just to talk.

779
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,206
I have no one.

780
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,543
You know all my secrets.

781
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:00,277
You will always be welcome,

782
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,647
but please be careful.

Nora.
[clears throat]

788
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:47,759
Chamon, I need ten guilders.

789
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:50,762
You know when you do it for
money, you ask for it before.

790
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:53,432
But when you do it for love,
you should wait till after.

791
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:55,767
It's for the children.

792
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,436
You know, you and me,

793
00:49:58,703 --> 00:50:00,104
we have to stop.

794
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:01,440
Why?

795
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,775
Bubu is my friend.

796
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:05,710
I can't stand lying
to him anymore.

797
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:09,313
All Bubu does
is chase after whores.

798
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:14,418
He knows I know,

799
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:16,588
so he doesn't ask
any questions.

800
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:18,723
One day, he will notice...

801
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:20,592
and then...

802
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,794
[Nora] You weren't afraid
of him before.

803
00:50:22,828 --> 00:50:24,962
How come you are now?

804
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:27,198
Have you become a coward,

805
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:28,934
little Chamon?

806
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:30,535

807
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,303
I'm not afraid of anyone.

Come on.

If you don't help me,

[chuckles]

839
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:15,299
You could make a living
from this, you know?

Making tables.

841
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,303
Making furniture.

842
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:21,940
As a business?

843
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:24,476
It is not impossible.

844
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,444
That is what we need here.

845
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:31,248
Kurasoleños used to produce
all kinds of things,

846
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:32,917
then that damned refinery came

847
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:35,987
destroyed all our motivations
to produce for ourselves.

848
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:38,288
You should go into politics.

Impossible.

[Bubu] Mm.

[laughs]

914
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:49,435

You're going somewhere?

00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:40,351
Hey, Manchi.

00:59:40,385 --> 00:59:42,687

00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,025
[Ernesto] What is the deal
with the shoes?

922
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:49,093
[Manchi] Come up with a better
way to keep score here.

923
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:53,598
Hey, we will hang the shoes
in the tree to keep score.

924
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,968
Lose ten games with them,

925
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,803
get one shoe.

926
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:00,204
Hey, no, no, no.

927
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:04,208
Please, please, our guests
are drying out.

928
01:00:04,242 --> 01:00:06,512
- All right.
- [laughs]

929
01:00:06,544 --> 01:00:08,046
We'll take black.

930
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:19,525
[Chamon] Hey, hey.

931
01:00:19,557 --> 01:00:21,793
- Hey, hey, hey!
- [Ernesto] Hey, Chamon!

932
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,994
- [Bubu] Chamon!
- [laughs]

933
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,862
- [banging on table]
- Mm.

934
01:00:24,896 --> 01:00:26,597
[Chamon] What we doing
with the shoes?

<i>It's how you play

01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,239
In the past,

939
01:00:35,273 --> 01:00:37,375
there was a toll
on the floating bridge in town.

[dominoes rattling]

941
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,379
Everybody had to pay
to cross it.

942
01:00:41,412 --> 01:00:44,048
Those without shoes
could cross for free.

943
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:51,523
To give a man shoes shows
that you are above him.

944
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:54,692
It's like
calling him a beggar.

945
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:56,327
So humiliation, then.

946
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,262
- [Manchi] Mm-hmm.
- Nice.

947
01:00:58,296 --> 01:01:01,065
So, Manchi...

948
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:03,301
let's give our friends
some shoes, eh?

Bubu, I heard the taxi drivers
want to form a union,

974
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:33,958
and that you will be elected
as the president.

975
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:36,595
- I heard it, too.
- Mm-hmm.

976
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,029
No, no.

977
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:40,164
I have enough problems
as it is.

978
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:43,535
So why is everybody saying that
you will be elected president?

01:02:43,569 --> 01:02:45,336
Well...

[overlapping chatter]

984
01:02:56,414 --> 01:02:58,049
You cannot take all the people.

985
01:02:58,082 --> 01:02:59,551
You can't take all the people.

[arguing continues]

987
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:06,958
- Let's go talk to Bubu.
- Yeah, let's go.

988
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,759
- Bubu!
- Let's go there.

989
01:03:14,031 --> 01:03:15,967
Hey, Bubu,
can you believe this, man?

990
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,002
There should be a law
against these buses, man.

991
01:03:18,035 --> 01:03:19,571
They're stealing
all of our customers.

992
01:03:19,605 --> 01:03:21,573
Some of the guys
have been talking

994
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,309
What do you think, Bubu?

995
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,211
Right!
The union, Bubu.

996
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:29,981
- Putting the union together.
- Okay. Okay.

997
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,749
Ah!
[indistinct]

998
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:33,417
What are you looking at?

999
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,556
Mm.

[bus horn honking]

Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:58,075
Hey, stop, stop, stop...

1003
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,279
Oh, of course!

[drivers chanting]
Yeah! Yeah!

1007
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:26,304
Get him!
Get him, that's right.

1008
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:27,972
- Let's do this, yeah!
- Hi.

1009
01:04:28,005 --> 01:04:29,974
Hey, Bubu.
This is my job, man.

1010
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,943
Hey, you've been stealing
our customers for too long.

1011
01:04:32,977 --> 01:04:36,247
So now, you leave
or you face the consequences.

1012
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,716
[all] Yeah!

1013
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,983
Go.

1014
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:44,456
It is good to have a union.

1015
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:47,992
You sound like a communist.

1016
01:04:48,025 --> 01:04:49,795
I am not a communist,

1017
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:51,896
but I ask you this:

1018
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:52,963
who owns the buses?

1019
01:04:52,997 --> 01:04:54,231
Who owns the hotels?

1020
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,568
Foreigners,
and that is who?

1021
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:00,672
Do you think they would let
a Kurasoleño run the refinery?

1022
01:05:00,706 --> 01:05:03,742
Could a Kurasoleño ever become
manager of the Hilton?

1023
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,243
If he has ability
and application.

1024
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,079
Come on now.

1025
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,615
Either you don't want to see
or you're really stupid.

1026
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:12,784
- Hey.
- This is modern slavery.

1027
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:15,286
We, Black men, have to take
control of our destiny.

1028
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:17,756
Hey, you and your Black power.

1029
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,591
Negroes can't govern.

1030
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,760
It's been proven often enough.

1031
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,595
They're lazy

1032
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,764
and have no sense
of responsibility.

1033
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,366
Ernesto, please enough
of this foolishness.

1034
01:05:28,399 --> 01:05:32,103
Hey, it's a de-mo-cra-cy.

1035
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,205
The best system there is.

1036
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:37,442
Politics is always corrupt.

1037
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:39,644
What it comes down to is this.

1038
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:42,547
A young girl is brought
to a doctor unconscious.

1039
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:46,183
Instead of reviving her,
which is his duty as a doctor,

1040
01:05:46,217 --> 01:05:48,352
he lifts up her skirt
and fucks her.

1041
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,657
That is what our politicians
are doing to our people,

1042
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:55,861
and they allow foreigners
to join the gangbang!

1043
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:58,396
Only the people
can correct this.

1044
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:01,633
But they have to be
educated politically

1045
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,636
before there can be any question
of your de-mo-cra-cy.

1046
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:05,637
You understand?

1047
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,506
Education.

1048
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:09,373
Our people have
to have education!

1049
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:11,643
Education. Do you know what
happens if you keep on exploiting

1050
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:15,212
people's ignorance
instead of educating them?

1051
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:17,716
We'll have a revolution
on this island.

1052
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:19,851
A real violent revolution...

1053
01:06:19,885 --> 01:06:21,318
[both] Just like in Cuba.

1054
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,890
That sounds very familiar.

1055
01:06:25,457 --> 01:06:26,691
[clears throat]

1056
01:06:26,725 --> 01:06:29,761
No, we don't want
Communism here.

1057
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:31,262
Mm-mm.

1058
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,864
You know, in Cuba,

1059
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:34,999
all the whores drive buses!

1060
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,768
Or would you rather them
drive taxis?

1061
01:06:36,802 --> 01:06:38,837
Manchi, it's true.

1062
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,271
There are no whores left!

1063
01:06:40,304 --> 01:06:42,940
Castro makes all of them
drive buses.

1064
01:06:42,973 --> 01:06:44,443
[Ernesto] Good for them.

1065
01:06:44,476 --> 01:06:46,377
We've got to start
loving this country more,

1066
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,379
- and our women, especially.
- [snorts]

1067
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:52,082
All the whores are now
bus drivers.

1068
01:06:52,116 --> 01:06:53,685
Imagine that.

1069
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,554
Imagine this.

1070
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:57,121
Sapatu number two.

1071
01:06:57,154 --> 01:06:59,123
[laughs]

1072
01:06:59,957 --> 01:07:02,727
I had threes.
You know I had threes.

1073
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:03,961
You win some, you lose some.

1074
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,095
[dice rattling]

1075
01:07:05,129 --> 01:07:06,363
Hm?

1076
01:07:07,264 --> 01:07:09,099
[Bubu] Mm-mm!

1077
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:12,102
I won one, just one,
but you lose every game.

1078
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:15,239
[clears throat]

1079
01:07:15,272 --> 01:07:16,407
We haven't given them
one shoe yet.

1080
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:18,042
[Bubu] Mm!

This will wake us up.

Mm.

01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,319
What a woman, hm?

1085

No, they're coming here today.

[Ernesto] Who?

1087
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,259
The taxi drivers.

Ya, ya, ya.

1090
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:42,066
They're going to elect me
by acclamation.

1091
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,602
Whatever that means.

1092
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:45,904
"By acclamation" means
there's no need to vote.

1093
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,939
They just say "Bubu Fiel"!

1094

- Yeah.

And you thought you married
an idiot, hm?

1098
01:07:56,982 --> 01:07:58,950
Do you want to know the words
from the sermon this morning?

1099
01:07:58,984 --> 01:08:00,117
[Bubu] Mm.

here in my house.

What's wrong, huh?

1119
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,216
Nothing.

1120
01:09:07,052 --> 01:09:11,723
It's just... sometimes,
I don't know how we'll survive.

1121
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:12,991
Survive?

1122
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,859
We don't have any money, Bubu.

1123
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:16,761
We never have money.

I don't know how
I can feed the children.

1613
01:39:24,935 --> 01:39:28,239
[Chamon] You know, no one
needs to go crazy here.

1614
01:39:28,272 --> 01:39:30,408
We're just...

We're just playing
dominoes, no?

Crazy isn't the right word, mm.

1617

They're just so pushy.

Man, I think this,
uh, defeat

01:39:47,358 --> 01:39:48,827
is getting to you bit, eh?

1622
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:51,763
Ah, Bubu, we cannot lose

1623
01:39:51,797 --> 01:39:54,566
because there's nothing to lose.

1624
01:39:55,966 --> 01:39:57,935
And don't forget...

1625
01:39:57,968 --> 01:40:00,271
it's only a game

You all heard my wife;
she just said

1636
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,410
that she was going to give
someone her condolences.

1637
01:41:13,445 --> 01:41:14,880
Now look, look... hey.

1638
01:41:20,952 --> 01:41:22,521
Now she's going
into Manchi's house.

1639
01:41:22,554 --> 01:41:23,855
She never does that.

1640
01:41:23,889 --> 01:41:27,726
She has been acting strange
all day.

1641
01:41:30,795 --> 01:41:32,062
All day.

1642
01:41:39,538 --> 01:41:42,206
Nora, tell me what's wrong.

1643
01:41:44,709 --> 01:41:46,343
It's Ostrik.

1644
01:41:47,244 --> 01:41:49,714
He needs shoes for school.

1645
01:41:50,882 --> 01:41:52,617
Well, how much do you need?

1646
01:41:53,852 --> 01:41:55,152
Five guilders.

1647
01:41:55,185 --> 01:41:56,955
Only five guilders?

1648
01:41:59,991 --> 01:42:01,693
One moment.

1649
01:42:04,029 --> 01:42:07,364
I'll get it back to you as soon
as I get some money from Bubu.

It's a bloodbath.

1667

The worst beating
in domino history.

1668
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,629
- Are they still losing?
- Yeah!

1669
01:43:10,662 --> 01:43:14,398
All this because Bubu spent
the whole night in Campo.

1670

That's a lie, you idiot!

1671

Can't start the union meeting

You want something?

Dominoes is a very

[man in distance
speaking indistinctly]

1792
01:52:08,299 --> 01:52:10,935
[Nora] You're a first-class
piece of shit.

1793
01:52:10,968 --> 01:52:12,336
You wouldn't talk
to me all day.

1794
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:14,573
- You wouldn't even look at me!
- [Chamon] Hey.

1795
01:52:14,606 --> 01:52:16,340
What did you expect?

1796
01:52:16,374 --> 01:52:17,576
Bubu is right there.

1797
01:52:17,609 --> 01:52:19,277
[Nora] Chamon, I'm desperate.

1798
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:22,481
- I need you to help me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1799
01:52:22,514 --> 01:52:25,316
I cannot do that anymore.

1800
01:52:25,349 --> 01:52:26,951
What is it, Chamon?

1801
01:52:26,984 --> 01:52:29,153
You don't like me anymore,
is that it?

1802
01:52:29,187 --> 01:52:30,656
[Chamon chuckles]

1803
01:52:30,688 --> 01:52:33,691
You don't like fucking me?

1804
01:52:36,127 --> 01:52:38,429
- You know I like it.
- Mm.

1805
01:52:38,463 --> 01:52:41,199
I wish I didn't like it,
but I love it.

1806
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:44,335
But you know, with you...

1807
01:52:44,368 --> 01:52:46,270
it is only about the money.

1808
01:52:46,304 --> 01:52:47,271
All the time.

1809
01:52:47,305 --> 01:52:49,774
"Chamon, give me some money."

1810
01:52:49,807 --> 01:52:53,978
And so it goes,
over and over and over.

1811
01:52:54,011 --> 01:52:56,981
You are the insatiable whore.

1812
01:52:57,014 --> 01:52:59,283
And you know, I'm beginning
to think that you like my dick

1813
01:52:59,317 --> 01:53:01,285
more than you like my money!

1814
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:05,223
Did you think that I came
to you for my pleasure?

1815
01:53:05,256 --> 01:53:08,326
- Uh-huh.
- [Nora scoffs]

1816
01:53:08,359 --> 01:53:12,830
Did you think that if I <i>only</i>
wanted to go to bed with a man,

1817
01:53:12,863 --> 01:53:15,233
I would have chosen an ugly

1818
01:53:15,266 --> 01:53:18,135
Windward Islander like you?

[both chuckle]

1820
01:53:19,705 --> 01:53:22,740
Did you think that
one dick isn't enough for me,

1821
01:53:22,773 --> 01:53:25,343
and that that was why
I needed your your dick,

1822
01:53:25,376 --> 01:53:28,145
your insignificant,
little dick?

1823
01:53:28,179 --> 01:53:29,581
Oh, no, Chamon.

1824
01:53:29,615 --> 01:53:32,750
I only needed one dick,
and no one else's.

1825
01:53:32,783 --> 01:53:35,319
And that is Bubu Fiel.

1826
01:53:35,353 --> 01:53:38,222
Do you know that in all this
time I've gone to bed with you,

1827
01:53:38,256 --> 01:53:40,057
I've never come, not once?

1828
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:41,392
Okay.

1829
01:53:41,425 --> 01:53:42,893
I've never had pleasure
with you.

1830
01:53:42,927 --> 01:53:44,195
Okay.

1831
01:53:44,228 --> 01:53:46,230
I never had pleasure
with anyone else,

1832
01:53:46,264 --> 01:53:49,934
but Bubu Fiel in my life.

1833
01:53:49,967 --> 01:53:52,437
You can't hold a candle
to him as a man.

1834
01:53:52,471 --> 01:53:54,839
And I wouldn't swap him
for another man,

1835
01:53:54,872 --> 01:53:56,608
not for a million guilders.

1836
01:53:56,642 --> 01:53:59,745
[scoffs]
And certainly not for you.

1837
01:53:59,777 --> 01:54:03,080
I thought we understood
each other.

1838
01:54:03,114 --> 01:54:06,217
But you're a dirty,
filthy slob.

1839

You're a bastard!

1840
01:54:07,552 --> 01:54:09,454
- You're a fucking liar.
- Hm.

1841
01:54:09,488 --> 01:54:12,089
And you're lying
because I know you loved it.

1842
01:54:12,123 --> 01:54:14,025
Never, never!

1843
01:54:14,058 --> 01:54:16,027
Never.
Not with you.

- Take it.

01:54:21,832 --> 01:54:22,800
- What?
- Here.

1848
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:24,235
What do you think I am?

You filthy Windwarder
piece of shit.

1850
01:54:26,772 --> 01:54:28,640
I will call Bubu,

1851
01:54:28,674 --> 01:54:31,942
and he'll kick that
filthy money up your ass!

1852
01:54:31,976 --> 01:54:34,278

Chamon, you were
insulting my wife, hmm?

1861
01:55:17,955 --> 01:55:20,625
What did you call my wife?

1862
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:22,461
- What did you call my wife?
- No.

1863

- No.

- What did you call my wife?
- No, no.

- Bubu, stop.

[Old Chamon]
I played a game once.

1910
01:59:31,141 --> 01:59:33,445
It was the most terrible game
I ever played.

1911
01:59:33,478 --> 01:59:35,412
It was an appalling game,

1912
01:59:35,447 --> 01:59:38,783
and we were under the most
severe stress imaginable.

1913
01:59:41,086 --> 01:59:42,687
And that game...

1914
01:59:45,724 --> 01:59:48,192
that game ended in tragedy.

1915

But no one, hear me,

1916
01:59:50,327 --> 01:59:52,797
no one was to blame.

1917
01:59:52,831 --> 01:59:55,033
How can nobody be to blame?

1918
01:59:56,735 --> 01:59:58,937
They all participated willingly.

1919
02:00:00,404 --> 02:00:02,073
Why didn't they stop the game?

1920
02:00:02,107 --> 02:00:04,743
Because that would not
have been possible.

1921
02:00:04,776 --> 02:00:08,446
The game... and the game
demanded an end.

1922
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,382
Whatever the consequences
of that entails...

1923
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:16,888
You know, if anything...

1924
02:00:19,024 --> 02:00:21,726
it was our poverty
that was to blame.

1925
02:00:24,663 --> 02:00:28,566
Do you think the players
deserved punishment?

1926

mete out punishment?

1969

<i>"And so he was," I said,</i>

1970
02:04:26,437 --> 02:04:28,907
<i>"but only for one day."</i>

1971
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:33,211
<i>And everyone still has a
relatively hard time of it here.</i>

1972
02:04:33,244 --> 02:04:35,480

1973

<i>based on the ideals
of the community</i>

1978
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:49,160
<i>with shared resources.</i>

1979
02:04:49,193 --> 02:04:51,829
<i>This system is the best
for our people</i>

1980
02:04:51,863 --> 02:04:54,232
<i>who deserve
their personal freedoms.</i>

1981
02:04:54,265 --> 02:04:57,101
<i>It would be something
of our own</i>

1982
02:04:57,135 --> 02:04:58,937
<i>for all of us.</i>
