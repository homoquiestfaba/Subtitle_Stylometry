She's at play rehearsal.

378
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:26,351
We have been so worried.

379
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,374

383
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,313
You've got to lie down.

384
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,450

Yes, it does.

464
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,489
It's one thing
for you to ruin my day,

465
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:01,492
but you can't screw up
the entire show for everyone.

475
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:26,449
that my theater teacher
would try to hurt me?

It doesn't matter
what I think.

477
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:29,378
It's just
a high school play.

478

This is not
just about the play.

479
