1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,639
<i>The amazing story I'm
about to tell you...</i>

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,764
<i>took place in the deepest and
darkest parts of Africa.</i>

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,804
<i>It is the tale of a young boy from
New York who lost everything...</i>

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,088
<i>to become the King of the Jungle.</i>

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,364
<i>But let's start at the beginning.</i>

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,003
<i>To be precise, 70 million
years earlier...</i>

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,683
<i>when the great dinosaurs
ruled the Earth.</i>

8
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,766
<i>An American named Greystoke set up
camp at the edge of the jungle.</i>

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,402
<i>He spent weeks in
search of the meteor,</i>

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,519
<i>while his family enjoyed
the wilderness.</i>

11
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,041
See, Kagira?
I told you he'd be back.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,247
<i>J.J.</i>

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,330
J.J., where are you?

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,209
Yeah, Mom?

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,319
Come on. Enough fun!
It's time to eat. Come on, J.J.

16
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,603
J.J.? Who's J.J.? My name's Tarzan!

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,239
Kagira gave me the name.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,842
It's ape language.
It means "ape with no fur".

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,846
That makes sense, little monkey.

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,687
Hey, guys! Wait for Tarzan!

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,001
<i>Greystoke was financing
the expedition...</i>

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,688
<i>and he had become pretty impatient.</i>

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,050
<i>Nothing. There's nothing here.</i>

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,168
Wow. That wall of fog again.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,969
My instruments are going haywire.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,487
Okay, that's it. Expedition's over.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,891
There's absolutely no sign of your
mysterious meteor here, Porter.

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,610
Great. Just great.

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,839
<i>They would probably
never find this meteor,</i>

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,039
<i>which according to
ancient folklore...</i>

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,609
<i>possesses limitless power and
is guarded by wild monkeys.</i>

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,006
<i>And who knows what other
amazing secrets...</i>

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,649
<i>may lay deep within
that mysterious rock.</i>

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,769
The power of the meteor is
supposed to be beyond imagination.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,243
John, we have to
continue our search.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,888
Jim, wake up.
It's just a local legend.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,681
We've searched every
square inch of this place.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,161
And the reports of the
19th century explorers?

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,721
Are the romantic fantasies
of treasure hunters.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,322
And this?

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,370
A lump of metal from a flea
market bin Kigali isn't proof.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,128
A word of advice between friends?

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,364
Take down your tent and come
back to New York with us.

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,599
You've got a beautiful wife waiting
there, and a lovely daughter.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,450
And they are real, Porter.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,607
If this meteor really
exists, it's not here.

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,447
Listen!

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,610
I'm Tarzan.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,090
When I come back, I'm gonna
be King of the Jungle!

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,283
Tarzan?

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,881
He made it up.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,726
Your son's got quite the
imagination. You know that?

53
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,720
Must get that from your
end of the gene pool.

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,206
Incorrigible dreamer, huh?

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,410
Is there any other reason why you've
dragged us to the end of the world?

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,889
Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,247
J.J., what...?

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,246
- You sure you want to stay?
- You still don't get it.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,371
- The jungle's my life.
- You take care.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,486
Kiss Jane for me!

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,006
John! Look! Down there.

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,208
A loner. A mountain gorilla
looking for a new family.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,130
Very, very dangerous.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,091
<i>You don't wanna mess with that guy.</i>

65
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,799
<i>By the giant waterfall,</i>

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,923
<i>which had carved a deep
gorge in the jungle...</i>

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,684
<i>one of the few remaining
families of mountain gorillas...</i>

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,684
<i>lived in peace and harmony.</i>

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,679
<i>But even their secluded hideaway...</i>

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,679
<i>could not protect them
from the angry loner...</i>

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,724
<i>and the hunt for a family
to take as his own.</i>

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,328
<i>And so the silverbacks
had to fight.</i>

73
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,888
<i>Look at all this volcanic activity!</i>

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,088
Wow! This wasn't here two days ago!

75
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,522
There's some kind of
magnetic interference.

76
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,807
What is this place?

77
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,651
<i>Get us outta here!</i>

78
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,851
<i>- We're gonna hit the wall!</i>
- I'll pull her up!

79
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,769
<i>Come on, come on.!
Hold on, everyone!</i>

80
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,244
My God. Porter was right.

81
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,208
Chris, land the bird.
I've gotta check this out.

82
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,969
- I'll be back in an hour.
- One hour.

83
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,240
It's getting late, okay?

84
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,606
This place is, I don't
know, it's creepy.

85
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,361
It's otherworldly, huh? Come on.

86
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,564
Hey, Tarzan, Kagira,
you're in charge.

87
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,129
- Say "bye", Kagira.
- Bye bye.

88
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,966
Kagira told me he had a
bad dream last night.

89
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,608
Oh no. Kagira, what did you dream?

90
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,604
You left him behind in the jungle.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,519
Oh, silly Kagira. We would
never leave you behind.

92
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,767
You promise?

93
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,841
I promise.

94
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,882
<i>Alice!</i>

95
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,961
<i>Alice! Alice, I found it!</i>

96
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,085
- John? What is it?
<i>- A cave.</i>

97
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,687
<i>A cave? Are you going in there?</i>

98
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,246
I have to.

99
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,207
I'll be back soon.

100
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,564
<i>And as John stepped into this most
inhospitable world cloaked in fog...</i>

101
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,239
<i>the guardian monkeys protecting
the meteor for eons...</i>

102
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,169
<i>became more and more agitated.</i>

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,247
<i>This secret, which had been
dormant for millions of years...</i>

104
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,649
<i>was about to be uncovered.</i>

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,962
John?

106
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,848
Can you hear me? Where are you?

107
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,491
We really have to leave.

108
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,961
<i>The ground shook,</i>

109
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,806
<i>and it seemed as if all the
elements were uniting...</i>

110
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,927
<i>to avenge the wound that John
had cut into the meteor.</i>

111
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,526
- John!
- Dad!

112
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,926
- What happened?
- Let's go!

113
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,127
What happened?

114
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,323
Get in there!

115
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,200
Something's pulling us down!

116
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,610
<i>And as the pilot battled
with the raging elements...</i>

117
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,731
<i>another heart-rending tragedy
took place nearby...</i>

118
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,809
<i>which would have momentous
consequences on things to come.</i>

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,567
You never should have ripped
that thing out of the rock.

120
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,722
You see that?

121
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,247
Forgive me.

122
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,645
Mommy!

123
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,683
<i>The next morning,
Nature had calmed down.</i>

124
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,970
<i>Karla, who had lost both
husband and baby...</i>

125
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,483
<i>wandered heartbroken
through the jungle...</i>

126
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,521
<i>when she came across
a strange object...</i>

127
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,320
<i>which had fallen from the
sky the night before.</i>

128
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,247
<i>Mommy...?</i>

129
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,042
<i>And as Karla miraculously
gained a new child overnight...</i>

130
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,647
<i>Tarzan found a caring hand to protect
him in the unforgiving wild.</i>

131
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,399
<i>Karla had decided to defend
her young by any means.</i>

132
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,889
<i>But from the start, Tarzan had become
a thorn in the side of Tublat...</i>

133
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,081
<i>the new evil leader of
the gorilla family.</i>

134
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,241
<i>- Something's pulling us down!
- What's pulling us down?</i>

135
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,486
<i>Mommy!</i>

136
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,406
<i>One... Two... Three...</i>

137
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,849
Ready or not, here I come!

138
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,165
Not again.

139
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,650
I know you're here somewhere!

140
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,966
Gotcha!

141
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,887
Wait for me!

142
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,519
<i>As time passed, the boy once
known as J.J. Greystoke...</i>

143
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,802
<i>had all but ceased to exist.</i>

144
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,528
<i>And in a world where the survival
of a young boy seemed impossible...</i>

145
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,684
<i>he sensed a ray of hope.</i>

146
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,964
<i>Now he really was Tarzan,
the ape without fur.</i>

147
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,883
<i>Oh, what a beautiful butterfly!</i>

148
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,371
Where's the gorillas?
This place blows.

149
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,340
Derek!

150
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,284
- Psycho.
- Beanpole.

151
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,962
Seriously, Dad, I don't know
how you do this every summer.

152
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,600
They pay well.

153
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,807
And I guess you
develop a few tricks.

154
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,487
Whoopsies.

155
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,530
Smile, everybody!

156
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,525
Well, here we are.

157
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,844
Welcome to Camp Porter.

158
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,164
This place is a dump!

159
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,323
<i>You got here just in time.</i>

160
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,082
<i>The gorillas are getting
tired of my jokes.</i>

161
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,927
I've never seen stars like this.

162
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,210
Just imagine, if you were a monkey,
you'd get to see this every night.

163
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,566
Makes you wonder which primate
got the better deal, huh?

164
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,131
Do you ever think
about coming home?

165
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,571
To New York?

166
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,523
Maybe trying things again with Mom?

167
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,882
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but this is my home.

168
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,246
It always was.

169
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,611
Well, in that case, I
have to come back.

170
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,884
Jane, my darling, nothing
would make me happier.

171
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,164
Don't stay up too late, sweetheart.

172
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,891
- We've got a big day tomorrow.
- Okay.

173
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,887
Who's there?

174
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,205
Oh! Hey. I was just out
here looking for birds.

175
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,766
- I think I'm just gonna go this way.
- I think that's a good idea.

176
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,362
Creep.

177
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,686
Now remember, everyone,
stay on the trail.

178
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,846
If you don't, we may
never find you again.

179
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,329
And more importantly, you
shouldn't make too much noise.

180
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,450
Unless you want to end
up on someone's menu.

181
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,122
Derek?

182
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,970
Derek, where are you?

183
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,842
Cool.

184
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,851
Listen to me, Derek.
This is very dangerous.

185
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,964
You're going to walk
towards me very slowly.

186
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,085
And whatever you do, don't run.

187
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,843
Derek!

188
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,769
Hey! Hey! Over here! Chase me!

189
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,800
It's okay, it's okay!

190
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,807
Who's there?

191
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,721
That's not good.

192
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,286
Oh, come on!

193
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,281
Oh, no!

194
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,082
Jane!

195
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,520
Jane!

196
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,248
Jane!

197
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,768
Jane!

198
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,646
Jane!

199
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,607
Who are you?

200
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,487
Jane?

201
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,442
Jane!

202
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,648
- Oh, Dad.
- You're here.

203
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,286
I'm not sure if he was a
boy or some kind of ape.

204
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,131
He had these long arms
and massive shoulders...

205
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,644
but the purest green eyes.

206
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,928
- Should I be concerned?
- Dad!

207
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,130
It's a jungle, not a pick-up bar.

208
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,481
Just asking.

209
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,201
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

210
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,604
It may sound weird, but in a way,
I've never felt safer in my life.

211
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,568
<i>These were just the fantasies of a little
girl growing up before her dad's eyes.</i>

212
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,959
<i>And she never dreamt that what she
encountered deep in the jungle...</i>

213
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,528
<i>- was the young Greystoke heir himself.</i>
- Bye.

214
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,727
Jane.

215
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,090
<i>It's ape language.
It means "Ape with no fur."</i>

216
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,687
Jane.

217
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,686
Tarzan.

218
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,606
Tarzan.

219
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,242
<i>- We would never leave you behind.
- You promise?</i>

220
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,130
<i>His friends tried everything
to make him feel better.</i>

221
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,321
<i>But nothing could fill the void
growing deep in Tarzan's heart.</i>

222
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,167
<i>And while Jane flew back
home to her mother...</i>

223
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,130
<i>Tarzan was tormented by a
thousand feelings and questions.</i>

224
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,559
<i>His world seemed to unravel...</i>

225
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,731
<i>as a longing arose in him that
he had never felt before.</i>

226
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,601
<i>Years passed.
Tarzan became stronger...</i>

227
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,926
<i>and reached farther than any
other creature in the jungle.</i>

228
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,488
<i>Mr. Clayton?</i>

229
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,279
<i>Two hours ago, our
communication center...</i>

230
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,642
<i>received a signal from
one of our helicopters.</i>

231
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,088
So?

232
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,366
It's Greystoke's.

233
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,287
Greystoke's?

234
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,571
After all these years. My God.

235
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
- The board's ready for you, sir.
- Thanks, Amy.

236
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,559
Mr. Clayton! If I could just
have a moment of your time...

237
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,762
I'm with the Society
for African Wildlife.

238
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,203
- Not again.
- Mr. Clayton!

239
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,839
Twenty years ago, John Greystoke
made a commitment to conservation.

240
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,204
All we're asking is a small grant,
less than 1% of your annual profits.

241
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,891
What did you say your name was?

242
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,842
Jane. Jane Porter.

243
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,361
I'll tell you what, Jane.
Can you stick around?

244
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,210
I've got a board meeting now.

245
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,840
Give me 30 minutes, okay?

246
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,924
- Great.
- Fine.

247
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,728
Seventy million years ago...

248
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,526
this planet was struck by
an extraterrestrial object.

249
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,925
But this was not just any meteor.

250
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,570
This was something else.

251
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,639
This was a new energy source
unlike anything we had ever seen.

252
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,639
We believe that the meteor is
buried in a mantle of cooled lava.

253
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,322
The technological
potential is limitless.

254
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,609
This was the treasure...

255
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,330
that John Greystoke spent his
life attempting to find.

256
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,531
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, we...

257
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,839
should follow in the footsteps
of John Greystoke himself

258
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,010
and blaze new paths in
energy production...

259
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,209
at profits...

260
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,765
he could never have dreamed of.

261
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,681
I'm certain...

262
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,243
that if we find Greystoke,
or what's left of him...

263
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,331
we'll find that meteor.

264
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,559
As you know, our competitors
are watching our every move.

265
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,879
Now, we need a cover. Some way
to get close to the crash...

266
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,686
without anyone knowing
why we're there.

267
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,447
I know a way.

268
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,967
Ah, Jane. There you are.

269
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,439
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

270
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,484
I'm so eager to find out
more about your foundation.

271
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,166
And how's your dad?

272
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,851
Hey! I want to take a
closer look at that gorge.

273
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,686
Hey! Darling!

274
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,571
I swear, you get more
beautiful every year!

275
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,483
So good to see you again, Daddy!

276
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,485
I missed you so much.

277
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,087
And you must be Mr. Clayton.

278
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,079
I can't tell you how much it
means to have your support.

279
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,169
Oh, well, don't thank me.
Thank Jane.

280
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,960
She wouldn't take
"no" for an answer.

281
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,367
Yes, and that's my
associate, Mr. Smith.

282
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,569
He's environmentally challenged.

283
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,919
Well, I'm gonna settle in.

284
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,487
Okay, darling.
Make yourself at home.

285
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,844
<i>So, this is your tent.
And watch out for the ants.</i>

286
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,328
<i>I forgot to tell you.
The ants bite.</i>

287
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,204
What with global warming,
logging, and regional conflict...

288
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,602
this eco-system has never
been more threatened.

289
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,641
I tell you, there's nothing more
frustrating than standing around

290
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,885
helplessly while the
jungle vanishes.

291
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,451
What he's trying to say is
thank you. Right, Dad?

292
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,281
Of course.

293
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,201
Goodnight, everyone.

294
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,480
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

295
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,445
I think I better turn in as well.

296
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,001
Monkeys.

297
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,450
What do you want, Clayton?

298
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,159
Excuse me?

299
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,567
Well, ever since you took
over Greystoke Energies,

300
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,410
you've ignored this place.

301
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,719
And then, all of a sudden,
after, what, fifteen years...

302
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,481
you decide to pop halfway across
the earth for an impromptu safari?

303
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,000
Please!

304
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,210
So what do you want?

305
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,842
The same thing that
John Greystoke wanted.

306
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,601
Did you ever consider there was a
reason why Greystoke perished?

307
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,364
That perhaps there are some things
that are not meant to be discovered.

308
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,244
Porter, you'd better
start calming down.

309
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,239
You've hit the
jackpot, haven't you?

310
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,479
Greystoke Energies is about to start
financing your ridiculous research...

311
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,207
into the "cradle of civilization" again.
You'd better cooperate.

312
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,846
That's a very pretty
daughter you've got there.

313
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,483
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to her, would we?

314
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,927
Who's there?

315
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,002
Jane.

316
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,007
You?

317
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,810
You're, you're real.

318
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,090
All these years, I wasn't
sure it actually happened.

319
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,442
<i>These mosquitoes.</i>

320
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,646
Wait! Don't go!

321
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,527
What are you doing?

322
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,371
- Don't sneak up on me like that.
- What is this?

323
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,929
Oh, really it's just...

324
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,039
for detecting a highly
radioactive meteor.

325
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,241
A what?

326
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,922
- There you are!
- You lied to me, Clayton!

327
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,089
You said you want to
support the foundation.

328
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,567
You said there were
no strings attached.

329
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,968
Oh, Jane.

330
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,760
Don't you know, there are
always strings attached.

331
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,366
Isn't that right, Porter?

332
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,561
Now I understand.

333
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,968
God, how could I be such an idiot?

334
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,522
You've been lying to me
the whole time, Dad!

335
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Jane, wait! That's not true! Jane!

336
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,959
I hope you're happy. Relax.

337
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,764
We all have to grow up sometime.

338
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,522
Jane!

339
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,967
Jane!

340
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,322
Jane!

341
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,529
Oh, no, no, no! Thank you.

342
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,247
Don't! Don't.

343
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,724
- Classy.
- Classy.

344
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,928
You can talk.

345
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,928
Talk.

346
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,366
What is your name?

347
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,282
Name?

348
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,167
Yes.

349
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,481
Name. What is your name?

350
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,964
Jane. My name is Jane.

351
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,208
My...

352
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,887
name...

353
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,767
Jane.

354
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,568
No.

355
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,281
My name is Jane.

356
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,488
What is your name?

357
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,401
Tarzan.

358
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,242
Tarzan.

359
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,927
Tarzan.

360
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,007
Tarzan.

361
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,688
Jane.

362
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,845
Me Tarzan.

363
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,844
- You Jane.
- Yes.

364
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,287
Me Tarzan, you Jane!
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

365
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,364
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

366
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,360
- Me Tarzan, you Jane!
- Jane.

367
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,450
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

368
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,443
Jane!

369
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,726
- Jane eat.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,246
Whoever you are,

371
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,322
whatever riddle is buried
inside you, Tarzan,

372
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,248
I feel like I've always known you.

373
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,561
- Do you have a name?
- Rafiki.

374
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,327
Watch over Tarzan
when Tarzan sleep.

375
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,968
For me?

376
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,805
It's beautiful.

377
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,722
My father has one just like it.

378
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,645
Where did you find it?

379
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,722
Smith, may I have the
coordinates, please?

380
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,011
It should be right here.

381
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,162
Jane?

382
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,924
Oh, my God! It's Jane!

383
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,368
Greystoke...?

384
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,120
- No, that's impossible.
- What did you say?

385
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,801
It is Jane. Some giant ape has her.

386
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,004
No, no! Don't shoot!

387
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,728
- You might hit Jane!
- Come on!

388
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,928
No! No! Don't shoot!

389
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,523
Come on!

390
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,639
<i>On the run from Clayton, they
entered a strange world...</i>

391
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,683
<i>never before seen by man.</i>

392
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,759
<i>A world which had been
under the influence...</i>

393
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,851
<i>of the meteor's mysterious
energy for millions of years.</i>

394
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,842
Thanks.

395
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,648
Tarzan!

396
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,771
We better get outta here.

397
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,321
This must be what my father and
Greystoke were looking for.

398
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,851
Greystoke...

399
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,370
You remember this place.

400
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,487
Of course!

401
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,089
You're the boy!
You're Greystoke's son!

402
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,246
But how were you able to
survive for all these years?

403
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,489
My family told me.

404
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,360
Your family?

405
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,527
Oh, hi.

406
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,810
Nice to meet you, too.

407
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,928
Tarzan, I have to go
back to the camp.

408
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,444
Jane is angry with Tarzan?

409
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,205
No, Tarzan. I'm not angry.

410
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,205
But my father will not
rest until he finds me.

411
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,689
And Clayton will kill you if he finds
out Greystoke's heir is alive.

412
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,359
As long as I'm here,
you and your family...

413
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,679
and this beautiful
paradise are in danger.

414
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,927
Tarzan strong!

415
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,930
Tarzan King of the Jungle!

416
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,886
I know, Tarzan.

417
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,568
But we can't fight Clayton's army.

418
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,648
Bring it in! This way!

419
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,409
<i>Meanwhile the camp had
undergone great changes...</i>

420
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,519
Keep going!

421
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,760
<i>As Clayton had made good on his threat
to find the meteor by any means.</i>

422
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,649
Hurry up, men!
We don't have all night!

423
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,130
I love you, Tarzan.

424
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,364
And I always will.

425
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,521
I have to go.

426
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,806
Our little runaway has
come back then, eh?

427
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,521
Hello. What have we here?

428
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,202
Don't!

429
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,930
Young Greystoke. Or do you
prefer "King of the Apes"?

430
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,648
The resemblance is uncanny.

431
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,564
Although you have a ways to go in
the wardrobe department, don't you?

432
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,007
You stay out of my way, savage.

433
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,201
The only savage here
is you, Clayton.

434
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,605
Mr. Greystoke, would you be so
kind as to bring us to the meteor?

435
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,687
Never.

436
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,329
Then unfortunately, we'll
have to go our separate ways.

437
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,208
No!

438
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,210
- Tarzan!
- Take her to her father.

439
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,528
Tarzan!

440
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,201
Jane!

441
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,731
Tarzan!

442
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,522
Just think...

443
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,359
the potential energy stored
in this one tiny piece...

444
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,801
could power the entire
East coast for a month.

445
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,084
Think what we could
do with a mountain.

446
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,289
I'll tell you what: you
take me to the meteor...

447
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,606
I'll set you both free.

448
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,519
Like hell I will!

449
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,726
Jane, your time with the monkey man
is starting to rub off on you.

450
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,928
Unfortunately,
he's managed to escape.

451
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,162
But Miller here and his friends are going
to follow the trail of your "ape"...

452
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,241
who obviously means
so much to you, Jane.

453
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,647
And he's going to take care
of both him and his gang.

454
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,810
I'll take you to the place.

455
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,443
But you won't need
to look for Tarzan.

456
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,646
He'll find you!

457
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,131
Look out! Incoming!

458
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,523
My grandma's quicker than you guys!

459
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,162
<i>Hook it up and let's
get out of here!</i>

460
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,803
<i>Start moving!</i>

461
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,083
Detonation in ten minutes!
Clear the blast zone!

462
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,722
What the...?

463
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,567
<i>Detonation in eight minutes.</i>

464
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,090
I knew there was a meteor.

465
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,808
Isn't it beautiful?
Like a gigantic diamond.

466
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,324
A mountain of unknown elements
from the depths of the universe!

467
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,568
A gift from outer space.

468
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,090
Dad, seriously, we'll be blown
to pieces in a few minutes.

469
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,682
We'd better find a way
to get out of here.

470
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,688
Of course. You're right, my love.

471
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,606
<i>Hello, love.</i>

472
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,690
I just want to say goodbye.

473
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,446
Don't touch me!

474
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,762
<i>Detonation in six minutes.</i>

475
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,728
Timing.

476
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,322
You don't know how
much I missed you!

477
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,768
- This is my dad.
- J.J.? I can't believe it's you!

478
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,566
- Look how big you've got!
- Boys!

479
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,844
When you're done here, can
we please stop Clayton?

480
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,281
Dad! Come on!

481
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,927
You go and I'll stay
here and cut the cables.

482
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,971
- I'm not leaving without you.
- It's our only chance.

483
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,407
Don't worry.

484
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,168
<i>Detonation in four minutes.</i>

485
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,481
Dad, hurry!

486
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,246
I'll be there in a minute!

487
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,088
<i>Detonation in two minutes.</i>

488
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,611
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

489
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,208
Do it.

490
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,928
No!

491
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,727
What happened?

492
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,809
You again. I should have known.

493
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,050
What's next, jungle boy?

494
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,805
Don't monkey with me.

495
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,849
Oh, my God! Dad's still down there!

496
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,285
Hurry! Come on!

497
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,649
Go! Go!

498
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,801
- Stay on them.
- Yeah.

499
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,570
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

500
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,162
Please!

501
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,086
Don't let me go!

502
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,122
Never.

503
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,961
They're getting away!

504
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,369
Let's go home, Tarzan.

505
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,484
Now Tarzan watch over Jane forever.

506
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,245
I know, Tarzan.

507
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,565
And if anyone threatens
this paradise again...

508
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,089
they'll have to deal with us.

509
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,682
Right, Rafiki?

510
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,559
<i>And as Tarzan, Jane,
and their friends...</i>

511
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,842
<i>celebrated their victory
over Clayton...</i>

512
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,799
<i>Tarzan found the one
thing more powerful...</i>

513
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,128
<i>than all the energy
in the universe...</i>

514
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,684
<i>the love of a woman.</i>

515
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,007
<i>As for Porter, he's a
scientist and adventurer.</i>

516
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,045
<i>But what kind of adventurer...</i>

517
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,807
<i>would let a simple
old rock defeat him?</i>
