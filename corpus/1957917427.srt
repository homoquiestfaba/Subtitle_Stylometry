know, get yourself off anyway.

172
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,929
Or, I'm just throwing
this out there,

173
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:12,667
you can have two hours
of amazing, vivacious,

174
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,604
sort of hauntingly
erotic conversation.

175
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,471
- Hauntingly erotic?
- Hauntingly erotic?

176
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,174
And you can go home anyway.

177
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,977
You know, get yourself off,
like, flick your little bean.

178
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,812
- Oh?
- Yeah.

179
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,957
And you don't have to wake up
next to 30 Seconds To Mars.

180
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,183
All right, well, I've got
a proposition for you.

181
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,052
How about you give me
back my fucking whiskey

182
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:34,789
and stop talking about me
flicking at my fucking bean?

183
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:35,923
- Okay.
- How about that?

184
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,658
Have you confirmed with him?

185
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,493
No, I have not given him a time.

186
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,072
Poor guy. It's kind of
sad. He's probably at home

187
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:45,066
scrolling through your
social media, fingers sweaty,

188
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,102
hand firmly on cock, just...

189
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,870
beating that meat,
waiting for your text

190
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,173
to pop up at the top.

191
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,941
Mm. I've blown off
twice already, so.

192
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,509
- Third time's a charm.
- Yeah.

193
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,112
Come on, get a drink
with your old pal Robbie.

194
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,282
It's my long time
employee Robbie.

195
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,718
- That's a little bit harsh.
- It's true. I own you.

196
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,162
- You own me?
- You're on my payroll. Yeah.

197
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,154
Mama. Okay. Okay. Okay.

198
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:10,291
I'm going to change your mind.
Have you heard his music?

199
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,227
- I have not bothered, no.
- Oh, that answers a lot.

200
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,862
Why? What you got?

201
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,206
ROBBIE: I'll show you
something Something fun.

202
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,665
TORI: Hmm.

203
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,633
All right. Ready?

204
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,702
I'm losing interest
already. Come on.

205
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,037
Alright, you'll see.

206
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,548
Hang on, hang on, hang
on, hang on, hang on.

207
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,108
What?

208
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,111
- Oh, my God.
- Soothing.

Why is he whisper singing?

210
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,290
ROBBIE: Doesn't want to
wake his parents, probably.

211
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,715
What the fuck? Turn that off.

212
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,250
Why are you showing
that to me? Stop.

213
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,928
Well, you know, it's not like
you're going to saddle up

214
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,796
with the son of a bitch. I
mean, you should probably

215
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,857
let the guy go back to
his family and his kids.

216
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,258
He's a daddy, after all.

217
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,760
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

218
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,929
Little Tommy Tinder.

219
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,731
Well...

220
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,177
All right. Let's
go get shit faced.

221
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,936
But you're not getting
anything either.

222
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,614
So if you want to go
flick your fucking bean,

223
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,806
do what you need to do.

224
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,341
- Come on.
- All right.

225
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,985
- Turn off the music.
- Well, considering you were

226
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,353
gonna saddle up with
old Emmett Eyeliner,

227
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,112
I'm not sure how I
should feel about that.

228
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,990
Well, I don't work with
them Emmett Eyeliner, do I?

229
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,658
Well, I am better looking in
that douche, though, right?

230
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,017
Do you want to fucking die?

231
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,762
Get your fucking grubby
shoes off the counter.

232
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:15,056
Kill the music before
I change my mind.

233
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,267
- Should I meet you there or?
- No, We're going to walk.

234
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,829
- Well, it's fucking snowing out.
- Oh, my God. That's so scary!

235
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,798
Come on. Get those
chicken legs out.

236
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,900
Let's go for a walk. I got
to bring this to Lahna.

237
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,878
ROBBIE: Why? They close at 6:00.
They're not going to be open.

238
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,336
No, they'll still be there.

239
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,372
They're having a little
Christmas Eve Fuckfest.

240
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,973
What the hell, Why?

241
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,718
TORI: You don't want
to fuck in a toy store?

242
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,877
No. Well, mm, maybe. I mean...

243
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,388
Sounds like you don't want
to fuck in a toy store.

244
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,748
It's just kind of weird.
Like, I feel sorry for the kid

245
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,726
that's going to go in tomorrow,
buy a teddy bear covered

246
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,151
- in fucking cum.
- Oh, my God.

247
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,920
We're going to scar
him. That poor child.

248
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,289
Come on. Lock up behind you.

249
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,664
ROBBIE: We could
have taken my car.

250
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,998
Would have been a smart option.

251
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you want to keep
keep complaining?

252
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,702
Or do you want to
just walk in silence?

253
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,146
- What do you want to do?
- You're the one who was

254
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,172
complaining all day about
fucking Christmas this,

255
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,650
Christmas that, oh, I
fucking hate Christmas.

256
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,275
Well, Christmas fucking sucks.

257
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,845
Do you not agree that there's
no good fucking Christmas music,

258
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,114
- no good Christmas movies.
- Bad Religion had

259
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,258
- a great Christmas album.
- Just fucking get it over with.

260
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,184
- Eh.
- It was good.

261
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,087
There aren't many albums
that give me that spirit

262
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,422
of fucking Christmas.

263
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,257
Well, Bad fuckin'
Religion, ain't it, buddy.

264
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,925
Give me that.

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,764
I would go as far to say
there's like fucking two...

266
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,666
Two Christmas songs
that are good,

267
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,137
and that's if you don't count,
if and only if, you don't count

268
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,172
fucking Crypt Keeper
"Christmas Rap."

269
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,740
Okay, love "Tales
From the Crypt."

270
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,742
That song sucks the
fucking shit out of my ass.

271
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,312
This is coming from a guy
who jizzes his fucking pants

272
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:49,450
every single time he hears
Buster Poindexter's cover of

273
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,418
"Zat You, Santa Claus?"

274
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,330
ROBBIE: No, no, no, no, no,
no. I don't like that cover.

275
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,955
I like the version
with the commentary

276
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,824
from Beavis and Butthead.

277
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,993
- Okay.
- Okay.

278
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,728
"Merry Christmas",
Ramones, then.

279
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,997
That's mine. What's your
big fucking runner up?

280
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,035
Uh, sorry to say, but
"Merry Christmas", Ramones,

281
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,837
that's a fucking runner up.

282
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,005
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

283
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,273
- First place...
- Fuck you.

284
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:13,941
First place is our
lord and savior Lemmy

00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,177
with "Run Rudolph
Run." Oh, it's magic!

286
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,888
ROBBIE: Okay. It's not
like it's Motorhead.

287
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,322
It's Lemmy with the
fucking Foo Fighters.

288
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,482
- Oh, R.I.P.
- Oh, R.I.P.

289
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,884
Also Lemmy is fucking
Motorhead, you idiot.

He's in the back, freshening up.

gets a little musty.

- You got a lot going on.
- Musty she says.

all about that, right?

You already cracked this open.

We may have had, like,
like a couple of drinks.
