00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,109
Man: I can't remember
if I had my first drink

3
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,372
to celebrate
my good fortune

4
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,114
or to grieve my losses.

5
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,857
I figure if I sit here
long enough, I'll remember.

6
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,252
How can a guy who has nothing
lose everything?

7
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:22,212
Well, I found out.

8
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:27,130
My name's Fritz brown,
and this is my story.

9
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,400
It all started about
a month and a half ago.

10
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,751
I had been working
as a repo man for bud Myers,

11
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:43,146
biggest used-car dealer
in southern California.

12
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,496
The whole day
just started out all wrong.

13
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,282
I mean, wrong
as in bad, you know?

14
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,502
[Laughs] Oh, shit.

15
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,078
Whoo!

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,167
Man: Hey, motherfucker!

17
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,168
Ho ho ho.

18
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:05,951
No, man, no.

19
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:08,128
Anybody moves my car--

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,180
You want
a dependable deal?

21
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:20,488
You get on down
to bud Myers.

22
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:24,187
Say hello, barko.

23
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,189
Come on, barko,
bark for daddy.

24
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,018
Fritz: I met bud Myers
back when I was still a cop.

25
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,629
And when I drank my way
off the force,

26
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:34,415
bud was right there
with the repo gig.

27
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,285
It saved my ass.

28
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,896
Hey, Fritz,
how's that look?

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,159
Oh, it looked great.

30
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,073
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

31
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,075
What a fucking
work of art!

32
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:46,688
We ought to hire
that fucker to redo
all our waiting rooms.

33
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,211
[Laughs]
You like it,
huh?

34
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,865
"Dragon wagon."

35
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,215
You want
a drink, Fritz?

36
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,131
Yeah, give me
a regular coke.

37
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,524
Oh, that's right,
I forgot.

38
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,526
You're not
drinking this week.

39
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,223
Bud, you are
something else.

40
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,007
After all the money
that dog's made for you,

41
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,054
and you're
still feeding him
that dried shit?

42
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,577
You are one cheap fuck.

43
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,666
He likes it.
It's good for his teeth.

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,537
What teeth?

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,407
He's got no teeth.

46
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,192
Then I must
be a cheap fuck.

47
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,845
You said it, not me.

48
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,152
[Laughs]

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:21,418
Hey, some son of a bitch
burned solly k's down
to the ground last night.

50
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,028
Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,205
Yeah, I heard
about that.

52
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,249
Too bad.

53
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,033
One of your
hangouts, right?

54
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,167
Sure, it's a great place
to take...Your wife.

55
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,256
What are you
talking about?

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,172
I thought she
divorced your ass.

57
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,391
What do I owe ya?

58
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,741
Fritz: I never did
more than one repo a day.

59
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:43,832
Bud paid me so well,
I didn't have to.

60
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,486
So to keep
from going insane,

61
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,836
I opened the brown's
detective agency.

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,448
I had a little office
out in rancho park
where I spent my days

63
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,276
waiting for
a knock on the door

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,326
and, unfortunately,
on this particular day, came.

65
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,719
I worked 6 years
as a cop in Hollywood,

66
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,026
where you get
all the crazies.

67
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,375
And let me tell you,

68
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,030
nothing that I'd seen or did
could have prepared me

69
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,206
for what
was about to happen.

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,121
I'd thought
a little p.I. Work

71
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,123
would keep my mind
off drinking.

72
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,169
Well, that was
my first mistake.

73
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,214
[Knock on door]

74
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,912
Just a minute.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,656
[Knock on door]

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,398
Hey, hey,
just a minute.

77
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,443
Can I help you?

78
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:32,489
Probably, if
you're p.I. Fritz brown.

79
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,360
I am.

80
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,013
Uh, so what
happened to you?

81
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,059
You lose a golf ball
or something?

82
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,844
A gol--[Laughs]

83
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,586
No, there's never
been a golf ball
that I couldn't find.

84
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,416
Ha ha. Can I come in?
Ha ha ha ha.

85
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,462
I'm Freddie baker.
You got the same
initials as me.

86
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,028
You can call me
fat dog, though.

87
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,553
Don't worry.
That's not an insult.
Everyone calls me that.

88
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,032
I like it.

89
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,731
All right,
uh, fat dog,

90
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,995
my fee is 500 bucks
a day, plus any
and all expenses,

91
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,258
and I get paid
up front in full.

92
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,259
Can you handle it?

93
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,956
I may not look
like no millionaire,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,175
but I'm holding heavy,
trust me.

95
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,307
I'll whip
some bread out on you

96
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,221
as soon as I tell you
what it is I want.

97
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:13,051
All right. Shoot.

98
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,052
Um...

99
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,532
All right,
I got this, uh, sister,

100
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,578
my--my kid sister Jane.

101
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,579
And, um...

102
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,798
She's the only
family I got.

103
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,626
And, uh,
for a long time now,

104
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,281
she's been living
with this rich old
Jewish guy, right?

105
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,414
And he don't want her
to have nothing to do
with me.

106
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,415
Yeah.
Right?

107
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,459
And he pays
for her piano lessons.

108
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,939
And now Janie,
my own kid sister,

109
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,551
shines me on like
I'm a piece of shit.

110
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,075
That sucks.

111
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,949
Your sister,
is she over 18?

112
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,125
Well, she's 17,
but I wasn't looking
for no morals rap.

113
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,736
It's just, you know,
this guy's been
fucking around somehow,

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,172
and I want to get
to the bottom of it.

115
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,392
So you tail the Jew
around town,
see what he's into--

116
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,133
oh, and I need--
I need pictures.

117
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,482
You got a camera, right?

118
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,005
If necessary,

119
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,181
I have an undercover
photographer that
I work with, yeah.

120
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,096
Undercover. That's good.

121
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,315
Do you mind?

122
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,405
So are you going
to help the fat dog or what?

123
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,365
Well, I'll tell you,

124
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:09,107
if your story,
uh, checks out...

125
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,935
I'll give it a week.

126
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,589
But first,
I got to find out

127
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,332
a little bit
more information
on your sister.

128
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,901
Her name is, uh,
Jane baker.

129
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:20,771
17?
Right.

130
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,469
Got any pictures
of her?

131
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,384
Yeah.

132
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,521
That's her.

133
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,481
You can't keep that.
I need that.

134
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,961
Don't worry.
You'll get it back.

135
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:40,443
I see the little, uh,
resemblance there.

136
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,879
So, um,

137
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,446
why don't you tell me
a little bit more
about this--

138
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,926
this bad guy
of yours, ok?

139
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,493
His name
is sol kupferman,

140
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,930
and, uh...

141
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,149
He lives--he lives
just north of sunset

142
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,021
near the Beverly Hills
hotel.

143
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:54,022
And it's, uh,

144
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,286
the address
is 8914 elevado.

145
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,461
E-l-e-v--

146
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,462
I can spell.

147
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,291
Just, uh, describe
the guy, ok?

148
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,988
I don't know.
He's, uh...

149
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,991
65, skinny,
salt-and-pepper hair,

150
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,732
big nose.
Typical heeb.

151
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,038
You get the picture.

152
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,170
I heard a lot of stuff
about solly k.

153
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:15,347
All bad stuff,
but all rumors.

154
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,566
Solly k?

155
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,264
As in solly k's that
burned down last night?

156
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,963
One and the same asshole.

157
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,661
Any idea on the fire?

158
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:25,923
He has a lot of enemies.

159
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,577
I told you, the guy's
into a lot of evil shit.

160
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,492
That Jew bastard
made her hate me!

161
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:30,754
All right, all right.

162
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:34,497
You, uh,
you simmer down,
fat dog, and, uh...

163
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,065
I'll tell you
what you do.

164
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,632
You hang loose and
come back and see me

165
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,024
when you get a little
cash in your pocket,

166
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,852
and I'll see what
I can do about this--

167
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:42,679
you--you
want some cash?

168
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:43,854
You want
a down payment?

169
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:46,770
Here, I'll give it
to you right now.

170
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,380
Fritz: A lifetime in L.A.
had taught me

171
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,992
never to take anything
at face value

172
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,036
except for money.

173
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,603
Fat dog's a good
judge of character.

174
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,171
You're ok.
Here you go.

175
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,000
You're a caddy?
Yeah.

176
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,785
[Laughs]

177
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,091
Well,
I'll tell you what.

178
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,527
What's that?

179
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,225
I'm giving up
this job of mine
and becoming a caddy.

180
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,532
[Both laugh]

181
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,143
Hey, hey, hey,
hold on a minute.

182
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,536
Uh, you got
a phone number?

183
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,755
You know,
I move around a lot.

184
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,147
You can reach me
at the rustic inn.

185
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,062
That's a beer bar down
on Santa Monica and sawtelle.

186
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,151
I'll get
the message there.

187
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,502
Fine.

188
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,898
Fritz:
I ignored my first warning.

189
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,206
This case stunk
right from the start.

190
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:38,039
My confrontation with
brother leotis' bat this morning

191
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,823
left a bad taste
in my mouth.

192
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,391
Man, was I tired
of that shit.

193
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:47,048
Solly k and his love nest
sounded like a nice
little diversion,

194
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:51,182
and it looked like I was gonna
make some cash on the deal.

195
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,663
The house
was just off coldwater.

196
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,491
It was
a cute little bungalow,

197
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,016
and the his and hers
rolls royces
were fire engine red.

198
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,499
At least I wouldn't have
any problem following 'em
around town.

199
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,418
At exactly high noon,

200
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:13,857
sleepy but hot-looking
Jane baker came out
of the house.

201
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,993
My lucky day.

202
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:22,170
Solly k would have
to wait his turn.

203
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,302
I went with the girl.

204
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:31,048
Now at this point,
nothing really seemed
out of the ordinary,

205
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,965
except for maybe the fact
that this 17-year-old girl

206
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,141
was driving around
in this amazing car,

207
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,970
and she could barely see
over the steering wheel,

208
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,799
but considering
where we were,

209
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,801
that's not such a big deal

210
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:48,370
and not so uncommon.

211
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,733
[Piano playing]

212
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,731
I don't like people
watching me play.

213
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,516
Oh, sorry, I...

214
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,778
I wasn't watching you play.

215
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,128
I--i was just--well,
yeah, I was watching you,

216
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:54,566
but I, uh, I was really
looking for my teacher.

217
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,960
Why don't I believe you?

218
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:01,051
Well, that's, uh,
probably just your upbringing,

219
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,010
you know,
never talk to strangers.

220
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,666
That certainly
wasn't my upbringing.

221
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,104
So you play the piano?

222
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,367
Uh, yeah...

223
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,850
Sit. Let me hear you.

224
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:17,938
Oh, no, no.

225
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,897
No, I don't--
I don't play the piano.

226
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,160
Well, not--
no, no, not well.

227
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:27,164
I-i-I'm just
starting my lessons today.

228
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,037
How did you become
interested in music?

229
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,343
Uh, that's a long story.

230
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,693
You don't wanna--
you don't wanna hear that.

231
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,303
I--i should
probably just go.

232
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,263
Look who's afraid to
talk to strangers now.

233
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:44,399
Oh...ok,
if you want to hear.

234
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:48,272
Sure, I'll tell you.

235
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:49,230
[Clears throat]

236
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:51,145
Um, I was 21, uh,

237
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:55,976
my mama just died,
and I was working, uh...

238
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,151
Uh, part-time
as a gardener,

239
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:02,025
living off her, uh,
insurance money, um...

240
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,073
Anyway, I, uh,
had this job in Pasadena

241
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,335
trimming
a little shrubbery there,

242
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:10,555
and I heard this music
coming from the house.

243
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,296
Uh, thunderous
powerful stuff.

244
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,733
It was pretty amazing.

245
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,125
It was, uh,
Beethoven's <i>eroica.</i>

246
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,912
Yeah, I mean, uh,
knocked me flat on my ass,

247
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,871
and, uh, and, uh,
well, I've never, uh,

248
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,656
I've never been able
to get enough of it since.

249
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,919
So what happened?

250
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,530
Why'd it
take you this long
to take a lesson?

251
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:34,144
Uh, well, um,
I became a cop.

252
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,581
So you're a cop?

253
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,063
[Laughs]
Well, I <i>was</i>a cop,
and I was a cop before,

254
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:45,242
but, you know,
that's, um, that's another
long, nonsensical story.

255
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,156
You don't want--

256
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,115
and I have
to practice, so...

257
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,291
You'll have
to save your story
for another time.

258
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,597
Yeah, I'll
look forward to it.

259
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,168
Fritz: I was never
any good at this stuff.

260
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,388
You see, it's not supposed
to go this way.

261
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,694
When you're
following someone,

262
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:07,134
well, they're
not supposed to catch you.

263
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,183
That night, I went back
to kupferman's mansion.

264
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,621
I had decided
to get a closer look
at mister solly k

265
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,058
and hopefully sneak a peek

266
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,931
at the young and lovely
Jane baker while I was at it.

267
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:58,315
[Muffled voices]

268
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,067
Ha ha ha ha.

269
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,026
Hey, listen...

270
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,549
Just come on,
baby. Come on.

271
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,812
We'll watch
a little TV
tonight, huh?

272
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,858
[Dog growls]

273
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,598
[Woof woof woof]

274
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,823
Fritz: A private eye needs
to be prepared for anything.

275
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:32,306
So I stopped off
on my way home

276
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,482
and bought a can of mace.

277
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,923
The dog didn't deter me.

278
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,664
The next morning,
I followed solly k

279
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,492
to a liquor store
down on crenshaw.

280
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,625
Not where you'd expect
the Beverly Hills crowd
to shop for their booze,

281
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:54,545
but I guess one bottle
of dom perignon tastes
as good as the next.

282
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,679
It was the rainy season,

283
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:00,421
not the ideal weather
to be driving around
in a convertible

284
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:01,335
with the top down,

285
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:04,904
but it was kinda fun
sometimes.

286
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,086
Fat dog wanted pictures,

287
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,349
so I figured
I'd take a couple of shots

288
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:19,048
just so he thought he's
getting his money's worth.

289
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,150
The 2 bags of booze
in his trunk,

290
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,457
I followed solly k
out of L.A.

291
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,328
And out of the rain.

292
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,200
I couldn't imagine
why this old guy

293
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:43,029
was driving all the way
out here.

294
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,814
But what did it matter?

295
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:49,949
It wasn't like I had
anything in particular
to do that day.

296
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,924
Finally, after 2 hours,
he stopped at
a little gas mart.

297
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,971
What happened next
made fat dog's story

298
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,235
start to make
a little more sense.

299
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,463
Haywood cathcart,

300
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,118
head of internal affairs.

301
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,296
The man who made an example
of me and my drinking

302
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,168
was accepting
2 grocery bags.

303
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:39,346
It probably had nothing
at all to do with booze.

304
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,046
Although I'm sure Haywood liked
the sauce as much as I did,

305
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,526
but he was just a little bit

306
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,573
more careful about it
than me, that's all.

307
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:55,144
I became his poster boy for
the new clean and sober l.A.P.D.

308
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:59,366
He pointed out my demise
as progress. I hated the guy,

309
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,368
and I had been waiting
all this time

310
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,153
for the chance
to pay him back.

311
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,113
Now fate had brought US
back together again

312
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:11,508
in the form of a caddy
named fat dog baker.

313
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:31,354
I had always believed
I didn't need anybody's
help staying sober.

314
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:34,270
I'd gone to a couple
of a.A. Meetings,

315
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,098
but it just wasn't my thing.

316
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,058
Sitting around with a bunch
of weak, pathetic alcoholics

317
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,103
didn't make
any real sense to me.

318
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,149
I went for my cousin
Walter's sake.

319
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:47,892
He was family, and I thought
that's what he needed.

320
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:52,114
[Whispering]
Get me outta here.
You're late, Fritz.

321
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:55,509
[Whispering] I know.
I'm on a case.

322
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,119
No way.

323
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,555
Yeah.

324
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,905
Who--who would hire you?

325
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,124
It's a long story.

326
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,995
Tell you all about it
later on tonight, ok?

327
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,042
Well, I guess that means
we're not going to lunch, huh?

328
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,046
Yeah, uh, sorry
about that, huh?

329
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,701
Here, here, here.

330
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,704
A little
lunch money.

331
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,055
That's a lot more
than lunch money.

332
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,711
Yeah, well,
it's a test, Walt.

333
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,149
You're never gonna
get better unless
you test yourself.

334
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,759
Hmm?

335
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,719
Can you do it?

336
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:35,157
We'll see about that
later, won't we?

337
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,724
Fritz: The rustic inn.

338
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,988
Must've been
the only bar in L.A.
I'd never had a drink in,

339
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:44,340
and if I had,
I didn't remember it.

340
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,564
What a dump.

341
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,133
It figured fat dog
would do his drinking here.

342
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:58,789
Get me a double bushmill
straight up with coke back.

343
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm looking
for fat dog baker.

344
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,409
He told me I could
get a line on him here.

345
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,239
I ain't seen fat dog
in a week or so.

346
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,163
[Clears throat]

347
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:28,297
Of course, if you'd
like to leave a message...

348
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:35,174
I'll see that he gets it
as soon as he comes in.

349
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,306
How about any
of these other guys?

350
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,655
7 bucks.

351
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:42,616
They know fat dog,
where I could
find him?

352
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,273
Augie?!

353
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,057
What can you do
for him?

354
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,886
He loops with fat dog
kinda semi-regular.

355
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,279
Why don't you
go ask him?

356
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:57,674
Maybe he knows, but you
need to buy him a pitcher.

357
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,154
He likes coors.

358
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,590
Of course.

359
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,944
[Sighs]

360
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,686
[Clears throat]

361
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,562
Yeah. Ahem.

362
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,564
Ok, thanks.

363
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,262
Augie dougal?

364
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,220
How ya doin'?

365
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,786
I'm a friend
of fat dog baker's.

366
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,136
You mind
if I talk to you
for a few minutes?

367
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,181
You're not a cop,
are ya?

368
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,966
Cops are always
lookin' for fat dog.

369
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,446
No, no, no.

370
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,231
I'm not a cop.

371
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,233
You look kinda like one.

372
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,756
Well, uh...

373
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,541
Yeah, well, I was, but
I've traded in my badge

374
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:40,151
for a set of golf clubs.

375
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:43,198
Yeah, the fat dog's
gonna teach me the game.

376
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,199
Oh.

377
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,374
There ya go.

378
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:48,464
Well, you picked yourself
a good teacher.

379
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,640
Nobody knows golf
like fat dog.

380
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:55,950
Nobody can read the Greens
as well as he can, either.

381
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,474
You put the putt
where he tells ya,

382
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,997
tch, whammo.

383
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,998
It's in the cup.

384
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,217
In the cup?
Every time.

385
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,787
In the cup.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
That's good.

386
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,528
Yeah.
Sure thing.

387
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:11,052
Top that off for ya.

388
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,054
There ya go.

389
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:17,798
Listen, um,
here's the deal, augie.

390
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,669
I got this big game
tomorrow,

391
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:22,150
and it's kind of
important that I, uh,

392
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,413
talk to fat dog tonight.

393
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,939
Do you happen to know
where he could be?

394
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,467
Well, he's been loopin'
the bel air lately,

395
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,994
uh, sleepin' on this hill
out there by eighth hole--

396
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,474
wait, wait, wait.

397
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:42,910
Go back a second.

398
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,608
You're tellin' me
that he's sleepin'
outside?

399
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:50,091
Fat dog, he don't
like sleepin' indoors.

400
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,093
Says it's bad for him.

401
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:55,009
He has bad dreams.

402
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,619
I see.

403
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:58,665
What would be
the best way

404
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,494
I could find him
tonight?

405
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:06,847
Well, there's a gate
just off of sunset.

406
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,110
It's near
the girls' school,

407
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:14,028
and there's this
big statue of Jesus there.

408
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:17,118
Fritz:
I neared the entrance augie
dougal was talking about.

409
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,947
Jesus stood guard
over the student parking lot

410
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,210
at marymont school
for girls.

411
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:27,694
I waited for a while
and got lucky.

412
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,091
Hey, fat dog!

413
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,789
Got a visitor out here!

414
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:38,139
Who's that?
Friend or foe?

415
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,881
It's Fritz brown, man.
I gotta talk to ya.

416
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,057
Oh, Fritz! What's up, buddy?

417
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,145
Hey, the private eye guy.

418
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,929
You got some good shit
for the fat dog?

419
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,844
Well, I don't know
about that,

420
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:49,063
but I checked it
all out,

421
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,499
and I have
to agree with you.

422
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,894
I think solly k
is doing something
with your sister.

423
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,809
I mean, uh,
if it was my sister,

424
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,245
I don't know
what I'd do, but...

425
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,333
Don't you see
what he's doing?

426
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,204
He's fuckin' her,
the son of a bitch!

427
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,163
No, i--i
didn't see that.

428
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,251
I mean,
I don't know.

429
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:04,426
You don't know that
for sure, do you?

430
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,819
Oh, the fuckin' hell
I don't.

431
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,298
Man, listen, y-you gotta
look after janey, all right?

432
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,083
Please, just make sure
nothin' happens to her.

433
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,085
They're followin' me.

434
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,392
Who's following you?

435
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:17,047
N-No, no, no,
there's nobody <i>following</i>me.

436
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,614
There's no one
literally following me.

437
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:22,575
No, you just told me
that somebody's
following you.

438
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,185
No, there's no one--
there's no one following me.

439
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,144
There's no--there's nobody
following me, all right?

440
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,233
Fine. Nobody's
following you.

441
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,105
Is it cathcart?

442
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,846
What do you know
about cathcart?

443
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,458
Well, solly
met with him today.

444
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:37,894
That fuckin' Jew.

445
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:38,852
I told him to stop,
you know?

446
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,201
I--i got money, too,
you know?

447
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,811
The fat dog's
got lots of money.

448
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,770
I-I'll give you
whatever you want, ok?

449
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,075
You just gotta
look after janey,

450
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,208
make sure nothin' happens
to my sister, please.

451
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,644
What does
Haywood cathcart

452
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:49,819

with any of this?

453
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,474
I told ya, solly's
into a lot of evil shit.

454
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,736
Cathcart's
as evil as they come.

455
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,044
I'll give you $10,000
to look after janey,

456
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,611

happens, all right?

457
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:02,005
What makes you think

458
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,226
Don't ya understand?
$10,000 for one week!

459
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,575
Do you want the money
or not?

460
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,013
Sure. Yeah,
I'll take your money,

461
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,537
but it's like
I told you before--

462
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,061
I get paid in full
up front.

463
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,062
That means tonight.

464
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,237
Tonight. I can
give you the money.

465
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,369
We gotta take a ride
for the cash, though.

466
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,458
Right now?

467
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,371
Yeah.

468
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:23,070
Ok. Where to?
Venice.

469
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,161
Put the fuckin' top up.
I'm freezin'.

470
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,163
No, I like
the top down.

471
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,120
It's raining,
you know.

472
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,079
Oh, yeah.
That's why it's down.

473
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,428
I'm in a t-shirt.

474
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,649
Yeah, you sleep outside,
I drive with my top down.

475
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,564
[Chuckles]

476
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,480
So tell me your story,
fat dog.

477
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,047
Uh, I mean, I was a cop
for 6 years, man,

478
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,092
and I tell you what:

479
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,095
I never met anybody
as queer as you.

480
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,357
[Chuckles]

481
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,098
What can I say?
I'm the king
of the caddies.

482
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,361
The greatest fuckin'
looper that ever
packed a bag.

483
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:57,321
I know every course
in this town like
the back of my hand.

484
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,106
Looks like hard work.

485
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,500
Those bags ever
get too heavy for ya?

486
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,457
Naw, naw, naw,

487
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,502
not unless you're
loopin', like,

488
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,894
hillview
or brentwood.

489
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,680
Those kikes like
to pack their bags
full of cement.

490
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,943
I mean,
they'll throw you
some extra cash.

491
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,597
It's just,
you know, they like
to feel superior

492
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,598
while they're
torturing you.

493
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,077
You ever caddy
for kupferman?

494
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,384
No, no, no.
He's got a coon
packing his bags.

495
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,734
Those Jews
and niggers are
like soul brothers.

496
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,170
All right,
all right, all right.

497
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:21,215
Just can it, ok?

498
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,783
I like Jews,
and I like blacks, too.

499
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,568
I grew up watching <i>
soul</i>train, you know.

500
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:27,656
Oh, yeah.

501
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,920
They had some hot babes
on that show.

502
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:35,925
So tell me, why do you
sleep outside, man?

503
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,452
You dig pussy?

504
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,151
Sure.

505
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,456
You ever wanted a girl

506
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,893
that could
give you everything
you ever wanted,

507
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,330
you didn't have
to worry about?

508
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:53,900
You didn't have to worry
about this chick
fuckin' other guys or--

509
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,032
her body is perfect,
you know?

510
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,731
Just like the one you've
always dreamed about,

511
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:00,602
and she's even nice
to be around

512
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,343
after ya fucked her.

513
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,041
That's how I feel
about golf courses.

514
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,217
They're just fuckin'...

515
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,133

a few minutes?

874
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:27,153
Yeah.

875
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:29,851
You don't mind,
do you?

876
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:33,115
Go ahead.
Finish up.

877
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:34,726
So are you vice?

878
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:37,380
No. Why do you ask?

879
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,252
Well, I always
thought of fat dog

880
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:42,864
as sort of some kind
of pervert, you know?

881
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:43,822
Yeah?

882
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,215
He used to be
the golf ball king

883
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:47,129
of all L.A.

884
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,696
He used to have
3 hotel rooms.

885
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,873
Nothing but golf balls
in all 3 rooms.

886
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:52,874
[Both laugh]

887
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,702
Then he'd go sleep
on the fifth tee

888
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:55,747
at Wilshire.

889
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,965
I mean, anybody
that does that

890
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,619
has got
to be a pervert,
you agree with me?

891
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,752
I agree with you.
Yeah.

892
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,014
Listen, Stan.

893
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:03,711
I need you to take me
out to bel air tonight.

894
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:06,018
Hmm? Fat dog's out there.

895
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,454
He sleeps out there
these days,

896
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:10,022
and I gotta talk to him.

897
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:18,030
Hop in the car.

898
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,379
Ok.

899
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:20,989
Stan: Well,
fat dog's not here.

900
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,643
Let's get the hell
out of here.

901
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:23,818
Fritz: Well,
what about the back 9?

902
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:26,038
Heh. Forget
about the back 9.

903
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,387
He hates the back 9.

904
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,781
The toughest 9 holes
I've ever packed.

905
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,956
Buggy as shit.

906
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:31,913
Buggy, huh?

907
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:34,089
Stan, uh, tell me
what you know

908
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,830
about
a Richard ralston.

909
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:36,918
Richard ralston?

910
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,094
Yeah, yeah.
Richard ralston.

911
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:40,226
You know the guy?

912
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:44,534
He's the meanest
human being I ever met.

913
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:47,146
[Sighs]

914
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,278
Smells nice around here,
don't it?

915
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,933
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.

916
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,195
It's peaceful.

917
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,153
You know,

918
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,067
I tell you,

919
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,590
it's gotta
be a tough job

920
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,983
doing what you do.

921
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,638
A tough way
to make a living.

922
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,858
Yeah.

923
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,556
Looping wouldn't
be such a bummer

924
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,516
if it wasn't for the guys
who were looping.

925
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,083
Hmm.

926
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,217
I gotta tell you
something.

927
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:18,743
Um, i'm, uh,
not really a cop.

928
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:22,094
No, i'm--i'm
a private investigator.

929
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:25,097
You son of a bitch.
I--you--i--

930
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,055
I knew there was something
funny about you.

931
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,622
Oh, I'm sorry.
I knew it.

932
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,059
I blew it.
I'm sorry, man.

933
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,974
You know, you can
hit me if you want.

934
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:35,107
But I shanghaied you
out here

935
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,152
all illegally and...

936
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,241
Sorry about that.

937
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:43,115
So how come you're
looking for fat dog?

938
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,203
Oh, he just hired me

939
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,031
to do a little work
for him.

940
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:47,075
That's all.

941
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,209
But mostly, I, uh,
I repossess cars.

942
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:52,907
[Laughing]

943
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,998
Now that's funny.

944
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,565
That's funny.
Yeah?

945
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,959
I used to steal cars.

946
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,482
No shit.

947
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:03,483
Did 18 months for it.

948
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,485
It's a hard habit to kick.

949
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:07,008
[Laughs]

950
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:09,141
Oh, I tell you,
that's, uh--

951
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,839
when you think about it,
that's about all I do.

952
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:14,015
Except they
don't send me to jail.

953
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:17,105
That sounds like
a hell of a good job.

954
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,280
Yeah?
Yeah.

955
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:22,154
Well, you know, it--
it has its good days.

956
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:25,244
I'll tell you what.

957
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,682
Why don't you
give it a try, huh?

958
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,684
Let me give you
one of my cards.

959
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,642
And, uh...

960
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,514
There you go.

961
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:36,690
Give me a call.

962
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,388
You might get
a kick out of it.

963
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,392
Fritz: Wally!
Come on out!

964
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:44,654
[Knocking]

965
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:47,701
Fritz: I stopped by
my cousin Walter's place.

966
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,181
I hadn't seen him
in a couple of days,

967
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:51,009
and I was wondering
how much of that 50 bucks

968
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,532
he had gone through.

969
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:53,838
Wake up, baby.

970
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,144
Wally, where you at?!

971
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:59,060
Hey, if you're
screwing with me again,

972
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:01,410
I'm gonna kick your ass!

973
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:03,804
Come on!
Where are you at?

974
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,197
[Walter coughing]

975
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,981
Got you!

976
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,113
Hey, man!

977
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:09,201
Oh, hey, buddy.

978
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:10,202
Hey, hey!

979
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:11,899
You're dead meat.
I got you.

980
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,293
You little bitch.

981
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:16,382
Oh, man.

982
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:19,037
Oh, you're bad.

983
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,907
Come on, come on.

984
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:20,995
They were
looking for you.

985
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:23,432
I got you. Come on.

987
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,825
I had to run away.

988
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,958
Come on.
Get up, baby, get up.

989
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,524
I don't
want to get up.

990
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,222
[Grunts]

991
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:31,832
Oh, I had to run away.

992
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,878
Ok, here,
put this on.

993
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,967
Oh, man,
I don't feel so good.

994
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:36,881
Hold on.

995
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:38,143
I haven't had
a drink all day.

996
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:40,232
What are you
talking about, man?

997
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:42,843
Do it yourself.
It's all right.

998
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:44,453
They looked like leger.
Ok.

999
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,847
Leger. Leger.

1000
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:48,240
French cubist.

1001
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:49,589
What'd they look like?
Tell me--

1002
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:52,679
so what would I be doing
with a dead French cubist?

1003
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:53,854
What did they look like?

1004
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:55,203
I didn't see too well.

1005
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,074
It's ok. Tell me
what they looked like.

1006
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,510
It was dark.
It was dark.

1007
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:58,380
I couldn't see, man.

1008
00:46:58,424 --> 00:46:59,251
But when
they got mad,

1009
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:01,340
they were
speaking Spanish.

1010
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:03,733
Fritz: Look...

1011
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:06,171
I know what you want
and I know what you need.

1012
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:09,174
What you want
and what you need

1013
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:12,003
are 2 different things.

1014
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:16,616
I know
what I need, Fritz.

1015
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:21,142
And it's not a doctor.

1016
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:24,493
No.

1017
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:25,625
Unless...

1018
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:26,452
No.

1019
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,409
She's, uh...

1020
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:29,020
She's a, you know...

1021
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,891
Uh-uh.
Ain't happening.

1022
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,546
You know the last time
I dipped my wick

1023
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:37,202
was August 19, 1993?

1024
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:40,596
It's embarrassing.

1025
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,990
Help me out.

1026
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,862
Help me out.

1027
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,822
Yeah. Drink it.

1028
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,216
Yeah, it was
that cop groupie

1029
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:53,783
you set me up with.

1030
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:57,004
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.
I remember that.

1031
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:59,093
I almost lost my job
on that one.

1032
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:00,573
Oh, she was something.

1033
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:02,967
She was something.
I know.

1034
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,142
God.

1035
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:07,145
Fritz, I'm lonely, man.

1036
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,624
Help me out, will you?

1037
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:11,192
Just do this for me.

1038
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,760
Ok. Ok, fine.

1039
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:14,935
You're gonna--

1040
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:15,980
ah--

1041
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:16,981
done, ok?

1042
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,199
But ain't nobody
gonna do anything

1043
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:20,114
unless you
take a bath first.

1044
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:21,028
Oh, hey.

1045
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:22,116
Is that ok?

1046
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,987
Yeah. You're a pal.

1047
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,162
Ok. Hop on.

1048
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:25,728
I know a gal that'll
take good care of you

1049
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,817
for a couple of days
at least.

1050
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,123
Great big tits?

1051
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,560
What, are you picky now?

1052
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:32,779
Yeah, yeah.

1053
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:33,954
She's got big melons.
Don't worry about it.

1054
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,173
And you know what else?

1055
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:36,696
She's gonna like you, man.

1056
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:39,003
She's gonna dig you
a lot because you're
an intellectual.

1057
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,048
She likes
the intellectual type.

1058
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:42,006
Very good.

1059
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,964
Raw tin, Fritz.

1060
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:46,010
Raw tin.
That's his last--

1061
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:48,186
ralston. Yeah, I know.

1062
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:50,666
Don't worry.

1063
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,155
Fritz:
The guy with Jane baker

1064
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,158
looked kind of like
an ex-ball player.

1065
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:06,204
Richard ralston.

1066
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:08,554
Had to be.

1067
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:11,992
What a gentleman.

1068
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,342
Everything started
coming together

1069
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,649
in a way
I still didn't understand.

1070
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:18,999
All I knew was...

1071
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,000
Richard!

1072
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:22,568
I had to keep going.

1073
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:32,882
Fritz:
I followed Richard ralston

1074
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,972
into the hillview
country club.

1075
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,148
I told them at the gate
that I was there

1076
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:40,368
to meet solly kupferman
for a quick 9.

1077
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:43,241
They believed me.

1078
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:03,174
Ralston: Fat dog got himself
in some big trouble.

1079
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,915
He fucked with
the wrong people.

1080
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,396
You're probably not gonna
see him again, augie,

1081
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,876
not ever.

1082
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:11,399
Augie:
What did he do, rod?

1083
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:15,403
Now, this is a real
heavyweight scene, augie.

1084
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:17,579
Heavy-duty shit.

1085
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:20,191
I mean, heavy-duty.

1086
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:21,453
Did he tell you about it?

1087
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:24,499
No, he didn't tell me
no heavy-duty shit, rod.

1088
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:27,459
Just looping
and racetrack stuff.

1089
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,373
Honest!

1090
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,287
Are you sure
about that, augie?

1091
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,767
I'm sure.
Honest, rod, honest.

1092
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,422
Fat dog ripped off
a ledger, augie.

1093
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:37,121
I <i>need</i>that ledger.

1094
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:40,994
Now, you know fat dog's
rich, don't you, augie?

1095
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,779
Loaded. Heavy bread.

1096
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,303
And guess what?

1097
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,000
It's rightfully mine.

1098
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,915
I <i>want...</i>

1099
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,308
That money.

1100
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:53,137
What do you know
about that, augie, huh?

1101
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,750
I don't know where
he keeps his money, rod,

1102
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:01,493
and I never saw
no ledger.

1103
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,931
Ok, augie.

1104
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:07,542
One more thing.
Then I'll let you go.

1105
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:11,459
I got a juicy 9-holer
waiting for you.

1106
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:15,115
Where do you think
the fat dog is, augie?

1107
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,334
T.j.

1108
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,075
Gotta be, rod.

1109
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,207
He--he--he's been
talking about racing dogs,

1110
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:25,082
and I ain't
seen him in 2 days.

1111
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,262
You are
a good man, augie.

1112
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:34,265
And a good caddy.

1113
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,269
Fritz: "Hot rod" ralston.

1114
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:41,098
Oh, he was gonna
get his due, all right.

1115
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,316
Yes, he was.

1116
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,318
But he'd have
to wait his turn.

1117
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:48,105
I needed to find
the fat dog.

1118
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,282
After a little
poking around,

1119
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:54,981
I discovered
that Tijuana had
its own country club.

1120
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,330
It's a giant patch of green

1121
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:58,158
in an otherwise
brown landscape.

1122
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,681
I thought maybe
I could get a lead

1123
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,683
on the king
of caddies there.

1124
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,163
<i> No reembolso.</i>

1125
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,164
No--
no refund.

1126
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,601
English?
You speak English?

1127
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:07,733
Yeah.
Yeah?

1128
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,474
Well, I just need
a little information.

1129
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:12,041
I'm looking
for this caddy.

1130
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,217
American guy.
Big.

1131
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,697
6'2".
285-300 pounds.

1132
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,698
Wears dirty
golf clothes--

1133
00:52:16,742 --> 00:52:18,744
yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know the guy.

1134
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:20,093
I know the guy.

1135
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,008
He laid
some golf balls on me
a couple days ago.

1136
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,141
Do you know where
I could find him?

1137
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,751
Nah.
He's just a bum.

1138
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:26,882
Fly-by-night.

1139
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,493
Well, did
he talk to you
about anything

1140
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:30,625
other
than golf balls?

1141
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:32,627
Yeah.

1142
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:34,890
As matter of fact,
he wanted to know

1143
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:36,414
where he could buy
some racing dogs.

1144
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:37,676
I thought he was
just shittin' me.

1145
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,112
He didn't
look like he had
the kind of money

1146
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,070
to be buying
no racing dogs.

1147
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:42,942
Then he pulls
out a roll.

1148
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:44,683
A couple of grand.

1149
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:46,075
I'm like, "fuck me!"

1150
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:46,989
You know, the <i>vato's</i>
got this kind of money

1151
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,382
and he's selling
golf balls?

1152
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:49,992
He's crazy.
He's got something

1153
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:51,211
in his head wrong,
you know?

1154
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,343
So you sent him
to the dog track?

1155
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:53,605
Hell, no!

1156
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:54,910
I sent him
to <i>primo Armando's</i>house.

1157
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,782
He's got a litter
of greyhound pups, man.

1158
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,349
Beautiful.
Why, you interested?

1159
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,611
Uh, no, no, no.

1160
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:02,701
How do I find
your <i>primo Armando</i>guy?

1161
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,444
Who are you, man?

1162
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:09,186
Look, I'm a good guy.
I just want the retard

1163
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,798
that sold you
the golf balls,
that's all.

1164
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:17,629
Fritz: I went
with my newfound friend

1165
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:21,937
way the hell out
in the middle of nowhere.

1166
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,201
After 2 hours of driving,

1167
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,594
I wasn't sure
what to expect.

1168
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:31,033
By now, though,
I was ready for anything.

what's your name again?

1173
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,222
Buto.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.Mr. Buto.

1175
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:51,315
Mr. Smart buto, huh?

1176
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:54,143
My cousin says
that, uh...

1177
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,363
You're trying to find
that fat <i>gringo</i>

1178
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,930
I sold 2 dogs to.

1179
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:00,149
That's right.

1180
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:03,022
It's gonna
cost you $200.

[Chuckles]

1182
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:07,113
All right, no problem.
Where is he?

1183
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,157
I'll tell you
where he is

1184
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:09,594
when you show me
the money.

1185
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:12,423
It's coming.
It's coming.

1186
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:14,120

your shorts on.

00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,996
So, where is he?

1190
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,260
You gonna
fuck him up, <i>gringo?</i>

1191
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,219
Maybe.
Maybe not.

1192
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,090
Where's he at?

1193
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:29,091
Fritz: I'd had enough.

1194
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:31,529
I was about ready
to blow it all,

1195
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:32,878
but I held it in

1196
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:35,359
and let the Mexicans play
their mind game with me.

1197
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:40,059
That fat <i>gringo</i>deserves
everything he gets.

1198
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:42,061
I got a feeling
about him.

1199

about you, too, <i>

So, I want to tell you.

You take that blue thing
up that road towards town,

1202
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,420
look for the blue church.

1203
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,814
You'll find him.

1205
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,007
Fritz: Something was up.

1206
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,531
I could smell it.

Fritz: The same stench
that lingered in the yard

1210
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:19,550
doubled as I came
through the door.

1212
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:27,427

And the one man
I thought could answer
all my questions.

1216
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,233
The shack was empty,

1217

but fat dog
never slept inside.

01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,815
If that's all you got,

1581
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:13,645
if that's all
you have to tell me,

1582
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,169
why don't you
just leave?

1583
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,605
Hmm?

1584
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:19,085
I'll tell you
what I'll do.

1585
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:21,435
I'll get
the door for ya.

1586
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:27,746
Ladies?

1587
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:33,839
[Chuckles]

1588
01:18:37,887 --> 01:18:40,193
You watch
your step, brown.

1589
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:43,066
I'm personally
keeping my eye on you.

1590
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:46,722
You have no idea
how excited
that makes me.

1591
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,990
Fritz: It was
on the bottom of page one.

1592
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:54,947
Not much,

1593
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,775
but the address
of George Hansen

1594
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:59,169
might be worth something.

1595
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,060
[Doorbell buzzes]

1596
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,110
Yes?

1597
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:28,285
Are you Mrs. Hansen?

1598
01:19:28,328 --> 01:19:29,503
Are you
from the police?

1599
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:31,070
Because they told me
I could wait
a few days

1600
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:32,768
before making
my statement.

1601
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:34,030
No, no, no.

1602
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:35,596
My name is brown.
I'm a private investigator.

1603
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,903
I'm here
looking into the murders

1604
01:19:37,947 --> 01:19:38,991
here in palm Springs

1605
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:41,037
and a couple
other related things,

1606
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,996
and I thought maybe
you might, uh,

1607
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,519
talk to me
just for a few minutes.

1608
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,174
Do you mind?
All right.
Come on in.

1609
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:49,872
Thank you.

1610
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:54,050
I'll try
to make this brief.

1611
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:58,228
I believe that the death
of your husband
and his 2 friends

1612
01:19:58,271 --> 01:20:00,230
can be traced
directly back

1613
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:02,014
to a Richard ralston

1614
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:05,278
and a Frederick
"fat dog" baker.

1615
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:08,847
You know these 2 men?

1616
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:13,286
Um, George has been
doing business with...

1617
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,550
Fred if you can
call it that.

1618
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:18,291
They have, um,

1619
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:19,466
thousands of golf balls

1620
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,905
at some tacky
motel room
in Los Angeles.

1621
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:26,256
Do you know who might
have the key now?

1622
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:30,173
Well, I've got it
here somewhere.

1623
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:33,045
You can have it
if I can find it.

1624
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:38,050
I've really had enough
of golf balls

1625
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:40,139
and golf bums.

1626
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,012
Oh, here it is.

1627
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:47,146
You know, I've been
sober now for, um...

1628
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,321
3 years.

1629
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:52,195
I've got
a higher power
in my life, so...

1630
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:53,892
Here.

1631
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:54,893
Take 'em.

1632
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,199
Thank you.

1633
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:57,722
How do you know
Richard ralston?

1634
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:01,160
George and I
have been friends
with dick ralston

1635
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:02,509
for years.

1636
01:21:02,553 --> 01:21:06,165
They used to
play minor league
baseball together

1637
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:08,907
when they
were teenagers.

1638
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:11,301
As a matter of fact,
he got, um...

1639
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:14,043
George started
as a caddy,

1640
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:17,046
and, um,

1641
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:19,222
George and I
were foster parents

1642
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:21,920
to Freddy baker and
his little sister

1643
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:24,967
when they were
just children.

1644
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,185
You were foster parents

1645
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:29,014
to fat dog baker
and his sister Jane?

1646
01:21:29,058 --> 01:21:30,581
Yes.

1647
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,235
When was this?

1648
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,716
1984.

1649
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:38,676
How did that, uh,

1650
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:39,764
come about anyway?

1651
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:44,160
A friend I knew
arranged it.

1652
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:47,815
He was
a wonderful man,

1653
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:48,729
an old friend,

1654
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:51,515
and he knew
that George and I

1655
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:54,387
wanted children
very badly and...

1656
01:21:54,431 --> 01:21:56,041
Couldn't have any.

1657
01:21:56,085 --> 01:21:58,391
He paid US really well

1658
01:21:58,435 --> 01:22:02,004
for taking care
of those children.

1659
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:05,181
I loved them so much.

1660
01:22:05,224 --> 01:22:07,009
They were just...

1661
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:09,054
Little orphans.

1662
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:11,970
Your, uh, friend,

1663
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:14,146
could you
tell me his name?

1664
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,975
Sol, sol kupferman.

1665
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,759
Kupferman.

1666
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:20,631
I see.

1667
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:24,113
Fritz: Back in L.A.,

1668
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:27,203
my next stop
was at the hall of records.

1669
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:28,465
Theory had been forming

1670
01:22:28,508 --> 01:22:31,729
in the dark corner
of my brain.

1671
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,339
Clerk: Kupferman.

1672
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:07,243
Send him
out to the car.

1673
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:15,947
Come on out
to the back in here.

1674
01:23:18,906 --> 01:23:20,256
[Sighs]

1675
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:26,697
[Chuckles]

1676
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,655
Well, Mr. Brown.

1677
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:31,354
We finally meet
face to face, huh?

1678
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:35,140
Are you about to tell me
what it is you want?

1679
01:23:37,316 --> 01:23:38,839
What are you
gonna give me?

1680
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:41,712
I'm about to honor
any requests.

1681
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:43,453
[Laughs]

1682
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:46,891
The great solly k
is gonna give me,
Fritz brown,

1683
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:49,024
whatever he wants.

1684
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,329
Real white of you.

1685
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:54,464
I know fat dog hired you
to keep an eye on Jane,

1686
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:56,553
but he attempted
to kill me.

1687
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,294
Why would he
want to do that?

1688
01:23:58,337 --> 01:23:59,773
Why would he
want to kill you?

1689
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:03,299
Well, I
don't think he liked
the fact that i--

1690
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:04,300
[chuckles]

1691
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:07,085
That Jane was
living in my house.

1692
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:09,740
I can't imagine why.

1693
01:24:09,783 --> 01:24:10,654
Oh.

1694
01:24:10,697 --> 01:24:13,396
He was unusually
close to Jane.

1695
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,571
Well, I would say

1696
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,790
that you're unusually
close to Jane,

1697
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:18,357
don't you think?

1698
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,796
Yes, well,
Jane and I are, uh--

1699
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,189
are what?

1700
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:26,017
Lovers?

1701
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,062
Look, Mr. Brown,
I don't think

1702
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:29,151
any of this
really concerns you.

1703
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:32,806
Call me Fritz, ok?

1704
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,373
And don't kid yourself.

1705
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,114
I'm very concerned here.

1706
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:37,507
You see, I don't think

1707
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:41,815
little girls
should be sleeping
with their daddies.

1708
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,644
Look, Mr. Brown, uh--

1709
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:46,168
Fritz.

1710
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,865
Jane and I are not--

1711
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:50,433
be careful
what you tell me.

1712
01:24:50,476 --> 01:24:53,305
Your whole way of life
depends on it.

1713
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:56,178
Now, the way I see it,

1714
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,136
cathcart's
blackmailing you.

1715
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,270
He nailed fat dog for
the club utopia firebombing,

1716
01:25:01,313 --> 01:25:04,055
and you didn't want your
little boy going to jail,

1717
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,884
nor did you want
to be killed by him either,

1718
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:11,106
and while
cathcart knows how
to control little Freddy,

1719
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:12,107
or should I say,

1720
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,675
knew how to control
little Freddy.

1721
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,768
What do you want, Fritz?

1722
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,161
I don't know.

1723
01:25:23,205 --> 01:25:24,119
Little revenge.

1724
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:25,076
[Laughs]

1725
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,687
Does that make me
a bad person?

1726
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:29,211
Look, it's
not that simple.

1727
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:30,821
Cathcart--

1728
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:32,997
he's--he's
too protected.

1729
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,434
He's beyond the law.

1730
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:37,654
Cathcart--

1731
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:38,959
cathcart is the law.

1732
01:25:39,003 --> 01:25:40,918
Let me worry
about cathcart.

1733
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:42,833
You just tell Jane
to pack her bags

1734
01:25:42,876 --> 01:25:44,574
and get the hell
out of there.

1735
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:45,792
Give her
whatever she wants.

1736
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:47,794
Tell her whatever
you want to tell her.

1737
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:49,622
Send her off
to a real music school,

1738
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:53,148
but just get her
the hell out of that house.

1739
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,324
Well, what if she
doesn't want to leave?

1740
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:56,412
Well, then,

1741
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:58,022
I'll just
have to tell her

1742
01:25:58,065 --> 01:25:59,676
her real last name.

1743
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:02,157
Don't mess with me.

1744
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,901
Stay out
of my way...

1745
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:11,166
And nobody will ever
find out what a...

1746
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:17,868
Sick, old,
disgusting pervert
you really are.

1747
01:26:17,911 --> 01:26:18,782
Oh, yeah.

1748
01:26:18,825 --> 01:26:22,220
I know everything.

1749
01:26:22,264 --> 01:26:24,527
Get out
of my sight...

1750
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:27,965
Before I blow
your guts all
over this counter.

1751
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:39,803
Fritz:
I bought a throwaway gun,

1752
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:41,892
untraceable,

1753
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:44,242
with a silencer.

1754
01:26:44,286 --> 01:26:46,201
It'll do the job.

1755
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:50,117
P.A.: Announcing
the arrival of bus number 12

1756
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:52,990
