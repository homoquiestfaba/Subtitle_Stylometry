1
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,398
Whoo!

2
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:04,364
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

3
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,166
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."
Pathetic.

4
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:11,299
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

5
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,605
Nicole.

6
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,542
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

7
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,711
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,391
Whoo-hoo!

9
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,992
I love it out here.

10
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,977
The Big Dipper.
It's my favorite.

11
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,640
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:53,444
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:00,455
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,924
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,992
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,940
I want you to feel this!

17
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,682
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,013
Daniel, are you OK?

19
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,816
Oh, my God.

20
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,828
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

21
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:30,841
Number Three's dead.

22
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,850
You all right?

23
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:38,719
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

24
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:23,265
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

25
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,857
All right, let's go.

26
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,838
Daniel.

27
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:11,779
<i>This is the part
I hate the most, the running.</i>

28
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,083
<i>But it's the only thing
in my life that's real.</i>

29
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,952
<i>The rest is a lie.</i>

30
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,183
<i>Even Henri.</i>

31
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:21,157
<i>People think he's my father.</i>

32
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,820
<i>He's not.</i>

33
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:27,424
<i>He's a warrior from my planet,
assigned to keep me alive.</i>

34
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,963
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

35
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:34,166
<i>All he left for me
was some kind of box.</i>

36
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,971
<i>Henri says he'll pass it on to me
when the time is right.</i>

37
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,772
<i>I got my first scar
when I was nine years old,</i>

38
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:45,340
<i>near the border of Mexico.</i>

39
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,182
<i>It woke me from my sleep.</i>

40
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,247
<i>It was the first sign that the
Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.</i>

41
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,027
<i>The second scar
came when I was 12.</i>

42
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,393
<i>I was in Colorado,
in the middle of a spelling bee.</i>

43
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,597
<i>As soon as I felt it,
I knew Number Two was dead.</i>

44
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,600
<i>Last night, I got my third scar.</i>

45
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:15,213
<i>I was just a kid when the Mogadorians
invaded my planet, Lorien.</i>

46
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,716
<i>Nine of us children escaped.</i>

47
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>We were gifted, meant to protect
our people when we grew up.</i>

48
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,953
<i>We never got the chance.
Everyone was killed.</i>

49
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,060
<i>We are the last of our kind.</i>

50
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,361
<i>Three of us are gone. Dead.</i>

51
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,632
<i>They are hunting us down,
one by one, in order.</i>

52
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,235
<i>I know I'm next.</i>

53
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,408
<i>I am Number Four.</i>

54
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,775
All right, well, so...

55
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,746
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

56
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,282
OK. You, too.

57
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,651
Your new ID.

58
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,926
And this time, you stay out of sight,
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

59
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,951
John Smith. Very original.

60
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,191
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

61
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,197
This time was different.

62
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,229
I didn't just get a scar.

63
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,867
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

64
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,608
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

65
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,215
- The others.
- We should get moving.

66
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,914
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

67
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:34,023
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

68
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,856
It's Bernie Kosar.

69
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,300
Played football.

70
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:55,168
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Hm. Good to know.

71
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,973
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

72
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,440
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

73
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:36,109
Ooh. Hang on.
I need a new picture.

74
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,909
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

75
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,287
Say "Paradise."

76
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,387
Oh, shit.

77
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,626
This is why
I need you to be invisible.

78
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,190
Get back inside.

79
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:28,501
John.

80
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,098
Come on. Come back inside.

81
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,812
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

82
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,020
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

83
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,185
He doesn't
have any collar or tags.

84
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,821
Hm. Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

85
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,231
Come on.

86
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,997
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

87
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:06,038
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.
- Talk to me.

88
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,343
Yeah, keep the dog.

89
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,812
What are you gonna call him?

90
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:16,151
How about Bernie Kosar?

91
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,111
What are you doing up?

92
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,776
I changed my mind.

93
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:58,684
About what?

94
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,817
Look, uh, as much fun
as you are to be around,

95
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,918
I can't be a prisoner.
Uh, I have to go to school.

96
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:06,987
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

97
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:09,588
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

98
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,157
- Didn't save him.
- Mm-mm.

99
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,796
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

100
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,339
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

101
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,567
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

102
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,839
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

103
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:23,506
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

104
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,251
Hm. Do you have a...?

105
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:29,912
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

106
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:32,617
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

107
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,180
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

108
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,159
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

109
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:40,389
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, OK?

110
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,359
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

111
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,029
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

112
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:51,302
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

113
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:53,366
And I'll be your teacher.

114
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,875
Fine.

115
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:59,849
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

116
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,294
I know how to blend in.

117
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,374
OK, doll. Take a seat.

118
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,878
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

119
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,377
I know she's
the star photographer,

120
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,318
but it's not fair
to the other students.

121
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,015
She's using up all the vital supplies.

122
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:40,888
Emory, come on. "Strangers in
Paradise." At least she's creative.

123
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,450
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

124
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:47,020
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

125
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:49,464
Keep the photos?
They're already all over the Internet!

126
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,900
It's a violation to post things like
this without people's permission.

127
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,267
You have to do something about this.

128
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,773
Mr. Behrman,
excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

129
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:07,750
Sarah, this is not like you.

130
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:10,220
Is there something going on?

131
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:13,156
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

132
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:16,215
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

133
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:20,395
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

134
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:24,233
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

135
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,297
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

136
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:32,469
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

137
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:36,172
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

138
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:37,942
OK.

139
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,711
Here's your schedule.

140
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:46,953
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

141
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:52,793
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

142
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:57,327
<i>Job fair starts tomorrow.
Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.</i>

143
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,496
What kind of camera do you use?

144
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,773
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

145
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,435
- Check it out.
- What?

146
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,612
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

147
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:12,840
It's kind of hard not to hear.

148
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:18,352
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

149
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:21,817
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

150
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:24,489
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

151
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:29,560
Good luck... um...

152
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,432
Oh, uh, John...

153
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,564
...Smith.

154
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,640
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

155
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:39,701
That's fine.

156
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:50,054
That's really my name.
John Smith.

157
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,859
What's up, man? You new?

158
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:07,736
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

159
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,535
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

160
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:11,542
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

161
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,547
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

162
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:15,912
Play any ball out there?

163
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:18,542
- Football?
- Yeah.

164
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:21,179
- No.
- Play anything?

165
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,382
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

166
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,889
Nope.

167
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,521
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

168
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,531
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

169
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:35,864
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

170
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:38,928
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

171
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:43,499
Good talking to you, big guy.

172
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,541
Look who it is.

173
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:47,773
Watch out, man.

174
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,438
Sorry, Sam.

175
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:53,453
Loser!

176
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:57,116
Wait up, fool.

177
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,452
Thanks.

178
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,819
Gotta love the classics.

179
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:04,659
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

180
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,724
Just get better with time, don't they?

181
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:12,261
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

182
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:14,797
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

183
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:21,534
So, she was like, "The solar system's
sun does not revolve around the Earth."

184
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,543
I said, "Yeah, right."

185
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,846
Hey, Spock!

186
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,678
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

187
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:33,050
That had to hurt.

188
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,849
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

189
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:36,082
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

190
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,625
- Oh, Mommy's coming!
- Oh...

191
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,225
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you OK?

192
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:47,198
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

193
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,979
Jesus!

194
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm fine! Get off me.

195
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:02,979
Come on, man!

196
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,008
- You OK?
- No.

197
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,418
That's quite an arm
you got there.

198
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,326
Yeah. Who knew?

199
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,697
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

200
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,799
I know it's your first day and all,

201
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:24,464
but, uh, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

202
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,666
Figure what out?

203
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,276
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

204
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,126
Invisible.

205
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,138
You heard me
when I said that, right?

206
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:34,269
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

207
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:23,191
<i>Let us face,
without panic, the reality of our times.</i>

208
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:25,126
<i>The fact that atom bombs</i>

209
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:29,359
<i>may, some day, be dropped on our cities.
And let us prepare for survival</i>

210
00:26:29,432 --> 00:26:31,457
<i>by understanding the weapon
that threatens us.</i>

211
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,525
Yeah.

212
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:42,231
How you settling in, bro?

213
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,540
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

214
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,949
I see you and Spock are vibing.

215
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,953
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

216
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:53,751
Who's talking?

217
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,761
Yikes.

218
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:02,820
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

219
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:05,061
But I find it irritating,

220
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:07,262
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

221
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:09,431
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

222
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,167
Also, while I'm here,

223
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,834
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

224
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:32,122
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

225
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,288
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

226
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:05,820
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go.

227
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:06,921
John.

228
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:09,490
- John.
- My hands. What...?

229
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,830
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

230
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:13,837
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

231
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,463
They called them legacies back home.

232
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,167
You, the nine,
you're the only ones who have them.

233
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:19,573
- Legacies?
- That's right.

234
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,635
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

235
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:24,169
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

236
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:25,373
- Gifts?
- That's right.

237
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,246
My hands light up like road flares.

238
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:29,845
- And you call that a gift?
- Each legacy has its own function.

239
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,945
There's...
There's more coming?

240
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:36,653
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

241
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:40,595
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

242
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,964
OK?

243
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:45,327
How do your hands feel?

244
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:50,498
- Better.
- Good.

245
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,867
So, what now?

246
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:56,069
Now?

247
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:59,310
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

248
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,079
I need you to be careful.

249
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,214
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

250
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,382
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

251
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,051
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

252
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:10,958
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

253
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:13,327
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

254
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:15,958
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

255
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,194
Exactly.

256
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:20,553
A little early for Thanksgiving.

257
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,184
Paper or plastic?

258
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,180
Whoa.

259
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,668
And you wind it here...

260
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:32,225
"Strangers in Paradise"?

261
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:37,362
I know. Arty, pretentious.

262
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:39,599
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

263
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:42,971
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

264
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:49,046
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

265
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,108
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

266
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:58,314
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

267
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,258
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

268
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,921
OK, I will next week.

269
00:33:02,962 --> 00:33:05,295
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

270
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,425
Oh, they're so cute.

271
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,594
You know, uh... I mean it.

272
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,229
Uh... Your photographs...

273
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:13,762
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

274
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,970
and those are two of my victims.

275
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:20,445
You know, I'm, uh...

276
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:23,914
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

277
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,349
...it's not going so well.

278
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:27,976
Oh.

279
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:30,954
Right. Um...

280
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,288
Thank you.

281
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,631
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

282
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:44,597
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

283
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:48,135
Come on! Let's go!

284
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,146
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

285
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,376
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- That's Sam's dad?

286
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,509
His stepdad.

287
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,610
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

288
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,394
This is it.

289
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,265
You live here?

290
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:20,940
Yeah, I grew up here.

291
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,940
- It's just a house.
- I know.

292
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:35,850
You hungry?

293
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:39,222
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

294
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,886
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

295
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:44,022
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

296
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,761
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

297
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,359
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

298
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:50,701
Question game!

299
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,037
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

300
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:55,202
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

301
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:58,576
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

302
00:34:58,646 --> 00:34:59,772
Hand them over.

303
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,645
- And you.
- Mom?

304
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:04,652
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

305
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,246
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

306
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:11,656
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

307
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,354
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

308
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,331
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

309
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,664
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

310
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,726
Where's your mom?

311
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,361
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

312
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:27,899
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

313
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:30,878
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

314
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:33,279
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

315
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:34,440
Cheap labor.

316
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,108
- That is not why.
- No.

317
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:38,948
- She's a very talented photographer.
- Question game!

318
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,081
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

319
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:45,820
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

320
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,259
Worst advice you ever got?

321
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,561
"Pull this."

322
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:50,826
Oh, stop!

323
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,492
That's really gross.

324
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,762
OK, um...

325
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:56,068
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

326
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:58,129
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

327
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,697
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

328
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,710
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

329
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:06,510
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

330
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,776
She was orange.

331
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:11,286
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

332
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:12,842
Oh, you should go get that picture.

333
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,149
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

334
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:15,952
Why would you want
to show him that?

335
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:18,289
I shouldn't have said it.

336
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,452
I think I tore them up.

337
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:28,199
Sorry about that.

338
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:33,432
- About what?
- My parents.

339
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:36,934
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

340
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,640
They seem very proud of you.

341
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:40,649
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

342
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:43,014
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

343
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:46,145
They'd love it if I stayed here.

344
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:49,316
Got into wedding photography.

345
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:52,361
What do you want to do?

346
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,296
That's my favorite.

347
00:36:58,334 --> 00:36:59,859
It's got all these light leaks

348
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,996
so the photos come out so interesting.

349
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,870
Here, I'll show you.

350
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,912
See that one right there?

351
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,886
That's what I was talking about.

352
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:23,252
What's this?

353
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:26,118
Um...

354
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:33,130
That is kind of private, actually.

355
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:36,801
It's amazing.

356
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:44,946
- What?
- You...

357
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:48,708
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

358
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:53,052
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

359
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,892
OK.
That's enough.

360
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,866
Seems like you want to run away.

361
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,928
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

362
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,734
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

363
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:13,275
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

364
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:14,901
I've heard it.

365
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:18,573
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

366
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:22,984
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

367
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,653
I, uh...

368
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,663
I think this is a pretty good place.

369
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:53,217
Bernie, you dumb dog.

370
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,979
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

371
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:01,684
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

372
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,591
Um...

373
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:12,702
Your turn.

374
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:18,304
Thanks.

375
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,015
I'm fine.

376
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:37,526
Heard you made quite an impression
in class yesterday.

377
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:40,860
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.
But that class...

378
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:43,958
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:48,166
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

380
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,003
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

381
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,407
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

382
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,501
Sarah may act like one of us...

383
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:55,705
...she's one of them.

384
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:57,009
He's into Sarah?

385
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:00,017
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

386
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:01,747
They were like the town...

387
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,151
Whoa!

388
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,554
Loser!

389
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:09,491
No... OK, come on...
Oh, God.

390
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:12,524
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

391
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:16,157
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

392
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:20,969
I wonder who did that?

393
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:24,238
What a loser.

394
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:25,970
Leave me alone!

395
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:30,874
Ah, ah, ah...

396
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,181
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

397
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:43,052
You see, in football,
a quarterback needs a few things.

398
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:44,585
Speed, strength...

399
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:48,361
Mostly, though, you need intuition.

400
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,766
A feeling when things
are going south.

401
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:55,807
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

402
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:08,484
There you go, John.

403
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:12,584
Good boy.

404
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:15,386
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

405
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:20,428
That was awesome.

406
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:28,236
Raided lost and found.

407
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:31,038
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

408
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:35,308
<i>Dude, it was that or the Hannah
Montana sweatshirt. You got off easy.</i>

409
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,372
So, uh...

410
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:42,047
...who's in the picture?
- My dad.

411
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:44,386
The real one.

412
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:56,263
<i>Where was that taken?</i>

413
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:01,205
Mexico. The Yucatán.

414
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,005
We used to go every year looking
for evidence of ancient astronauts.

415
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:07,437
Ancient astronauts?

416
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,449
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

417
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,541
Freak show stuff.

418
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:15,279
He called himself an anthropologist...

419
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,881
<i>He was really just a foreman
at the steel mill.</i>

420
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:24,018
<i>He spent all his time preparing
for some kind of alien arrival.</i>

421
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,493
I used to think he was a genius.

422
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,468
Had to, I guess.

423
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:33,029
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

424
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:49,046
Sam...

425
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:51,188
Sam.

426
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,323
Oh!

427
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:46,696
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

428
00:46:05,952 --> 00:46:08,319
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

429
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:33,710
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

430
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:50,289
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

431
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:57,634
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

432
00:46:57,706 --> 00:46:59,936
All your mistakes, your secrets?

433
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:05,603
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

434
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,581
I got into photography,

435
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,917
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

436
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,481
Said I was becoming a total snob.

437
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:18,958
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

438
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:23,055
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

439
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,128
All my friends.

440
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,600
Uh... I'm sorry.

441
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:35,805
I'm not. I mean, I was...

442
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,975
...but, um, I don't know,

443
00:47:39,048 --> 00:47:42,142
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

444
00:47:42,185 --> 00:47:44,085
Got away from all of that.

445
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:49,857
So, uh, what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

446
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:59,361
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

447
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:01,026
Don't be scared.

448
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:26,026
<i>Save yourself.</i>

449
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,013
Last year, she was drawn and quartered.

450
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,540
It was awesome.

451
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:54,551
My God.

452
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:06,897
Hell's Gate.

453
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:09,701
Everybody off.

454
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:32,589
Quite a production.

455
00:49:32,631 --> 00:49:36,623
Hm. Small town.

456
00:49:48,946 --> 00:49:52,279
OK. The last part got to me.

457
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:56,009
What is that?

458
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:59,613
Don't! Let him go! Let him go!

459
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:01,954
Stop it!

460
00:50:04,328 --> 00:50:05,352
Hello?

461
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:09,829
Was that real? Are you all right?

462
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:13,795
Let me go! Stop it!

463
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:15,702
Leave him alone!

464
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,797
- No!
- Whoa! Calm down.

465
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,824
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

466
00:50:42,902 --> 00:50:45,494
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

467
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:47,834
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

468
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:50,340
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will. I will!

469
00:50:50,942 --> 00:50:52,203
Sarah!

470
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:07,959
Where is she?

471
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:09,688
It burns, man!

472
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:12,994
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!

473
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:15,966
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

474
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:22,194
Where's John?

475
00:51:22,272 --> 00:51:25,402
I don't get what happened to us.
I don't. I really don't.

476
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:27,743
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

477
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:29,713
drag me through the woods
to come here,

478
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:33,776
when all you had to do is ask me!
Like a normal person!

479
00:51:33,853 --> 00:51:37,583
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

480
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:40,887
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

481
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,894
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

482
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:47,398
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

483
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,792
You OK?

484
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:04,481
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

485
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,816
No, John, stop! Stop!

486
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,230
John. John, stop. Wait.

487
00:52:22,268 --> 00:52:25,295
Hey. I just didn't want you
to break his arm.

488
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:27,771
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

489
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,503
Hey.

490
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:33,743
Will you walk me home?

491
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,951
You should really get that looked at.

492
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,790
I will.

493
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:50,653
I, uh...

494
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:57,732
I think we should talk.

495
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:04,309
I know. It's crazy.

496
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:06,945
Mark is insane.

497
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,881
And this is our last year.

498
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,940
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

499
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:14,613
Exactly.

500
00:53:15,522 --> 00:53:17,079
Who knows?

501
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:22,025
So, I guess I'll just...

502
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:23,961
...see you when I see you?

503
00:53:25,198 --> 00:53:26,460
Yeah.

504
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:30,434
OK.

505
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,371
Your hand's really warm.

506
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:57,895
All I think about is you.

507
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:00,593
All I think about is you, too.

508
00:54:24,525 --> 00:54:26,288
Where did you come from?

509
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:31,228
All right, Mom! I got it!

510
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,932
- I, uh...
- Yeah, I should go.

511
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:52,529
Bye.

512
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:54,273
John! In here.

513
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,847
So, what are you?

514
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:04,587
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

515
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,493
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

516
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:11,861
So I'm asking you, what are you?

517
00:56:14,502 --> 00:56:16,061
Do I need to threaten you?

518
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,504
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

519
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:19,973
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

520
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,976
- Give me that.
- No.

521
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,342
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

522
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:43,091
Knock yourself out.

523
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:53,297
My entire childhood...

524
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,004
<i>...has been an episode of X- Files.</i>

525
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:01,505
You know what it's like
to feel something...

526
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:05,381
...so strong...

527
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,354
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

528
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:10,517
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

529
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,254
And that everything
we believed in was true.

530
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:15,797
And that we were not crazy.

531
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:21,227
Please.

532
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:28,131
Please.

533
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,079
Your dad was right.

534
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,078
What?

535
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:43,782
He was right.

536
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,358
About ancient astronauts...

537
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,891
...life on other planets...

538
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,501
...all of it.

539
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,403
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

540
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:07,405
I mean, they found his truck near the
border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

541
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,281
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

542
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,649
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

543
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,055
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I-I-I wouldn't.

544
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,287
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

545
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:21,490
There are others from where I'm from
looking for me.

546
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,862
I'm not safe.

547
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:28,870
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

548
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,406
Wait until I get inside and then go.

549
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:33,169
Sam?

550
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,406
I promise.

551
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,677
Yes!

552
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,278
Come on.

553
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,670
Hey, you maniac.

554
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:06,106
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the, uh...?

555
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,536
Hello, Dad.

556
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,674
Sheriff James says
some boys got hurt last night.

557
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,810
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

558
00:59:15,854 --> 00:59:17,343
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

559
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,447
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

560
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:24,825
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

561
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,660
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

562
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,725
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

563
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,794
He said you were there.

564
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,531
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

565
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:43,671
So I wasn't paying any attention.
Um...

566
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,738
Sarah Hart?

567
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:53,015
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

568
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:56,548
But, eventually, someone will.

569
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,290
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

570
00:59:59,364 --> 01:00:01,729
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

571
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:24,615
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

572
01:00:26,224 --> 01:00:27,987
Was it difficult?

573
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,918
Piece of cake.

574
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,589
Good. Means you're getting it.

575
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,656
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

576
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,098
Because of last night?

577
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:39,762
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

578
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:42,862
- And I think this is gonna raise a few.
- "They walk among us."

579
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,806
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

580
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,776
Except that's actually you.

581
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,007
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

582
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:51,481
Oh, shit.

583
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,607
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

584
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,948
I can't get through the firewall.

585
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,783
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

586
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:58,981
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

587
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:01,355
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

588
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,490
I'm not going.

589
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,660
I'm sorry, what did you say?

590
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:10,428
I'm not going.

591
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:13,700
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

592
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:15,466
It's not my fight and it never was!

593
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,804
I can't even remember
a world before this one.

594
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,707
Wait, wait...

595
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:22,109
...is this because of a girl?

596
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:25,940
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

597
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:30,315
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

598
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:33,188
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

599
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:37,159
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

600
01:01:37,228 --> 01:01:38,717
And it wasn't so you could come here

601
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,957
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

602
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:42,694
I'm not leaving.

603
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:48,371
John... John!

604
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,703
I'm not leaving!

605
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,536
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

606
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:01,978
Hey, John!

607
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:15,399
I'm letting go, OK?

608
01:02:16,535 --> 01:02:18,298
- OK?
- OK.

609
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,375
- On our planet...
- Just tell me why they want to kill me.

610
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:36,911
The Mogs, they don't colonize.
They decimate. And then they move on.

611
01:02:36,988 --> 01:02:39,684
And now, they've moved here.

612
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:44,662
There are few forces that can stop them.
You and the other five can.

613
01:02:44,697 --> 01:02:46,359
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

614
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:50,061
I'm not gonna let you throw that away
for a girl.

615
01:02:50,102 --> 01:02:52,570
She's not just a girl.

616
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,234
I think about leaving her...

617
01:02:57,876 --> 01:02:59,868
...but I can't.

618
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:02,346
And I don't know why.

619
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,222
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

620
01:03:14,326 --> 01:03:16,158
You never forget.

621
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:23,102
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

622
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,502
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

623
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:29,631
Now, we have to go.

624
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:33,605
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

625
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,513
A day? To say goodbye?

626
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,813
That's more than the rest of us had.

627
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:00,204
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

628
01:04:10,817 --> 01:04:13,513
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

629
01:04:17,457 --> 01:04:18,481
Henri?

630
01:04:39,778 --> 01:04:42,544
Henri? Hello? Henri?

631
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:47,245
<i>No, but come here
and I'll tell you how to find him.</i>

632
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,117
Who are you? Where's Henri?

633
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:52,057
<i>417 Willard Court,
Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

634
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,168
Come on, come on.

635
01:05:05,206 --> 01:05:06,731
I need your help.

636
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,743
So, you guys... you guys don't...

637
01:05:13,814 --> 01:05:16,146
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

638
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,207
No.

639
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,709
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

640
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:21,948
...they do?

641
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:44,834
That's it.

642
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:48,045
Thanks.

643
01:05:55,823 --> 01:05:58,314
Whoa! You brought a gun?

644
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:01,385
I stole it from Ed.
It might come in handy. Let's go.

645
01:06:01,463 --> 01:06:04,796
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

646
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:08,392
You have. Now, go home.

647
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:28,316
Whoa!

648
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:33,117
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

649
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:34,922
What if these Mog people took my dad?

650
01:07:06,962 --> 01:07:11,400
Holy shit!

651
01:07:11,467 --> 01:07:13,627
But you just dead-bolted it.

652
01:07:15,136 --> 01:07:17,832
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

653
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:21,000
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

654
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,873
Copy that. I'm on it.

655
01:08:57,107 --> 01:08:58,131
Henri.

656
01:09:12,589 --> 01:09:14,385
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

657
01:09:14,423 --> 01:09:16,585
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

658
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:19,458
We need to leave. They're coming.

659
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:22,465
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

660
01:09:22,499 --> 01:09:25,092
I'll do it!
Get your hands up!

661
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:26,431
So glad you brought the gun.

662
01:09:27,803 --> 01:09:29,134
You're Malcolm's boy.

663
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:33,739
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

664
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:40,639
Oh!

665
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:49,315
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

666
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:52,452
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

667
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:55,294
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

668
01:09:55,332 --> 01:09:56,664
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

669
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:00,170
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

670
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:02,501
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

671
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:05,474
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

672
01:10:05,509 --> 01:10:06,909
John. It's time to leave.

673
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:10,674
They like it here, Earth. They're gonna
take all this shit, everything!

674
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:12,045
John! Now!

675
01:10:12,116 --> 01:10:14,140
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

676
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:16,652
It's time to go! Now!

677
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:35,730
John. John! John, no!

678
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:12,039
John, go!

679
01:11:12,076 --> 01:11:13,543
- Now!
- Go!

680
01:11:39,704 --> 01:11:42,230
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

681
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:43,969
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

682
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:46,532
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

683
01:11:47,378 --> 01:11:49,609
Guys, what are we waiting for?

684
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:53,350
- I've lost the keys!
- John, start the engine.

685
01:11:53,418 --> 01:11:56,546
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

686
01:11:59,323 --> 01:12:01,553
- Come on.
- Start the car.

687
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,494
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

688
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:11,968
Start the car! Start the car!

689
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:14,904
Use your magic powers!
Come on! We are so dead!

690
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:18,968
Oh, my God!

691
01:12:22,947 --> 01:12:25,177
Go! Drive the car!

692
01:12:36,795 --> 01:12:38,490
You take this.

693
01:12:43,835 --> 01:12:46,302
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

694
01:12:46,337 --> 01:12:49,604
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

695
01:12:49,642 --> 01:12:51,837
He was supposed to bring us together.

696
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:54,977
You need to find the others.

697
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,404
Together you'll be more powerful.

698
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:11,862
I can't do this without you.

699
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:15,227
Yes, you can.

700
01:13:16,936 --> 01:13:18,631
Yes, you can.

701
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:24,698
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

702
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:31,974
Henri.

703
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:29,373
Just let me talk.

704
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:33,705
OK. So, I called you like you said.

705
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:37,982
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

706
01:14:39,753 --> 01:14:41,742
I mean, we held up our end.

707
01:14:41,787 --> 01:14:44,279
- Hm.
- We're still in?

708
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:47,657
The whole new world order thing?

709
01:14:47,728 --> 01:14:51,721
The Locator.

710
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:54,427
- Where is it?
- OK.

711
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:58,632
All he had was a knife and that rock.

712
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:01,065
And I put it...

713
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:07,546
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

714
01:15:07,614 --> 01:15:09,672
But it's not there now.

715
01:15:31,938 --> 01:15:36,171
Cartoons for children.

716
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,804
Where I'm from, men have to work.

717
01:15:38,846 --> 01:15:40,710
Look, I'll work hard.

718
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,445
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

719
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:49,048
it's... beautiful.

720
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:51,249
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

721
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:56,253
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

722
01:15:57,799 --> 01:15:59,562
I have a gadget.

723
01:15:59,634 --> 01:16:03,501
- Would you like to play with it?
- Uh... No, no. I...

724
01:16:03,537 --> 01:16:07,940
It wants to play with you!

725
01:16:21,588 --> 01:16:22,851
Need to talk to you.

726
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:24,882
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

727
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:27,554
He's not who you think he is.

728
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,426
Excuse me?

729
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:36,495
<i>The Paradise Sheriff's Department</i>

730
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:38,232
<i>raided the home of two suspects,</i>

731
01:16:38,272 --> 01:16:41,036
<i>seizing computers
and several suspicious items.</i>

732
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:44,408
<i>An APB has been issued on
the suspects and anyone with...</i>

733
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:49,406
We need to get out of here.

734
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:52,880
There's a news thing.

735
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:56,084
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

736
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,426
We're going back.

737
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:13,607
I'm outside of
the home here in Warsaw

738
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:16,803
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

739
01:17:16,877 --> 01:17:18,903
were just found a few hours ago.

740
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:20,745
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

741
01:17:20,783 --> 01:17:23,149
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

742
01:17:23,218 --> 01:17:25,549
Police have no suspects
at this time...

743
01:17:36,263 --> 01:17:37,754
- I have one of those!
- What?

744
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:40,564
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

745
01:17:40,603 --> 01:17:42,799
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

746
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:46,363
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

747
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:48,376
I'll call you after.

748
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:50,809
- And then what?
- Then I get the rock and you go home.

749
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:03,984
- It's him.
- John?

750
01:18:04,593 --> 01:18:07,926
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

751
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:10,624
Yeah, he's here.

752
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:16,530
That's him!

753
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:34,547
Come on.

754
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:37,217
Come on.

755
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:02,640
Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.

756
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:08,718
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

757
01:19:08,758 --> 01:19:11,350
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

758
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:13,327
I'm such an idiot.

759
01:19:14,697 --> 01:19:17,929
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

760
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:20,128
He's not a terrorist.

761
01:19:20,737 --> 01:19:22,135
Tell me the truth.

762
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:25,336
Who are you?

763
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:37,047
He's upstairs.

764
01:19:37,887 --> 01:19:39,685
All right, guys, out of the way.

765
01:19:41,658 --> 01:19:43,889
You didn't answer my question.

766
01:19:44,761 --> 01:19:46,388
I just came to say goodbye.

767
01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:48,397
- John, wait! What are you... No, John!
- Don't move!

768
01:19:48,431 --> 01:19:50,831
Sarah!

769
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:01,067
How...

770
01:20:01,111 --> 01:20:02,577
- Move! Move!
- Go!

771
01:20:18,262 --> 01:20:19,922
That was awesome!

772
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:23,400
Whoa...

773
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:30,939
What you did is not possible.

774
01:20:30,975 --> 01:20:32,497
Who I am...

775
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:34,543
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

776
01:20:34,611 --> 01:20:38,344
Wait. Come with me.
Please.

777
01:20:39,283 --> 01:20:41,649
Any idea where they'd be?

778
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:44,153
I think I know
where she might go.

779
01:20:54,198 --> 01:20:57,633
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

780
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:08,136
Holy shit...

781
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:13,912
No, no, no!

782
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,712
Dad!

783
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:34,036
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

784
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:37,938
...healthy and well-fed.

785
01:21:38,008 --> 01:21:41,603
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you? Do you? Do you?

786
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

787
01:21:43,915 --> 01:21:46,474
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

788
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:49,715
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

789
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:54,019
But I say... don't do that.

790
01:21:54,058 --> 01:21:55,753
OK?

791
01:21:57,461 --> 01:22:00,692
Tell me now, where is the boy?

792
01:22:28,259 --> 01:22:30,784
These are beautiful.

793
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,934
Can you show me?

794
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:17,139
- No!
- Get in!

795
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:24,839
Let me go! Let me go!

796
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:30,850
Let go of me!

797
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,331
- Hello?
- Where are you?

798
01:23:40,366 --> 01:23:41,458
I'm at the high school.

799
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,262
<i>Yeah, you need to get out of there now.</i>

800
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:44,326
Why? What's happening?

801
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,168
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

802
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:48,638
<i>If they're not right on your ass now,</i>

803
01:23:48,674 --> 01:23:50,402
<i>they will be soon.</i>

804
01:23:50,976 --> 01:23:52,341
Come on.

805
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:54,539
And don't tell me this is not my fight.

806
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:59,050
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

807
01:23:59,685 --> 01:24:02,676
And also, I have your dog.

808
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:04,681
<i>Look, I'm on my way.</i>

809
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:06,213
<i>I'll meet you out front of the school.</i>

810
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,156
<i>You've got to get out now.</i>

811
01:24:08,727 --> 01:24:10,321
<i>John?</i>

812
01:24:10,364 --> 01:24:11,421
<i>John!</i>

813
01:24:16,068 --> 01:24:17,399
Let's go.

814
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:24,205
Let go of me!

815
01:24:28,179 --> 01:24:30,706
Jesus!

816
01:24:30,751 --> 01:24:34,551
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

817
01:24:34,621 --> 01:24:37,350
Run!

818
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,862
Let me go!

819
01:24:49,702 --> 01:24:52,603
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

820
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,333
Do you understand me?
Come on.

821
01:26:09,116 --> 01:26:12,108
Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

822
01:26:14,455 --> 01:26:18,686
- Who are you?
- Number Six. Where's your protector?

823
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:22,159
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

824
01:26:22,195 --> 01:26:23,627
Mogs got her four months ago.

825
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:26,224
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

826
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,530
Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.

827
01:26:28,603 --> 01:26:30,833
You should be watching your own ass.

828
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:33,169
Mogs have all the exits covered.

829
01:26:33,206 --> 01:26:36,199
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

830
01:26:36,277 --> 01:26:38,506
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

831
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:40,980
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

832
01:26:41,015 --> 01:26:43,779
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

833
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,149
Let's go.

834
01:26:48,421 --> 01:26:51,016
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

835
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:52,649
Stay tuned.

836
01:27:24,826 --> 01:27:27,294
Oh, shit.

837
01:27:34,736 --> 01:27:36,169
Oh, shit!

838
01:27:45,913 --> 01:27:47,744
Careful, they'll see us.

839
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,951
And you're going
to need all your energy.

840
01:27:55,056 --> 01:27:58,048
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

841
01:27:58,092 --> 01:28:00,560
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

842
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:03,087
Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?

843
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:04,530
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

844
01:28:04,566 --> 01:28:06,760
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

845
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:09,963
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

846
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,976
Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?

847
01:28:16,979 --> 01:28:18,207
Jane Doe.

848
01:28:18,246 --> 01:28:19,543
That's cool. It's cool.

849
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,945
So, are you a number, too?

850
01:28:20,982 --> 01:28:23,975
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

851
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,613
What flew out of the truck?

852
01:28:30,726 --> 01:28:33,286
Come on! Go, go!

853
01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:36,627
Sam. Come on! Go!

854
01:28:40,903 --> 01:28:42,664
Come on! Come on!

855
01:28:45,774 --> 01:28:48,106
Come on!

856
01:29:48,137 --> 01:29:49,228
Ahh!

857
01:29:56,878 --> 01:29:59,210
- Hit me.
- What?

858
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:01,683
With your lumen.
I need to power-up.

859
01:30:03,885 --> 01:30:05,251
Hit me!

860
01:30:16,232 --> 01:30:18,062
Red Bull's for pussies.

861
01:30:20,404 --> 01:30:22,531
He killed Henri. I want him.

862
01:30:54,236 --> 01:30:57,297
Ah!

863
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:00,509
Four!

864
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:14,815
You're good with your hands.

865
01:31:14,891 --> 01:31:16,859
- Thanks.
- No problem.

866
01:31:18,362 --> 01:31:22,663
- My dog, he, uh... he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

867
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:24,860
He came with you from Lorien.

868
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:27,335
Someone had to look after you.

869
01:32:30,434 --> 01:32:32,528
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

870
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:35,004
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

871
01:32:45,717 --> 01:32:46,741
Go!

872
01:32:55,728 --> 01:32:57,355
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Got it! Come on!

873
01:33:04,702 --> 01:33:06,932
- Holy...!
- Ahh!

874
01:33:11,543 --> 01:33:12,840
I play a lot of Xbox.

875
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:20,175
Oh!

876
01:33:40,438 --> 01:33:42,600
Oh! Ahh!

877
01:34:52,445 --> 01:34:56,710
Number Four, I think you
have something I need. Hm?

878
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:02,687
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

879
01:35:02,722 --> 01:35:07,988
Think of how quickly we'll finish off
the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!

880
01:35:08,727 --> 01:35:11,356
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

881
01:35:11,398 --> 01:35:13,662
Just relax.

882
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:18,833
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

883
01:35:18,871 --> 01:35:20,964
You have...

884
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:23,441
...no idea...

885
01:35:24,644 --> 01:35:26,111
...what I'm capable of.

886
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:43,658
Ah!

887
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,781
John.

888
01:36:45,058 --> 01:36:46,753
Fireproof?

889
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:50,294
I told you to stay tuned.

890
01:37:19,193 --> 01:37:21,320
All right, give me that.
Come on.

891
01:37:22,197 --> 01:37:23,424
Thank you.

892
01:37:54,461 --> 01:37:58,455
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

893
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,558
No, it was.

894
01:38:00,634 --> 01:38:03,034
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

895
01:38:03,103 --> 01:38:06,267
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

896
01:38:12,515 --> 01:38:15,710
- Here.
- Thank you.

897
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:18,550
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

898
01:38:18,587 --> 01:38:23,081
Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence
all the time.

899
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:25,557
My dad won't even know.

900
01:38:25,593 --> 01:38:28,494
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

901
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:31,020
Because I told my dad you're going east.

902
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:42,842
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

903
01:38:43,944 --> 01:38:45,708
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

904
01:38:45,747 --> 01:38:47,978
We need to find his father.

905
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:54,987
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

906
01:38:55,056 --> 01:38:57,525
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

907
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:05,625
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't, uh...

908
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,465
- Safer.
- Yeah.

909
01:39:08,537 --> 01:39:10,095
I know.

910
01:39:11,307 --> 01:39:13,774
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

911
01:39:15,043 --> 01:39:16,806
Me, too.

912
01:39:20,181 --> 01:39:22,673
You know I'll find you again.

913
01:39:24,986 --> 01:39:27,978
Probably still be here.

914
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,782
It's the people that make the place.

915
01:39:31,559 --> 01:39:33,892
- Right?
- Yeah.

916
01:39:40,235 --> 01:39:44,104
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

917
01:39:46,309 --> 01:39:47,776
Ever?

918
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:50,043
Ever.

919
01:41:22,839 --> 01:41:25,739
<i>This is the first town
I've left without Henri.</i>

920
01:41:26,675 --> 01:41:30,134
<i>But it's also the first one
I have a reason to come back to.</i>

921
01:41:31,514 --> 01:41:35,006
<i>Henri was right,
we're stronger together.</i>

922
01:41:35,551 --> 01:41:38,146
<i>So we will find the others.</i>

923
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:45,020
<i>My planet is called Lorien,
but Earth is my home now.</i>

924
01:41:46,063 --> 01:41:49,760
<i>It's as good a place
as any in the universe.</i>

925
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,234
<i>And that's how it's going to stay.</i>
