1
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,957
(RICHARD) If you're listening to my voice,
you'll have bought the new "Top Gear" DVD

2
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:16,597
and you're in for a great time
in front of the telly.

3
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:21,163
We've gathered together
some of our classic films,

4
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,397
including car versus bobsleigh,

5
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,164
the Apache and Lotus shoot-out...

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,646
Ohh!

7
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:31,321
...the great Aston Martin race,

8
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:34,001
the pick-up destruction

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,523
- and the 747 blowback.
- Crikeyl

10
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:43,557
We'll also reveal the secrets
of how to be a "Top Gear"presenter.

11
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:46,719
And we'll relive
some of the Stig's finest moments,

12
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:49,242
along with some of our un-finest.

13
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:54,003
A lot of that is quite difficult to follow.
(STUMBLES OVER WORDS) See?

14
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:58,638
(RICHARD) Enjoy.

15
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:08,441
Mr J Sampson in Emmerdale
has six Swaledales, all ewes, ready to go.

16
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:12,600
Michael Dodds in Ambleside,
four blue-faced Leicesters, ready to go.

17
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:16,316
Chris Muckle in Grisdale,
five Border Leicesters.

18
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:20,924
And finally Mr L Kyle
of Sykes Farm, Crummock,

19
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,159
has five Jacob ewes ready to go now.

20
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:29,606
When you start out in radio and TV, things
don't always work out the way you'd hoped.

21
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,565
This was my first job on Radio Cumbria,

22
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:35,116
reading out the names for half an hour

23
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,757
of lambs up for adoption by local farmers.

24
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,839
Not what you'd call the best job in the world.

25
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,204
Now, "Top Gear",
that's definitely a bit of a step up.

26
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:49,758
Where else does a day in the office
involve two miles of deserted beach

27
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:53,078
and three hugely powerful sports cars?

28
00:01:56,487 --> 00:02:01,481
We've got the business jet and the Tornado.
Where's Hammond and the Messerschmidt?

29
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:04,161
- You did say 10am, didn't you?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:07,046
Where the hell is he, then?

31
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,918
(JEREMY) Eventually he stopped fooling
on the Welsh mountains

32
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:22,603
and joined us at one of the most remarkable
places in the British Isles.

33
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,565
Pendine Sands.

34
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:33,845
Here we are, all three cars together
on this enormous playground.

35
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:40,038
Now we must decide which is best.

36
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:46,923
First we learn how hard it is to drive
a powerful rear-drive car on wet sand.

37
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,282
They just go sideways, constantly.

38
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:05,762
After many hours of arduous fun -
I mean practice -

39
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:10,045
we worked out that the Jag
and the Porsche were a riot.

40
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:17,321
And the BMW was a bit like
watching your dad trying to dance.

41
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,006
Strewth. I'm giving this up. This is lethal.

42
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:33,917
It's not bad, but it simply doesn't have
the exuberance of the Jaguar

43
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:37,397
or the poise of the Porsche.

44
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:43,920
However, maybe things would be different
in a straight-line drag race.

45
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,278
This will be a drag race with a difference.

46
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:59,157
There's so little traction on the beach
that you could spin in a straight line.

47
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,444
I'm fairly sure at least one of us
will cross the line

48
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:05,724
either backwards or upside down.

49
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,486
And we're off.

50
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:20,001
The Porsche's rear engine
gave it better traction off the line,

51
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:24,558
but the sheer power of the Jag
meant it couldn't pull out much of a lead.

52
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:27,400
That Porsche is completely planted.

53
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,316
It moves around a lot as you accelerate.

54
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,644
And the BMW, that was nowhere.

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,718
Come on, car. Go in a straight line.

56
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:44,758
This isn't so much a test
of how fast the car goes,

57
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,796
but how able you are to hold it in a straight line
on what feels more like sheet ice.

58
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:56,563
I can feel it snatching and grabbing
as it gets grip and then loses it.

59
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:59,605
Jag is in the lead.

60
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,638
Aaargh!

61
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,356
(SHOUTING)

62
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,242
Hammond beat me going backwards.

63
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:29,282
(JEREMY) Let's not forget that the BMW
is the most spacious car here,

64
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,325
with the largest rear seats and biggest boot.

65
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,638
It's also the cheapest by £6,000

66
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:40,437
and it will look good in the Pringle-ised world
of your local golf club.

67
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:46,364
Here, though, at Britain's birthplace of speed,
it is completely outclassed.

68
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:49,121
To find out if my colleagues shared this view,

69
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:52,324
we peeled off for a cup of tea.

70
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:01,521
So, chaps, if it were your money,
you had to go out and buy one of those cars,

71
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,520
big two-door coupé, what's it gonna be?

72
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:09,317
For its drive, and it is so far ahead
of the Jaguar, I'd have to have the 911.

73
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:15,756
I'm not really a 911 person, but I drive
that car and I think, "This is really special."

74
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:20,717
But I'd have the Jag. It's a huge car.
You're sitting in a tiny cabin.

75
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:24,277
You're using an immense amount of fuel
but it's all yours.

76
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,644
The worry for me would be if you bought the 911,

77
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,844
at some point you'll be on a country road driving,

78
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:35,797
you'll look in your mirror,
see one of those Jags and think, "No!"

79
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,879
I'll tell you what I think is interesting here.

80
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:42,596
- We haven't discussed the BMW.
- It's boring.

81
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,678
It's like Munich, actually.

82
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:48,123
You go to Munich, you get a fantastic hotel,

83
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:51,643
it looks great,
the services are good, the food's great,

84
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,516
you come home and you never think,
"I wish I was still in Munich."

85
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:59,043
- It leaves you feeling completely cold.
- There's no magic.

86
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,483
- Completely boring. You'd have the Jag.
- The Jag.

87
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:05,081
- 911.
- So go on.

88
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:08,398
Casting vote.
You've got to spend money on one.

89
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,876
Logic dictates I buy the Porsche.

90
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,356
- It does?
- But I wouldn't.

91
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:16,405
- You'd go for the Jag.
- I've just made my mind up.

92
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:20,116
- I can totally see why.
- It is magnificent.

93
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:24,280
It's a majority verdict and it's the Jag.

94
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:34,200
I wish it had more space.
I wish it had a limited slip differential.

95
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,358
I wish all the buttons made sense.

96
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:46,319
But you would never tire of the way
it goes from 80, 90, 100, 110.

97
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,399
It's like you've got this huge supercharger

98
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:54,401
with a small V8 shoved on the back
as a sort of afterthought.

99
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,639
(JEREMY) That's what it's all about
with cars like this.

100
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:02,961
Excitement. And it's excitement
that the Jag delivers... in spades.

101
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,606
It may not do much to get baby lambs adopted,

102
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:12,396
but "Top Gear" is definitely
the best job in the world.

103
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,923
And this is the heart of it,
the "Top Gear" bunker,

104
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,079
at a secret location in somewhere or other.

105
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:24,483
This is where we plot and plan
and keep souvenirs from past adventures.

106
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:28,162
Look. This is the sand
from my pants on Pendine.

107
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:31,080
(JAMES)... his car out.

108
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,798
Think of this as Q's workshop...

109
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,926
without the money or the gadgets
or the technical expertise.

110
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:46,319
It may be the best job in the world,
but it's not an easy one to get.

111
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:50,924
The "Top Gear" presenter must possess
many skills if they're to make the grade.

112
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:54,796
Naturally, an innate sense of style is important.

113
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,596
But another vital quality is you must be brave.

114
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:05,804
(RICHARD) This is Lillehammer in Norway,
the setting for the 1994 Winter Olympics.

115
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:11,520
It's got one of the most formidable
bobsleigh runs in the world.

116
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,076
A downhill course of twists and turns

117
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:17,125
stretching for almost two kilometres.

118
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:30,956
Even so, a crack bobsleigh team
can get down this run in just under a minute,

119
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:34,164
with the bobsleigh itself hitting 80mph.

120
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,921
That speed comes at a price
for the passengers

121
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:42,525
because each member of the team
is subjected to cornering forces of 5G,

122
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,484
more than an F1 driver suffers.

123
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:51,280
To do this you'd have to be brave, stupid
or just desperate to get on the television.

124
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:54,166
I'll be sitting here in the middle.

125
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,876
To make things even more arduous,
we're gonna have a race.

126
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:04,245
We've come to Lillehammer because
alongside the bobsleigh run is this road.

127
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,719
They start in the same place,
run down the hill and finish in the same place.

128
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:12,800
The road is almost exactly
the same length as the bob run,

129
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:18,087
and like the bob run it's slippery,
dangerous and full of difficult corners.

130
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,407
It requires a special vehicle.

131
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,764
So that's what we've got.

132
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,919
It's a Mitsubishi Evo world rally car

133
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:36,684
with a 300 horsepower turbocharged engine,
four-wheel drive and studded tyres.

134
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:40,362
That's the challenge.
Can the rally car beat the bobsleigh?

135
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:44,964
I think it can,
although Hammond tells me it definitely can't.

136
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:50,156
This is my bobsleigh run.
It wiggles down and finishes there.

137
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,966
This is the road, which is in green.

138
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:56,642
It wiggles up there but finishes
in exactly the same place.

139
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:02,916
But my bobsleigh can get from there all the way
down in less than a minute. You've had it.

140
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,397
All you've got to get from there to there
is gravity.

141
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:10,958
I've got 300 horsepower
and a huge turbocharger

142
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,277
and 420 spikes in each tyre

143
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,961
and gravity to get down there.

144
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,960
But my bobsleigh was custom-built
for going on ice.

145
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,766
Your car has been adapted
with clever tyres.

146
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:26,000
You've got tights. I can't take
lectures on physics from a man in tights.

147
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,000
- I am aware...
- Dancing, yes. Physics, no.

148
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:34,004
(JAMES) But the bob
is going to be hard to beat.

149
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,920
Which kind of counts me out
for driving the car.

150
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:45,960
So instead we've got Henning Solberg,
the Norwegian national rally champion.

151
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,166
One, two, three...

152
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:52,445
(RICHARD) The bobsleigh's chance of victory
depends on how good our start is.

153
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:57,965
That means intense preparation
for me and the Norwegian bobsleigh team.

154
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:05,280
While we practise running,
the driver visualises the course in his head.

155
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,000
All of this provided much merriment
for the bone-idle May.

156
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,965
Are you warming up? I'm warming up as well.

157
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:23,198
I couldn't see the funny side of it because
I was worried about letting the team down.

158
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:30,764
Any time you lose here, a second, is multiplied
by three at the bottom, so that's three seconds.

159
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:34,602
I was also worried
about whether my body would cope.

160
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:39,158
The key thing is, as you go into the corners,
to get a lot of breath in,

161
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:44,082
because that holds your body up
when you're subjected to G-forces.

162
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:48,160
Apparently in a couple of places down there
it hits 6.5G.

163
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:53,845
A driver told me he's been doing this
six years and he's 3cm shorter.

164
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,202
I can't afford to lose 3cm.

165
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,756
James was strapped in
and I was ready to run.

166
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:09,324
Our ace rally driver
could hardly speak any English,

167
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:13,446
but that didn't stop James giving him
a patronising British pep talk.

168
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:17,885
Right, Henning, it's the reputation
of internal combustion

169
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:23,360
resting on your shoulders
for the next minute or so.

170
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:28,198
(JAMES) I was going to time the car
with my stopwatch

171
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:31,962
and Hammond's bob would be timed
by the course officials.

172
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,687
This was it.

173
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,921
You nutter!

174
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,638
We're starting to turn.

175
00:13:56,807 --> 00:14:01,085
Ooh, that's a turn. That's a turn. 6-G in corners.

176
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,158
That's three of them.

177
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:11,881
(JAMES) Two kilometres on ice in a minute.
Boy, has Henning got it all to do.

178
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:14,277
Ooh, that's a large bump on my head.

179
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,481
(BLEEP)

180
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:23,198
(RICHARD) The bob may have started slow,
but it was getting faster and faster

181
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,722
and these guys never use the brakes.

182
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,444
Ohh!

183
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,000
There's a corner coming up. That's one.

184
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,158
And there's another.

185
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:38,639
(JAMES) At mid-point, 1,000 metres in,
it was anybody's guess.

186
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:50,083
I've got to suck in air.

187
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:09,284
Ohh!

188
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:14,564
(JAMES) Henning was just awesome.
You can't go this fast on ice.

189
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,287
(BLEEP)

190
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:20,439
He hit the side. He's going to kill us.

191
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,961
Aaargh!

192
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,641
I don't wanna die in tights!

193
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:47,522
59.68. Did we win? What did he do?

194
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:53,643
Strewth! I can't... I'm broken.

195
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:56,241
- What have you done it in?
- 59.68.

196
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:59,604
Come on. Come on, come on.

197
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,758
One minute, two seconds 24.

198
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:07,285
We won! Hey! The boys!

199
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:11,042
I hope I didn't slow you up too much.
That was fantastic.

200
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:15,917
We did it. That really was something.
Awesome. Yes!

201
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:21,036
No stand-ins, no stunt doubles round here.

202
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:25,678
You must have the heart of a lion,
or at least something bigger than a gerbil.

203
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,759
Another important quality is "think big".

204
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,443
That's exactly what happened when
James and I had an epic race with Jeremy

205
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:38,283
from our studios here in Guildford
all the way down to Monte Carlo.

206
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:42,201
Us on a train, him in an Aston Martin,
last one there's a wettie.

207
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:57,322
OK, the rules of this are very simple.

208
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:01,605
They can't use any form of car,
I can't use any form of train.

209
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:07,876
The winner is the first one to the Café de Paris,
Casino Square, Monte Carlo. See you, chaps.

210
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,440
(HORN)

211
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,280
He'll get to the end of the lane before us.

212
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:23,238
Once we're on that train, there is no way
that car can beat us. It is impossible.

213
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:28,002
In an ordinary car, I agree,
it may well be impossible.

214
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,204
But this is no ordinary car.

215
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:38,158
The old DB7, that was just a Jag in drag.

216
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:43,003
It was an XJS in a party frock.
This is completely different.

217
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,635
It's made in a brand-new factory

218
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:50,642
using space-age materials
and sci-fi production techniques.

219
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,558
- Is that heavy?
- Yeah.

220
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,446
- No, I mean really heavy.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,516
You get a sense of that modern-ness in here.

222
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,759
I've got loads more space
than you got in the DB7.

223
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,885
Look at the dash.
It's aluminium, it's pale wood.

224
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,119
You get dials like you get
on a techno marine watch.

225
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,084
You get a split-screen sat nav, hands-free phone.

226
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:22,881
It's as bang up-to-date and as modern
and as clean and as crisp

227
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:26,642
as the departure lounge at a Swiss airport.

228
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:32,682
By the time the boys had walked the two miles
to the bus stop, I'd covered 40.

229
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:40,764
Everything was going fine until I reached
the outskirts of Dover, where I hit traffic.

230
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,158
Get out of my way, you foolish lorry!

231
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:48,036
Why are you cluttering up our roads
with Latvian milk?

232
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,162
- Money?
- Two to Guildford, please.

233
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:55,240
- £5.60, please.
- £5.60?!

234
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:59,317
If I don't catch this ten o'clock ferry,
I'm out of the race.

235
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,996
I perfected this design on the school bus.

236
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,443
Three, two, one, throw.

237
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,723
(HORN BLARING)

238
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,559
- Thank you very much.
- That was excellent.

239
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,924
Yes! We are in business.

240
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:23,118
I'm about to get on the Seacat,
which will get me to France in 60 minutes.

241
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,882
Before I get on,
I have one concern about the car.

242
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,322
It is spectacularly good-looking.

243
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:32,081
And it is very modern.

244
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:35,239
But in my lifetime Astons
have been very British cars,

245
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:42,518
big, heavy, dark, green, like jet-propelled
stately homes, Merlin engine shire horses,

246
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,645
and I'm not sure this is.

247
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:50,801
It may be a good car,
it may well be a great car, but is it an Aston?

248
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,675
- (JAMES) Where are you?
- At the docks, about to get on the boat.

249
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,197
- He's at the docks.
- Where are you?

250
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,758
- In Guildford station.
- You're in Guildford, I'm at the Channel.

251
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:08,761
Give it a few hours
and we'll be at least 150 miles ahead.

252
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:13,842
- I'm gonna win this.
- No. A car cannot beat the train in France.

253
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,282
They still think they're gonna win.

254
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:29,004
- Sorry.
- That's what I call moving!

255
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:33,164
- What a nice day.
- It is a gorgeous day.

256
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:39,644
Look at that! I wonder where they are now.

257
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,726
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'm all right, really.

258
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:55,166
Right, it's quarter past 11 UK time,

259
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:58,763
which means Jeremy
has just driven off the Seacat.

260
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:03,842
We're only at London Waterloo, but we're going
onto the Eurostar all the way to Paris.

261
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:06,567
This is where we catch up.

262
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,407
(JEREMY) At last, the French motorways.

263
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:21,756
Now I can really open the taps
and find out if the DB9 is a proper Aston.

264
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:25,522
This car absolutely flies.

265
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,121
It's got a six-litre V12 engine

266
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:33,245
that develops 460 brake horsepower.

267
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:37,878
It's actually more powerful per ton
than a Vanquish.

268
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:44,322
That means it does 0 to 60
in four and a half seconds.

269
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:47,843
Top speed, 190.

270
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,881
I'm trying to say
it's definitely got the power of an Aston.

271
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,805
It also makes a fabulous noise.

272
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,037
- Listen to that.
- (ENGINE ROARING)

273
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:05,076
This is how you beat the French,
shouting at them.

274
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:07,238
Aaah!

275
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:12,560
But when you settle down to a cruise,
it stops shouting.

276
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,718
It starts to sing a gentle ballad.

277
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:26,397
Naturally, being an Aston, it wasn't long
before it attracted some attention.

278
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,558
(SIREN)

279
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:31,684
- May.
- Yes, hello, Jeremy.

280
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:35,044
I've got the gendarmes just all over me.

281
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:37,482
I think he's been nicked by the rozzers.

282
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:42,357
- Have they stopped you?
- They come alongside and go, "Quicker!"

283
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,006
You're making it up.

284
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:49,161
This is the great thing about driving - the police
come along and want you to go quicker.

285
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,799
How's that, Mr Gendarme?

286
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,247
So far Jeremy's had it pretty much his own way,

287
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:02,320
while we've carried heavy bags,
walked, caught buses and small trains.

288
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:05,081
Now things change. We're on the big train.

289
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:10,321
We'll hit nearly 200mph on the way
from here to Dover, it's 60mph in the tunnel

290
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:13,843
- and best part of 200mph across France.
- (MOBILE RINGING)

291
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,998
- Is that him?
- It is.

292
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,759
Excellent.

293
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,476
- Bonjour, Monsieur Clarkson.
- I want to know where you are.

294
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:25,519
We are on the Eurostar train
in enormous comfort,

295
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,201
looking forward to the first-class lunch.

296
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,927
- Would you like a drink?
- I think champagne.

297
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,884
I'll have champagne, too.

298
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:38,358
As they headed for the Channel Tunnel,
I was already in champagne country.

299
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:41,280
But it wasn't me who needed a drink.

300
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,645
This is not good. The fuel warning light's on.

301
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:52,402
This is gonna be a Formula One-style pit stop.

302
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:56,085
- Here we go.
- That's it.

303
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,363
Where's the fuel filler cap button?

304
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,644
- Sir?
- I'll have the white Bordeaux.

305
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:08,645
Why aren't they in the same place? Have you
ever seen a more stupid place to put it?

306
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,846
I suppose Jeremy could have a pasty
or a pork pie.

307
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:16,556
- Le burger.
- Le sausage roll.

308
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:22,166
- Come on!
- Finally, French soil.

309
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,115
- (HUMS "LA MARSEILLAISE")
- Vive la France!

310
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:28,482
Jeremy, we're coming to get you.

311
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,956
That was a fraught fill-up.

312
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:34,517
What a place to put it when you're in a race.

313
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,400
We brought a sophisticated tracking device

314
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:45,401
that will enable us to see
where Jeremy is at any time in his Aston

315
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,364
and plot his speed and course.

316
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:52,647
- He's there and he's doing 84mph.
- That's a bit weedy, actually.

317
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:57,961
We're going to be doing 200mph all the way.
Frankly, he doesn't stand a chance.

318
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,402
(RICHARD) Our cockiness is short-lived.

319
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:05,482
As the train approaches Paris,
Jeremy is already 172 miles south of us

320
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:09,003
and we have to get across the city
to change trains.

321
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,403
- If we get this train, we're all right.
- Stop wittering.

322
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,364
If we miss it...

323
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:20,043
James and I have just 50 minutes
to catch the connection to Nice.

324
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:25,318
It's one minute to four, French time.
They are now arriving in Paris.

325
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,797
James, just think of Jeremy arriving before us.

326
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:32,846
- The quantity of smugness.
- My soul is prepared.

327
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:37,205
It's just eating the petrol in one big lump.
All 20 gallons. (GULPS)

328
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:40,040
That was delicious. I need some more of that.

329
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:46,596
We can't take a taxi so we have to use
an incomprehensible underground system

330
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,565
from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon.

331
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,116
Lyon down there.

332
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:56,883
I've done the calculations on my phone.
It's doing 19 miles to the gallon.

333
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:02,201
Bearing in mind we're only cruising,
it drinks like an Aston should.

334
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:07,798
And James refuses to run on television.

335
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:12,882
- James and Richard are on the underground.
- Two stops, 15 minutes to do it in.

336
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,402
I admit, it is a bit tight.

337
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,684
- Hammond, will you hurry up?
- Shut up.

338
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:24,596
- We're catching a train.
- I wanted to make life difficult.

339
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:28,646
- How long have you got?
- Minutes. If we don't catch this train...

340
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:34,598
- If you don't catch it, you lose the race.
- The longer I talk to you, the less likely it is.

341
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:38,919
- Now I've lost James.
- (JEREMY LAUGHS)

342
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:48,155
- You've caught it, then?
- We'll be accelerating up to 200mph.

343
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:50,682
Will you get 200mph out of your head?

344
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:54,522
- The train does not go 200mph.
- 186, then.

345
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:58,999
- Not as fast as a DB9.
- It's a lot faster than you'll be going.

346
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:02,716
Enjoy your trip.
I'll have another bottle of diet Coke now.

347
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,402
We'll maybe order the wine.
Talk to you later. Bye-bye.

348
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:16,206
We're not the first people to do this, you know.

349
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,564
There's this racing driver here
called Wolf Barnato.

350
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,718
Somebody challenged him
to get from Cannes to England

351
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:28,358
in the time it took the Blue Train,
the tourist train from the south of France,

352
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:31,519
to get from Cannes to Calais.

353
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:35,521
He got to the Conservative Club
in St James's, London,

354
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,724
four minutes before the train reached Calais.

355
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:43,319
- What did he go in?
- A Bentley Speed Six.

356
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:46,517
Was he a seven-foot curly-haired yob?

357
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:49,997
No, one difference is
that he was a rather dashing chap.

358
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:01,363
I'm about halfway into the journey.

359
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:06,681
No backache, I'm not uncomfortable,
I'm not tired, my ears aren't bleeding.

360
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:11,156
So this car is as comfortable
as an Aston should be.

361
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:19,317
One thing I cannot stand
about this car's big brother, the Vanquish,

362
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,284
is its flappy paddle gearbox.

363
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,961
It doesn't work and it breaks all the time.

364
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:28,405
That's because the paddles are attached
to a manual gearbox,

365
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:32,446
whereas in this they're attached
to a six-speed automatic.

366
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,805
You don't get a gear lever. Nothing at all.

367
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:42,563
All the gears are selected by buttons.
Push D and it's a normal automatic.

368
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,400
Just like any other auto you've ever driven.

369
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:50,880
However, when you pull one of the paddles,
like so, it changes down.

370
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:55,802
Pull it again, blips the engine,
drops it into third and then you're off!

371
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,162
Like a scalded cock!

372
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:11,124
- There's his location.
- How has he done that?

373
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:16,315
- By going very, very quickly.
- He must have absolutely caned it from Lyon.

374
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:19,797
- That thing must be on fire.
- It must be glowing red.

375
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:25,162
This gearbox works.
Can you hear it double-declutching?

376
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:29,002
- (ENGINE ROARS)
- Oh! In an auto!

377
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:32,755
It's not only the gearbox that impresses.

378
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,446
Because it's so light and modern,

379
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,725
I thought it would flow from bend to bend
like a Ferrari or a Porsche,

380
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:43,526
like it doesn't really need your help.

381
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:46,599
But actually they've made the steering
quite heavy.

382
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,997
It feels like there's a big lump there.

383
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:52,876
A great big solid British suet pudding
of an engine.

384
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:57,325
And that means when you kiss
an apex just right, and you will,

385
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,603
'cause the handling is brilliant,

386
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:06,002
you feel like you did it, you're responsible,
it was all your own work, not the car's.

387
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,635
It flatters you.

388
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,243
(JEREMY) But it doesn't matter
how good the car is.

389
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:15,240
It's choked by the French speed limits.

390
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:20,680
The Aston was reined in so badly, in fact,

391
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:24,476
that with 200 miles to go, the train tore past.

392
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,639
- We are ahead!
- We are ahead!

393
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:32,276
(JEREMY) Now the fight really hots up.

394
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:36,804
I love today. Today's a big tick in my life box.

395
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:39,561
A big "Yes, that was a good day".

396
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:44,200
Even better, though, if I could win.

397
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,158
So let's get on with it.

398
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:58,200
(JEREMY) I have just one slim chance.

399
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,927
They've got to go further than me.

400
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:08,117
They're on a train which will go where
it wants to go, not where they want to go.

401
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:11,643
Me, on the other hand,
I am proceeding directly,

402
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,923
no more fuel stops,

403
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,884
to Monte Carlo.

404
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:18,481
So don't bet on the train just yet.

405
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:25,843
Now that I'm in the south
on the twisty motorway going up to Monte Carlo,

406
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,118
the car's changed from
a comfortable long-distance cruiser

407
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:33,996
into being this kind of savage sports car.

408
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:38,285
It feels like a brute, which is
exactly what an Aston should feel like.

409
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:44,120
(RICHARD) With 100 miles to go,
the train slows down along the coast

410
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,323
and the gap is starting to shrink.

411
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,756
At Nice, even though
we're just 15 miles from Monte Carlo,

412
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,441
we need to make another train change.

413
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,597
- Stop pacing now.
- I can't.

414
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:01,684
I don't just like this car. I love it.

415
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,645
- Jeremy's going, "Grrrr!"
- I know.

416
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:13,646
It feels like motoring perfection.

417
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:18,642
If you don't mind just getting out of the way,
Frenchie, I've got a train to catch.

418
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:38,244
- What do you think?
- Keep going up.

419
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,716
This is it. This is it.

420
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,166
- Come on, James. To lose it now...
- Sodding bag!

421
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,726
Come on. Last bit. It is down here.

422
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:54,844
Come on!

423
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:01,522
Why didn't we bring a map?

424
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,281
James, come on!

425
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:07,357
Oh, that's bad.

426
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:12,119
Oh. I haven't the heart to tell him.

427
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,485
- It's all over, May.
- Oh, cock.

428
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,718
- Evening.
- Have you noticed something here?

429
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:26,324
- You two look stressed. I'm relaxed.
- There is a degree of perspiration.

430
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,478
The important thing we've proved

431
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:33,641
is that no matter how good public transport is,
how much it runs like clockwork,

432
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:36,719
it'll never be a match for a car.

433
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:41,803
(JEREMY) And what a car
we used to prove the point.

434
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,561
The fly-spattered DB9,

435
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,241
which isn't just better than a train...

436
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:53,239
It's more lovable and more rounded
than a Bentley Continental GT.

437
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,046
It's better than a Ferrari 575.

438
00:33:56,207 --> 00:34:00,041
It's better than a Vanquish.
It's prettier, with a better gearbox.

439
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:06,237
And at £103,000 it's considerably
less expensive than all its rivals.

440
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,398
You know the best thing about it?

441
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:11,718
It's a proper, pukka, hundred per cent,

442
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:17,883
real, fabulous, glorious,
exquisite, magnificent Aston Martin.

443
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:28,364
If you want to get to Monte Carlo slightly
faster than on a train, buy an Aston Martin.

444
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,405
That's the sort of advice
we've become famous for.

445
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,798
Time to find out
about the most important skill of all.

446
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:40,406
Driving. It's sort of what we do,
this being a car show and everything.

447
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,320
Today is a quiet day
at the "Top Gear" test track.

448
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:48,720
So the Stig is keeping its hand in
by hammering out a few laps in a Noble M400.

449
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,684
Here it comes.

450
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:55,045
Ooh, 126 on a damp track. That is fantastic.

451
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:59,120
That is race car driving. Accurate, precise, fast.

452
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:02,359
It's what the Stig's for. It's not what we're for.

453
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:07,802
What "Top Gear" presenters do is TV driving.

454
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:11,965
It's never gonna get you a great lap time,

455
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,687
but it sure is fantastic to look at.

456
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:20,845
What we're doing
is make life as hard as possible

457
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:24,317
and see how it behaves
in extreme circumstances.

458
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,558
In this case, pretty well.

459
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:30,036
It's easier with something like this.

460
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:33,643
It's the Vauxhall Monaro VXR.

461
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:37,516
Jeremy tested one of these last year
and he absolutely loved it.

462
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,838
This is the new, even more mental one.

463
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,436
If you take those three qualities,

464
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:47,917
bravery, thinking big and TV driving,

465
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,078
and put them all together,

466
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,681
the results can be spectacular.

467
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:58,080
As Jeremy proved with a Lotus Exige
and a little help from the army.

468
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:07,080
(JEREMY) This is it. The Exige.

469
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:13,126
It weighs less than a ton
but you get 190 brake horsepower.

470
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:18,798
That's like putting a Saturn 5 rocket
in a food blender.

471
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:29,676
It does 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds.

472
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:34,884
Flat out, you'll be going 147.

473
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,035
And it's quite a sophisticated engine.

474
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:47,916
You get two camshafts,
one for economy and one for power.

475
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:52,478
And there's a Lotus computer
which manages the transition between the two.

476
00:36:53,887 --> 00:37:00,565
You get to 6,200rpm when a normal engine
would be running out of steam.

477
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:02,718
Here we go.

478
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,119
There's actually a jerk
as it goes onto the power cam

479
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,801
and you get even more!

480
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:14,038
Oh!

481
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,683
The best thing is
when you drop down a gear

482
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:22,396
to go round a corner on a track like this,

483
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:26,799
it always stays above that magical 6,200rpm

484
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,845
so you've always got the power.

485
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,845
Oh-ho! Ha-ha!

486
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:38,006
But strangely, speed is not the key to this car.

487
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:43,799
And despite the rather steep £30,000 price tag,
nor is sophistication.

488
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:49,200
Certainly you don't look very sophisticated
when you're getting out of it.

489
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:53,245
And then there's the interior
you've left behind.

490
00:37:54,527 --> 00:38:00,477
Yes, you've got a stereo that plays MP3s,
and air conditioning and electric windows.

491
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:06,244
But all these things are optional extras
and so are the carpets and even the sun visors.

492
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:10,437
To get an idea
of just how spartan this thing is,

493
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:13,679
you need to look through the rear window.

494
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:18,318
Back there you've got chicken wire,
Bacofoil and Tupperware.

495
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:21,445
Like peering into your granny's kitchen cabinet.

496
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:28,158
So if it's not built for speed or comfort,
what's this car for, then?

497
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,401
Well, um... this.

498
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,677
It corners like a housefly.

499
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:44,681
It's not just better than an Elite,
but just about anything.

500
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:46,838
And here's why.

501
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:56,405
The front splitter and rear spoiler
work to create real downforce

502
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,240
like you get with a Formula One car.

503
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:06,280
Its tyres are as slick as the law allows
and you get racing suspension.

504
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:12,118
Add that lot together
and the effect is astonishing.

505
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:15,483
Everything just goes mental!

506
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:21,324
To come up with something to match it,
you have to think vertically.

507
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:33,798
This might do the trick.

508
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,197
It's an Apache helicopter gunship.

509
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:43,082
It's not the fastest helicopter in the world,
it'll only do 163mph,

510
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,522
and nor is it the most manoeuvrable.

511
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:50,844
But it is the ugliest
and it does pack the deadliest punch.

512
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:56,319
It carries 12 Hellfire missiles, 72 rockets,

513
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:59,877
and has a cannon which points
wherever the pilot is looking

514
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:04,120
and fires ten high-explosive rounds a second.

515
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:10,644
The thing that interests me most
about the Apache, though, is its radar.

516
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:14,720
You can pop up
from behind a tree or a hill 8km away.

517
00:40:14,887 --> 00:40:20,166
It'll have a look at the battlefield,
it'll recognise 256 targets,

518
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:25,401
prioritise the 16 most dangerous
at that given moment and destroy all of them.

519
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,242
And it'll do all that in 28 seconds.

520
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:35,718
Great, but in a single lap of our track,
can it get missile lock on our Lotus?

521
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:42,567
The best helicopter gunship in the world,
flown by the best pilots, the British Army...

522
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:50,965
...against the best-handling car in the world,
driven by an idiot.

523
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,960
They'd win easily if they went a long way away,

524
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:58,598
but we've instructed the pilots
to stay within the confines of the track.

525
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,917
Let's go.

526
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,965
Target is identified.

527
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:13,606
That is not something you see every day,
a gunship in your rear-view mirror.

528
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:19,439
I'm gonna turn round and go the other way.
Hope we're ready for that.

529
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:25,162
I'm not exactly a tank, matey boy.

530
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:30,918
Because this is black and plastic,
it's hard to get radar lock.

531
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:34,636
It's like an F117 Nighthawk.

532
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:42,402
It's not that I'm an overgrown schoolboy
or anything, but this is really good fun.

533
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,842
I can out-brake
and I can out-turn the helicopter.

534
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,035
One and a half seconds
after I make the move,

535
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:55,244
you look in the mirror and there he is.

536
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:12,006
At one point, I hid
beneath its soft American underbelly.

537
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,366
But it just blew me out again.

538
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:18,483
He's moving in the downdraught!

539
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:32,927
That helicopter is the ugliest machine
I have ever seen.

540
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,758
It's so ugly it's almost beautiful.
Not when it's in your rear-view mirror.

541
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:51,641
It's right behind me!

542
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:58,955
Epic stuff. The Stig has seen the Monaro
and is pointing and grunting at it.

543
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:02,756
So we've had to swap -
not a bad swap, though - for this.

544
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:06,556
The Noble M400. We like this car.

545
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:09,195
Technically, it is a road car...

546
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:13,519
until, that is, it gets the faintest whiff
of a racetrack.

547
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,927
Then it's a race car.

548
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:20,875
Who would have thought that back there
was a Ford V6?

549
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:27,316
It's shoving out a mind-bending
425 brake horsepower,

550
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:33,926
which means 0 to 60 is done and dusted
in three and a half seconds.

551
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,242
Of course, Stig's not
the only racing driver around here.

552
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:43,444
There was one occasion a while ago

553
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:48,203
when I had to do a birthday tribute
to the Renault Espace...

554
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:52,042
and I had a good idea to sort of liven things up.

555
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:58,567
(RICHARD) You can't say a car has really arrived

556
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:01,719
until it gets its own classic racing series.

557
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,685
There's the historic
Ferrari-Maserati championship

558
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:08,042
and Aston Martin and Jaguar have one.

559
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:09,799
They all do them.

560
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:16,122
And so we come to the inaugural Historic
People Carrier Racing Championship, um... race.

561
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:21,765
We think this sport has great promise.

562
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:26,682
It'll be cheap, exciting
and it's open to minicabbers and dads.

563
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:29,156
Just look at the line-up.

564
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:37,037
It should also be a good laugh,
especially when you see what's taking part.

565
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:42,644
As well as two Espaces,
we've got the Toyota Space Cruiser,

566
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:48,325
a car once described by consumer experts
as "highly unstable".

567
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:54,357
The Mitsubishi Space Wagon, the lowest car
here. That's got to be good for handling.

568
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,360
Then we come to this, the Toyota Previa.

569
00:44:57,527 --> 00:45:02,885
Now, this one has an ace up its sleeve
because it's mid-engine...

570
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:06,398
...just like a Ferrari.

571
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:12,357
And finally the Nissan Serena, for many years
Britain's slowest-accelerating car,

572
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:16,600
with a 0-to-60 time of 28 agonising seconds.

573
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:20,085
All of them picked up
for a few hundred quid apiece.

574
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,525
We really want to put this race series on the map.

575
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:30,442
To show we're not messing about,
we've got some serious driving talent.

576
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:34,718
Tim Harvey,
former British touring car champion.

577
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:40,403
Matt Neal, former independent
British touring car champion.

578
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,836
Anthony Reed, reigning independent
touring car champion

579
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,601
and Race of Champions... champion.

580
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:51,603
Rob Huff, Seat Cupra Championship champion.

581
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:57,476
And Tom Chilton, who one day
probably will be a champion.

582
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:00,926
Champion.

583
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:17,200
This is very, very exciting.
I'm with some of the country's top racing drivers.

584
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,680
I was in silver Espace, No. 1,

585
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:27,557
but Rob Huff in the diesel Serena
went for my jugular right from the off.

586
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,602
Really a pretty brutal start.

587
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:35,805
The racing rules were simple.
15 laps and no body contact.

588
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,919
But touring car drivers always forget that last bit.

589
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,638
Obviously you do get a bit of lean
in people carrier racing.

590
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,561
As they go into the top turn,
bit of four-wheel drift.

591
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:53,718
I'm getting understeer.

592
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:56,799
I'm being leant on heavily by the Toyota.

593
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:02,956
The Serena just a great big lump,
like somebody's left a barn on the track.

594
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:07,723
How am I gonna get round that thing? Like that.

595
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:10,685
Soon both Espaces were fighting for the lead.

596
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,963
I'm in third gear and it's cost me.

597
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:17,960
Ooh, that's cost me two places, that mistake.

598
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,836
And Matt Neal's Space Cruiser
was more like a spacehopper.

599
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:30,523
I'm using the Toyota to steer the Espace,

600
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:33,281
countering my terrible understeer problems.

601
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:38,726
This is not obviously
a usual way to drive a family vehicle.

602
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:40,923
Oh, this is big!

603
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:47,443
Yes! (LAUGHS)

604
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:49,598
That's two of them gone.

605
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:54,887
By now, it has to be said,
there was a smattering of body contact.

606
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:57,880
Yes!

607
00:47:58,047 --> 00:48:03,485
But you always get teething problems
in the early days of any historic race series.

608
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,802
Come on!

609
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:13,405
Right, I'll have him for that. Here we go.

610
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:24,635
My Espace made mincemeat of Tim Harvey's
Space Wagon as we headed for the finish.

611
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:28,800
This is the best form of racing ever devised.

612
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:33,959
Now it's Espace on Espace.

613
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:39,158
We've stayed at the front.

614
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:44,401
Second. First and second for the Espaces.
What a great victory.

615
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,241
What a great day.

616
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:53,716
You see, they were a multi-purpose vehicle

617
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:57,880
and we tried almost everything with them -
carrying families, dogs -

618
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:01,198
but there was one purpose
we left unexplored until now.

619
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,959
We've started something.

620
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:06,881
Historic people carrier racing
could be the way forward.

621
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:10,801
Not with this one, though. That's a bit spent.

622
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:14,243
After that film
we appealed for people carrier owners

623
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:16,523
to help us get the race series going.

624
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,761
We were absolutely inundated
with literally no responses whatsoever.

625
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,157
Hang on. Here he comes.

626
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,240
One minute 36. Good, Stig. And in the wet, too.

627
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:34,197
Now, those humble MPVs teach us another lesson
about being a "Top Gear" presenter.

628
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:39,566
You don't always need the most expensive
supercars to get the best stories.

629
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:44,721
We proved that when we tried to buy
three Porsches for scrapyard money

630
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:46,878
and then keep them going.

631
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:54,043
This is Exchange Square, in the heart
of Europe's biggest financial district.

632
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:59,679
It's the spiritual home of hedges,
stocks, futures... and, of course, Porsches.

633
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,683
Though probably not ones like this.

634
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:06,806
It's what I bought, though. A 23-year-old 924,

635
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:09,640
the Porsche that was designed for Everyman.

636
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,799
I didn't spend 1,500 quid on my 924.

637
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,162
I didn't even spend a grand.

638
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:19,639
750 quid... on the Porsche.
750 quid. And the lights pop up.

639
00:50:19,807 --> 00:50:23,641
I was feeling pleased
until I saw what James had bought.

640
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:29,443
You've got a 944! In white.

641
00:50:29,607 --> 00:50:33,600
- This looks all right from a big distance.
- What do you mean?

642
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,758
It looks all right close up.

643
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:39,078
It's got a 2.5- litre four-cylinder engine

644
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:42,637
and it's a proper Porsche-developed engine,

645
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:45,799
whereas your car has the engine from a VW van.

646
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:50,483
- What's His Nibs gonna have got?
- I think he'll have got one of those.

647
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:54,083
(JEREMY) In fact,
His Nibs had been rather more ambitious.

648
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:57,523
- (HORN)
- Oh, my... He's got a 928!

649
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,965
Absolutely. A 928.
No Everyman Porsche for me.

650
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:06,757
This one has a 4.7- litre V8.

651
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:10,397
Gentlemen, I give you a timeless classic.

652
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,558
A proper Porsche.

653
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:16,003
Jeremy, you got a 928 on our budget?

654
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:20,638
Beneath this rather faded, ruined exterior

655
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:24,004
beats a heart of pure arthritis.

656
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,965
Come and have a look at this.

657
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,118
It's even full of junk!

658
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:32,040
These water bottles are a little bit necessary...

659
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:35,916
- Ah, got you.
...in order to make it move.

660
00:51:36,087 --> 00:51:38,203
Maybe you've overreached yourself?

661
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,040
I've seen one for more advertised as spares.

662
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:44,404
Let's see what you've got. This looks quite good.

663
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:47,718
- From a distance.
- It's been in a canal at some point.

664
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:51,516
Hey, now, survey the magnificence.

665
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:56,556
This one has the van engine.
It has a good, simple van engine.

666
00:51:56,727 --> 00:52:00,083
- We got three Porsches.
- We did get three Porsches.

667
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:04,718
Pretty ropey. Scrap. Mine looks pretty good.

668
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:08,084
Let's have a look at what the challenge is.
Thank you.

669
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:10,044
Thank you.

670
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:13,916
"Veteran cars can make it
from London to Brighton, but can you?"

671
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,840
- No.
- No. But why do it?

672
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:20,761
"Five points are lost
for each time you open the bonnet."

673
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,646
That's thousands for you.
Throw the bonnet away.

674
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,799
"Meet on the sea front
to receive your next challenge,

675
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,356
"assuming you make it... Jeremy."

676
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,518
Brighton from here in our Porsches.

677
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:34,485
- How far's that?
- It's 70 miles.

678
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:38,037
- I'm very confident.
- See you at the seaside, chaps.

679
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:41,085
No, you won't, but all right, let's go.

680
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:43,522
A wide range of warning lights already.

681
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:49,125
We are on the way to Brighton... in our Porsches.

682
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:53,880
This was a hugely advanced car
when it came out.

683
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:59,405
Polyurethane bumpers,
first car ever with passive rear-wheel steering.

684
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:04,163
I've always, always... Oh, my God, I've got steam.

685
00:53:04,327 --> 00:53:09,401
- Is Jeremy breaking down?
- There's a lot of steam coming out of the bonnet.

686
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:12,320
Did he say "I've got speed" or "I've got steam"?

687
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:17,959
(JEREMY) No, it was definitely steam
and it was erupting after just two miles.

688
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:19,765
Garage.

689
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:22,236
Oh, there is a god.

690
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,277
- We won't need all this.
- No, no.

691
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,484
- Is it really coming out?
- Faster than it's going in.

692
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:33,638
Needs a bit more.

693
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:36,560
It's leaking faster and faster.

694
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:39,480
Is there this much water in England?

695
00:53:39,647 --> 00:53:41,478
And still it goes in.

696
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:44,639
Every single fluid is gushing out of it.

697
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:47,719
Can you see if they've got any eggs, Richard?

698
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:50,321
Jeremy and Richard have gone to buy an egg

699
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:54,719
so we can use the old trick
of mixing the egg white into the coolant system

700
00:53:54,887 --> 00:53:57,082
and that will find... and block.

701
00:53:57,247 --> 00:54:01,365
This... this is Hammond's contribution.
He's bought a chocolate egg.

702
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:05,076
- Eggs work. That's the only one I found.
- Put it in.

703
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:07,920
15 litres and it's full.

704
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:11,363
- Have you seen this?
- (BLEEP)

705
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,283
There's another puddle.

706
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:17,519
It's fine. It's just a little... It's a dribble.

707
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:22,477
With all the water from the Thames Valley
in my cooling system, and a chocolate egg,

708
00:54:22,647 --> 00:54:25,081
we were back on the road.

709
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:27,283
We're off.

710
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:30,484
That was a complete farce.

711
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,525
Where did this car pass its MOT?

712
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,444
Iran, perhaps?

713
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,963
Our progress was good
for, ooh, another two miles

714
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,642
and then it was James's turn
to grind the convoy to a halt

715
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,798
with a puncture.

716
00:54:45,967 --> 00:54:50,279
Guys, who thought this was a sensible idea,
to buy three Porsches?

717
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:54,963
- We've done four miles.
- You could have had a puncture in any car.

718
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:57,118
But you didn't.

719
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,999
- He can't open the boot.
- Is that boot broken?

720
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:05,797
(JEREMY) Luckily we were able to hot-wire
the remains of the remote boot release.

721
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,798
- Anything?
- Yes.

722
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:09,958
There you go, James.

723
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:12,595
Unfortunately the spare was flat and bald

724
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:17,795
so we had to take the original punctured tyre
up the road to get it fixed.

725
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:20,481
Mine's working perfectly now. It is.

726
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,087
- I'll race you to Brighton.
- All right.

727
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:29,198
How many points off is this?

728
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,120
- And where's my eclair?
- He only gave me two.

729
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,802
Unfortunately,
while I was gorging myself on chocolate,

730
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:40,245
down the road my car was emptying itself
of yet more fluids.

731
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,126
- Oh, my God.
- Is that petrol?

732
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:47,485
- It's leaking petrol out of the back.
- Should we stand away from it?

733
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:49,603
And steam coming out of the front.

734
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,359
It's still leaking.

735
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:55,759
That might explain the poor fuel consumption
I got coming to London.

736
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:57,645
And the fire following you.

737
00:55:57,807 --> 00:56:00,844
Happily, the brave men of Brixton
helped us fix it...

738
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:05,079
...and once again we were under way,

739
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:07,397
although a little behind schedule.

740
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:12,641
In fact, we'd set off six hours earlier
and we were still in South London

741
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:15,480
and things were still going wrong.

742
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:18,002
What's this?

743
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:23,925
While I was laughing at James, though,
my car went wrong again.

744
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:27,762
You won't believe it.
My coolant warning light's come on.

745
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:30,316
It's going to break.

746
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:36,562
We'd asked ourselves whether you could buy
a decent Porsche for less than £1,500.

747
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,446
The answer was becoming obvious.

748
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,836
(JEREMY AND RICHARD LAUGH)

749
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:48,205
It was hanging off in the wind.
Hey, that's five points.

750
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,404
- How many points is that?
- It's overheating again.

751
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:55,276
- That's five points, then.
- It's boiled 15 litres of water.

752
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:59,042
- My kettle couldn't boil them in three miles.
- This is bigger.

753
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:03,200
This time we're gonna go
more than three miles without stopping.

754
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:10,159
(RICHARD) So this is it, the long run.
Brighton, here we come.

755
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:13,125
We're going by Porsche power!

756
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,278
At last, the open road to Brighton.

757
00:57:16,447 --> 00:57:19,644
(JEREMY) Hey, I'll tell you something interesting.

758
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,765
As I speak to you now, all is well.

759
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,835
Yes, we were on our way.
Nothing could stop us now.

760
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:36,599
(RATTLING)

761
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,440
Once again I see through the traffic ahead

762
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:43,122
what appears to be a small -
no, make that a large - fire.

763
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,043
Oh, dear. Jeremy's car
does appear to be genuinely broken.

764
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:53,716
It's... I can't see anything.

765
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:59,796
I've had steam from the front, water
from underneath and now smoke from the back.

766
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:05,321
Will it get to Brighton? Oh, steam from the front.

767
00:58:06,647 --> 00:58:12,324
Finally, seven hours and six breakdowns
after we started, we hit the motorway...

768
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:17,886
...where, apart from its structural weaknesses,

769
00:58:18,047 --> 00:58:20,800
James's 944 was going well.

770
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,323
And surprisingly, mine wasn't holding up
too badly either.

771
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:28,480
For the first time today
I have no warning light on the dashboard.

772
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:30,046
All is well.

773
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,562
Apart from the rear windscreen wiper

774
00:58:32,727 --> 00:58:35,878
and the electric window and electric door mirrors

775
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:38,959
and the stereo and the clock
and the air conditioning

776
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:41,118
and the speedometer and mileometer

777
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:43,676
and the piston ring that's eating the engine

778
00:58:43,847 --> 00:58:46,520
and the big smoke coming out of the back.

779
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:49,803
Everything's fine.

780
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:54,802
Hammond's lowly 924, though,
was the star of the show.

781
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:59,961
See, I'm cruising on the motorway -
I'm overtaking on the motorway -

782
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:04,040
in my Porsche for 750 quid.

783
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:06,319
It's fantastic.

784
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:10,036
(RICHARD) An hour later
we were just outside Brighton.

785
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,641
Guess what's missing from this picture.

786
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:17,520
We should go back and look for him.
That would be the caring thing to do.

787
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,645
But he wouldn't do it for me.

788
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:24,044
We're at Brighton.

789
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:27,995
I knew we'd make it, obviously.
I knew I'd get here. Yes!

790
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:34,758
Apart from losing Jeremy, the only problem
we had was James's enormous new spoiler.

791
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,126
Three, two, one...

792
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:53,041
1,500-quid Porsches. I'm not sure.

793
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:06,563
Our rendezvous point was the sea front,
where there was still no sign of Clarkson.

794
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:10,118
I think he'll still turn up.

795
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:15,202
Let's look at the next challenge,
work out whether or not he's likely to be in it.

796
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:18,359
- Can we have a challenge, man?
- Thank you.

797
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:24,676
OK. Challenge Two. "It's max Porsche time.

798
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:28,157
"You must use the change
from your £1,500 budget

799
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:31,558
"to modify your car and generally improve it.

800
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:33,797
"Reconvene at the 'Top Gear' base,

801
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:37,755
"where an independent adjudicator
from the Porsche Owners Club

802
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:39,918
"will judge your work."

803
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:43,124
- Have you got any change?
- A bit of change, yeah.

804
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:46,120
- I'm fairly confident Jeremy hasn't.
- I doubt it.

805
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:48,198
(RICHARD) Speaking of the devil...

806
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:51,040
That's the fastest your car's been all day.

807
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:54,517
It's still using more fuel than mine
sitting on there.

808
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:57,247
What have you got to say about your car?

809
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:02,037
- The bonnet hasn't been up.
- Has it welded itself shut?

810
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:07,327
After the other times, I didn't lift it.
There was such a big bang.

811
01:01:07,487 --> 01:01:11,036
You don't know about the next challenge,
do you?

812
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:16,406
- What is the next challenge?
- Spend the change from your 1,500 budget.

813
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:19,877
You've got to improve your car
as much as possible

814
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:24,245
and have it judged by an adjudicator
from the Porsche Owners Club.

815
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:28,844
You can spend all the money
left from the 1,500 quid on your car.

816
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:33,159
- How much have you got?
- I spent 750 quid on my car.

817
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:36,558
So I've got 750 quid to spend on improving it.

818
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:42,279
I spent 900 quid on my car, which gives me
600 quid to spend improving it.

819
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:45,200
- How much did you spend?
- (MUMBLES) 1,500.

820
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,766
- Sorry?
- 1,500.

821
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:51,762
1,500? So you've got nothing
to spend on improving it.

822
01:01:51,927 --> 01:01:56,603
- It's not improving it...
- It's getting it going.

823
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,044
A round of applause.

824
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:09,564
Now to business. The scores.
After that Brighton run...

825
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:15,563
I didn't open my bonnet once so I don't
lose any points. That's a zero in there.

826
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:20,642
James, you had one breakdown.
That counts, so that's minus 5 for you.

827
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:26,120
- Jeremy, you had seven...
- I didn't. I had six breakdowns.

828
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:32,157
Six. The AA man came and I said,
"Don't open the bonnet, I'll lose five points."

829
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,795
He was a bit confused, but I said,

830
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:37,606
"The 928's got no cylinder liners

831
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:41,442
"so the broken piston rings
chew the engine to pieces."

832
01:02:41,607 --> 01:02:45,202
I said, "You can't fix that at the side of the A23..."

833
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:49,201
- How was that not a breakdown?
- Come on.

834
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:52,120
- Does that count?
- (AUDIENCE SHOUTING)

835
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:55,245
It's a breakdown. It's a breakdown.

836
01:02:55,407 --> 01:03:00,879
As I was saying, minus 35. Great start.

837
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:03,561
Then we addressed the issue of fuel economy.

838
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:07,481
The target here was 25 miles to the gallon
on the trip to Brighton.

839
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:10,241
I did exactly 25 miles to the gallon.

840
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:13,604
That means I scored no points
but I don't lose any points.

841
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:20,764
You, Hammond, did 27 miles to the gallon,
which gives you plus 10 points. 2mpg over.

842
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:23,680
Jeremy, you did seven miles to the gallon.

843
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:26,042
No. Again, no.

844
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,883
I put the petrol into the tank, it went straight out.
It didn't go near the engine.

845
01:03:31,047 --> 01:03:33,686
It didn't go back in the pump.

846
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:36,315
You're not gonna... It's not seven.

847
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:39,797
Thank you. So as we were saying, minus 90.

848
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:44,876
- Well done.
- Minus... Oh, for God's sake!

849
01:03:45,047 --> 01:03:49,006
Anyway, when we came back
I had the chance to make up some ground

850
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:53,683
because we were given another challenge
which I have here.

851
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:55,838
Let me read it out for you.

852
01:03:56,007 --> 01:04:00,319
"The reason why middle-aged men
such as you buy Porsches

853
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:03,047
"is because they're having a mid-life crisis.

854
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:06,438
"Each of you must place an ad
in a lonely hearts column

855
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:08,996
"and refer to the car you've bought.

856
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:11,317
"Five points for each reply."

857
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:14,559
James, why don't you read out
your advertisement

858
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:18,402
that you placed, genuinely, in wherever it was?

859
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:22,765
"41-year-old man with sensitive hair, dri...

860
01:04:24,847 --> 01:04:29,045
"41-year-old man with sensitive hair,
drives Porsche 944 Lux,

861
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:31,198
"seeks brewery heiress or similar

862
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,484
"with liberal attitude
to motorcycle parts in the bath."

863
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:37,002
- How many replies did you get?
- Three.

864
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:40,125
Three replies, so that's 15 points.

865
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:45,077
- OK. Hammond?
- Well, my advert went like this.

866
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,477
"Porsche 924 owner..." Got it in first.

867
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:51,276
"...good-looking, mild-mannered,
snappy dresser, 5'11"..."

868
01:04:52,687 --> 01:04:55,759
- 5'11"?
- Mild-mannered?

869
01:04:55,927 --> 01:05:01,240
If I put "angry short bloke"
I won't get any replies. Big it up, talk it up.

870
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:04,160
- How many replies did you get?
- None.

871
01:05:04,327 --> 01:05:05,919
(LAUGHTER)

872
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:09,238
- So that's a big fat nought for you.
- What about you?

873
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:14,561
My ad: "Porsche 928 driver -
that's the V8 one..."

874
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:18,720
- Did you actually put that?
- Yes. "That's the V8 one."

875
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:22,800
"Tall, slim hips, likes books
with speedboats on the cover,

876
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:25,640
"would like friendship, maybe more."

877
01:05:25,807 --> 01:05:29,004
Do you know where he put that advert?

878
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:31,920
He put that in the Men Seeking Men column.

879
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:39,037
A moment of genius, that, 'cause I recognised
that men would like the V8 thing.

880
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:43,405
- But did they?
- Yeah, got two replies. So, plus 10.

881
01:05:43,567 --> 01:05:45,205
For me.

882
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:48,161
We must get on with our Porsche story.

883
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,797
If you weren't watching earlier,
each of us was given £1,500

884
01:05:51,967 --> 01:05:54,356
and told to go off and buy a Porsche.

885
01:05:54,527 --> 01:05:56,836
We were told to drive them to Brighton.

886
01:05:57,007 --> 01:06:02,479
Then we were told to spend the change
from our 1,500 quid on doing the cars up.

887
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:04,683
That was a problem for Jeremy

888
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:07,884
because he'd blown all 1,500 quid
on his rubbish 928

889
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,959
and it arrived in Brighton on a low-loader,

890
01:06:11,127 --> 01:06:13,595
which meant he had to get it going first

891
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:18,204
and then do it up on a budget of nothing.
Tall order.

892
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:22,280
(RICHARD) There are three shapes there,
so presumably Jeremy's car made it.

893
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:25,280
Let's see what changes James has made.

894
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,039
It looks the same.

895
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:29,562
- Is this putty?
- No. Bathroom sealant.

896
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:33,163
- (LAUGHING)
- What did the car have in it?

897
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:35,124
I'd run out of money.

898
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:38,324
(JAMES) OK, the interior
was a Homebase bodge job

899
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:43,481
but my secret weapon was
the gleaming condition of my engine bay.

900
01:06:43,647 --> 01:06:45,797
- How did you clean it?
- With a man.

901
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:53,362
He's spent his money on a man. You think
the judge will only be interested in concours?

902
01:06:53,527 --> 01:06:58,123
- I'd forgotten it was a Porsche judge.
- I've been thinking ahead here.

903
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,246
Right.

904
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:06,437
(JAMES) Hammond had given his 924
sporting credentials it didn't deserve.

905
01:07:07,447 --> 01:07:09,483
- Look at that!
- It's the flames.

906
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:12,559
I did those with help from an art college friend.

907
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:14,763
They're the Gulf racing colours.

908
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:21,082
- I've just seen the gear knob.
- That's quite a nice addition.

909
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:24,603
I spent my money in the pursuit of performance.

910
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:28,999
It's been lowered, it's on new springs,
new suspension, lower-profile tyres.

911
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,919
- It's a track car.
- James.

912
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:34,079
- Oh, no!
- Have you put a turbo on it?

913
01:07:34,247 --> 01:07:35,839
- No.
- Is this the turbo?

914
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:39,317
No, none of those are the turbo.

915
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:42,957
- Well done.
- Good job you fitted the air intake.

916
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:46,915
(JAMES) Right, let's see
what Jeremy has achieved with no money.

917
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:49,601
Blackboard paint!

918
01:07:49,767 --> 01:07:53,919
Jeremy, you're supposed to put the underseal
on the bottom of the car.

919
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:57,045
- You know those old Capris?
- That's what I wanted.

920
01:07:57,207 --> 01:08:02,235
I thought I'd copy it, only I went over a bit,
so I just kept going.

921
01:08:02,407 --> 01:08:04,716
Whereas this looks much better.

922
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:07,481
- How many cylinders?
- Six and three quarters.

923
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:10,559
I'm less worried, having seen yours.

924
01:08:10,727 --> 01:08:14,163
(JEREMY) Laughing at each other
was not a scientific measure.

925
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:17,444
Our efforts had to be judged
by the chairman of judges

926
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:22,123
of the famously fastidious
Porsche Owners Club of Great Britain.

927
01:08:22,287 --> 01:08:25,677
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- May. M-A-Y.

928
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:28,680
And the registration, please, Mr May.

929
01:08:28,847 --> 01:08:32,157
- I don't know.
- Could you open the tailgate for me?

930
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:34,761
I'll have a go.

931
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:36,724
Don't break it.

932
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:42,007
The original door pull was missing
and it's a difficult part to get hold of,

933
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:46,922
so I substituted the kitchen unit drop handle.

934
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:50,045
And that is the rear windscreen wiper.

935
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:54,723
- It all looks like Tippex to me.
- That's because it is Tippex.

936
01:08:54,887 --> 01:08:57,640
- Oh, really?
- (JEREMY) Now for the big moment.

937
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:02,198
- Come and see this, gentlemen.
- James's sparkling engine bay.

938
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:05,882
- All original fittings?
- Yes, simply cleaned and polished.

939
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:10,359
- No fancy tricks, just elbow grease.
- That's what we like to see.

940
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:16,200
I'm worried about the originality of the colour.

941
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:20,804
It's not an original colour.
Have you ever seen a Blackbird, the SR71?

942
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:24,164
- There you go.
- So not original, better.

943
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:29,481
- Could you flip the bonnet up for us? Thanks.
- There you go.

944
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:33,361
- That's my...
- That's rather vulgar.

945
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:38,362
- I think bling.
- I can't give you any points for the seats.

946
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:43,999
But you can't knock any off. There's
nothing wrong with them if they're not there.

947
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:48,399
- Original stickers.
- Are they?

948
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,479
- One point for those, then.
- Right.

949
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:54,480
Probably the most valuable bit of the car.

950
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,646
That's not real.

951
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:58,445
- What does it do?
- Nothing.

952
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:03,522
(JEREMY) While the judges retired to do
their scoring, we dived into the next challenge.

953
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:06,121
"All your cars have a sporting pedigree.

954
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:08,926
"Each Porsche must set a lap time
with the Stig.

955
01:10:09,087 --> 01:10:12,796
"You will gain a point
for every second under 1 minute 35,

956
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,197
"lose a point for every second over."

957
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,597
(ENGINE SPLUTTERS THEN STARTS)

958
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:20,440
There, you've started. See the black smoke?

959
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:28,806
- Look at all the smoke!
- It's just mist on a lovely morning.

960
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:35,000
- Look at that!
- It's gassing everything down there.

961
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,919
Stop it.

962
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:39,681
It's going round the corner, James.

963
01:10:39,847 --> 01:10:44,637
- Look at it.
- Let's just ease back a bit.

964
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:47,525
More than that!

965
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:51,477
- What was the time?
- 1.45.

966
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,320
What a machine. What a machine.

967
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,523
- What a stink.
- Let's see yours.

968
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,882
(TYRES SCREECH)

969
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:02,562
Those second-hand tyres are really holding well.

970
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:06,078
Already several seconds ahead.

971
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:11,037
(JEREMY) I wonder if James's grout will hold.

972
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:13,880
A bit of smoke there, James.

973
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:20,076
- It was light. He only had two cylinders left.
- So it did it?

974
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,841
- 1.43.
- That's faster than Jeremy's.

975
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:27,159
- Only two seconds.
- This is everything for me.

976
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:30,160
You need this to work.

977
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:36,038
- It looks smaller because of the tyres.
- Better acceleration.

978
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,198
Exactly. Better acceleration.

979
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:45,526
- It was making a grinding noise.
- There is a wheel bearing issue.

980
01:11:45,687 --> 01:11:48,485
I could replace it or do the suspension.

981
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:51,639
So the wheel may come off.

982
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,241
- And kill the Stig.
- So?

983
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:56,716
It looks good.

984
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:04,525
All of that effort, all of those low-profile tyres...
slower than his.

985
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:08,362
If I'd left it standard
it would have been a lot slower.

986
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,480
(JEREMY) James's gloating
was short-lived, though.

987
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:16,276
Look at what had happened
to his shiny engine bay.

988
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,802
- (LAUGHTER)
- It's not funny.

989
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,606
All he had was a clean engine.

990
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,645
- Have you finished?
- Get your hand off my bonnet.

991
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:28,998
"The next challenge is Elevenses.

992
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:35,436
"Each driver must use his Porsche to see
who can create the longest number 11 skid mark."

993
01:12:35,607 --> 01:12:38,758
- This should be a well-oiled attempt.
- Yeah.

994
01:12:38,927 --> 01:12:42,602
- No shortage of oil under the bonnet.
- Let's see him.

995
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:51,838
Not bad. I've got a tape measure. Grab that.

996
01:12:52,647 --> 01:12:55,764
- Go down.
- I've never seen him be that lairy.

997
01:12:55,927 --> 01:13:00,955
That is 31 feet. Don't tell him that.

998
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,563
You did about four inches.

999
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:07,400
- That's quite good.
- That was me in a Bentley.

1000
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:09,239
Go!

1001
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:14,685
- Amazing.
- Give me the end.

1002
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:19,802
It is 35 feet. He's beaten you.

1003
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:25,121
- He can do something.
- However, my V6 and ¾ is coming.

1004
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:31,681
To be brutally honest, my car,
with its V6 and ¾ engine and automatic gearbox,

1005
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:38,116
can't do smoking starts,
so I'll have to be ingenious.

1006
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:42,485
The life remaining in that car
can now be calculated in yards.

1007
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:46,686
Right, three, two, one, let it rip.

1008
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,757
He's just driven away.

1009
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,316
- Let's give him an inch.
- It's an inch.

1010
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:55,284
- Guys.
- Yeah.

1011
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,245
- That wasn't my best start.
- Look at the result.

1012
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:01,763
I've had a great idea. Stand back.

1013
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:12,397
Imagine what he was like as a child.

1014
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:17,925
If you were from the region of China
just near Tibet, north-east,

1015
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,647
you'd look and go, "Someone write 11."

1016
01:14:20,807 --> 01:14:24,846
- This is all just rubbish.
- That's not an 11, is it?

1017
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:29,046
39... 40... 41... 42 yards.

1018
01:14:30,207 --> 01:14:34,166
(RICHARD) The judges would have to decide
on Jeremy's Asian number 11.

1019
01:14:34,327 --> 01:14:38,445
In the meantime, we had our final challenge
to think about.

1020
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:43,601
"We hope you enjoyed owning your Porsches.
Each of you must now sell your cars.

1021
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:49,000
"Points will be awarded for the money
you make over the £1,500 you spent."

1022
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:53,046
That's not in good shape.
Yours isn't in good shape.

1023
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:56,165
- Mine's got my name on it.
- But we're better off.

1024
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:58,318
I've got my name on it.

1025
01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:02,799
I'll have to find a short bloke
called Richard Hammond who wants a car.

1026
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:05,401
- Who's gonna buy it from me?
- Nobody.

1027
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:09,721
If you want sound car-buying advice

1028
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:15,007
from experts with a combined 40 years
of motoring journalism, look elsewhere.

1029
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:19,482
But no one can say we don't test a car properly.

1030
01:15:19,647 --> 01:15:22,241
Another quality a "Top Gear" presenter needs.

1031
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:25,001
By "properly" I don't just mean how it drives.

1032
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:28,318
What happens if your car
is struck by lightning?

1033
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:30,478
Someone had to find out.

1034
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:34,196
This is the Siemens high-voltage lab in Berlin.

1035
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:37,723
Normally it builds and tests
high-voltage equipment

1036
01:15:37,887 --> 01:15:41,038
for power stations and the national grid.

1037
01:15:41,927 --> 01:15:48,116
These transformers can generate
almost two million volts of pure electricity.

1038
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:52,280
But today they're going to use that electricity
for something else.

1039
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,722
To make lightning.

1040
01:15:56,767 --> 01:16:00,442
They're going to zap me and this car
with 800,000 volts.

1041
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:05,727
Car firms don't test for lightning strikes,
so I've no idea how it'll go.

1042
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:10,039
Right, my life is now in the hands
of "A" level physics.

1043
01:16:11,287 --> 01:16:15,519
The lightning will come out of these transformers
along the wires

1044
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,201
and then shoot down to the car.

1045
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:21,406
(BUZZER)

1046
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:23,000
What was that?

1047
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:30,599
(GERMAN MAN)
OK, I will start to raise the voltage.

1048
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:36,357
He's starting to raise the "woltage".

1049
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:40,318
200,000 volts.

1050
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,717
We had a briefing with the scientist

1051
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:49,800
and he said keep my hands together
towards the centre of the car

1052
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:52,162
and away from any metal objects.

1053
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:54,841
But it's a car. It's made of metal.

1054
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:58,119
400,000 volts.

1055
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,997
I can hear a noise, a buzzing.

1056
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,237
(BUZZING)

1057
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:07,760
600,000 volts.

1058
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:15,045
It's really buzzing now.
I don't know what'll happen when it comes.

1059
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:17,846
I'm about to be hit by lightning.

1060
01:17:18,007 --> 01:17:21,044
It's building and it builds the tension with it.

1061
01:17:21,207 --> 01:17:23,084
It's quite a strange...

1062
01:17:24,487 --> 01:17:27,604
- You can almost feel the tension...
- (CRACKLING)

1063
01:17:33,447 --> 01:17:35,881
Oh, that's scary.

1064
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:43,678
I'm being hit by lightning.

1065
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:50,003
My hands are buzzing.

1066
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,566
Wa-hey!

1067
01:17:55,847 --> 01:17:59,840
It's doing stuff to my car.
I've got "Error" up on the dashboard.

1068
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,201
Handbrake light flashing.

1069
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:08,402
Whoa-ho!

1070
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:19,004
So it works. Assuming I'm not now talking to you
with wings and a harp, I'm alive.

1071
01:18:20,967 --> 01:18:25,040
The question is, is the car?
The electric windows work.

1072
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:27,277
Lights, they work.

1073
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:30,041
Stereo. That's nice. Lovely.

1074
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,004
Indicators. Everything.

1075
01:18:32,167 --> 01:18:34,761
- (ENGINE STARTS)
- And it starts.

1076
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:37,566
It still works. Amazing.

1077
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:43,321
The testing doesn't stop there.

1078
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:48,083
What about driving in crosswinds
behind a 747?

1079
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:57,565
These are General Electric CF6s.

1080
01:18:57,727 --> 01:19:01,925
They're 23 feet long and they weigh six tons.

1081
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:06,516
One engine produces 58,000lb of thrust.

1082
01:19:06,687 --> 01:19:08,962
And this has got four of them.

1083
01:19:09,807 --> 01:19:13,243
But 58,000lb of thrust,
that's kind of meaningless.

1084
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:16,240
How do you get your head
round that sort of power?

1085
01:19:17,807 --> 01:19:24,076
Our plan is to drive a car behind the 747
when the engines are at full power.

1086
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:28,525
The question is, how far can the engines
blow the car off course?

1087
01:19:28,687 --> 01:19:31,121
It's not as easy as you might think.

1088
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:34,802
It's too dangerous to drive them under here
behind the engines.

1089
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:39,995
They have to be well clear. In fact,
they have to be way back here, past the tail.

1090
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:44,922
And then a bit more.
That's a good 50 yards behind the engines.

1091
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:52,156
The first car we'll be subjecting
to a good stiff breeze is this Ford Mondeo.

1092
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:56,286
Modern, aerodynamic,
good at coping with motorway crosswinds.

1093
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:04,916
Right, here we go. The pilot is easing up
the throttle, building up the power.

1094
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:13,363
It's crucial that we release the car
at exactly the right time.

1095
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:17,805
If these engines run at full thrust
for more than 20 seconds,

1096
01:20:17,967 --> 01:20:20,162
they'll start to rip up the runway.

1097
01:20:20,327 --> 01:20:22,795
And then we'll be in trouble.

1098
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:27,399
(PILOT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

1099
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:31,321
OK, the engines are at full power
and here comes the Mondeo.

1100
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:36,322
Can they blow this one-and-a-half-ton car
off course from 50 yards away?

1101
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:42,005
Three, two... Oh, blimeyl There it goesl

1102
01:20:55,047 --> 01:21:00,280
The Mondeo must have been blasted
a good 50 feet, but we haven't finished yet.

1103
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:03,200
That was a modern, aerodynamic car.

1104
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:07,440
Let's see what happens
when we let loose the "Top Gear" crosswind

1105
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:10,724
on something a little more, well, slab-sided.

1106
01:21:10,887 --> 01:21:13,321
A Citroën 2CV.

1107
01:21:13,487 --> 01:21:18,515
Big engine, lightweight hippy car.
This should be fun.

1108
01:21:22,607 --> 01:21:27,920
OK, here we go again.
The engines are up to 58,000lb of thrust.

1109
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:34,122
The car is released. And three, two... Crikeyl

1110
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:41,836
Yes, the 2CVreally doesn't like crosswinds.

1111
01:22:02,847 --> 01:22:04,439
There you go.

1112
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:10,637
Next time you think you might encounter
crosswinds or have to drive behind a 747,

1113
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:14,243
you're better off with a Mondeo than a 2CV.

1114
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:17,517
It's a service we provide, this stuff.

1115
01:22:19,807 --> 01:22:25,279
Those everyday occurrences - lightning strikes,
driving behind a jumbo jet - taken care of.

1116
01:22:25,447 --> 01:22:30,760
Now we come to the final and most important
lesson to learn to be a "Top Gear" presenter.

1117
01:22:30,927 --> 01:22:36,240
It's quite a simple one. Always remember
it's the car and not you that's the star.

1118
01:22:36,407 --> 01:22:40,719
Nothing proves that better than this,
the legendary Toyota pick-up,

1119
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:42,957
the car that refused to die.

1120
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:50,082
(JEREMY) For £1,000,
we got a 13-year-old Hilux diesel

1121
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:53,922
which had done 190,000 miles.

1122
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:59,483
Judging by the state of it,
only ten of them had been done on the road.

1123
01:23:01,487 --> 01:23:03,603
We love cars like this on "Top Gear".

1124
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:07,282
It's why we like the Citroën Berlingo
and the Daihatsu Charade.

1125
01:23:07,447 --> 01:23:10,120
They're simple, honest-to-God engineering.

1126
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:13,358
But this gives us a problem.

1127
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:17,202
When we get a Porsche to test
we find out how fast it goes.

1128
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,598
When we get a Renault Mégane
we find out how safe it is.

1129
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:23,645
But this, as you know, is built for strength.

1130
01:23:23,807 --> 01:23:26,799
So we've got to find out how tough it is.

1131
01:23:27,847 --> 01:23:30,645
That's why we brought it to Bristol.

1132
01:23:33,447 --> 01:23:36,325
This city has an air of solidity about it.

1133
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:40,958
The paving stones, for instance,
are cemented and then nailed in place.

1134
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:46,155
The buildings look planted.
It's a Victorian ode to the test of time.

1135
01:23:47,967 --> 01:23:53,997
So let's find out how the best-built city
in Britain copes with our pick-up truck.

1136
01:23:54,847 --> 01:23:58,840
Now, this, I want to make it plain,
is not Hollywood.

1137
01:23:59,007 --> 01:24:02,886
We're not using stuntmen,
we're not gonna use computer graphics.

1138
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:08,445
We haven't made any mechanical alterations
to the car at all.

1139
01:24:08,607 --> 01:24:11,644
We picked it up from the farmyard
and brought it here.

1140
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:26,444
Ooh, dear, that was a bit uncomfortable.

1141
01:24:33,687 --> 01:24:37,965
It's damaged my spine quite badly, doing this.

1142
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,717
And then it set about damaging Bristol.

1143
01:25:02,727 --> 01:25:05,287
This didn't really hurt it either.

1144
01:25:06,447 --> 01:25:12,044
Yeah, battery's good, radiator's good.
That'll buff out.

1145
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:15,197
- That's got it.
- (ENGINE STARTS)

1146
01:25:21,447 --> 01:25:25,122
Soon we left the city centre
and went to the seaside.

1147
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:31,597
I'd tried careless driving...

1148
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:38,838
...so I thought I'd try a spot of careless parking.

1149
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:50,164
Look what's happened. This is the Severn
Estuary, home to the world's second-biggest tide.

1150
01:25:51,327 --> 01:25:54,239
40 feet, and it moves at 8mph.

1151
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:57,797
That's why the RNLI
have tethered my car in place.

1152
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,876
I'm not gonna get that out for hours.

1153
01:26:02,887 --> 01:26:05,276
(ECHOING) Damn!

1154
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:16,280
The lifeboatmen and locals
thought it was all a huge laugh.

1155
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:18,915
- That'll drown my car?
- Oh, yes.

1156
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:22,318
- When will I be able to get it out again?
- A few hours.

1157
01:26:23,327 --> 01:26:26,603
Windscreen's still in.

1158
01:26:30,927 --> 01:26:33,316
But then disaster.

1159
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:39,965
The ropes tying it down had snapped.

1160
01:26:44,727 --> 01:26:48,197
- It could be...
- It could be right out in the main channel.

1161
01:26:49,327 --> 01:26:52,364
I don't think you quite got this.

1162
01:26:52,527 --> 01:26:55,917
We've got to get it back.

1163
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:07,046
Very kindly, they waded out
to see if they could find it,

1164
01:27:07,207 --> 01:27:14,443
but it had gone and it didn't turn up
until the tide had gone out five hours later.

1165
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:37,244
The silt had jammed the steering lock
and the cylinders were flooded with sea water.

1166
01:27:38,607 --> 01:27:40,404
It was a wreck.

1167
01:27:40,567 --> 01:27:44,082
Though we'd brought a mechanic along,
we had no spare parts.

1168
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:46,761
Things looked bleak.

1169
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:54,039
The mechanic has worked on it now
for 40 minutes or so, I think...

1170
01:27:55,047 --> 01:27:57,356
...and it's not looking good.

1171
01:27:58,447 --> 01:28:01,678
It seems that if you want to kill
one of these things,

1172
01:28:01,847 --> 01:28:05,840
the beach, the sea, salt water is the answer.

1173
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,318
Sorry.

1174
01:28:09,487 --> 01:28:13,719
- (ENGINE STARTS)
- Erm, wrong.

1175
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:19,156
Astonishingly, the Toyota was not dead.

1176
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,966
I do not believe it.

1177
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:29,602
Right, it started. Now, let's see if it moves.

1178
01:28:29,767 --> 01:28:32,076
(ALL CHEER)

1179
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,885
So it had survived the West Country.

1180
01:28:40,047 --> 01:28:43,084
But would it survive our test track?

1181
01:28:43,247 --> 01:28:48,321
The problem is, what can we do here
that we haven't already tried?

1182
01:28:53,407 --> 01:28:55,398
Difficult one.

1183
01:28:56,767 --> 01:28:59,679
I mean, the only solid structure we have here

1184
01:28:59,847 --> 01:29:03,442
is this, the "Top Gear"production office.

1185
01:29:03,607 --> 01:29:05,882
And that won't stop it.

1186
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:16,081
The Americans have used daisy-cutters
on these things, to no avail.

1187
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:19,284
But I've got something much more powerful.

1188
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:22,642
The Mistral GT.

1189
01:29:33,887 --> 01:29:36,845
What do you have to do to kill one?

1190
01:29:39,127 --> 01:29:42,278
Ah. Right.

1191
01:29:42,447 --> 01:29:45,883
It'll be a bit undignified, but here we go.

1192
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:50,205
Oh, Lordy, I'm too old for this.

1193
01:30:02,327 --> 01:30:04,124
I honestly can't believe this.

1194
01:30:04,287 --> 01:30:08,758
The steering's fine, the gearbox is fine,
the low-range box, the brakes.

1195
01:30:08,927 --> 01:30:11,236
The speedo's telling me we're doing 30.

1196
01:30:13,487 --> 01:30:17,196
To give you an idea
of just how strong this car still is,

1197
01:30:17,367 --> 01:30:19,198
look what we've got here.

1198
01:30:19,367 --> 01:30:22,120
It's used to fell skyscrapers,

1199
01:30:22,287 --> 01:30:26,166
but look what happens
when you thump it into the car.

1200
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:39,081
Well, the day thou gavest, Lord, is ended.

1201
01:30:39,247 --> 01:30:42,239
But, sadly, the car isn't.

1202
01:30:42,407 --> 01:30:47,720
It survived trial by water,
it survived trial by Bristol and trial by caravan,

1203
01:30:47,887 --> 01:30:51,926
but now it must face
the most difficult trial of them all.

1204
01:30:52,087 --> 01:30:53,998
Trial by fire.

1205
01:30:57,087 --> 01:30:59,362
(WHISTLES)

1206
01:31:11,607 --> 01:31:14,280
- That was phenomenal.
- I know. Amazing.

1207
01:31:14,447 --> 01:31:17,598
Be honest.
Did you really not change any bits?

1208
01:31:17,767 --> 01:31:24,366
Only the windscreen. The sea took the
windscreen out and we had to put a new one in.

1209
01:31:24,527 --> 01:31:26,643
So we put a new piece of perspex in.

1210
01:31:26,807 --> 01:31:32,245
Other than that, we just had hammers,
spanners and WD-40 to get the engine going.

1211
01:31:32,407 --> 01:31:36,002
Which makes it more of a shame
that you killed it with fire.

1212
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:39,239
- That was churlish.
- Well, that's the thing.

1213
01:31:39,407 --> 01:31:42,717
You probably won't believe this,
ladies and gentlemen.

1214
01:31:42,887 --> 01:31:46,880
I want a huge round of applause.
It is still working!

1215
01:31:47,047 --> 01:31:49,038
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

1216
01:31:55,687 --> 01:32:00,238
Oh, my car! My car!

1217
01:32:03,807 --> 01:32:06,719
Have you ever seen anything like it?

1218
01:32:06,887 --> 01:32:12,598
After that, James made
an even more spectacular attempt at killing it.

1219
01:32:12,767 --> 01:32:17,204
He put it on top of a tower block
that was about to be demolished.

1220
01:32:17,367 --> 01:32:23,044
(MAN) Six, five, four, three, two, one...

1221
01:32:58,407 --> 01:33:01,080
(JAMES) So, the moment of truth.

1222
01:33:01,247 --> 01:33:05,877
Will it be buried under thousands of tons
of public housing?

1223
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:15,881
No. There it is.

1224
01:33:29,567 --> 01:33:32,081
It may have escaped being buried alive,

1225
01:33:32,247 --> 01:33:36,365
but that 240-foot drop has taken its toll.

1226
01:33:46,807 --> 01:33:52,006
It's smashed and bashed
almost beyond recognition.

1227
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:54,798
Oh, dear.

1228
01:33:57,127 --> 01:34:00,199
Oh, yeah. I'd say that was pretty Ronnied.

1229
01:34:00,367 --> 01:34:02,961
- Have you got a crowbar with you?
- Yeah.

1230
01:34:05,767 --> 01:34:07,564
(JAMES) We've got our mechanic.

1231
01:34:07,727 --> 01:34:12,517
As before, he's not allowed spare parts
and can only use basic tools.

1232
01:34:18,607 --> 01:34:21,644
Too much. It doesn't look good.

1233
01:34:23,727 --> 01:34:27,197
- Is this it?
- This is it. I'll give it a go.

1234
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:30,598

But, but, but... OK, James... James...

1240
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:04,122
- We've seen that it started.
- Yeah, it did start.

1241
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:08,166
- But did it move?
- I can hardly believe this myself.

What a truly amazing vehicle.

1246
01:35:27,407 --> 01:35:31,400
I think it's made its point.
We'll never try and harm it again.

1247
01:35:31,567 --> 01:35:35,879
That's about it from down in the bunker.
I hope you've learnt something.

1248
01:35:36,047 --> 01:35:41,644
Before I lock up, let's pay a brief tribute
to the one who doesn't get to spout off,

1249
01:35:41,807 --> 01:35:46,927
sign autographs, open supermarkets
and wear hair products in the way that we do.

1250
01:35:47,087 --> 01:35:49,123
This is where we keep him.

1251
01:35:50,447 --> 01:35:52,165
And this is what he does.

1252
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:54,765
Bring him out. Stiggy bird.

1253
01:35:56,447 --> 01:36:00,565
(JEREMY) It's more intelligent
than the man behind the wheel.

1254

a raw, simple car and a raw, simple driver.

01:36:12,087 --> 01:36:13,918
The Stig.

01:36:20,847 --> 01:36:24,203
(JEREMY) 1.21.9.

1258
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:28,406
- You've got to give it to the Stig.
- (RICHARD) It's going up.

1259
01:36:30,127 --> 01:36:32,800
(JEREMY) It goes there.

1260
01:36:36,047 --> 01:36:39,483
One minute 20 seconds point nine.

1261
01:36:40,807 --> 01:36:43,879
(JAMES)... do that. Down a wee bit for this lap.

1262
01:36:44,847 --> 01:36:48,556
One minute 27.1.

1263

01:36:56,487 --> 01:36:58,318
What will the Stig make of it?

It's soaking wet.

1267
01:37:03,447 --> 01:37:07,076
One minute 28.5 seconds.

1268
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:11,444
Let's hand it over to the dark side of the Stig.

(JEREMY) This is Stig's birthday
and Christmas present all rolled into one.

1271
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:33,722
And he's offl

1272
01:38:42,047 --> 01:38:44,197
Come on. Did he?

1273
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:50,397
Well, it was greasy out there and there were
big puddles which did slow him down a bit.

1274
01:38:50,567 --> 01:38:52,683
- Yes?
- The Stig did it.

1275
01:38:52,847 --> 01:38:55,645
- 59 seconds.
- Yes!

1276
01:40:15,247 --> 01:40:20,401
Another essential quality for the "Top Gear"
presenter is, of course, professionalism.

1277
01:40:20,567 --> 01:40:23,525
Absolute professionalism at all times.

1278
01:40:26,287 --> 01:40:30,280
You know the three hardest words
for a man to say?

1279
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:32,438
"I won't **** ** **** *****"? No.

1280
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:38,924
What I've got here are two Armani jackets,
basically identical.

1281
01:40:39,087 --> 01:40:43,956
In this one, if you look,
the label says "Armani". OK?

1282
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:48,086
Whereas in this one
we've changed the label to... (BLEEP)

1283
01:40:48,247 --> 01:40:50,477
Sorry. I've just realised something.

01:40:50,647 --> 01:40:52,842
It's late and I'm drunk.

1285
01:40:55,087 --> 01:40:59,319
Time for the news.
Terrible pity about Jeremy not liking the 350Z.

1286
01:40:59,487 --> 01:41:04,038
- I wondered if he'd like the 350Z watch.
- I've got cramp!

1287
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:08,718
(BLEEP)

1288
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:13,439
Oh, bloody hell! Aargh!

1289
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:19,724
So we're saying that this lovely old car
is the embodiment of a nice cup of tea

1290
01:41:19,887 --> 01:41:22,003
in front of a roaring log fire?

1291
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:26,365
Yes, it's like settling down
in the warm library of a country house

1292
01:41:26,527 --> 01:41:31,885
with a good book and a Labrador at your feet
and nothing to do until dinner.

1293
01:41:37,847 --> 01:41:39,917
Right, time for the news.

1294
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:44,319
It's been officially announced this week
that Jeremy Clarkson is an arse.

1295
01:41:51,047 --> 01:41:54,437
(RICHARD) He has a point.
He does have a point.

1296
01:41:56,967 --> 01:41:58,764
Get on with the news properly.

1297
01:41:59,607 --> 01:42:03,236
So what we're saying is that this...

1298
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:08,757
Oh, no, no, this is bad.

1299
01:42:08,927 --> 01:42:14,240
I appreciate a lot of that is difficult to follow.
(STUMBLES OVER WORDS) You see?

1300
01:42:18,367 --> 01:42:20,358
I haven't started yet.

1301
01:42:20,527 --> 01:42:23,963
Yes, it's a steaming hot bowl of soup after a...

1302
01:42:24,127 --> 01:42:30,362
He just... He started that! It wasn't me!
He went. I didn't do it.

1303
01:42:30,527 --> 01:42:33,644
I appreciate a lot of that
is quite difficult to follow.

1304
01:42:33,807 --> 01:42:37,595
The Porsche 911 range
is one of the world's great unfathomables.

1305
01:42:37,767 --> 01:42:41,157
Let me try and explain it to you
in basic English.

1306
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:43,522
This is Sharon, OK?

1307
01:42:43,687 --> 01:42:48,078
Now, Sharon is all woman.
She is the 911 turbo, OK?

1308
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:51,080
Now, standing next to her is Vicky.

1309
01:42:52,447 --> 01:42:54,802
Oh, I've forgotten.

1310
01:42:58,767 --> 01:43:01,281
They just put me off!

1311
01:43:01,447 --> 01:43:05,201
Just... these great orbs! Bloody hell!
