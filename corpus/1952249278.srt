1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,306
After the destruction of Jerusalem
nearly six centuries...

2
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,308
before the birth of Christ...

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,311
the Jews were taken
into captivity in Babylon.

4
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,315
But 60 years later, Babylon's
territories were conquered...

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:56,322
by the Persian Army, and
engulfed in a new vast empire.

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,323
By edict of King Cyrus,

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,258
all captive peoples
were set free,

8
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,262
and allowed to return
to their own lands.

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,266
But not all the Jews
returned to Judea.

10
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,269
Many decided to remain
in the Persian empire,

11
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:16,274
the capital of which
was the magnificent city of Susa.

12
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,244
Stop! Stop!
Thief!

13
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,253
Come here, you!
Hold it!

14
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,255
- Let me go!
- That's all!

15
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,261
That wretched man
will have his hand cut off.

16
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,263
It's the harsh law
of the Persians.

17
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,267
It's not the harshness, Ezra,
it's the absence of clemency.

18
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,270
We Jews should remember
when we write our own law...

19
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:30,275
People of Susa! Make way
for the counselor of your king!

20
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,283
Just look at him.

21
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,286
Ever since the kingdom of Saul,
every Jew has known...

22
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,289
as long as there's one Amalekite
on earth, we are in danger.

23
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,293
It's been so many years.
Will this feud never end?

24
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,296
Maybe, but I still refuse
to bow before him.

25
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,298
Come, Ezra,

26
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,302
we must try to do nothing which
can bring harm to our people.

27
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,237
Haman is just looking
for an excuse to strike us all.

28
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,242
Why can't we get through?
You stupid idiots!

29
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,244
Bow your heads
before Haman,

30
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:11,249
who brings gifts for the great
King of Persia and Media.

31
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:21,259
- How dare he?
- What is it, my lord?

32
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,265
Nothing.

33
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,280
His riches have opened
too many doors at court.

34
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,282
Soon he may even win
the king's favor.

35
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,284
Well, you know the king.

36
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,287
- He may have his indulgences, but...
- Well then,

37
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,290
it might not be as hard as we
thought to rid ourselves,

38
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,293
of that impostor.

39
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,247
You make me so proud,
Hadassah!

40
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,250
You've a true gift for languages,
and you learn so quickly.

41
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,254
Well, I do have the best
teacher in Susa, cousin.

42
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,258
She's so generous and obedient.
That's because she has the blood,

43
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,262
of King Saul, from the tribe of
Benjamin, flowing in her veins.

44
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,264
- Thank you, Ezra.
- But heed my words...

45
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,267
don't let her marry a foreigner.

46
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,271
- Has someone asked for my hand?
- No one!

47
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,273
Haven't you some...

48
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,275
some chores to do?

49
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,613
Mordecai...

50
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,311
you shouldn't treat her like the
orphan you took in many years ago.

51
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,286
She's a woman now.
You have to accept that.

52
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,290
I know, I know.
But she is a special girl.

53
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,223
She deserves a man
who is worthy of her.

54
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,228
If it be the will
of the Lord.

55
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,231
Hadassah,

56
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,234
what is this about a man?

57
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,234
So...

58
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,239
should someone
be asking for your hand?

59
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,241
Is it...
anyone in particular?

60
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,243
I don't know...

61
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,246
The man of my dreams,
perhaps?

62
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,250
But I'll accept whomever
you choose for me.

63
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,254
You know me well, and you're a wise
man. I know you'll make,

64
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,257
- the right decision.
- Today, with Haman,

65
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,260
I was neither wise nor prudent...

66
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,264
Hadassah,
Ezra is not wrong.

67
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,268
Living among the Persians so long,
we have become like them.

68
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,270
But we are still Jews.
We are different.

69
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,274
But you've taught me that what
matters is what's in a man's heart,

70
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,276
not his blood.

71
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,280
Your father might not
have taught you so.

72
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,217
No father is more dear
to me than you are.

73
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,221
Nehemia!
What are you doing?

74
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,229
The king's jewels,
booty from all over the kingdom.

75
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,233
But they are better off here
than in their original places.

76
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,235
Like that gold basin.

77
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,237
It comes from
the Temple in Jerusalem.

78
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,241
The Jews used it to gather
the blood during the sacrifices.

79
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,243
- Have you washed?
- No.

80
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,247
Everything must be purified before
one of the most important banquets,

81
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,250
ever offered by the king.
Wash!

82
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,255
Tend to the wine.

83
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,259
And taste it before
offering it to the king.

84
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,265
- What if I die?
- You can...

85
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,269
but not the Great King Ahasuerus.
Come!

86
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,226
Parathael,
are you instructing him well?

87
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:20,231
Remember that at court, a false
move could cost him dearly.

88
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,233
Come with me,
Nehemia.

89
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,239
Here's the wine you requested,
my king.

90
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,256
To the health
of our wise king.

91
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,259
May he live forever,

92
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,262
by the grace of the god
Ahuramazda,

93
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,267
for the eternal joy
of his loyal subjects.

94
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,216
If you, my subject,
are so full of joy,

95
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,218
why do you look so sad?

96
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,223
Won't you reply?

97
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,225
My lord...

98
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,230
I was thinking
that this feast will soon end.

99
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,234
Your servant Haman is sad because
he cannot make it last longer.

100
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,238
You cannot,
but your king has this power.

101
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:43,238
I, Ahasuerus,
King of Persia and Media...

102
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,251
declare...

103
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,255
that every man here
assembled shall drink

104
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:55,260
without restraint,
each to his own desire.

105
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,265
You spoke well,
but answer this:

106
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,269
Which of the king's jewels
would you desire for yourself?

107
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,271
They're all equally magnificent,
Shetar.

108
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,273
I wouldn't know
which one to choose.

109
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,278
My king, this man finds none
of your jewels worthy of praise.

110
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,280
How brazen!

111
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,291
Haman, you say
that the King of Kings...

112
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,295
doesn't own a jewel
splendid enough to...

113
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,298
reflect his glory?

114
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
My lord,

115
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,304
the king's most beautiful jewel
isn't among these.

116
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,308
Where is it, then?
Let it be brought!

117
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:48,313
A man's most precious jewels
are his wife's grace and honor.

118
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,315
There's no other
beauty in your empire...

119
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,318
that can rival that
of Queen Vashti.

120
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,259
Ishtar,
the goddess of love and war...

121
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,264
she must have her way,
and she is pleased when she sees...

122
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,268
the beautiful princess
and the valiant warrior...

123
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,271
fall in love.

124
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:22,280
But other gods conspire
against the match.

125
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,284
Ishtar, moved to pity,

126
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:31,289
begins to blow,
and blow, and blow...

127
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,294
until the offending gods
are swept away.

128
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,300
Love triumphs
and the enemies of love...

129
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:47,305
are turned into ugly pigs.

130
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,316
Why do I bother to bring artists
and dancers from faraway lands...

131
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,249
if my guests refuse
to show interest in them?

132
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:06,258
My queen, we are not used to plays
that ridicule our king's gods.

133
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,259
We are... confused.

134
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,261
I'm not one of those
foolish courtiers...

135
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,265
that prostrate themselves
in order to obtain favors.

136
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,267
I am the queen,

137
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,270
and I do as I please
in my chambers.

138
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,274
Harbona, the king's eunuch,
asks to be received.

139
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,277
Don't just stand there,
Harbona, speak.

140
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
The king requires
my lady's presence.

141
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,281
For what purpose?

142
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,284
He makes display
of his most treasured objects.

143
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,286
Am I such an object?

144
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,289
The most beautiful of all,
my queen!

145
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,293
It does not befit a lady,
much less a queen,

146
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,296
to be displayed before a man
quite drunk...

147
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,298
after too many days
of feasting.

148
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:52,303
The king wills it.
You are to wear the royal crown.

149
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,308
Say to the king that I refuse.

150
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,245
Queen Vashti...!

151
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:13,258
Queen Vashti wrongs the king
by refusing my command.

152
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,260
Not only the king,
but the officials,

153
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,262
and the whole people
in every province.

154
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,267
- A royal command must be obeyed.
- What does the law require?

155
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:28,272
If it pleased the king, let a royal
order go out that Vashti...

156
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,277
be sent away from palace life and
never return before the king again.

157
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,281
Let it be written among the laws
of the Persians and the Medes

158
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,284
so that it might not
be revoked.

159
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,287
My king,
when word gets out,

160
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,290
all women will look upon
their husbands with contempt.

161
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:51,295
Let her royal position be given
to another who is better than she.

162
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,302
Very well, Memucan.

163
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,236
Scribe!

164
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,245
Let it be written to every
province in its own script...

165
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:11,249
...and to every people
in its own language.

166
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:20,258
Let it be sent by swift couriers
to every province in the empire...

167
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,262
that I declare
by royal decree...

168
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,267
that the king no longer
recognizes Vashti as his queen,

169
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,270
due to her disobedience,

170
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:37,275
as she dared oppose
an explicit order by the king.

171
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,241
Harbona,
go bring the queen to me.

172
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,246
- There is no queen, my lord.
- A decision made in haste.

173
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,249
It was the wine.
I revoke my command.

174
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,253
Bring Vashti.
I want her here.

175
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,256
I want to restore her crown.

176
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:30,261
It was a royal decree, my lord.
By law, it cannot be revoked.

177
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,264
And not even the king
can go against the law...

178
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,266
What is your advice?

179
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,278
If it pleases the king...

180
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,278
Speak, Haman.

181
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:53,284
Let beautiful young virgins
be sought out for the king.

182
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,287
And let the king appoint
commissioners in all the provinces...

183
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,223
to gather the virgins
to the harem in the citadel.

184
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,226
And let the girl
who pleases the king...

185
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,230
be queen in Vashti's place.

186
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,233
This suggestion...

187
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,238
pleases the king.
Let it be as Haman has proposed.

188
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,260
Search every house
in the town!

189
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,263
What are they doing?
That's my house!

190
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,266
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Break it down.

191
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,271
Hurry up!
Search those houses over there!

192
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,277
- Come on, come on, hurry.
- Don't worry, Mother.

193
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,283
Hurry up!
Bring them all to the palace!

194
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,220
Hadassah!

195
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,223
Any resistance
will be punished!

196
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,226
You must obey
the king's order!

197
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:16,233
Look in that direction!
Move on to the next street!

198
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,240
- Hadassah?
- Mordecai?

199
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,243
Thank God you're here.
Quickly, quickly,

200
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,245
- you must hide!
- Why?

201
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,248
- They're taking girls...
- What for?

202
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,252
For the harem of the king!
Hurry! Hurry! Get in here!

203
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,256
Do you want to spend the rest
of your life in a harem? Get in!

204
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,259
Be still!

205
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,266
Open the door!
In the name of King Ahasuerus!

206
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,269
I will send them away.

207
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,272
Come on, open up!

208
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,276
Yes, yes, yes...

209
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,211
Your daughter
must come with us.

210
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,216
Daughter?
I have no daughter.

211
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,218
Your neighbor says
there is a young girl here,

212
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,220
a very beautiful young girl.

213
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,224
My neighbor is old.
He doesn't see well.

214
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,226
You Jews,
you think you can outwit...

215
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,228
a chamberlain of
the Great King of Persia?

216
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,232
Perhaps it was
a servant girl he saw.

217
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,235
She just cooks for me,
she doesn't live here.

218
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,238
Look for yourself...

219
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,264
No daughter?
What is this?

220
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,267
- Sir, you were lying to me.
- It's not what it seems.

221
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,270
Keep searching
and bring her to me.

222
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,208
- Come on, up, up...
- Please...

223
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,211
- Leave me.
- Let's go. Hurry.

224
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,215
She's an orphan
and a kinswoman.

225
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,218
See here,
perhaps we can discuss...

226
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,220
...an arrangement.

227
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,224
Say goodbye
to your "kinsman. "

228
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,231
Goodbye,
my dear cousin.

229
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,234
May the God of our ancestors
reward you...

230
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,238
for all your kindnesses.

231
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,174
Tell no one
you're a Jew.

232
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,245
You cannot even
use your name.

233
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,249
Call yourself "Esther",
you know what it means.

234
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
Forget your name,

235
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,254
but never forget
you're a Jew...

236
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,257
except in the silence
of your heart.

237
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,261
Be brave, my child.

238
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,313
This way. Quick, quick!

239
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,317
Come on!

240
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,288
Separate them! Find rooms for them
away from the others from Babylon!

241
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,292
Come, come. Enter, my beauties.
Don't be afraid.

242
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,302
Jews.

243
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,308
I am Hegai,

244
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:56,313
in whose charge you'll remain until
you move on to the second harem.

245
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,316
Welcome to your new home.

246
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,251
Today, we shall begin
transforming you...

247
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:08,260
for your encounter with the great
king in the royal bedchamber.

248
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,263
Don't be upset. We'll begin the
prescribed treatments...

249
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,267
with oil of myrrh, and later
with perfumes...

250
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,269
- Little one, no need to cry.
... and cosmetics.

251
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,272
You will be taught
palace etiquette...

252
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,275
and how to conduct yourself
in the presence of the king.

253
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,278
So that,
when your turn comes,

254
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,282
you could even become
a queen.

255
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,284
What is this commotion?!

256
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,288
- Make her be quiet!
- Lf only she could be with her sister,

257
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,290
who was also brought
to the palace...

258
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,293
- You know this girl?
- Not until now...

259
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,296
Then she is no concern
of yours.

260
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,301
But her distress
is my concern,

261
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,305
and easily remedied
by a man of authority here.

262
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,309
Men?

263
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,242
You won't find any men here.

264
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,247
I know a man's real strength,

265
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,249
and by your eyes, I see
more strength in you, Hegai,

266
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,252
than in an army of warriors.

267
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,258
Who...

268
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,262
who are you?

269
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,266
- I am Esther.
- Esther?

270
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,268
A Babylonian name.

271
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:28,272
- Your people are from Babylon?
- No, I'm from Susa.

272
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,276
Well, Esther of Susa...

273
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:38,283
out, everyone out! To the second
wing, with the Babylonians!

274
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,283
This is the full tribute
of ebony?

275
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,286
Six hundred talents, yes.
And next we have incense.

276
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,288
Not you, again!

277
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,290
I told you,
don't bother me today.

278
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,293
What happens in the harem
is of no concern to me,

279
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,296
nor of any man,
save the king.

280
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,231
If you want a long life,
my friend, forget the girl...

281
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,237
I am charged by her family
to see if she is well.

282
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,241
Please.

283
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,245
What's this?

284
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,247
Frankincense, sir.

285
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:24,254
You call this incense?
This is second rate.

286
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,259
You know people in the court.

287
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,263
You know the eunuchs.
You could ask them.

288
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,268
You made an error.

289
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,270
How?
What are you talking about?

290
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,272
Here.

291
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,278
- So I did.
- It's because you need an assistant.

292
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,281
Appoint me.
I am a scribe.

293
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,285
I can read and speak Aramaic,
Babylonian, and Persian.

294
00:25:55,353 --> 00:26:00,222
- I could be of great help to you...
- All because you know how to count?

295
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,227
That incense...

296
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,231
- it isn't actually second rate...
- Enough.

297
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,235
My assistant...

298
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:16,240
perhaps you will sit
within the palace gate.

299
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,245
You're a clever man,
Mordecai the Jew.

300
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,256
The king
will tell you to rise.

301
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,258
Watch...

302
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:46,270
You will not bow with your head,
but with your heart.

303
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:53,278
You will walk lightly,
as if on water.

304
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,283
And when you do bow,
you will smile...

305
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,218
but keep your eyes lowered.

306
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,224
Silence!

307
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:15,232
It is forbidden to look
the king in the eyes,

308
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,237
save for the royal princes
and his closest advisors.

309
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,241
It is forbidden to rise
without the king's permission.

310
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,246
It is forbidden
to dress carelessly,

311
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,248
and it is forbidden...

312
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,250
to scratch yourself.

313
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,255
Forget whatever you
have done up until now.

314
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,262
When it is your night
to go to the king,

315
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,265
you may ask for anything
you want to take with you.

316
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:53,270
I will ask for a necklace of
pearls that will reach to my feet.

317
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,273
I will have only a fan
of white feathers.

318
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,209
Perhaps the king
will never send me away!

319
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,214
Maimuna,

320
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,217
why has no girl ever
returned from the king?

321
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,220
The first harem
is only for virgins.

322
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,223
And after our first night,
what then?

323
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,226
In the morning, Shaagaz
will take you to the second harem,

324
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,229
the eunuch in charge
of the concubines.

325
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,232
There you will remain,
unless the king delights in you

326
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,235
and calls for you by name.

327
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,237
Maimuna?

328
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,239
My lady?

329
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,242
What is it like?

330
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,244
I mean,

331
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,247
to make love to a man?

332
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,251
That depends on the man.

333
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,259
The murder of the governor of the
southlands is clearly an offense.

334
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:52,262
Even the king's life
could be in danger.

335
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,265
The assassins must
be found and punished!

336
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,268
Memucan's concern is justified.

337
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,201
We must send someone there
immediately.

338
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,206
This is a very serious matter.

339
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,208
Perhaps you should go,
Carshena.

340
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:09,212
Everyone knows you've been coveting
the idea of a governorship...

341
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,214
in those rich lands.

342
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,217
That is a lie!

343
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,225
Let me go!

344
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,231
I bring a message to the great king
from the governor of the southlands.

345
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,234
That's impossible.
The governor is dead.

346
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,237
Boy, don't you know no one comes
unsummoned before the king?

347
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,239
The penalty is death.

348
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,242
- It's the law.
- But I was summoned.

349
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,244
By whom?

350
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,253
He was supposed to be here,
my lord.

351
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,256
I don't see him,

352
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,259
but I know his name.
It's...

353
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:01,264
it's... Carshena.

354
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,277
Carshena?

355
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:22,286
And where...
is he now?

356
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,292
I don't see him!

357
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,333
- Execute him!
- I'm innocent, my lord.

358
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,302
- I don't want to die.
- Be brave.

359
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,304
Your death
shall not go unpunished.

360
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:48,301
If one of you sent for this man,
his blood is on your hands.

361
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,315
There will be an investigation
of this "Carshena".

362
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:59,322
Esther, what will you wear
when you go into the king?

363
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,259
You have seen to my every need,
Hegai. You decide.

364
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,262
But it is customary to request
something to take in with you.

365
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,266
Well, in that case,
I'll rely on your wisdom.

366
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,269
I should bring whatever
you think I require.

367
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,286
It's for tonight.

368
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,293
May the god, Ahuramazda,
be with you.

369
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,251
Tell us your name.

370
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,255
I'm called...
Esther.

371
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,257
Esther.

372
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,263
The name of the goddess Ishtar,
the goddess of love, yes?

373
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,266
In the tongue of my people,
it has another meaning.

374
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,269
It means "hidden".

375
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,273
So you hide behind a veil?

376
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,275
Are you that ugly?

377
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,281
Rise,
so I can see you.

378
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:05,241
Are you a...
Mede?

379
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,246
Are you lonian?
Assyrian?

380
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:18,254
My people are loyal subjects
of the King of Persia, my lord.

381
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,257
That's not an answer.

382
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,264
Silence is a rare gift
in a woman,

383
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,266
but I command you...

384
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,269
look at me.

385
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,279
What do you see?

386
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,281
My king...

387
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,286
I see a man with courage
and beauty in his eyes.

388
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,288
You're all the same.

389
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,292
You're lying to me,
just like they taught you to.

390
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,231
Well, let us do
what has to be done.

391
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,243
You picked a rose
in the garden.

392
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,247
Is it a gift for your king?

393
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,250
My lord,
I picked it for myself.

394
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,253
Forgive me for taking it.

395
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,257
You are different.
You are courageous.

396
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,260
You're not like the others.

397
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,261
Perhaps.

398
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,266
The truth is that I've always
been afraid of the unknown.

399
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,270
And I've never known a man.

400
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,277
Esther,
no one will hurt you.

401
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,247
Rise, Esther,

402
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,250
Queen of Persia and Media.

403
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,256
Hail to the Queen!
Hail!

404
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:45,261
Long life and happiness
to Queen Esther!

405
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,236
You're a Jew who bows
before a pagan king.

406
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,240
Esther is crowned Queen
of all Persia. Rejoice!

407
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,243
How can I rejoice when a Jewish girl
is wed to an uncircumcised heathen...

408
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,245
king or no king?

409
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,248
Our sons and daughters are mixing
our precious seed with...

410
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,252
with foreigners, and they take for
themselves foreign names like "Esthe

411
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,255
Perhaps there is a hidden design
in this turn of events.

412
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:51,262
There's one way for us, the way that
leads us back to Jerusalem.

413
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,266
All guards,
two steps forward, march!

414
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,269
- Are you afraid?
- It's not the first time...

415
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,205
- I've killed a man.
- It's set then. Tomorrow night.

416
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:07,210
Here is the poison.
To slip into his drink.

417
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,214
You have the dagger?

418
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,217
Tomorrow night.

419
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,232
Hathach!

420
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,236
Send for Harbona! I must speak
with the king immediately!

421
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:37,240
- It's a question of life or death.
- Yes, my queen.

422
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,246
How came this evil news
to you?

423
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,249
The man they
call Mordecai the Jew,

424
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,251
who sits within your palace gate,
sent word to me.

425
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,251
A Jew?

426
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,256
Cannot the ears of a Jew be trusted
to save the life of our king?

427
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,256
Go on.

428
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,260
Mordecai overheard Teresh
and Bigthan planning to kill you.

429
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,263
My lady, it's the word
of a stranger...

430
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:04,267
against that of two noble members
of the king's household.

431
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,270
Harbona, then why don't you show
the king your precious dagger?

432
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,273
I can't, my lady.
I mislaid it several days ago.

433
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,277
It's by the fountain in the garden.
It was to be Bigthan's murder weapon.

434
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:18,281
But everyone was to believe
Harbona was the real assassin.

435
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,285
And then Teresh was to feign
Harbona's suicide with poison.

436
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,293
You wanted to poison me?!

437
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,296
- And kill my king?
- It's a lie!

438
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,300
- We are falsely accused, my king!
- Enough!

439
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,305
Memucan...

440
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,309
Memucan, you conduct
a search immediately. Guards!

441
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,313
Hold these men prisoner
pending an investigation!

442
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,316
- No!
- No, please!

443
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:57,320
It will be done, my lord,
it will be done.

444
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,272
So they are guilty.

445
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,277
But why did
they want to kill me?

446
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:25,281
This investigation of yours
doesn't say why.

447
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,283
They refused to explain
their reasons.

448
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,286
I had entrusted them
with my life!

449
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,289
They had my complete trust!

450
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,293
Who is behind this,
Memucan?

451
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:44,301
When will I see an end
to all these intrigues?

452
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,310
Execute them, and let it be
written in the annals.

453
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,313
Let it be written...

454
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:01,249
in the annals of Ahasuerus,
the Great King,

455
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,254
that in the month of Tebeth,
Bigthan and Teresh...

456
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:09,258
My lord,
Haman is here.

457
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,261
...and that the plot
was discovered...

458
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,264
- Let him in.
... by Mordecai the Jew,

459
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:19,268
who did save
the life of the king...

460
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,271
with much alacrity
and courage.

461
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,273
My king...

462
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,799
If you bring nothing
but bad news, Haman,

463
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,277
you may go.

464
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:33,282
One can hide nothing
from you, my lord.

465
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:01,242
Your stupid gifts
will get you nowhere.

466
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,247
I'm patient, Chamberlain.

467
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,251
And most of all,
I've time to wait.

468
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,295
Memucan...

469
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:24,267
Memucan,
I commanded you not to die.

470
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,270
How dare you leave me?!

471
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:33,276
My lady, no one is able
to make him see reason.

472
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:37,280
No, my lady, no one may come
unsummoned before the king,

473
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,284
not even the queen.
The penalty is death.

474
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,293
The queen requests
to be received.

475
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,296
She's worried
about your health.

476
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,242
Get away, all of you!

477
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,245
He is in pain, my lady.
He will overcome it.

478
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,247
No one can...

479
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,257
My lord,

480
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,260
you have mourned him
for three whole days.

481
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,263
Do you want Memucan to come back
from the valley of death...

482
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,266
to remind you of your duty?

483
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,270
You must go back
to governing again.

484
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,274
If the queen has lost
the king's favor,

485
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,276
there will be sad days
ahead.

486
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,286
Haman...

487
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,323
- What do you want?
- Help me win back the king's favor.

488
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,292
Speak to him.

489
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,295
I'm not in a position
to do so.

490
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,228
You think you can get away
with this?

491
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:05,234
I got rid of Carshena for you,
and this is how you repay me?

492
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,241
What's the trouble?

493
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,244
What was that all about?

494
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,246
Shut up,
you foolish woman!

495
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,248
What more do you want?

496
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:23,252
The king is about to appoint me
his new Lord Chamberlain.

497
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,277
Are you mad?

498
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,280
You show no respect
for the king's right hand man?

499
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,283
Never will I bow to that man.

500
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,285
The king commands it.

501
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,287
Who are you to disobey?

502
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,223
A Jew who prostrates himself
only before the Lord.

503
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:26,248
It's not so easy as it looks.
It takes time.

504
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,251
It seems
I have plenty of time.

505
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:38,260
If you ask me, our king should pay
more attention to his beautiful queen.

506
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,263
You know what the king should do
better than the king himself?

507
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:45,267
Can't you see how she suffers
since she lost his affection?

508
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,210
- My queen...
- Hegai,

509
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,281
am I not still the same Esther
you took under your wing?

510
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,214
Yes...

511
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,223
It seems I have lost favor
with the king.

512
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,223
That cannot be.

513
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:12,228
If I have done anything, anything
that has displeased him...

514
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,230
Why should you think so?

515
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,233
He's not sent for me
in weeks.

516
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,237
Please, Hegai, tell me...
what shall I do?

517
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,239
Be patient.

518
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,242
The king attends
to many urgent matters.

519
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,245
He instructs a new
Lord Chamberlain besides.

520
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,247
Haman.

521
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:37,253
This man alone does not show
respect to Your Lordship.

522
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:42,258
His superiors speak to him day after
day, but he does not listen.

523
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,261
Pay him no heed.
The man is mad.

524
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,265
I cannot be bothered
by such foolishness.

525
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,273
I want to talk to the Jew.

526
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,207
Him!

527
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,211
Bow your head!

528
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,220
You know
I can make you do it.

529
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,222
You know that!

530
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,226
He despises me.
He insults me.

531
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:21,230
He turns the sweet honey
in my mouth to bitter bile.

532
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:25,234
You exercise the power of
the king. Do something.

533
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,237
- Kill him.
- It's beneath me to lay hands on him.

534
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,240
Jews!
They cheat us,

535
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:35,244
then hoard their wealth
to flaunt before us.

536
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,247
They think themselves
better than the rest.

537
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,249
Jews!

538
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:44,253
I don't want to hear
anything more about them!

539
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,256
We should destroy them.

540
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:54,264
Destroy every man, woman,
and child among them!

541
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,265
All of them...

542
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,200
all at once.

543
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,206
Forgive me, my lord,
forgive me.

544
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,210
Haman requests to speak
with you.

545
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,212
Let him in.

546
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,219
My lord,

547
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,222
a most urgent matter
that must be discussed...

548
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,225
away from indiscreet ears.

549
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,240
A certain people,

550
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,243
scattered and dispersed among the
populace in all the provinces...

551
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,246
Yes, yes, yes,
come to the point!

552
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,248
Their laws are different.

553
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,252
There can be only one law.

554
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,256
One day in seven they refuse
to work. They hoard money...

555
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,258
and cheat on their taxes.

556
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,262
How do you suggest
we solve the problem?

557
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,264
Eliminate the problem.

558
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,269
If it pleases the king,

559
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,275
let a decree be issued
for their destruction.

560
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,277
I cannot destroy
my own subjects!

561
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,280
If lawbreaking is tolerated,
others will follow.

562
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,284
Tributes and tax revenues
decline.

563
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,289
Be logical, Haman.

564
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,291
The dead yield no taxes.

565
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,294
It's not a question of taxes.

566
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:37,299
I will pay 10,000 talents of silver
into the king's treasury if need be.

567
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,301
My lord,

568
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,304
the stability of the entire
kingdom is in danger.

569
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,307
These people
are capable of far worse.

570
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,309
They can conspire against us.

571
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,313
They occupy important positions
in every city of the kingdom.

572
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,317
That's why I insist
we rid ourselves of them.

573
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,254
If what you say is true,

574
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,258
we must act.

575
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,265
Who might these people be?

576
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:15,270
A small,
insignificant clan, my king.

577
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,274
If my king trusts me,

578
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:24,279
I'll take care
of the details personally.

579
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,284
There is no one else
I can trust.

580
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,295
You will be granted
all the powers.

581
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,299
I want to know nothing
about the matter.

582
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,248
The lot falls to the 13th day.

583
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,253
And now the month...

584
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,259
The month of Adar
is propitious.

585
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,262
The 13th of Adar...

586
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:17,266
Men cast the lots
but the gods decide.

587
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:22,271
The gods decide.
I shall make ready.

588
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,275
Scribes!

589
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,280
To every province
in its own script,

590
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:35,284
and to every people
in its own language,

591
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,287
by a royal decree
of Ahasuerus:

592
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:42,291
Let them destroy,
kill and annihilate

593
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,293
all the Jews,

594
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:48,297
young and old,
women and children...

595
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:52,301
Young and old, women
and children in one day?

596
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,303
The 13th day
of the twelfth month,

597
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,307
which is the month of Adar;
and to plunder their goods...

598
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,242
And let this decree be issued
in every province by proclamation,

599
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,247
calling on all the peoples to
prepare and make ready for that day.

600
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,249
Your Persian king
is going to kill us!

601
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,251
No, no.

602
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,255
It cannot be.
We have lived here for years.

603
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:17,259
They are our friends...
They won't allow this to happen.

604
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,265
They won't.

605
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:29,271
We must leave before it's too late.
Take this and go.

606
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,281
Hey you, girl...

607
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,283
- Come here! Come on!
- Leave me alone!

608
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:47,290
- You know we can do what we like.
- Help! Somebody help me!

609
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,293
Jew!

610
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,297
Leave him be.
We'll deal with him later.

611
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,300
Oh, my God!

612
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,238
Have you forgotten us, Lord?

613
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,241
Have you forgotten us?

614
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,618
Woe to the Jews!

615
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,621
Woe to the children of Israel!
We are undone!

616
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,625
Our enemies sit in ambush.

617
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:31,633
Woe to the Jews!

618
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:35,637
Woe to the children
of Israel!

619
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,641
We are undone!

620
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,644
Why does our God...

621
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,647
why does our Lord
not save us?

622
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,650
- Get away, you filthy wretch!
- Katare!

623
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,655
Mordecai, be quiet.

624
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,657
Get a hold of yourself.

625
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,661
- We are undone!
- Quiet, my friend.

626
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,664
- No, no!
- Quiet, quiet!

627
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:07,601
You want to make things worse
for you and your people?

628
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,607
You must not play the fool.

629
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,611
Get a hold of yourself!

630
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,624
- He's still there!
- But he's been howling for hours...

631
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,624
Who?

632
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,628
It is the Jew, my lady.
Such a racket.

633
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,631
He wails night and day
without ceasing.

634
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,634
He dresses in sackcloth and ashes
and sits outside the king's gate.

635
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,636
- What Jew?
- His name is...

636
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,639
It's the man who warned you
of the plot against the king.

637
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,641
Are you sure?

638
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,658
The queen commands you
to make yourself presentable.

639
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:22,611
He refused them?
Why?

640
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:30,619
Hathach, return to him, please,
and ask him what afflicts him.

641
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,622
Ten thousand talents of silver,

642
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,627
that is the price
of our lives for the king!

643
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,631
Tell the queen that Mordecai
charges her to go before the king...

644
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,635
and plead with him
for her people.

645
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,644
But why?

646
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,649
Why was I not informed
of this decree?

647
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,652
My lady,
these are affairs of the king...

648
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,588
I don't know what gives
this Mordecai the right...

649
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,593
"Plead for her people... "

650
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,597
But it is forbidden to go before
the king without being called!

651
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,600
On penalty of death,
my queen.

652
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,604
But if the king holds out the golden
scepter that person may live.

653
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,607
Maybe the king remembers the
sweet nights he spent with you.

654
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,610
If there ever was such a time that
he felt such tenderness for me,

655
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,612
it is over.

656
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,616
It has been so long
since he sent for me.

657
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,622
I must go to Mordecai myself.
I must make him understand.

658
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,625
If you are found outside the
harem, outside the palace gates,

659
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,627
in the company of a man...

660
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,636
Do not think that in the King's
palace you will escape...

661
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,638
any more than all
the other Jews.

662
00:57:56,706 --> 00:58:01,643
Because if you keep silent
at such a time,

663
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,646
relief and deliverance will rise
for the Jews from another quarter.

664
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:10,584
But you, and with you,
your father's family, will perish.

665
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,588
Hadassah,

666
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,592
perhaps you have come
to royalty

667
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:22,597
for such a time
as this.

668
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,603
Those were his words.

669
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:33,608
But, I beg of you, my queen,
do not risk your life.

670
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,616
Seize him.

671
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,619
Come on!

672
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,624
Wait...

673
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,572
Mordecai...

674
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,583
Mordecai...

675
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,588
- Mordecai...
- Hadassah!

676
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,591
I'm Esther.
Go.

677
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,594
Gather all the Jews
to be found in Susa.

678
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,597
Fast on my behalf.

679
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,601
Neither eat nor drink
for three days, night or day.

680
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:37,606
Esther, if only I could
have spared you with...

681
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,608
Do as I command.

682
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:44,613
I and my handmaids will fast also.
Then, I will go to the king,

683
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,617
though it is against his law.

684
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:53,622
If I perish, I perish.

685
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:01,630
May the Lord protect you,
Esther...

686
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,580
Come in aid of Your servants...

687
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,583
We are in overwhelming danger.

688
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,587
Father,
You who chose our fathers...

689
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,590
You who punished us...

690
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:33,595
and turned us over to our enemies
because we have sinned against You...

691
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:39,601
...still not happy, they want us
to be completely annihilated.

692
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:45,608
Do not allow them to triumph, Lord,
but turn their plans against them,

693
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,611
and strike the first
of our persecutors.

694
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,614
Put the words...

695
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:58,620
that will touch the heart
of my king into my mouth.

696
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:04,626
Let them remind him of the love
he once felt for me...

697
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:10,564
and turn his heart against those
who hate and battle against us.

698
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,568
Let him be the one to yield.

699
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,574
Free me...

700
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,580
Free me...

701
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:31,586
Deliver me from my anguish,
O Lord!

702
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:25,573
Maimuna, I need to bathe and dress.
Please, lay out my robes.

703
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,588
I'm ready.

704
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,560
Next, Great King, we have
the trade delegation from Bactria.

705
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,563
Have they paid
their tribute?

706
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,565
Not yet, Majesty.

707
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,570
Let them wait!
I've been waiting...

708
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,576
I've been waiting for months!
I have no intention...

709
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,599
Do not fear, Esther.

710
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,608
If it pleases the king...

711
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,614
What is your request,
Beloved Queen?

712
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:17,619
It shall be given you,
even to the half of my kingdom.

713
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,621
Let the king...

714
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,623
and Haman...

715
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:28,630
come today to the banquet
I have prepared in my quarters...

716
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,632
for the king.

717
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,649
Let it be...

718
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,654
as our queen desires.

719
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,630
Now,
my delectable queen,

720
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,633
what is your petition?

721
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,641
Come, come.
Tell me.

722
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:50,645
What is your request?
It shall be fulfilled.

723
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,648
If I have found
favor with you,

724
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,652
and if it pleases the king to grant
my petition and fulfill my request...

725
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,656
then let the king
and Haman come again tomorrow...

726
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,659
to the banquet
I shall prepare for them.

727
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:11,598
- This woman tries our patience.
- Indeed, my lord, as do they all.

728
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,603
Then I shall tell my wish...

729
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,609
as my king desires.

730
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:29,617
Bow before the great Haman!

731
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,640
All this does me no good...

732
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,644
as long as I see
that insolent Jew...

733
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,646
refusing to acknowledge me!

734
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,649
Vultures will feast on
his insolence soon enough, Father.

735
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,652
Not soon enough for me.

736
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,585
Then build a gallows...

737
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,590
fifty cubits high.
Get the king's consent...

738
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:15,597
- and hang Mordecai upon it.
- I'll have to build it immediately.

739
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,632
- My lord?
- I cannot sleep.

740
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,635
Shall I call a scribe,
with your permission, my lord?

741
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:58,639
His readings will help you
fall a sleep.

742
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:17,592
In the 10th month,
two eunuchs of the threshold...

743
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,595
did conspire to assassinate
the king.

744
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,598
By the grace of the god,
Ahuramazda, the Wise Lord,

745
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:27,602
the plot was discovered
and exposed...

746
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,609
...by a certain Mordecai,
the Jew, who sat within the gates...

747
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:38,613
and by whose brave action
did save the life of the king.

748
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,615
Is that all?

749
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:44,619
The eunuchs were executed
under the laws of Persia.

750
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,626
Harbona!

751
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,632
Ah, my lord, the king wants
to see you immediately.

752
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,634
- Do you know what he wants?
- I believe he owes...

753
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,637
a debt of gratitude to someone.

754
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,573
I am yours to command,
King of Kings.

755
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,576
Tell me,

756
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:13,581
what shall be done for a man
the king wishes to honor?

757
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,585
To the man whom
the king wishes to honor...

758
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,588
let royal robes be brought...

759
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,592
and the king's horse, with a royal
crown on its head, and...

760
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,597
let him be conducted on horseback
through the open square of the city.

761
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,599
Good!

762
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:37,606
Thus shall be done for a man
the king wishes to honor.

763
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,591
I am brought low.

764
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:36,598
The gods are surely envious
of my glory to so sorely mock me.

765
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,600
What scoundrel invented
my father's misfortune?

766
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,603
It was I!

767
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:46,607
I knew not that the king
meant to honor that foul toad.

768
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:50,611
I thought he wished to honor me!

769
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:55,616
And thus I proposed
a fitting tribute,

770
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:59,620
which he then charged me
to execute in favor of my enemy!

771
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:04,625
If that Mordecai is part
of the Jewish people,

772
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:10,563
I fear this is but
the beginning of your downfall.

773
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,567
What?

774
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:22,577
- Open in the name of the King!
- Open up.

775
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,583
My Lord Chamberlain,
are you ready?

776
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,586
The queen's banquet
is prepared.

777
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:37,592
You see, good wife?
I'm still the king's right hand man.

778
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,609
The fowl was excellent.

779
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:59,614
My lord,
the queen looks like a goddess.

780
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,618
Even if she were to feed me
poison, I would die a happy man.

781
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,553
Take care how you flatter
my wife, Lord Chamberlain.

782
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,556
Your king is a jealous man.

783
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:13,561
I intend only to praise
my lord's impeccable taste.

784
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:15,562
Enough.

785
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:23,572
Now, you promised to tell me
your petition and your request.

786
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,574
And it shall be granted?

787
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:30,578
Even to the half of my kingdom.

788
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:40,588
If I have won your favor,
and if it pleases the king,

789
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,590
let my life be given me.

790
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:45,593
- That is my petition.
- Your life?

791
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,596
And the lives of my people.
That is my request.

792
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:51,599
She ensnares me in riddles.

793
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,602
I know nothing
about your people.

794
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,608
We are to be sold, I and my people,
not merely as slaves,

795
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,611
for then I would have held
my peace.

796
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,546
You cannot be sold.
You're mine.

797
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,549
We have been sold...

798
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,552
to be destroyed,
to be killed...

799
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,556
- to be annihilated!
- My lord, perhaps I can explain...

800
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:18,559
And no enemy can compensate
for this damage to our king.

801
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:22,563
Speak clearly, woman.
What damage? What enemy?

802
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:28,570
Haman. Through his enmity towards
my kinsman, Mordecai.

803
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,572
- Your kinsman?
- Your kinsman!

804
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,575
Haman has decreed death
to all the Jews,

805
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,578
every man, woman,
and child.

806
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:49,590
My lady, I beg you...

807
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:54,595
I had no wish to harm you...
how could I know?

808
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,605
Have mercy on me,
I beseech you,

809
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,607
for the sake of my sons.

810
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:10,611
I will be your slave
but spare my life!

811
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,616
Guards! Eunuchs!

812
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,619
Will he assault the queen
in my house, in my presence?!

813
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,621
It's a misunderstanding,
I can explain...

814
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,624
He insults the queen and plots
to destroy her people!

815
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,626
The penalty is death!

816
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,629
A gallows 50 cubits high
stands at Haman's house.

817
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:32,633
He prepared it for Mordecai,
who saved the king!

818
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:35,636
- Hang him on that!
- Great Queen, save me!

819
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,638
Tell them the truth!

820
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,643
Wait!

821
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,645
My ring!

822
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,650
No! Have mercy!
Tell them the truth!

823
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,652
Please!

824
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,622
Please, don't bow before me,
cousin.

825
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,625
You are the most powerful
woman in the kingdom.

826
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,628
But that doesn't change
the way I see you.

827
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,631
Mordecai,

828
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,634
you know me well,
remember?

829
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:47,641
This is the Hadassah I know.

830
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,646
The Lord has granted
my request.

831
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,652
But let us not rejoice
too soon.

832
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,655
It's not over yet.

833
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:05,659
Yes, that is why the Jews
put their trust in you.

834
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,592
Let them keep their faith.

835
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,600
The king has come back
to me with his love.

836
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,603
I shall go to him and ask him
to revoke Haman's decree.

837
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,606
I will not let
our people down.

838
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,611
Approach, Mordecai.

839
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,616
Give us your hand.

840
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:35,623
The trust which we unwisely placed
in the hands of your enemy,

841
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,628
we now confer on you.

842
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:55,643
My dear cousin,
as my king sees fit to trust you,

843
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,645
so do I,
with all my heart.

844
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,647
I give unto you
my property,

845
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,650
and set you over
the house of Haman.

846
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,585
So shall it be.

847
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:10,591
And now, if there be
no other urgent matters...

848
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:16,597
If it pleases the king
and if I have won his favor...

849
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,600
- Yes?
- My lord,

850
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,604
how can I bear to see
calamity come on my people?

851
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,606
My own kindred.

852
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:29,610
Let an order be written to revoke the
letters devised by Haman the Agagite...

853
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:33,614
in which he decreed to destroy
the Jews in all the provinces.

854
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:37,618
It was a royal decree.
It cannot be revoked.

855
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,620
It is the law.

856
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:44,625
The laws are made by the king, surely
they can be unmade by the king,

857
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:49,630
An edict sealed with the
King's ring can't be revoked.

858
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,632
Not even by the king himself.

859
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,578
Mordecai,

860
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:11,585
you have shown yourself to be
both wise and clever.

861
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:26,600
Please, please, please!
Just one at a time!

862
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,603
If we all speak at once,
then nobody listens.

863
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:33,607
- He's right. Listen to me.
- Why you? First listen to me!

864
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,609
No, no,
please stop,

865
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,612
because by the time you decide
who is to speak first,

866
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,615
it will be the 13th of Adar
and we shall all be dead.

867
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:45,619
Now, you said that the Lord
has abandoned us.

868
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:49,623
What I say is...
we have turned away from the Lord.

869
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,625
Ezra is right.

870
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:55,629
How can the Lord hear our prayer
so far from Jerusalem?

871
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,632
We should return
while there is yet time.

872
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,634
What safety
is there in Jerusalem?

873
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:02,636
The walls lie in ruins.

874
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:11,578
Listen! Listen, friends! Please!
Please listen to what I have to say.

875
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:14,581
- You're not one of us!
- I am a Jew, just like you!

876
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,584
But how could I survive at the
Persian court if I told them?

877
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:21,588
- He's Nehemia, the king's cup bearer.
- Let him speak.

878
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,590
Ezra is not wrong.

879
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,593
One day, the Jews must
return to Jerusalem, but...

880
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,595
But?

881
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:31,598
Is it so easy to give up
what we have struggled to build?

882
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,601
Our homes
and our families are here.

883
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:38,605
Our fathers and grandfathers
lie buried in this ground.

884
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:42,609
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- No, you must let him speak!

885
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,612
Listen!
Listen...

886
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,615
The king has given authority to
Queen Esther and Mordecai,

887
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:53,620
to find a solution. Give them time.
Have faith a little longer.

888
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:57,624
Have faith?
In the laws of Persia?

889
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,627
Or have faith in the Lord?

890
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:04,631
Salvation for the Jews...
our very survival...

891
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,566
dwells in the land
promised to Abraham.

892
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,571
I would sooner live
in a city with no walls...

893
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:15,542
than in the richest empire
that has no true faith.

894
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,582
How will we find
a way to save us?

895
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,587
Oh Lord, why have you
turned away from us?

896
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:32,594
Please, put the right words into
my mouth and turn his heart...

897
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,596
Turn his heart...

898
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:40,601
Turn the heart of he who battles
against us! Turn! Can't you see?

899
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,605
We have asked the Lord to turn
our fate against our enemies,

900
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,607
and in His goodness,

901
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,611
He has given us the means
to do so.

902
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,614
The law.

903
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,617
To every province
in its own script,

904
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,620
and to every people
in its own language.

905
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:04,625
And to the Jews
in our script and our language,

906
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,560
by royal decree of Ahasuerus,
King of Kings,

907
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:10,564
to all his governors
and officials:

908
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:14,568
Let the Jews in every city
assemble and defend their lives,

909
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:20,575
to destroy, kill and annihilate
any armed force of any people

910
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,577
that might threaten them
on a single day:

911
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:26,580
The 13th day
of the 12th month of Adar.

912
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:31,585
Let this decree be published
in every province,

913
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:35,589
and issued
to all peoples,

914
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:40,594
and let the Jews prepare
and make ready for that day.

915
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,602
Ezra!

916
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,606
Ezra,
have you heard the edict?

917
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,608
It doesn't promise triumph,
only bloodshed.

918
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,610
There's no guarantee
we will win.

919
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:01,615
At least we can defend ourselves,
if all we have is tools and stones.

920
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,618
Is this battle the right way?

921
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,553
This battle will keep
the Jews alive.

922
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,564
Let us begin...

923
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:21,568
Blessed art Thou,
O Lord,

924
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,571
Whose hand is gracious
to those who seek You.

925
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,576
Protect and defend Your people
tomorrow on the day of battle,

926
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:33,580
and deliver us
from our enemies...

927
01:23:56,664 --> 01:24:00,600
The Jews have defended
themselves well.

928
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:05,605
Hundreds of people have
been killed, on both sides.

929
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:10,610
We are still awaiting reports
from the provinces.

930
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,617
I wanted to tell you myself.

931
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,622
Rejoice, my queen.

932
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:26,626
You have saved your people.

933
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,629
It's over, Esther.

934
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:37,637
The peril. The blood.
It's all over.

935
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:44,644
Now I have a request for you.

936
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,652
And I ask you to listen
to me...

937
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,655
if I have found favor
in your eyes...

938
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,598
Be my queen.

939
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,605
Share my kingdom,
my nights...

940
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:14,608
Be the light of my life.

941
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:26,620
I shall be your lover
when you desire me,

942
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:29,623
and your counsel
when you need me...

943
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:34,628
I've never given a woman
the love I feel for you.

944
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,634
It shall be so.

945
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:55,649
I, Esther, Queen of Persia,
decree that each year...

946
01:25:55,717 --> 01:26:00,654
the Jews will commemorate
the 14th and 15th days of Adar,

947
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:05,659
because this was the month in which
their despair was turned into joy,

948
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:09,595
their mourning into
a feast of celebration,

949
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:13,600
with exchanging of gifts
and almsgiving to the poor.

950
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:18,605
And to remember how their fate,
or Pur, was turned around,

951
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:22,609
it shall be called
The Feast of Purim.

952
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:10,590
While many Jews
still remained in Persia,

953
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:14,594
others decided,
under the leadership of Ezra,

954
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:19,599
to return to the land from which
their ancestors had been deported.

955
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:02,642
They were sustained
on their long journey

956
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:05,645
by the desire to rebuild
a nation of their own.

957
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:10,582
In the Temple of Jerusalem, which
rose again after the destruction,

958
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,586
they would pray together
with those of the Jews

959
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:16,590
who had returned after
King Cyrus' edict years before.

960
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:19,593
The walls of Jerusalem
would rise again too,

961
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,596
under the wise ruler,
Nehemia,

962
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:26,600
who was appointed Governor
of Judea by the Persian King.

963
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,604
Ezra,
the scribe and priest,

964
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:33,607
became the spiritual leader
of the people of Israel,

965
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:37,611
and helped them to preserve
the divine word of the Bible

966
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:42,616
at the center of their lives
and at the heart of their faith.

967
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,618
"In the beginning,

968
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:48,622
God created the heaven
and the earth.

969
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,626
And the earth
was without form,

970
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:56,630
and void and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.

971
01:28:56,698 --> 01:29:00,634
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,

972
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:04,638
and God said,
'Let there be light',

973
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,573
and there was light... "
