1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,667
I will kill you!!!

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,361
...and that concludes the court's explanation
of the legal aspects of this case.

3
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:56,278
And now jentlemen of the jury I come to
my final instructions to you.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Murder in the first degree,

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,482
premeditated homicide is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,083
You've listened to the testimony, you've had the law
read to you and interpreted as it applies to this case.

7
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:18,683
It now becomes your duty to try to
separate the facts from the fancy.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,200
One man is dead.
The life of another is at stake.

9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I urge you to deliberate thoughtfully and honestly.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,100
If there is a reasonable doubt, you must
bring me a verdict of not guilty.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,700
If however there is no reasonable doubt,
you must, in good conscience,

12
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,365
find the accused guilty.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Whatever your decision,
your verdict must be unanimous.

14
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,600
In the event that
you do find the accused guilty,

15
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,500
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Bear in mind that he could face
the death penalty.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,440
I don't envy your job, you're faced
with a grave responsibility jentlemen, thank you.

18
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,507
Can I get a couple of you jentlemen to help
me pull those two tables together please?

19
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:53,907
Hey, get some windows open man.

20
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,107
Yeah!

21
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,126
- Piece of gum?
- No, thank you.

22
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,147
-Bad news.
-What?

23
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:11,247
You see the Weather Report?

24
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,147
This is the hottest day of the year.

25
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:15,627
Figures...

26
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,000
You'd think they could have air-conditioned
the place, you know?

27
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,267
-I don't wanna drop dead in court...Piece of gum?
-Yeah!

28
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,160
OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

29
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:26,800
You want anything,I'll be right outside the door.
Just hit the button 'n' I'll come right in.

30
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,287
Thanks.

31
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,326
I never knew they locked the door.

32
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:39,319
They always lock the door brother.
What'd you think?

33
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:42,399
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.

34
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:46,995
- Hey, what's that for?
- I figured we might wanna vote by ballot.

35
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:50,300
That's a great idea. We might be able
to get this boy elected senator.

36
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:56,162
- Well, how'd you like it?
- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.

37
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:02,098
- Yeah? I'm falling asleep.
- What I mean is, I've never sat on a jury before.

38
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,655
I've sat on juries.

39
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:11,901
One thing that always amazes me is how these lawyers
can talk and talk, even on a case as obvious as this one.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,423
- I've never heard so much talk about nothin'.
- Well, I guess they're entitled.

41
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,624
Oh sure, everyone's entitled to a fair trial, I'd be
the last one to say a thing against that, but...

42
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:27,144
sometimes I think, we ought to take these tough kids
and just slap'em down, before they start trouble.

43
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,917
-It would save a lot of time and money.
-Mr. Foreman, would d'ya say, we get started here?

44
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah, let get this over with, we
probably all got things to do.

45
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,700
We might as well take a five minute break.
There's a man in the bathroom.

46
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,818
Are... we sitting in our own way?

47
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:40,118
So what do you think about the case?

48
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:44,307
I enjoyed it. No dead's bus,
you know what I mean?

49
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,307
We were lucky to get a murder case.

50
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,307
I figured us for an assault or a burglary
or something like that.

51
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:50,707
These can be dull...

52
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:06,107
Hey, can you imagine, sitting in
here for three days just for this?

53
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,907
Yeah, how about that business with the knife?

54
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,407
I mean, expecting normal people to
believe that kind of bullshit.

55
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:13,307
Well you gotta expect that. You know
what you're dealing with here.

56
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,907
What's the matter? You cold?

57
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,607
Well, I can hardly touch my
nose, you know what I mean?

58
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,007
Your horn's alright.
Try your lights.

59
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,807
Ahh, this is beautiful! The air
condition that doesn't work!

60
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:33,407
Somebody take a letter to the mayor.
Dear stingy...!

61
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:36,507
I didn't get a chance to see the papers
today. Anything new going on?

62
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,807
I was just wondering
how the market closed.

63
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,807
I wouldn't know.

64
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,907
You're in exchange or something?

65
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,807
No, no, I'm a broker.

66
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:46,807
Really? I run a messenger service,
The Beck and Call Company.

67
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:52,107
My wife's idea. We employ 37
people. Started from nothing!

68
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:55,107
Come on, Mr. Foreman, come on,
what do you say, let's go here!!!

69
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:57,107
Alright jentlemen, let's take seats.

70
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,107
This better be fast, I got two
tickets to the ball game tonight.

71
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:05,507
Yanks and Cleveland. We've got
this new kid Modjelewski in there.

72
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,607
This kid, he's a real bull, you know, I mean...

73
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:12,407
Talking about a real jug-handled. You know?

74
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,827
You quite the baseball fan, eh?

75
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,927
Where do you want us to sit?

76
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:24,927
Well, I was thinking we'd just sit
in order of jury number: 2,3,4...

77
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,327
I kinda like it.

78
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,827
If that's alright with you jentlemen.

79
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,227
-Sure!
-What's the difference?

80
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,627
I think it's reasonable to
sit according to numbers.

81
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:33,827
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

82
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,627
I beg your pardon?

83
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,727
I thought it was very sharp the way he handled
all his points one by one, in logical sequence.

84
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,627
Takes a good brain for that,
I was very impressed.

85
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:42,427
Yes, he did an expert job.

86
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,227
They got a lot of drive these guys,
you know, real drive.

87
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:47,077
Let's get this show on the road!

88
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,027
You...you'd like to sit down?

89
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,827
Jentleman at the window?

90
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:55,627
Would you like to sit down?

91
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,127
Oh...yeah, sorry!

92
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,327
It's pretty tough, isn't it?

93
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,127
I mean, the kid just kills his father,
bang...just like that!

94
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,727
If you analyze the figures on the...

95
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,527
Come on now, what figures?

96
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,327
It's those people I'm telling you.

97
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,727
See, they just let the kids run
wild out there.

98
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:13,327
Maybe it serves'em right,
you know what I mean?

99
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,927
Where's that elderly jentleman?

100
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,527
He's in the bathroom.

101
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,327
Would you knock on the door please?

102
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:19,427
Sure.

103
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:20,527
Thank you.

104
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,927
You a Yankee fan?

105
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,527
No, Milwaukee.

106
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,227
Milwaukee? What, you kidding?

107
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,627
It's like getting hit on the head
with a crowbar once a day!

108
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:30,927
I mean, tell me, who they got?

109
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:33,727
Really, I'm asking you, who they got?
Besides great grasskeepers?

110
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,527
We'd like to get started here.

111
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:38,527
Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,327
I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

113
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,427
Quite alright.

114
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:43,527
Alright jentlemen.

115
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,327
You can handle this any
way you'd like to.

116
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:46,927
I have no rules.

117
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:50,027
We can discuss it first and
then vote, that's one way

118
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:53,127
or we can vote and then
see where we stand.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
That's all I have to say...

120
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,536
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

121
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:00,636
Yeah, come on, let's vote!

122
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:02,584
Then we can all go home!

123
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:06,276
It's up to you, but let's just remember
this is a first degree murder charge.

124
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:09,268
If we find him guilty, he
could die by lethal injection.

125
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,084
Yeah, let's vote.

126
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,788
Yeah, let's see who's where!

127
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,536
Anyone who doesn't wanna vote?

128
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,544
Let's just remember that this is gotta be
twelve to nothing either way, that's the law.

129
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:21,188
Everyone ready?

130
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:24,412
All those voting guilty raise your hands.

131
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,940
Eleven.

132
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,680
All those voting not guilty.

133
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,188
One.

134
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,852
Eleven-one guilty.

135
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,172
Now we now where we stand.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Well there's always one, eh?

137
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,312
So what do we do now?

138
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,708
I guess we...talk.

139
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,396
Honestly, you really think he's innocent?

140
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,084
I don't know.

141
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,568
I mean, let's be reasonable here.

142
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,324
You sat in the court room,
you heard everything.

143
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:01,872
The rest of us did. This man is a
dangerous killer, you could see it.

144
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:03,744
Man? He's 18 years old.

145
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,776
He's old enough!

146
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,816
He knifed his own father,
four inches into the chest.

147
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,784
Pretty obvious. I was convinced
on the very first day.

148
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:11,844
Sure, who wasn't?

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I really think this is one of
these open and shut things.

150
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,440
I mean, they proved it a
dozen different ways.

151
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
Would you like to
list'em for you?

152
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:19,376
No, no, no...

153
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,576
Then what DO you want?

154
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:21,984
I just wanna talk!

155
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,796
Well, what's there to talk about?

156
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,576
Eleven men here agree.

157
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,132
I mean, who would have to
think twice about it except you?

158
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,016
Hey look, let me ask
you a question.

159
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,792
Do you really believe
that boy's story?

160
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:37,576
I don't know if I believe his
story or not, maybe I don't.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
So then, why did you
vote not guilty for?

162
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,568
Look, eleven men voted guilty.

163
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:47,184
I just don't find it easy to raise my hand
and send a boy to prison for life

164
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,820
or maybe even to be executed
without talking about it first.

165
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,124
Who says it's easy for me?

166
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:53,536
Noone.

167
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,068
What, because I voted fast?

168
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,860
No.

169
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,268
I honestly think the kid's guilty.

170
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked a 100 years!

171
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,112
I'm not trying to
change your mind.

172
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,496
We're talking about a person's life here.

173
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,992
We can't just decide in 5 minutes.

174
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,044
Suppose we're wrong?

175
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,464
Suppose we're wrong! Suppose
the whole building fell on my head!

176
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:12,816
You could suppose anything you want.

177
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:13,892
That's right.

178
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,712
So then what difference does
it make how long it takes?

179
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:20,304
If we honestly think the kid's guilty,
suppose we finish in 5 minutes, so what?

180
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:24,112
Suppose we take an hour,
your game doesn't start till 8 o'clock.

181
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,396
Ok slugger, be my guest.

182
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,544
Who's got something to say?

183
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,820
Not me.

184
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:38,668
I'm willing to put in an hour.

185
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:42,852
-What?
-Great! I heard a pretty good story last night...

186
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,232
There is this woman, she goes
running into the doctor's office...

187
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:51,172
Excuse me, that's not why
we are sitting in here for.

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,440
Alright then, you tell me
what are we sitting here for.

189
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:59,068
Well, maybe for no reason,
I don't know, but look...

190
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,724
...this kid has been knocked
around all of his life,

191
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,180
been born in a slum, he lost his mother
when he was just, what, 9...

192
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,080
and he spent a year and a half in an orphanage,
while his old man was doing a jail term for forgery.

193
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:13,924
That's not a very good headstart.

194
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,464
He's had a rotten 18 years.

195
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:19,972
I just think we owe that boy
a few words, that's all.

196
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:21,736
Hey look, I don't mind
telling you this mister,

197
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,520
but we don't owe him a thing!

198
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,416
That's right!

199
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:26,472
I mean, he had a fair trial, didn't he?

200
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,592
What do you think that trial cost?

201
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,196
And he was lucky he got it.

202
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,120
We're all grown ups in here and we
heard the facts, now didn't we?

203
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,352
Now you're not gonna sit there 'n' tell us
we're supposed to believe this kid

204
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,656
knowing what he is.

205
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Look, I've lived among them all my life.

206
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:43,424
I mean, you can't believe a word they say.
They are born liars.

207
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,936
It suddenly occurs to me that
you must be an ignorant man.

208
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:49,828
What are you talking about?

209
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,980
You think you have a monopoly on the truth?

210
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:56,028
Why are you making a federal case out of
this, come on man, how do you like this guy?

211
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,660
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

212
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,684
This isn't Sunday, we don't
need a sermon in here.

213
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:05,556
I don't see any need to argue like that, I think
we ought to be able to behave like jentlemen,

214
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:07,596
if we're going to discuss this case.

215
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,468
Maybe the jentleman who's disagreeing
down there could tell us why.

216
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,288
Tell us what he thinks and we could
show him where he's probably mixed up.

217
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
-What are you doing?
-Eh?

218
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:17,144
What is that?

219
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:20,128
It's one of the products I work
on at the ad agency: Rice Pops.

220
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:22,676
"The breakfast with the built in bounce"
I wrote that one.

221
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,044
Oh, that's where that came from.

222
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,344
That's very catchy.

223
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,580
Do you mind?

224
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:32,012
I'm sorry, I just have this habit of doodling.
It keeps me focused.

225
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,860
We're trying to do something.
We could be sitting here forever.

226
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:39,564
No, look, look, look, I might have an idea. I mean
I'm just thinking out loud, but it seems to me

227
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,672
that it's up to us to convince this jentleman
that we're right and he's wrong.

228
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Maybe if we each took a minute or two
to explain how we feel, you know...

229
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:56,124
-It was just a quick thought.
-No, no, no, that's good.

230
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:57,788
Suppose we go once around the table.

231
00:12:57,996 --> 00:13:00,996
-Anything, just let start it off!
-Fine, why don't you go first?

232
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,772
No, not me...

233
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,844
I think we ought to go in order.

234
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:12,352
Ok, that's fair... in order.
Two minutes a piece.

235
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,808
That means you go first.

236
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:18,968
Oh, well, um...

237
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:25,156
Well, it's hard to put it into words....
I just think that he's guilty.

238
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:30,612
I thought it was obvious from the word go.
Nobody proved otherwise.

239
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:35,012
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof rests with the prosecution.

240
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,712
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

241
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,260
I know that! What I meant was...
the man is guilty, there was a witness.

242
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:45,732
Somebody saw him do it.

243
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,608
Ok, here's what I think.

244
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:54,112
And I have no personal feelings at all,
I'm talking facts.

245
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
Number one, let's take the old man who lived
on the 2nd floor directly underneath the room

246
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,744
where the murder was committed.

247
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:06,588
Now, he says that about 10 minutes
after 12 on the night of the killing

248
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,476
he heard a loud noise from upstairs.
Sounded like a fight.

249
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:13,288
And he heard the boy yell out:
"I'm going to kill you"

250
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:17,404
A second later the body hit the floor,
he run to his appartment door, looked out,

251
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,736
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

252
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,500
He called the police and they found
the father with a knife in his chest.

253
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,732
-And the coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

254
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:30,944
He's right. These are facts. You can't
refute facts. This kid's guilty.

255
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:36,128
Look, I'm as sentimental as the next guy.
I know he's only 18.

256
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:38,568
But he's gotta pay for what he did.

257
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,336
I'm with you pops.

258
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,764
It was obvious to me that the
boy's entire story was flimsy.

259
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,148
He claimed he was at the movies
at the time of the killing

260
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:51,316
yet one hour later he couldn't
remember what films he saw.

261
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,940
-He claims that.
-That's right. Did you hear that?

262
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
That's absolutely right.

263
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:59,124
And noone saw him going
into or out of the theater.

264
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,116
And what about the woman
across the street?

265
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,608
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

266
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
That's right, she's the one
who actually saw the killing.

267
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,128
That's right.

268
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Come on fellas, let's go in
order here, come on.

269
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:11,596
Now look. Here's a woman
who's lying in her bed.

270
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:15,232
She can't sleep, dying from the
heat, you know what I mean.

271
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:18,032
And then she looks out the window,
and right across the street

272
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:20,732
she sees this kid stick the knife
into his father.

273
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,588
It's 12.10 on the nose.
Everything fits.

274
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,544
And look, she's known this boy
all of his life.

275
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:30,488
His window is right opposite hers right across
the el tracks and she swore she saw him do it.

276
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Through the windows of
a passing elevated train?

277
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,732
This el train had no passengers on.
It was just being moved downtown.

278
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,120
Lights out, remember that?

279
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:41,956
And they proved in court that at night you can
look through the windows of a passing el train

280
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,448
with the lights out and you can see
what's happening on the other side.

281
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:45,272
Now they proved that!

282
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,684
Could I ask you a question?

283
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:47,948
Go ahead.

284
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:52,016
You don't believe the boy.
Why do you believe the woman?

285
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,428
Isn't she one of them too?

286
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,560
Oh you're just a real smart
fellow, aren't you?

287
00:15:58,644 --> 00:15:59,344
Take it easy.

288
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,884
- What's he so wise about? I'm telling ya...

289
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,144
Alright, alright, we don't need
none of that in here.

290
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,148
Now, whose turn is it?

291
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,388
Alright, you're next.

292
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:14,976
I pass.

293
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,404
-What did he say?
-He passes.

294
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:18,552
It's his priviledge.

295
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,340
How about the next jentleman?

296
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:29,952
I don't know... I came convinced
very early in the case. Excuse me.

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
See, I'm looking for motive.

298
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:36,828
I think it's very important. If you don't
have a motive you don't have a case, right?

299
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:42,128
So anyway, that testimony from those people
across the hall from the kid's apartment,

300
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,560
well, that's why that was so important,

301
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,640
cause didn't they say that the
father 'n' the kid had an argument

302
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,908
and the kid run out sometime around 7 o'clock
that night, I could be wrong about the time...

303
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:55,752
It was 8 o'clock.

304
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,120
Yes, that's right, it was 8 o'clock.

305
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,420
They heard the argument but they couldn't
tell what the argument was about.

306
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,268
Then they heard the father hit the son twice

307
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,968
and then later they saw the son
walk out of the appartment angrily

308
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,536
...but what does it prove?

309
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:11,408
It don't exactly prove anything, I'm just
saying it's part of the picture, that's all.

310
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:15,056
Yeah, but you did say it revealed the motive
and that's what the prosecution said.

311
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,028
To me it's a very weak motive!

312
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:21,792
This boy has been hit so many times
that violence is a normal part of his life.

313
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:25,156
I don't think a couple more hits in the
face would provoke him to murder.

314
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,788
It may have been two hits too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

315
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,500
-Anything else?
-No.

316
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,704
-How about the next jentleman?
-Me?

317
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,204
I don't know...

318
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:42,564
I mean it's practically all
been said already, you know?

319
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:44,712
I mean we could talk about it forever.

320
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,424
This kid's 0 for five.
I mean look at his record.

321
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,492
At 10 he's at juvenile court, he
threw a rock at a teacher,

322
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:53,284
at 14 he was in reform school
cause he stole a car,

323
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:58,268
he's been arrested for muggin', he's been picked up
twice for trying to slash another teen with a knife,

324
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:01,456
he's real good with that switchblade you know.
Everybody said that.

325
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,040
This is a real fine boy.

326
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,428
Ever since he was 5 years old,
his father beat him up

327
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,700
and he used his fists.

328
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,120
So would I. A kid like that?

329
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,100
Wouldn't you call those beatings a
motive for him to kill his father?

330
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:15,596
I'd say it's a motive for him to be
an angry young man, I'd say that.

331
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,032
These kids, the way
they are nowadays.

332
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,764
They're angry, hostile.

333
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:22,652
I mean, look at the way they talk.

334
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:27,284
When I was at his age I called
my father "Sir", that's right!

335
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,880
Ever hear a boy call his
father that anymore?

336
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:33,004
Fathers don't seem to think
that's important anymore.

337
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,488
-No? You got any kid?
-Two.

338
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:36,856
I got one.

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
He is 32.

340
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,424
We did everything in the world for
that boy that could happen.

341
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:45,508
When he was 9 he run away from a fight,

342
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,520
I saw him do it, I was so
ashamed I almost threw up.

343
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:51,104
And I said to him right straight out, I said
"I'm gonna make a man out of you

344
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,732
or I'm gonna bust you in half trying".

345
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,020
I made a man out of him alright.

346
00:18:56,328 --> 00:19:01,028
When he was 16 we got into a battle,
he hit me in the face, big kid, ya know.

347
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,400
I haven't seen him in 14 years.

348
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,080
Rotten kid!

349
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,988
You work your heart out...

350
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:14,376
Well come on, let's get on with it.

351
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,052
I think...I think we're
missing the point here.

352
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,420
This boy, let's say he's a product
of a filthy neighbourhood

353
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,376
and a broken home, he can't help it,

354
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:26,096
we're here to decide whether
he's guilty or innocent of murder,

355
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:28,688
not to go into reasons why
he grew up this way.

356
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,532
He was born in a slum.

357
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:34,948
Slums are breeding grounds for
criminals, I know as a view it's no secret.

358
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:41,376
Slum big grounds are
potential menaces to society.

359
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:42,736
You can say that again!

360
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,020
Alright, kids who crawl out of these
places they're nothing but trash.

361
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,624
Hey, I don't want a think in the
world to do with them, I'm telling you.

362
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,384
I lived in a slum all my life!

363
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:54,952
I nursed that trash in Harlem
hospital six nights a week.

364
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:55,604
Hey, now, come on!

365
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,408
I used to play in a backyard that was full
of garbage, maybe it still smells on me!

366
00:19:58,624 --> 00:19:59,624
Now, come on, why you got to go there...

367
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,200
-Let's be reasonable, there's nothing personal...
-There is something personal!

368
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:06,324
Now, now, let's not be so sensitive.

369
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:08,284
This kind of sensitivity I understand.

370
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:12,376
Alright, let's stop all this arguing,
it's just wasting time.

371
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,952
Now, it's your turn, let's go.

372
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,112
Me? I didn't expect a turn.

373
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:21,904
I thought everybody was trying to convince
me, I thought that was the idea.

374
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:23,616
Check, I forgot about that.

375
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:27,004
I mean, what's the difference? He's the one
keeping us here, let's see what he's got to say.

376
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,820
Wait a minute! We decided we're gonna do
this a certain way, let's stick to what we said.

377
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,344
Come on, stop treating us like kids!

378
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,604
-Kids? What are you talking about?
-Just what I said.

379
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:39,348
What, just that I'm trying to
keep things organised here?

380
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,100
Listen, you wanna do this?
You sit here!

381
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:46,204
You take responsibility.
I'll just shut up.

382
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:49,436
What now, why'd get so hot about it man,
why don't you just calm down up there!

383
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,220
Don't tell me to calm down, here's the chair.
You keep things runnin' smooth 'n' everything.

384
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,484
You think it's a snap?
Come on man Mr. Foreman,

385
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,220
let's see how great you run this show.

386
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,180
-You ever seen a thing like that before?
-Oh you think it's funny now, eh?

387
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:01,804
Hey, this whole thing is unimportant.

388
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,072
It's unimportant? What?
You wanna try it?

389
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:05,768
No, look, you're doing a beautiful job!

390
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:08,868
You're doing a beautiful job!

391
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:14,568
Come on now, let's
hear from somebody.

392
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:15,852
Excuse me jentlemen!

393
00:21:15,912 --> 00:21:18,312
If you would like to hear
how I feel about all of this,

394
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,060
I'd be glad to tell you right now.

395
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,072
I don't care what you gonna do!

396
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,592
Oh now, he's mad, you mad?

397
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:28,188
I don't have anything brilliant and
I already know what you all know.

398
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,084
-From the testimony, the boy looks guilty.

399
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,988
-You can say that again!
-Alright, now maybe he is, but,

400
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:43,328
I spent 3 days in court listening
to that evidence build up and build up

401
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,520
and everyone seemed so positive, I began
to get a peculiar feeling about this case,

402
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:53,732
because nothing is that positive, nothing.

403
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I had a bunch of questions I wanted to ask about all
these things, they mean anything or not I don't know,

404
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:04,944
but I do know that I felt the lawyer, the
boy's lawyer, was not doing his job.

405
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:07,472
He was letting too many
things go by, little things

406
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:10,616
What do you mean little things?
Look, when these guys don't ask questions,

407
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,568
it's because they know the answer and they
figure that they'll probably get hurt by it.

408
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,320
Yeah, but it could also mean that the
lawyer is just plain stupid, couldn't it?

409
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,020
Sounds like you've met my brother in law.

410
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,188
Anyway... I put myself in the boy's place.

411
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:27,648
If I was that boy, I would've
asked for another lawyer.

412
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,628
I mean, if I'm on trial for my life

413
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:38,384
I would want my lawyer to take all of the prosecution's
witnesses and just tear them to shreds, or try.

414
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:42,088
Now look, there was one
eye witness to this killing

415
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:44,516
and someone else said that
they heard it and then

416
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,296
saw the boy running out later.

417
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:52,824
There was a lot of circumstantial evidence, but those
two witnesses where the entire case for the prosecution.

418
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,520
Suppose they were wrong!

419
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,280
What do you mean suppose they were wrong?
What's the point of having witnesses at all?

420
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,344
Could they be wrong?

421
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:05,724
They took the stand under oath!
What are you trying to say?

422
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:08,876
Well, they're people.
People make mistakes.

423
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,708
Could they be wrong?

424
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:14,388
No, I don't think so.

425
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:15,848
Do you know so?

426
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,864
Nobody could know something like that.
This isn't an exact science.

427
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,208
That's right, it isn't.

428
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,156
Let's try to get to the point.

429
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,372
Let's take the knife they
found on the father's chest.

430
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:31,832
Wait a minute! Don't you think we ought to...
Some of the people haven't had the chance to talk.

431
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,888
They can talk anytime they want,
just gimme a second here, will you?

432
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:36,672
What about that knife?

433
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,940
You know the one our fine, upright boy
admitted buying the night of the murder?

434
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:40,828
Let's talk about it.

435
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:41,888
Yes, let's talk about it.

436
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:45,416
As a matter of fact let's look at it again.
I'd like to see it. Mr. Foreman?

437
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,476
We all know what it looks like. What are
we gonna gain by seeing it again?

438
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,480
He brought it up.

439
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:53,164
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits of evidence,

440
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:57,816
the knife, where it was bought,
it's pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

441
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:58,784
Yes I do.

442
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,224
-We're gonna need that knife.
-OK.

443
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:06,448
One: The boy admitted going out of his house
at 8 o'clock on the night of the murder

444
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,156
after being punished several
times by his father.

445
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:13,628
He said slapped, not punished. There's
a difference between a slap and a punish.

446
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,000
After being slapped several
times by his father.

447
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,380
Two: The boy went directly to a neighbourhood
junkshop, where he bought, what do you call it?

448
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:23,732
-Switchblade!
-Switchblade knife!

449
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,916
Thank you, thank you. Three:
This wasn't what you'd call an ordinary knife.

450
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,220
It had a very unusual carved handle.

451
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:36,012
Four: The storekeeper who sold it to him
identified the knife in court and said

452
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:39,916
it was the only one of its kind that
he had ever had in stock.

453
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:46,476
Five: At about 8:45 the boy run into
three friends of his in front of a diner.

454
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:47,836
Am I correct so far?

455
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,480
You bet he is! Listen to this man,
he knows what he's talking about.

456
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:55,872
The boy talked with his friends for
about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

457
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:58,492
During this time,
they saw the switch blade knife.

458
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:04,024
Six: Each of them identified the death
weapon in court as that same knife.

459
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:08,904
Seven: The boy arrived home
at about 10 o'clock.

460
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:12,888
Now, this is where the stories offered by the
boy and the state begin to diverge slightly.

461
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:18,672
He claims that he stayed home until 11:30
then went to one of those all-night movies,

462
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:23,196
he returned home at about 3:50 in
the morning to find his father dead

463
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:24,704
and himself arrested.

464
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,492
Now, what happened to the switchblade knife?

465
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,220
He claims that the knife fell
through a hole in his pocket,

466
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:39,832
sometime between 11:30 and 3:50
while he was on the street to the movie

467
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,608
and that he never saw it again.

468
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,508
No! This is a tale jentlemen!

469
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:47,324
I think it's quite clear that he never
went to the movies that night.

470
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:52,452
Noone in the house saw him go out at 11:30.
Noone at the theatre identified him.

471
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:55,724
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

472
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:59,224
Now... what actually happened is this.

473
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,140
The boy stayed home, had
another fight with his father,

474
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:06,708
stabbed him to death with the knife
at about 10 minutes after 12

475
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,212
and fled from the house.

476
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:11,292
He even remembered to wipe
the knife clean of fingerprints.

477
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:15,608
Thanks man.

478
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:17,128
Please give me the knife.

479
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:21,448
Are you trying to tell me that the knife
fells through a hole in the boy's pocket,

480
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:25,124
that someone picked it up off the street
where it was the boy's house,

481
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,208
stabbed his father, just to be amusing?

482
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:32,664
I'm just saying that it is possible
that the boy lost the knife

483
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:36,136
and somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

484
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:37,876
It's possible, that's all.

485
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:39,552
It's possible...

486
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:44,812
Take a look at that knife.

487
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:46,724
I've never seen one like it.

488
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:48,984
Neither has the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

489
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,700
And you're asking us to accept a
pretty incredible coincidence?

490
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,720
I'm not asking you to accept anything.
I'm just saying that it's possible.

491
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:01,304
And I say it's not possible!

492
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
What are you trying to do?

493
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Who do you think you are...

494
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,820
Hey, what is this? Where
did you get that knife now?

495
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,468
Where has that come from?

496
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:15,176
Quiet, quiet, please!

497
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,300
Where did you get that knife?

498
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:21,128
I was out walking last night,
just...thinking...

499
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:22,792
I was in the boy's neighbourhood,

500
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:26,628
that knife comes from a pawn shop
three blocks from his house,

501
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,240
it cost 25$.

502
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:31,032
-It's against the law to buy it.
-I broke the law.

503
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:36,096
Listen, you pulled a pretty bright trick here,
now suppose you tell me what it proves.

504
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:39,044
There could be ten knives like that, so what?

505
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:40,496
There could be...

506
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:42,248
What does that mean?

507
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:47,276
I mean, so he got the same kind of knife, what
is that, the discovery of the age or something?

508
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:51,984
It'd still be an incredible coincidence for another person
to have stabbed the father with the same kind of knife.

509
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,812
Come on, the odds are a million to one!

510
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,264
But it's possible!

511
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Alright jentlemen, let's take sits.
There's no point meddling around here.

512
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:06,084
Very interesting that he should find
a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

513
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:08,656
What's interesting about it?
It proves anything?

514
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:10,752
Proves? No, no, no...
I didn't mean...

515
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,888
How come the kid bought the
knife in the first place?

516
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:14,812
Well, he claims...

517
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,140
I know he claims he bought it
as a present for a friend of his,

518
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,784
who was gonna give it
to him the next day,

519
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,440
because he busted the other kid's
knife dropping it off the pants!

520
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:23,664
That's what he said.

521
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:28,712
The friend testified in court that
the boy did break his knife.

522
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,608
How long before the killing?

523
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,356
Three weeks, right?

524
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:36,936
So how come our noble lad bought this thing
an half an hour after his father smacked him

525
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:40,756
and three and a half hours before they found
it shoved up to here into the father's chest?

526
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:44,816
Look, he was gonna give it to his friend,
he just wanted to use it first.

527
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:50,996
Let me ask you a question, this is
something I wanted to bring up in court.

528
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:55,132
If the boy did buy the knife to use
on his father, how come he showed

529
00:28:55,236 --> 00:29:00,136
what was going to become the murder weapon to
three friends a couple of hours before the killing?

530
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:01,944
All this is just talk!

531
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,872
The boy lied and you know it.

532
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:05,564
Do you think he lied?

533
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,752
That's a stupid question,
damn right he lied!

534
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,380
And you sir?

535
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:12,468
You don't have to ask me that, you
know my answer - he lied, yes!

536
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:14,048
And you?

537
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,696
-I think maybe...
-Maybe, wait a second!

538
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,792
What are you, the kid's
lawyer or something?

539
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:21,832
Who are you to come in here
and start cross examining us?

540
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:24,224
Isn't this what's supposed
to happen in a jury room?

541
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:27,204
There are still eleven of us
in here who think he's guilty.

542
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,676
Yeah, I mean what'd you
think you gonna accomplish?

543
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:31,432
You're not gonna change anybody's mind!

544
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,184
You wanna be stubborn and
hang this jury? Go ahead!

545
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,504
The kid'll be tried again and
found guilty, as sure as he's born.

546
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:37,712
You're probably right!

547
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,776
So then what do you wanna do about it?
We could be here all night...

548
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:44,132
It's only one night. A boy may die.

549
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,064
Oh brother!

550
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,912
Anybody got a deck o'cards?

551
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,404
I don't think he should joke about it.

552
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,984
I don't see how all this talk about
the knife's got to do with anything.

553
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:57,036
I mean, come on, somebody
saw that boy stab his father.

554
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:58,208
What more do we need?

555
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:01,868
I got three car washes out there going to
pot while we're sitting up in here talking.

556
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:04,108
Come on, let's get done with
this so we can get outta here!

557
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:05,896
Excuse me, but...

558
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,760
...the knife was very important
to the district attorney,

559
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,432
he took one whole morning with that!

560
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:13,088
Come on, that guy was a 15th assistant
or something... What does he know?

561
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:14,852
I think we should get on with it.

562
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:16,892
These side arguments
only slow us up.

563
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:18,728
Now, what about it?

564
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,072
You are the only one...

565
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,636
Jentlemen...

566
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,012
I have a proposition.

567
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:36,852
I'd like to call for another vote,

568
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,068
I want you eleven men to
vote by secret written ballot

569
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,308
and I will abstain.

570
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,308
If all eleven of you vote guilty,

571
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:50,552
I'm not gonna hold out - we'll go in
with a verdict to the judge right now.

572
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:56,392
But if anyone votes not guilty,
then we stay and talk!

573
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:02,436
And... that's all...

574
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,804
I'm ready right now,
if you'll all go for it.

575
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,724
Finally, you're behaving
like a reasonable man!

576
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,216
Come on, let's do it!

577
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,172
Anyone who doesn't agree?

578
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:12,764
Alright, pass these along.

579
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,394
Come on, today man...

580
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:36,444
Alright...

581
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Guilty.

582
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:42,832
Guilty.

583
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,024
Guilty.

584
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:49,008
Guilty.

585
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,056
Guilty.

586
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,104
Guilty.

587
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:58,264
Guilty.

588
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:01,896
Guilty.

589
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:07,848
Guilty.

590
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:14,376
Not guilty.

591
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,304
Guilty.

592
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:23,988
Well how do ya like that?

593
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,652
And another chap flips
his god damn wings!

594
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,440
Come on who was it?
Cause I wanna know!

595
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,280
Excuse me! We agreed that
this would be a secret ballot.

596
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:34,432
-Secret?
-Yeah!

597
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:36,412
-What are you talking about?
-Secret...

598
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,572
There's no secrets in the jury room...

599
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,508
I know who did it...

600
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,280
Brother you are really something,
you know that?

601
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:46,836
You come in here

602
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:49,644
and you vote guilty
like everybody else

603
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,800
and then there's golden voice preacher
over here starts to tear your heart out

604
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:59,064
with a lot of stories about a poor little boy
who just couldn't help becoming a murderer.

605
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:00,704
So you change your vote...

606
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:02,188
...that is the most sickening...

607
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,212
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

608
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,860
Wait a minute, you
can't talk like that!

609
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:10,736
Sit down!

610
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,484
- He's very excitable.
-Damn right I'm excitable!

611
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:16,804
We're trying to put a guilty man where he
belongs and somebody's telling us fairy tales

612
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,800
and we're listening!!!

613
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,380
-Take it easy.
-What do you mean take it easy?

614
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:23,436
You feel like seeing a proven
murderer walking the streets?

615
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:27,672
I'll tell you what! Let's give him his
knife back, make it easier for him!

616
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:29,088
Alright, stop the yelling!

617
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,688
Now does anyone have any other suggestions?

618
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,656
Excuse me,  I would like to say something.

619
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,780
I've always thought that in
this country a man was

620
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,540
entitled to have an unpopular opinion.

621
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,196
Hey look, let's stick
to the subject, ok pal?

622
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,036
Why did you switch your vote for?

623
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:47,316
Now look... ain't none of
your fucking business...

624
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:51,316
He didn't switch his vote, I did.

625
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,684
Would you like me to tell you why?

626
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,128
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why...

627
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:01,132
Well, I'd like to make myself clear anyway...

628
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:02,936
If you don't mind.

629
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:04,088
Do we have to listen to this?

630
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:05,804
Hey look, the man wants to talk!

631
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,112
Thank you!

632
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,584
This jentleman has been
standing alone against us.

633
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,228
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

634
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,336
He just isn't sure.

635
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:26,424
Well it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others...

636
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,208
He gambled for support
and I gave it to him.

637
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,468
I respect his motives.

638
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,968
The boy on trial is probably guilty.

639
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,728
But I wanna hear more...

640
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,088
I'm talking here!

641
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,120
You have no right to just walk...

642
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:46,452
He can't hear you. He never will.

643
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:47,788
Sit down.

644
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:52,072
If the speech is over,
may we go on?

645
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:55,708
I think we ought to take a
break, there is a man inside there...

646
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,892
...we should wait for him.

647
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:33,688
Look I... was pretty excited,
you know what I mean...

648
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:37,412
I didn't mean to get nasty or anything.

649
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,084
Thank you.

650
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:50,736
God, I wish I knew some
way we could break this up.

651
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,116
You know in advertising... I told you
I work in an ad agency, didn't I?

652
00:35:55,032 --> 00:35:56,732
Well, we got some pretty
strange people down there.

653
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,080
Well, not strange really, they
just have peculiar ways

654
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:01,788
of expressing themselves sometimes,
you know what I mean.

655
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:03,448
It's probably the same thing in your business.

656
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:04,892
What is it you do?

657
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:06,644
I'm a watch maker.

658
00:36:07,148 --> 00:36:08,148
Really?

659
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,720
Finest watchmakers in the world
come from Europe, don't they?

660
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:13,796
Anyway! Like I was saying...

661
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,364
At the ad agency, when we reach
a point like this in a meeting,

662
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:18,632
there's always some character
ready with an idea that kills me.

663
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:20,984
I mean it's the weirdest thing
sometimes, the way they...

664
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:22,836
...percieve their idea with some
little phrase, you know,

665
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,500
like some count exec would go

666
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,088
"Oh here's an idea, let's hang around the flag
pole, see if anyone sings the national anthem"

667
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:31,896
or..."Here's an idea, let's put it on the
bus, see if it gets of at Wall Street"

668
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:34,248
I mean, it's idiotic really, but it's funny.

669
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,128
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

670
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:42,688
So, I wonder if I can ask you a question.

671
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:47,956
Are you one of those nation Islam guys? I only
ask cause I've never met one of you guys before.

672
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:50,492
I was...

673
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:53,024
But we didn't exactly see things eye
to eye, you know what I'm saying?

674
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:56,832
Not really...

675
00:36:57,592 --> 00:37:00,292
But anyway, I was wondering
if you could do me a favour,

676
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,760
maybe take it a little easier on the old man.

677
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,752
I figure once you get up that high in
years, you know, deserve a little break?

678
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:12,344
I guess that's a no.

679
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:17,948
-You a salesman?
-No, architect.

680
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,188
-You know what a soft sell is?
-Yes...

681
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:22,392
You're pretty good at it!

682
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,152
I've got a different technique, you know?

683
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:29,308
-Jokes, drinks, knock'em on their asses.
-Yeah...

684
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:32,512
I made 57 thousand last year.
Selling marmalade.

685
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,852
That's not bad. I mean, you know,
considerin' the marmalade.

686
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:44,032
So what are you getting out of this?

687
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:47,092
Kicks? The boy's guilty pal.

688
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,732
Why don't you let us go home
before we all get sore throats?

689
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,300
What's the difference whether you
get one here or at the ball game.

690
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:57,936
....That's too... No difference
pal, no difference at all...

691
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,060
Nice bunch of guys!

692
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,984
-Same as any... I guess.
-Yeah.

693
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,204
-You know, that guy with the hat?
-Yeah.

694
00:38:11,312 --> 00:38:12,512
He's a real prince!

695
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,362
And out loud every second
everyone stalks by this kid

696
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:19,812
...the way he's talking...
is embarassing.

697
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:24,356
Murderous day!

698
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,320
Will we be much longer?

699
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,580
I don't know.

700
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,144
He's guilty you know!
Not a doubt in the whole world.

701
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:33,804
Should have been done by now!

702
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,796
Not that I really care,
I mean, beats working... Right?

703
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:46,476
You think he's innocent?

704
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:47,824
I don't know.

705
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,600
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you've never been wronger in your life.

706
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:54,284
Better wrap it up.

707
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,140
Just waisting your time.

708
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,500
Suppose you were the one on trial.

709
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:06,336
Well... I don't do a lot of supposing...

710
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,544
You know, I'm just the working man.

711
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,612
Let my boss do my supposing.

712
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,940
But if you want I'll try one.

713
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:16,508
Suppose you talk us all out o' this

714
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,200
and that kid really did stick
that knife into his father.

715
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,788
Alright jentlemen, let's take our seats.

716
00:39:36,652 --> 00:39:38,552
Looks like we'll be here for dinner.

717
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:40,184
Let's get down to business.

718
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,052
Who wants to start it off?

719
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:46,232
-I'd like to say something...
-Be quiet...

720
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,456
Excuse me!

721
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:49,548
Number 6.

722
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,420
Alright, please go ahead, go ahead, please...

723
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:54,928
This may be a small point,
but anyway...

724
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,484
The boy had a motive for the killing.

725
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,160
The beatings 'n' all, right?

726
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,320
If he didn't do it, who did it?

727
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,408
Who else had a motive?

728
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:03,928
I mean, that's my point.
You don't go out and just

729
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:06,448
kill somebody for no reason,
unless you're just plain nuts.

730
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:09,332
As far as I can see, we're here to
determine whether or not this boy

731
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,280
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

732
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:14,596
We're not concerned with anyone else's
motives, that's a job to the police.

733
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:19,044
Alright...but it can't help letting the only
motive we know of creep into our thoughts.

734
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:23,352
We can't help asking ourselves,
who else might have had a motive.

735
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,160
I mean, this jentleman is
asking a reasonable question:

736
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:29,264
Somebody killed him, if it
wasn't the boy, who was it?

737
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,048
Modjelewski!

738
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,492
Ohhh, you're talking about the man I love!!!

739
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:37,352
Maybe if you haven't got anything to
add besides jokes, I suggest you listen.

740
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,140
I'm sorry, I was just letting
off steam. Go ahead.

741
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:43,848
Maybe you can answer me, who
else might have killed the father?

742
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,952
Well, I don't know... I mean...

743
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,136
The father was hardly
a model citizen,

744
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:51,076
we knew that he served a prison term

745
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:54,952
and that he was an inveterate
gambler and a consistent loser

746
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,304
and he frequented all of the local bars.

747
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:00,824
Usually after a couple of drinks
he'd get into a fight over a woman

748
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:02,024
...I wouldn't mind telling that...

749
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,040
He was a mean, cruel,
primitive kind of man.

750
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,300
He couldn't even hold a job for longer
than 6 months in his entire life.

751
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:13,244
So, hell, he could have been murdered
by anyone of the prison inmates,

752
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,100
or a bookmaker, or somebody he
beat up, or a woman he picked up,

753
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:20,872
or anyone of those tough guys
that he used to hang around with.

754
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,956
Look, come on man, we know
that the father was a bump,

755
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:24,272
what's that got to do with anything?

756
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:27,836
Well, I didn't bring this thing up, the man
asked who else might have killed the man

757
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:29,112
and I gave an answer.

758
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:31,764
That jentleman there asked a direct question.

759
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:33,728
Well, everybody is a lawyer...

760
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:35,364
Suppose you answer this for me...

761
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,780
The old man downstairs heard the
kid yell loud: "I'm gonna kill you".

762
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:40,348
A split second later, the body hit the floor,

763
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:42,076
then he saw the kid running out of the house.

764
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,640
Now what does all that mean to you?

765
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,560
I was wondering how well you could hear
that boy's voice through the ceiling.

766
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:48,088
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.

767
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:50,476
His window was open. The
window was open upstairs,

768
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:51,564
it was a hot night, remember?

769
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:56,732
The voice was from another appartment, it's very difficult
to identify a voice, let alone a voice that's shouting.

770
00:41:56,888 --> 00:41:58,188
He identified it in court.

771
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:01,896
He picked the boy's voice out
of 5 other voices blindfolded.

772
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:04,704
That was just an ambitious
district attorney putting on a show.

773
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:05,672
Look...

774
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:09,788
The old man knew the boy's voice very well.
They lived in the same house for years.

775
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,200
But to identify the voice positively
from another appartment...

776
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:15,292
Isn't it possible that he was wrong?

777
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:18,288
Isn't it possible that he thought
the boy was upstairs

778
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:21,808
and therefore he just assumed that
the voice he heard was the boy's voice?

779
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:23,864
I think that's a bit farfetched!

780
00:42:24,232 --> 00:42:26,432
Look, the old man heard the father's body falling.

781
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:30,908
Then he saw the boy running out of the house
15 seconds later. Come on, he saw that boy.

782
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,600
What about the woman across the street?
She looked right out into the open window,

783
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:37,004
saw the kid stabbin' his father, I mean, come on.
Isn't that enough for you?

784
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:39,468
-Not right now it isn't.
-Oh man!

785
00:42:39,564 --> 00:42:40,864
How do you like this guy, eh?

786
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:42,464
It's like talking to a dead phone!

787
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:45,944
The woman saw the kid through the
window of a moving elevated train.

788
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:50,552
The train had 6 cars and she saw it
through the windows of the last 2 cars.

789
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,800
I mean, she remembered
the most significant details.

790
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:56,812
I don't see how you can argue with that.

791
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,372
What do you got to say about that?

792
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:00,868
It doesn't seem right to me.

793
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:02,824
Well suppose you think about it, eh?

794
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:10,636
I wonder if there's anyone
here that has an idea

795
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:17,364
how long it would take a 6 car el train,
travelling at, what, medium speed...

796
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:20,588
Wait a minute!

797
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:21,988
This is not a game!

798
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:23,544
-Who do you think you are?
-Take it easy.

799
00:43:23,592 --> 00:43:24,592
Come on now, sit down!

800
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,968
That's all we need, a fighting here!

801
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,884
Did you see him?
The nerve, the absolute nerve!

802
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:32,196
Who does he think he's dealing with here?

803
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,148
Come on now, it's over.
Now let's just sit here...

804
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,440
It's not over, I want an apology!

805
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:38,064
Alright georgie, apologise, now let's
just hear what the man's got to say.

806
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:39,072
Thank you.

807
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:42,152
As I was trying to say, I wonder
if anybody here has an idea

808
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
how long it would take an el train

809
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:48,516
to pass a given point,
going at a medium speed.

810
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:50,128
What the hell does that
got to do with anything?

811
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,400
Well go on, just take a guess!

812
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,620
I wouldn't have the slightest idea.

813
00:43:53,636 --> 00:43:54,436
You?

814
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,400
I don't know, 10, 12 seconds maybe...

815
00:43:56,604 --> 00:43:58,904
-What's all this for?
-Well that sounds like a pretty good guess...

816
00:43:58,952 --> 00:43:59,752
Anyone else?

817
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:01,064
That sounds right to me.

818
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:02,628
Come on, what are the guessing games for?

819
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,540
You, how about you?

820
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:05,404
10 seconds, approximately.

821
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,288
Alright, say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

822
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,280
Just this!

823
00:44:09,452 --> 00:44:12,952
It takes 10 seconds for a six car
el train to pass a given point.

824
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:17,184
Let's say that given point is the open window
of the room where the murder took place.

825
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:22,628
You can practically reach out that window
and touch the el tracks, couldn't you?

826
00:44:22,688 --> 00:44:23,688
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

827
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,464
Let me ask you another question jentlemen.

828
00:44:25,528 --> 00:44:29,828
Is there anybody here who has
ever lived next to an el line?

829
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,968
I just finished painting in an
appartment over next to an el line.

830
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:34,068
-Yeah?
-It took us three days.

831
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,272
-And what was it like?
-What do you mean?

832
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:37,256
Noisy?

833
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:42,428
Yeah! Yeah, noisy! We were all punchy about
our business anyway, but yeah, it was noisy.

834
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:46,284
Yeah, well. When I was very young, I
had an apartment on the second floor

835
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,484
right next to an el line and I wanna tell you,

836
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:53,176
when that window is open and the train
is roaring by, the noise is unbearable.

837
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,652
You can't hear yourself think!

838
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,620
OK, you can't hear yourself think,
now will you get to the point?

839
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,340
OK, let's try and tie two pieces
of evidence together.

840
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:05,372
No 1, the old man in the apartment downstairs,
he swears that he heard the boy say

841
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,180
"I'm gonna kill you" and then a split second later
what sounded like a body falling to the floor.

842
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:12,892
-One second later, am I right?
-Right.

843
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,820
OK. Now the woman across the street,
she swears that she saw the stabbing

844
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,860
through the windows of the last two cars of an
elevated train, the last two cars, am I right?

845
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,076
What are you making here?

846
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:26,716
Alright, we agreed that it takes
10 seconds for an elevated train

847
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:28,048
to pass a given point.

848
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,840
If the woman witnessed the stabbing through
the last two cars, then we must assume

849
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:36,412
that the body fell just as the train was passing by.

850
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:43,148
Therefore, it was roaring by the old man's window
for a full 10 seconds before the body fell.

851
00:45:43,552 --> 00:45:49,852
The old man, now, according to his own testimony,
hearing the boy say "I'm going to kill you"

852
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:55,908
and the body falling, must have heard that statement
while the el was roaring by right under his nose!

853
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,204
It's not possible that he could've heard it.

854
00:45:58,264 --> 00:45:59,864
It's idiotic! Sure he heard it!

855
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:01,448
You really think so, eh?

856
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:04,372
The old man said the boy yelled it
out, that's good enough for me.

857
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:07,884
Well, whatever he heard, he couldn't have
identified the voice with that el roaring by.

858
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,472
You're talking about a matter of seconds here,
nobody could be that accurate!

859
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:18,584
Well, I'll tell ya, I think the testimony that can send
a human being to death should be that accurate!

860
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:27,256
-I don't think he could've heard it...
-Yeah, maybe he didn't hear it with all that el noise.

861
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:28,568
What are you people talking about?

862
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:30,288
-Well it stands to reason.
-It's crazy!

863
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:32,304
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

864
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,188
Attention, maybe.

865
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,280
You keep coming up with these bright sayings. Why
don't you sell'em to the Reader's Digest, they pay $50.

866
00:46:39,808 --> 00:46:42,108
Why do you keep talking to him like that, hah?

867
00:46:42,576 --> 00:46:45,776
No, a guy who talks like that to an old man
ought to get stepped on, know what I mean?

868
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:48,268
You oughta have little respect!

869
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:53,004
You go ahead, you say whatever you
want! Noone's gonna stop you!

870
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,528
Why do you think the old man might lie?

871
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:56,888
Well,...

872
00:46:57,832 --> 00:47:01,832
...it's just that I looked at him for a very long time...

873
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:05,996
The seam of his jacket was split under the arm.

874
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:08,296
Any of you notice it?

875
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:12,612
I mean, to come into court like that.

876
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:22,084
He was a very old man with a torn jacket
and he walked very slowly towards the stand.

877
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:26,964
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it,

878
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:29,272
because he was ashamed.

879
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,780
I think I know him better than anyone here.

880
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:47,156
This is a quiet, frightened, insignificant
old man who's been nothing, all his life.

881
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:51,676
Never had recognition, never seen
his name in the newspapers.

882
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:59,012
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

883
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:00,264
You know...

884
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:04,068
...that's a very sad thing, to be a nothing.

885
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:08,444
A man like this needs to be recognised,

886
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,820
to be listened to, to be quoted, just
once. That's very important.

887
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,200
He would find it hard to recede into the background,
when there's a chance for him to become a...

888
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:26,048
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Are you trying to tell
us that the guy would lie just to be important once?

889
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:29,144
He wouldn't... really lie!

890
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,060
But perhaps he'd make himself believe that

891
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:35,664
he heard those words and recognised the boy's face.

892
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:38,588
That's the most fantastic story I've heard in my life!

893
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,324
How can you just make up some stuff like that?

894
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:42,364
What do you know about it?

895
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:43,396
Sit down!

896
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:44,796
You sit down!

897
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,860
Sit down!

898
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:51,872
Jentlemen, let me remind you, this case is based
on a reasonable and logical progression of facts.

899
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,040
Please, let's keep it.

900
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:59,656
Facts may be covered by the personalities
of the people who present them.

901
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:01,424
Let's not forget that.

902
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,800
-Would anybody like a cough drop?
-Yeah, I would, thank you.

903
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:10,276
Say what you like fellas...

904
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,352
I still don't see how anybody
could think this kid's not guilty.

905
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,280
There's one thing I did wanna
talk about for just a minute.

906
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,820
I think that we have proven that the old man
could not have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you".

907
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:23,332
But suppose that...

908
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:24,284
What are you talking about, "prove"?

909
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:26,684
You haven't proved it at all!
What are you talking about?

910
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,064
But suppose he did hear it.

911
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:33,124
I mean, how many times have we
all probably used that expression?

912
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,000
Hundreds of times, you know!

913
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,260
I could kill you for that darling, or...

914
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:41,072
...junior, I'm gonna kill you if you
do that one more time, or...

915
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:42,664
...kill'em Rocky, kill'em!

916
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:46,768
You know, it's just a common everyday...
It doesn't mean we're gonna kill someone.

917
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,592
Wait a minute, what are you trying to give us here?

918
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,000
The phrase was "I'm going to kill you" and the
kid screamed it out on the top of his lungs.

919
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:55,536
Don't tell me he didn't mean it!

920
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,680
Anybody who says something like that,
the way he said, they mean it.

921
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,384
Well, gee, I...

922
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:02,076
...I don't know...

923
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:08,368
I remember I was arguing with this
guy that I work next to at the bank,

924
00:50:08,444 --> 00:50:11,944
so he called me an idiot, so I was yelling...

925
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:16,024
This man is trying to get you to
believe things that just aren't so.

926
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:19,224
The boy said "I'm going to kill you"
and he did kill him!

927
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,200
Do you really think that he would shout out something
like that for the whole neighbourhood to hear? I don't think so.

928
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:25,644
I think he's too bright for that.

929
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:26,808
Bright?

930
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:28,704
He's the common ignorant slob.

931
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:33,144
-He don't even speak good english.
-He does not even speak good english.

932
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,460
Mr. Foreman...

933
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:40,512
...I'd like to change my vote to not guilty.

934
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:42,968
-Oh you got to be kidding me!
-You heard me.

935
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,100
Are you sure?

936
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,076
Yes, I'm sure.

937
00:50:47,776 --> 00:50:49,776
The vote is 9 to 3 in favour of guilty.

938
00:50:50,268 --> 00:50:51,868
Well, if this isn't the livin' end!

939
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:53,652
What are you basing it on?

940
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:55,656
The stories this guy made up?

941
00:50:55,872 --> 00:50:58,472
I mean, this guy... he should write
for Amazing Detective Monthly.

942
00:50:58,508 --> 00:50:59,708
He'd make a fortune!

943
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:03,344
Now listen, Milwakee, there are facts
there and their right in your face.

944
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:05,976
And everyone of them says
"This kid killed his old man"!

945
00:51:06,876 --> 00:51:09,176
I mean, his own lawyer, knew right from
the beginning he didn't stand a chance.

946
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:10,416
His own lawyer!

947
00:51:10,816 --> 00:51:12,016
You could see it!

948
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:14,396
-Body, he deserves to die!
-Oh, does he?

949
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,320
For your information, it's happened in the past that
people had been convicted of murder and then executed

950
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:24,172
and later, years later, someone comes
along and confesses to the crime.

951
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:28,844
You see, sometimes, the facts that are
staring us in the face are wrong...

952
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,600
Hey listen, I'm talking to him, not to you!

953
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,140
Boy, this guy's beautiful, isn't he?

954
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:36,872
Yeah, listen, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

955
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:39,168
The lawyer presented the case, not you!

956
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:42,416
-How come you got so much to say?
-The lawyer was court appointed!

957
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,216
So what does that mean?

958
00:51:44,316 --> 00:51:45,416
It could mean a hell of a lot!

959
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:49,708
It could mean he didn't want the case, it could mean
he resented being appointed, what's there for him?

960
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,560
No hope, no glory, very little chance of winning.

961
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:56,076
Not a very promising situation for a young lawyer.

962
00:51:56,304 --> 00:52:00,704
He would have to really believe in his
client in order to put up a good fight.

963
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,440
As you mentioned a minute ago, he obviously didn't!

964
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:04,444
Oh sure he didn't!

965
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:06,176
Who the hell could?

966
00:52:06,388 --> 00:52:08,588
Except maybe god come to Earth or somebody...

967
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,360
Come on guys, look at the time!

968
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,168
Pardon me here.

969
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:22,072
-I have some notes here... somewhere...
-Notes?

970
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:27,668
I... would... like... to ask some questions.

971
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:33,556
I've been listening very closely to
what this jentleman has been saying.

972
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:36,224
He's got some very good points to make.

973
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:41,228
Now, from what was presented at the trial,
it seems that the boy is guilty,

974
00:52:41,312 --> 00:52:42,512
but maybe if we go deeper...

975
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:45,104
Come on, will ya?
Gee!

976
00:52:45,816 --> 00:52:47,416
I would like to ask one question.

977
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:51,376
Now, we assumed that the boy commited murder.

978
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:54,524
That he stabbed his father in the chest and then he run away.

979
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,380
This was at 10 minutes after 12.

980
00:52:58,736 --> 00:53:00,336
Now, how was the boy caught...

981
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:01,744
...by the police?

982
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,660
He came back, at about 3 o'clock or so

983
00:53:06,556 --> 00:53:09,556
and he was caught by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

984
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:10,584
Come on man!

985
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:13,092
Now my question is this...

986
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:18,904
If he really did kill his father, why
did he come back 3 hours later?

987
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:23,332
Would he not be afraid of being caught by the police?

988
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:25,812
Look, he came home to get his knife.

989
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:29,948
It's not nice to leave knives sticking
around out of people's chests!

990
00:53:30,152 --> 00:53:31,552
Yes, especially relatives.

991
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,180
-I don't see anything funny about it.
-Neither do I.

992
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:38,972
The boy knew that there were people who could
identify the knife as the one he had just bought.

993
00:53:39,044 --> 00:53:40,544
He had to get it before the police did.

994
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:44,164
But if he knew that the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it in the first place?

995
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:44,996
Oh well...

996
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:48,856
I think we can assume he run out in a
state of panic after he killed his father.

997
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,620
And when he finally calmed down, he
realised that he had left the knife there.

998
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,764
Then this depends on your definition of panic.

999
00:53:56,128 --> 00:54:00,128
Because he was calm enough to make sure
that there were no fingerprints on the knife.

1000
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,420
Now, where did his panic start and where did it end?

1001
00:54:03,496 --> 00:54:05,496
Look, you can throw all that other staff out...

1002
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,220
He came home to dig out his knife and get rid of it.

1003
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:10,424
-Three hours later?
-Sure, three hours later!

1004
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,520
If I had killed my father, I would not be coming back
three hours later, I would be afraid of the police.

1005
00:54:15,012 --> 00:54:18,012
No...I would stay away, knife or no knife!

1006
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:20,716
Look, you voted guilty, didn't you?
What side are you on?

1007
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:24,168
I do not have to be loyal to one side or
the other, I'm simply asking questions.

1008
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,080
Well, look...

1009
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,080
This is just off the top of my head
but it seems to me, I mean,

1010
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:32,196
if I were the kid and I'd, you know,
done the stabbing and all that,

1011
00:54:32,656 --> 00:54:34,356
I'd take a chance and go back for the knife.

1012
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:38,236
I mean, he probably figured that noone's seen
him and nobody didn't discover the body yet.

1013
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
I mean, it was the middle of the night.

1014
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,492
He probably figured that the body
wouldn't be found till the next day.

1015
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,368
Excuse me, but that is my whole point.

1016
00:54:44,056 --> 00:54:44,756
Now...

1017
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:48,076
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing,

1018
00:54:48,088 --> 00:54:49,588
that is a moment after the el train went by,

1019
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:52,096
she screamed, then telephoned the police.

1020
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:56,092
Now, the boy certainly must have heard the
scream and knew somebody saw something.

1021
00:54:56,816 --> 00:55:00,116
No, I do not think the boy would have
gone back if he had been the murderer.

1022
00:55:01,016 --> 00:55:01,816
Two points.

1023
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,124
One...

1024
00:55:03,796 --> 00:55:06,396
In his state of panic, he may
not have heard the scream,

1025
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,600
perhaps it wasn't very loud.

1026
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,900
Two. If he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

1027
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:16,556
Remember, he lived in a neighbourhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

1028
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:17,724
Right! There's your answer.

1029
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:25,232
Maybe the boy did stab his father, did not hear the screams,
run off in a panic and calmed down three hours later,

1030
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:32,340
came back to get his knife, risking being caught by the
police, maybe all of those things are so and maybe not!

1031
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:38,296
I personally think there is enough doubt for us to wonder
if the boy was there at all when the murder took place.

1032
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:40,132
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

1033
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:43,044
Didn't the old man see the boy running out of the house?

1034
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:45,244
Well, see? He's twisting the facts!

1035
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,780
I'm telling you, he's twisting them!

1036
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:51,652
Did or didn't the old man see the boy running
out of the house at 12:10? Did he or didn't he?

1037
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,180
-He says he did...
-Well... "He say's he did"?

1038
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:56,532
How do you like this?
"He says he did"...

1039
00:55:56,932 --> 00:56:00,132
Did or didn't the woman across the
street see the boy kill his father?

1040
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,440
She said she did!

1041
00:56:01,832 --> 00:56:03,732
You make it like it don't matter what people say.

1042
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,640
What you wanna believe, you believe,
what you don't wanna believe, so you don't!

1043
00:56:08,216 --> 00:56:09,416
What kind of way is that?

1044
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,180
And what do you think these people
get up on the witness stand for?

1045
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:13,592
Their health?

1046
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,040
I'm telling you man, the facts
are being changed in here.

1047
00:56:16,116 --> 00:56:18,916
Witnesses are being doubted and there's no reason for it!

1048
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:20,232
Witnesses can make mistakes.

1049
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
Yeah, when you want'em to they do!
You know what I mean?

1050
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:24,672
Alright now, let's keep the yelling down.

1051
00:56:24,776 --> 00:56:25,576
Well you keep saying that!

1052
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:27,052
What we need in here is a little yelling.

1053
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,708
These men running off every each way.
Did hear the scream, didn't hear the scream...

1054
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:32,172
What difference does it make?

1055
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:33,436
Those little details!

1056
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,060
You guys are missing the important stuff.

1057
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:38,964
-I mean, all of a sudden you hear everybody...
-I would like to call for another vote.

1058
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,120
-I'm talking here!
-Another vote called for here, jentlemen take your sits.

1059
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:44,604
-What are we gonna gain by voting again?
-I don't know.

1060
00:56:44,688 --> 00:56:47,088
The man asked for another vote,
we're gonna have another vote.

1061
00:56:47,728 --> 00:56:49,928
I've never seen so much time spent on nothing!

1062
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:51,404
It only takes a second...

1063
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:54,116
Alright, the fastest way is to
find out who's voting not guilty.

1064
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:56,872
All those in favour of not guilty raise your hand.

1065
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:00,504
Three...

1066
00:57:01,308 --> 00:57:02,108
...still the same.

1067
00:57:02,248 --> 00:57:04,048
Three not guilty, nine guilty.

1068
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:05,332
So, where are we?

1069
00:57:05,532 --> 00:57:08,932
I mean, come on, we can yakety-yakety until
next Tuesday. Where is it getting us?

1070
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:09,824
Pardon me...

1071
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:11,712
I would like to change my vote.

1072
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:13,516
I vote not guilty.

1073
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:15,108
Oh brother!

1074
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,600
Come on now, listen, what are you talking about?

1075
00:57:18,732 --> 00:57:20,032
We're all going crazy in here!

1076
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,900
This kid is guilty.

1077
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,340
Why don't you pay attention to the facts?

1078
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:24,408
Tell him, will you?

1079
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:25,572
This is gotta be a god damn joke!

1080
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:28,336
The vote is 8 to 4 in favour of guilty.

1081
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:31,932
I mean, everybody's heart is starting
to bleed for this punk little kid,

1082
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:35,372
like the president just declared "Love Your
Underpriviledged Brother Week" or something...

1083
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:35,972
Listen to me!

1084
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:38,268
I want you to tell me why you changed your vote.
Come on, give me reasons!

1085
00:57:38,284 --> 00:57:42,884
I do not have to defend myself to you.
I now have reasonable doubt.

1086
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:44,784
"Reasonable doubt"...
That's nothing but words!

1087
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:46,308
Look at the knife!

1088
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:50,676
The kid you just decided is not guilty was
seen ramming that thing into his father.

1089
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:53,404
Well, look at it, Mr. "Reasonable Doubt"!

1090
00:57:53,912 --> 00:57:54,912
That's not the knife...

1091
00:57:56,204 --> 00:57:57,304
...don't you remember?

1092
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,460
Brilliant!

1093
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:01,848
You know this is the craziest...

1094
00:58:02,496 --> 00:58:04,796
I mean, you're pulling stories out of thin air.

1095
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,496
What are we supposed to believe?

1096
00:58:07,544 --> 00:58:13,144
I'm telling you, if this guy was sitting ringside at the
Tyson Holyfield fight, he'd be trying to tell us Tyson won!

1097
00:58:13,968 --> 00:58:15,868
Look, what about the old man, eh?

1098
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,480
Are we supposed to believe that he didn't get up and run
to his front door and see that kid tearing down the stairs,

1099
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:22,344
15 seconds after the killing?

1100
00:58:22,692 --> 00:58:24,992
He's only saying it so he can be important, right?

1101
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:27,528
-I mean, what's the point of this...
-Wait... wait a second, wait a second!

1102
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:32,088
The Milwakee rooter is heard from and pop-ups
are fallin' for base hits wherever we look at.

1103
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:34,048
Did the old man say he run to the door?

1104
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,300
Run, walked, what's the difference?
He got there!

1105
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,204
He said he run.

1106
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:40,184
I don't remember what he said,
but I don't see how he could run!

1107
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:44,268
He said he run, he run from his bedroom
to the front door. That's enough, isn't it?

1108
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,336
Where exactly was that bedroom again?

1109
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:48,628
It was down in the hall somewhere.
You don't remember that?

1110
00:58:49,288 --> 00:58:51,088
-No...
-I thought you remembered everything!

1111
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:54,468
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see a diagram
of the apartment again please.

1112
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,980
Why don't we run the trial over just to
see if we can get everything straight...

1113
00:58:57,044 --> 00:58:58,244
-Mr. Foreman...
-I heard you.

1114
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,284
What's all this for?

1115
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,120
How come you're the only one in the room
who wants to see exhibits all the time.

1116
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:03,192
I wanna see this one too!

1117
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,600
And I wanna stop wasting time...

1118
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:08,636
If we are going to start wading through all this business
about where the body was found, then we can...

1119
00:59:08,684 --> 00:59:09,484
No, we're not!

1120
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,560
I just wanna find out if a man who limps
because he had a stroke a year ago,

1121
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:15,048
can get from his bed to his front door in 15 seconds.

1122
00:59:15,056 --> 00:59:16,556
He said 20 seconds...

1123
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:19,256
-15!
-I'm telling you he said 20. Why do you always distort him?

1124
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:20,352
He said 15...

1125
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,520
How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1126
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:23,708
You can't judge a thing like that!

1127
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:27,532
He said 15 seconds. He
was very positive about it.

1128
00:59:27,616 --> 00:59:30,516
He's an old man, you saw him.
Half the time he was confused!

1129
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:33,112
How could he be positive ab...about anything?

1130
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:35,424
I don't see what we're going to prove here.

1131
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:39,268
The man said he saw the boy running
out, that's what he said to us.

1132
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:41,116
Well, let's see if the details bear him out.

1133
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,740
Now, the minute the body fell,
the old man says he heard footsteps

1134
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:46,608
running towards the front door upstairs.

1135
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:51,096
Then he heard that upstairs door open and
the footsteps continued down the stairway.

1136
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:55,708
He got to his front door as fast as he could, swears
it couldn't have been more than 15 seconds,

1137
00:59:56,532 --> 00:59:59,632
-Now if the killer started to run immediately...
-Well, maybe he didn't!

1138
01:00:00,168 --> 01:00:01,268
The old man says he did.

1139
01:00:01,272 --> 01:00:04,172
You oughta be down at Atlantic City
at the hair-splitters' convention.

1140
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:07,288
Hey baseball, why don't you stop with
the smart remarks all the time?

1141
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:11,512
Oh my friend, for your $15 a day
you gotta listen to everything.

1142
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,400
Ok, now you got that thing in here...
...what about it?

1143
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:15,232
May I?

1144
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:20,568
Ok, this is the apartment where the killing took place.

1145
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,680
The old man's apartment is exactly
like it, directly underneath.

1146
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:26,384
Now, here's the el line,

1147
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:30,232
here's the bedroom, living room,
the kitchen and the bath,

1148
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,580
here's the hallway and way down there is the front door
to the apartment and here are the steps that go down.

1149
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:40,652
Now, the old man was in bed in this room.

1150
01:00:41,232 --> 01:00:43,332
He says he got up, he went into the hall,

1151
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:46,132
went all the way down the hall, opened the front door,

1152
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:50,208
just in time to see the boy racing down the stairs.

1153
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:51,384
Am I right?

1154
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,240
That's the story... for the 19th time!

1155
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:56,096
15 seconds after he heard the body fall.

1156
01:00:56,424 --> 01:00:57,124
Correct...

1157
01:00:57,244 --> 01:00:58,844
The old man's bed was by the window.

1158
01:00:59,228 --> 01:01:04,028
That means he had to walk... 12 feet
from the bed to the bedroom door

1159
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:09,728
and the hall is... 43 feet 6 inches...
down to the front door.

1160
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:14,752
That means that he had to get up, get out of
bed, walk 12 feet, open the bedroom door,

1161
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:19,156
walk 43 feet and open the front door to his apartment,

1162
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,004
all in 15 seconds...

1163
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,360
Does anyone think he could have done it?

1164
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,488
-Sure he could have done it!
-He can only walk very slowly...

1165
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,500
There they helped him to the witness chair...

1166
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:28,392
You make it sound like a long walk!
It's not!

1167
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,240
For an old man who's had a stroke...
it's a long walk!

1168
01:01:34,136 --> 01:01:34,836
What are you doing?

1169
01:01:35,056 --> 01:01:36,956
I wanna set this up, see how long it took him.

1170
01:01:37,048 --> 01:01:40,248
What do you mean you wanna set this up?
Why didn't the kid's lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

1171
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:41,484
Maybe he just didn't think of it!

1172
01:01:41,804 --> 01:01:44,304
What do you mean he didn't think of it?
Do you think the guy's an idiot or something?

1173
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:46,412
-It's an obvious thing, isn't it?
-Did you think of it?

1174
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:48,768
Look smart guy, don't matter what,
I thought of it over the night.

1175
01:01:48,808 --> 01:01:50,408
Alright, let's calm it down.

1176
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,120
He didn't bring it up cause he thought
it was gonna hurt his case.

1177
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,480
Wait a minute! Maybe he didn't bring
it up because it would seem as if

1178
01:01:55,576 --> 01:01:59,676
he was badgering and pressuring a helpless
old man, which does not sit well with a jury,

1179
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,316
lawyers try to avoid that sort of thing if they can...

1180
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:03,884
What kind of bum is he then?

1181
01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:05,664
That's exactly what I've been asking!

1182
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,560
Now, let's say this is the old man's bed.

1183
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:10,648
First, I'm gonna pace off 12 feet,
that's the length of the bedroom.

1184
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:14,232
You're crazy! You can't
recreate a thing like that!

1185
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,828
You wanna do me a favour?
Could you hand me that chair?

1186
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,980
Put it right here...
This is the bedroom door.

1187
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,840
Now the hallway was...what? It was 43 feet.

1188
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,580
Well, I'll pace over to that wall and
then back around this way again.

1189
01:02:30,704 --> 01:02:34,304
This is absolutely insane! What's the
idea behind wasting everybody's time with this?

1190
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:38,448
...11...12... Look, it's only gonna
take 15 seconds according to you!

1191
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,076
...40...41...42...43.

1192
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:53,484
If you would... thank you very much!

1193
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,260
This is the doorway out into
the hall and the stairway going down.

1194
01:02:57,968 --> 01:02:59,868
It was chain locked according to testimony.

1195
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,216
Now, does anybody here got
a second hand on their watch?

1196
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:02,996
I have.

1197
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:08,480
Alright. Will you just stamp your foot when
you want me to go, that'll be the body falling, alright?

1198
01:03:08,504 --> 01:03:09,504
Time me from then.

1199
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,860
Anybody for charades?

1200
01:03:10,948 --> 01:03:13,748
-I've never seen anything like this in my whole...
-Alright, I'm ready.

1201
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,600
Come on, come on, won't you?

1202
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:17,736
I'm waiting for the second hand to reach sixty.

1203
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:19,980
Go!

1204
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:28,384
Oh come on, step it up, he
walked twice as fast as that!

1205
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,188
That's too slow!

1206
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:32,832
-That's how he walked, he walked like an old man!
-...what will this kid's stuff do?

1207
01:03:33,664 --> 01:03:35,564
-No. That's too slow...
-...that's the way he walked.

1208
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,040
You want me to walk faster?
Alright, I'll walk faster.

1209
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:51,548
-This is a trial for murder!
-Relax, will ya? Jeez!

1210
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,636
Time!

1211
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:03,812
Exactly 42 seconds!

1212
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:05,612
42 seconds?

1213
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:07,524
42 seconds.

1214
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,420
Here's what I think happened.

1215
01:04:11,324 --> 01:04:14,824
I think the old man heard the fight
between the boy and his father earlier

1216
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:17,284
and then a couple of hours later, lying in bed,

1217
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,908
he heard the body hit the
floor at the boy's apartment

1218
01:04:19,976 --> 01:04:22,176
and heard the woman scream across the street.

1219
01:04:23,016 --> 01:04:24,416
He tried to get to the front door.

1220
01:04:24,496 --> 01:04:28,796
He heard someone running down the
stairs and he assumed that it was the boy.

1221
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:31,296
I think that's possible.

1222
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:32,264
Assumed?

1223
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,636
Now listen to me people!

1224
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,360
I've heard all kinds of dishonesty
in my day, but this little display...

1225
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:41,128
...takes the cake! You come in here,

1226
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:45,428
with your sanctimonious talk
about slum kids and injustice

1227
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:47,644
and you make up a lot of wild stories

1228
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:51,032
and all of a sudden you're gettin' through
to some of these little old ladies in here.

1229
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,100
But you're not getting through to me!
I've had enough!

1230
01:04:53,548 --> 01:04:55,048
What is the matter with you people?

1231
01:04:55,528 --> 01:04:58,228
Everyone of you knows he's guilty! He's got to burn!

1232
01:04:59,056 --> 01:05:00,756
We'll let him slip through our fingers!

1233
01:05:00,804 --> 01:05:03,504
"...let him slip through our fingers..."
What are you, his executioner?

1234
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,324
I'm one of them!

1235
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:05,612
Maybe you'd like to put the needle in!

1236
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:06,988
For this kid? You bet I would!

1237
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,504
God, I'm sorry for you...

1238
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,576
Don't start with me now!

1239
01:05:09,608 --> 01:05:13,908
Ever since we've walked into this room, you've
acted like a self-appointed public avenger.

1240
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:15,072
Shut up!

1241
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:19,752
You want the boy to die for your own
personal reasons, not because of the facts!

1242
01:05:22,312 --> 01:05:23,212
You're a sadist!

1243
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,580
I'll kill him!
I'll kill him!

1244
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:26,644
You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?

1245
01:05:31,892 --> 01:05:33,192
What the hell's going on here?

1246
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,788
Nothing.

1247
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,320
Just a little argument, everything's
fine brother, everything is...

1248
01:05:39,324 --> 01:05:40,124
...fine.

1249
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,428
Just.. things just got a little heated.

1250
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:45,184
Thank you.

1251
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,640
What are you staring at?

1252
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,080
Well, I suppose we need someone
else to start this off again, eh?

1253
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:08,412
It's getting late.

1254
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:11,008
What do they do?
Take us out to a restaurant or something?

1255
01:06:11,512 --> 01:06:12,412
I don't know.

1256
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:15,932
I sure hope they let us go home in
case we don't finish this case tonight.

1257
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:18,768
My little grandson has the
mumps, face up to here,

1258
01:06:18,996 --> 01:06:21,596
my wife says he looks like Fat Albo...

1259
01:06:23,948 --> 01:06:25,648
Well, look guys,

1260
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:29,056
if noone else has any ideas, I might
have a cute one here, I mean...

1261
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:33,788
...I ain't putting my stock into it, but let me throw it out
in the stoop, see if the cat licks it up, what do you say?

1262
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:36,056
"... the cat licks it up"

1263
01:06:37,408 --> 01:06:38,508
Yeah... it's an expression...

1264
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:42,728
It wasn't much of an idea really...

1265
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:49,656
Look how dark it's getting there.

1266
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:51,732
We're gonna have a storm.

1267
01:06:52,436 --> 01:06:54,836
-Well...
-Boy, it's hot!

1268
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,340
Don't you sweat?

1269
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:01,828
No, no, I don't...

1270
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:03,932
I don't either.

1271
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:09,976
Well, listen! I'm wondering...
maybe we could take another vote.

1272
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,562
Yeah... Maybe we can follow this one
up with dancing and refreshments!

1273
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:16,528
-Mr. Foreman...
-Alright with me.

1274
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:17,933
Anyone who doesn't wanna vote?

1275
01:07:19,094 --> 01:07:23,833
I think we should have an open ballot.
Call out your votes, see who stands where.

1276
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,289
Alright... The last vote was 8 to 4 in favour of guilty.

1277
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,004
I'll just call out your jury numbers.

1278
01:07:31,357 --> 01:07:33,277
I vote guilty. Number 2?

1279
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:36,652
Not guilty.

1280
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,600
Number 3?

1281
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:40,872
Guilty.

1282
01:07:41,868 --> 01:07:43,168
-Number 4?
-Guilty.

1283
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,900
Number 5...

1284
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:46,096
Not guilty.

1285
01:07:47,532 --> 01:07:48,432
Number 6...

1286
01:07:50,668 --> 01:07:51,668
Not guilty.

1287
01:07:53,796 --> 01:07:54,696
Number 7...

1288
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:57,064
Guilty.

1289
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:58,792
Number 8...

1290
01:07:59,044 --> 01:08:00,144
Not guilty.

1291
01:08:00,972 --> 01:08:02,472
-Number 9...
-Not guilty.

1292
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:04,672
Number 10...

1293
01:08:04,768 --> 01:08:06,268
He's guilty brother.

1294
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:08,264
Number 11...

1295
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,384
Not guilty.

1296
01:08:10,468 --> 01:08:11,368
Number 12...

1297
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,760
Guilty.

1298
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,400
6 to 6.

1299
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:23,284
And we go into extra innings here.

1300
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,400
6 to 6!

1301
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:28,408
Well, I'm telling you, some of you people
have lost your damn minds! A kid like that!

1302
01:08:29,312 --> 01:08:32,012
I don't think the kind of boy
has anything to do with it.

1303
01:08:32,836 --> 01:08:34,836
The facts are supposed to determine the case.

1304
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,420
Oh, don't give me any of that "facts"!

1305
01:08:36,596 --> 01:08:37,596
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1306
01:08:37,816 --> 01:08:38,816
Twist'em any way you want to!

1307
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
Facts! Facts!

1308
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:46,244
That's... That's exactly the point that
this jentleman has been making!

1309
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:52,562
You... You keep shouting at the top of your lungs as
though that were some sort of solution, I mean...

1310
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:58,865
I just wish I was a little younger...

1311
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:04,001
-It's gonna rain.
-No! How did you figure that out?

1312
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:07,883
How come you switched?

1313
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,444
Well, it just seemed...

1314
01:09:09,472 --> 01:09:11,172
You haven't got a leg to stand on, don't you?

1315
01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:12,924
I don't feel that way.

1316
01:09:13,436 --> 01:09:15,836
-There were a lot of details that didn't come out.
-Details?

1317
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:20,290
Look, you just let yourself to get bulldozed by
a bunch of these old white washed intellectuals.

1318
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,780
-That's not so!
-Oh come on, this is me!

1319
01:09:22,531 --> 01:09:26,268
You're just like some other folks your age, you're scared
of the white man! They say something, you get low...

1320
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:27,356
Hey you, listen!

1321
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:30,592
-... you make stuff I said!
-You have no right to...

1322
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,380
You... loudmouth!

1323
01:09:34,924 --> 01:09:36,524
-Oh oh! Here it comes!
-Look at that.

1324
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,760
Get that window, come on!

1325
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:44,776
What's with this window here?

1326
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,140
Let's try to get this air conditioning
working in here, what do you say, eh?

1327
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:01,952
Hey! Look at this!

1328
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,440
Hey, it must have been connected to the light switch, eh?

1329
01:10:14,324 --> 01:10:15,324
Some rain, eh?

1330
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:21,028
And what about this thing - even Steven...

1331
01:10:22,112 --> 01:10:23,512
Kinda surprising, isn't it?

1332
01:10:23,772 --> 01:10:24,672
Yeah, yeah...

1333
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:28,452
You know, that business before,
when that guy was baiting me...

1334
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:32,956
That doesn't prove anything!
I'm a very excitable person, I mean...

1335
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:38,100
Where does he come off calling me a public
avenger and a sadist and everything?

1336
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,276
Anybody in his right mind
would've blown his stack, right?

1337
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:43,684
He... was just tryin' to bait me.

1338
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:45,472
He did an excellent job.

1339
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:49,208
Man, look at it go...

1340
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:53,544
You know, it reminds me of the...

1341
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,316
... city championships three years ago.

1342
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,260
What a game!

1343
01:11:01,628 --> 01:11:04,828
Score was tie, 21-21, it could've gone out of the way...

1344
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:07,516
We had this young brother Yelder.

1345
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:08,628
Great kid.

1346
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,656
Quiet, respectful, wiry,

1347
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:14,236
but he could shake you out of your shoes!

1348
01:11:16,504 --> 01:11:17,504
Nobody could touch him.

1349
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:19,876
I'm the football coach over at Bay Side.

1350
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,160
These gaps he just started to have around him,

1351
01:11:23,928 --> 01:11:26,828
the refs said they requested
the game just to see him play.

1352
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,300
He was renowned... I mean... I...

1353
01:11:30,336 --> 01:11:31,836
I'd built the whole team around him.

1354
01:11:32,016 --> 01:11:33,227
I knew better, but I...

1355
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,147
...but I loved the kid.

1356
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,860
We came out at half time and it..

1357
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,407
... already began pouring.

1358
01:11:43,335 --> 01:11:45,346
Now, at the 4rth quarter the field was mud bath!

1359
01:11:45,736 --> 01:11:47,636
Yelder of course, he couldn't get to sweating.

1360
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:53,268
He sat scatback and there it was a big fullback that's
rammed down our throats and... won the game.

1361
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
But, you know...

1362
01:11:56,432 --> 01:11:57,632
I'll always remember...

1363
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,740
Yelder after the game...

1364
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,275
sitting on the bench...

1365
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:05,758
still in his uniform...

1366
01:12:10,227 --> 01:12:14,024
staring off into... space.

1367
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:22,635
His... broken heart!

1368
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:41,447
Isn't that the dumbest thing you ever saw?
6 to 6!

1369
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:42,984
It's a joke!

1370
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:45,516
What are we gonna do about it?
Can we break it somehow?

1371
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:48,278
Yeah, well, six fools in there aren't
gonna change their minds...

1372
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:52,748
I thought they already have changed their mind.
There's no reason why they can't be persuaded to do it again.

1373
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,840
And how?

1374
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:56,092
Just by using logic!

1375
01:12:56,824 --> 01:12:57,624
Yeah, logic, eh?

1376
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:00,614
You listen to this man, he's the
only one in the room who knows.

1377
01:13:00,996 --> 01:13:01,996
Hey, you want my opinion?

1378
01:13:02,632 --> 01:13:03,332
Go ahead.

1379
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,688
I think we should just quit.

1380
01:13:05,504 --> 01:13:06,704
What are you talking about?

1381
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:09,272
I mean, come on, these six people in there,

1382
01:13:09,724 --> 01:13:11,916
all of a sudden they act like it's
some kind of mission or something.

1383
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:15,652
I mean, come on, they're not gonna switch.
Let's just go to the judge or we'll be here all night.

1384
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,070
Let's just go and tell her that we're hung.

1385
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:18,176
To hell with this!

1386
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,620
What am I supposed to do?
Break my brain over some... scum like that?

1387
01:13:21,512 --> 01:13:23,512
You took an oath in the courtroom!

1388
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:24,732
You can't just quit.

1389
01:13:24,928 --> 01:13:25,728
Why not?

1390
01:13:26,172 --> 01:13:27,072
It's dishonest!

1391
01:13:27,344 --> 01:13:28,644
Why don't you just vote not guilty?

1392
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:30,738
No, I voted guilty cause I think he's guilty!

1393
01:13:30,836 --> 01:13:33,384
-But you don't care about what happens to him!
-No, why should I?

1394
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,889
Stop this! We're not going
to get anywhere like this.

1395
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,996
I mean, come on, what does he want?
I gave him an honest opinion.

1396
01:13:38,092 --> 01:13:38,792
I know.

1397
01:13:39,892 --> 01:13:40,992
Oh, I suppose you don't think much of it...

1398
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:42,456
No, I don't!

1399
01:13:45,752 --> 01:13:47,452
How about him?
Is that something?

1400
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,160
Ah well, a hung jury doesn't mean anything.

1401
01:13:50,804 --> 01:13:53,500
Just have to start the trial again with another jury.

1402
01:13:53,568 --> 01:13:54,442
That's not what we're here for...

1403
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:55,706
What the hell is the difference?

1404
01:13:55,836 --> 01:13:57,101
A hung jury's what you're gonna get!

1405
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,220
Alright, look! I'll tell you what I think, alright?

1406
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:04,456
We ain't going nowhere in here!

1407
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:07,306
I'm ready to go into court right
now and declare a hung jury.

1408
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:08,516
Yeah, I go for that too!

1409
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:11,696
Come on, let's take it to the judge.
Let this kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1410
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,888
The court is not going to accept a hung jury.
We haven't been here long enough.

1411
01:14:15,904 --> 01:14:16,909
Well, let's find out!

1412
01:14:16,988 --> 01:14:18,164
I'm not in favour of this.

1413
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:21,460
Listen, this kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury and you know it.

1414
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:23,255
Come on, we're hung...

1415
01:14:23,448 --> 01:14:26,219
Nobody's gonna change their opinion!
Let's take it inside.

1416
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:28,584
You still don't think there's any
room for reasonable doubt?

1417
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:29,952
No, I don't.

1418
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:33,408
Pardon, maybe you do not fully
understand the term reasonable doubt.

1419
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,383
Oh, what do you mean I don't understand?

1420
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:37,966
Who the hell are you to talk to me like that?

1421
01:14:39,248 --> 01:14:40,721
How do you like this guy, eh?
I'm telling you...

1422
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,338
They're all the same...

1423
01:14:43,036 --> 01:14:45,134
You come over to this country
running for your life

1424
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:47,798
and before you can take a big breath
he's telling us how to run the show.

1425
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:49,766
The arrogance of this guy!

1426
01:14:50,136 --> 01:14:52,876
-Oh you call him arrogant cause he wasn't born here.
-Please don't...

1427
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:55,025
Well, I'm calling you arrogant
cause you were, how's that?

1428
01:14:55,044 --> 01:14:56,576
-Hey look, sonny...
-And who the hell are you calling sonny?

1429
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,500
Hey look, sonny!

1430
01:14:57,564 --> 01:15:00,452
Nobody around here's gonna tell me what
words I understand and what words I don't.

1431
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:01,776
Especially him!

1432
01:15:02,352 --> 01:15:05,665
Cause I'll knock his middle eastern
European god damn head off!

1433
01:15:05,712 --> 01:15:07,184
Alright, cut the bullshit.

1434
01:15:07,464 --> 01:15:09,264
We're not going in as a hung jury.

1435
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,869
Come on, let's get back to work.

1436
01:15:11,984 --> 01:15:15,939
I think there's something I would like to
discuss, if it's alright with you jentlemen.

1437
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:19,251
An important point the prosecution
raised, was the fact that the boy,

1438
01:15:19,304 --> 01:15:20,965
having said that he was at the movies,

1439
01:15:21,344 --> 01:15:23,304
during the time the murder occured,

1440
01:15:23,428 --> 01:15:27,460
could not remember the names of the
films or the stars that were in them.

1441
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:30,616
-This jentleman has raised that point several times.
-That's correct.

1442
01:15:31,212 --> 01:15:36,787
It was the only alibi the boy offered and he himself
couldn't back it up with any details at all.

1443
01:15:36,872 --> 01:15:39,686
Well, putting yourself in the boy's place, if you can,

1444
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:42,410
do you think that you would
be able to remember details

1445
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:45,672
after an experience such as your
father hitting you on the face?

1446
01:15:45,836 --> 01:15:50,755
Yes, I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

1447
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:55,385
He couldn't remember the movies at the theatre
he named because he wasn't there that night.

1448
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,827
Well, the police said they interrogated
the boy in the kitchen of his apartment,

1449
01:15:58,912 --> 01:16:01,775
while his father's body lay
on the floor of the bedroom.

1450
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,295
Do you think that you could remember
details under a situation such as that?

1451
01:16:06,716 --> 01:16:07,616
Yes, I do.

1452
01:16:07,736 --> 01:16:09,667
Under extreme emotional stress?

1453
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,537
Under extreme emotional stress, yes, yes...

1454
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,447
Of course, in court, he did remember
the names of the pictures

1455
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,166
and he remembered the names of
the stars that appeared in them.

1456
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:20,762
Oh, yes! His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

1457
01:16:21,132 --> 01:16:25,999
He had three months from the night of the murder
to the day of the trial in which to memorise them.

1458
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,928
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated him right after the murder.

1459
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,246
Then he couldn't remember a thing about the movies.

1460
01:16:34,472 --> 01:16:36,573
Great emotional stress or not!

1461
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:38,811
Ok... Could I ask you a personal question?

1462
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:39,728
Oh, please, go ahead, go ahead...

1463
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:40,944
Where were you last night?

1464
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,296
I was home, yes..

1465
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,063
Ok... The night before that?

1466
01:16:44,108 --> 01:16:45,008
Hey, come on, what is this?

1467
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:46,673
It's perfectly alright... wait, wait...

1468
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:47,804
The night before...

1469
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:54,094
I went from home to my office, stayed until 8:30,
then I went straight home to bed, yes.

1470
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:55,805
Alright... and the night before that?

1471
01:16:56,785 --> 01:17:00,778
That was... Tuesday... thank you, Tuesday.

1472
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,766
That was the night of the bridge tournament...
Yes, yes, I played bridge.

1473
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,424
And Monday night?

1474
01:17:06,544 --> 01:17:09,798
When you get them down to
New Year's Eve 1972, let me know!

1475
01:17:09,852 --> 01:17:10,652
Wait, wait...

1476
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,936
Monday night...

1477
01:17:14,244 --> 01:17:16,223
...Oh yes! My wife and I went to the movies.

1478
01:17:16,244 --> 01:17:17,844
Ah... What did you see?

1479
01:17:21,396 --> 01:17:28,050
"Lies... and... secrets". It was a very
touching story about a black woman who...

1480
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:28,860
Excuse me!

1481
01:17:29,908 --> 01:17:32,139
It's called "Secrets and lies".

1482
01:17:32,872 --> 01:17:34,593
"Secrets and lies", yes...

1483
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,398
Correct. And who was in "Secrets and lies"?

1484
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:42,527
Wait, wait, wait a minute...
It was something with a 'B'... it was 'Be'...

1485
01:17:44,044 --> 01:17:44,644
I think...

1486
01:17:45,072 --> 01:17:46,960
Yeah, Bella, Bella... Bella...

1487
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:48,024
It was Brenda.

1488
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:49,288
Brenda,

1489
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:51,853
...was her name. And what was her last name?

1490
01:17:55,096 --> 01:17:56,096
It was an english movie...

1491
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,934
The actors that I'm not familiar with...

1492
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,892
...There was something with 'U'...

1493
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:07,509
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1494
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:11,395
And you weren't under great emotional
stress at the time, were you?

1495
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:14,380
No sir, I... wasn't... sorry.

1496
01:18:15,364 --> 01:18:16,664
I think the point is made!

1497
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:18,216
Yeah, big point!

1498
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,640
I think it is a big point.

1499
01:18:21,084 --> 01:18:24,058
What, because he couldn't remember the
name of a couple of two brit movie stars?

1500
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:26,788
Oh well, I guess that proves that
the kid was at the movies then.

1501
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:30,033
No, but it indicates that noone
can prove that he wasn't.

1502
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,540
He might have been at the movies
and forgotten what he saw,

1503
01:18:34,116 --> 01:18:35,016
it's possible...

1504
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:38,848
If it's perfectly logical for this
jentleman to forget a few details,

1505
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,537
it's perfectly logical for the boy!

1506
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:45,294
Being accused of murder isn't supposed
to give him an infallible memory.

1507
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:49,942
Man, you can talk till your tongue is draggin'
on the ground, ok? The kid is guilty, period!

1508
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,280
You know what I mean, my friend?

1509
01:18:53,456 --> 01:18:54,577
Who's got the cough drops?

1510
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,871
They're all gone... my friend.

1511
01:19:00,888 --> 01:19:04,591
You know, there's something we're forgetting
here, that I was just thinking about

1512
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:10,859
and that's that old business that dragged down forever
with the psychiatrists, where he got all involved with...

1513
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:14,491
Oh come on, don't start with all that phony,
psycho, whatsyoucallem stuff!

1514
01:19:15,236 --> 01:19:18,024
That boy would have reckon that is, fill
the people's heads with all that junk.

1515
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:20,926
I got three psychiatrists bringing in
collars to my detail shop,

1516
01:19:21,008 --> 01:19:22,984
the whole three of them bullies is crazy!

1517
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,280
I'm trying to make a point...

1518
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:28,338
I will give you a buffalo nickel for a
psychiatrist's testimony, I would... I would!

1519
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:30,156
Why won't you let the man talk?

1520
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,956
You can do five minutes on the usages
of psychiatry after he's through.

1521
01:19:35,032 --> 01:19:36,032
What I was gonna say,

1522
01:19:36,432 --> 01:19:40,368
was that the psychiatrist definitely stated that
the boy had strong homicidal tendencies,

1523
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,962
that he was capable of commiting murder.

1524
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:47,308
He also described all those tests, etc.

1525
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:49,471
The boy definitely was the killer type!

1526
01:19:49,664 --> 01:19:50,264
Am I right?

1527
01:19:50,288 --> 01:19:52,960
I think he said something about
paranoid enmities, if I'm not mistaken.

1528
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,860
That's right!

1529
01:19:54,376 --> 01:19:55,876
Let's just try to remember he said it.

1530
01:19:56,705 --> 01:20:00,187
Let's not forget that we're talking about a boy
here who's always had murder on his mind.

1531
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:01,456
His unconscious mind!

1532
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:03,372
I beg your pardon! In discussing...

1533
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:05,752
"I beg your pardon"!
Why are you so damn polite about?

1534
01:20:07,376 --> 01:20:11,564
For the same reason that you are not:
It was the way I was brought up...

1535
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:14,610
In discussing such a thing as the murder potential,

1536
01:20:15,112 --> 01:20:19,448
we must remember that many of us are capable
of commiting murder, but few of us do.

1537
01:20:19,768 --> 01:20:22,140
We impose controls upon ourselves to prevent it.

1538
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:26,648
Now the most that these psychiatric tests
can accomplish along these lines is this...

1539
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,368
They can tell us that some day, a
particular person may commit murder.

1540
01:20:31,468 --> 01:20:33,691
That is all! They prove nothing!

1541
01:20:33,768 --> 01:20:35,576
Then how come they're admitted in evidence?

1542
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:37,611
They have many uses, of course...

1543
01:20:38,048 --> 01:20:42,098
In this case, they added to the general impression
the prosecution was trying to create.

1544
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,291
Perhaps we would find,

1545
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:47,208
if the twelve of us men took the same tests,

1546
01:20:47,532 --> 01:20:52,011
one or two of us might be discovered to
have the subconscious desires to kill

1547
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:54,597
and the potentiality of carrying them out.

1548
01:20:55,312 --> 01:20:56,902
Yet, none of us has...

1549
01:20:57,576 --> 01:20:59,952
To say that the man is capable of murder,

1550
01:21:00,124 --> 01:21:02,088
does not mean that he has commited murder.

1551
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:03,452
Yeah, but it could mean it!

1552
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:07,311
Look, if they said that this kid is capable of
killing, he could've killed, couldn't he?

1553
01:21:07,356 --> 01:21:12,617
You're the one who said and I quote: "I wouldn't give
a buffalo nickel for a psychiatrist's testimony"!

1554
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:17,996
5 to 6...

1555
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,220
Look at that rain...

1556
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,612
There goes the old ball game.

1557
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:30,832
Say... Say... Could I see that knife for a second?

1558
01:21:33,796 --> 01:21:34,996
Alright jentlemen...

1559
01:21:37,052 --> 01:21:38,552
...we're still tied 6 to 6.

1560
01:21:40,612 --> 01:21:42,688
-Who's got a suggestion?
-I do. Where's that dinner?

1561
01:21:43,112 --> 01:21:45,476
-Let's go until 7, give it another hour.
-Ok.

1562
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,448
Listen... Something... Something I wanna say.

1563
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,024
It's been bothering me a little and...

1564
01:21:51,492 --> 01:21:52,992
as long as we're stuck...

1565
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:54,864
Well,

1566
01:21:55,532 --> 01:22:02,481
there was this whole business about the stab wound,
how it was made, the downward angle, you know?

1567
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:06,469
-You're not gonna start that again, they went over 'n' over it!
-I know they did, but I...

1568
01:22:07,648 --> 01:22:09,048
...I can't go along with it.

1569
01:22:10,116 --> 01:22:11,016
The boy...

1570
01:22:12,436 --> 01:22:16,408
...was, what, 5 feet 7 inches tall, right?

1571
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:21,159
And according to the medical examiner,
the father was 6 feet 2.

1572
01:22:21,788 --> 01:22:24,984
Now, that's a difference of 7 inches.

1573
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:29,612
Now, it's an awkward thing to...

1574
01:22:30,456 --> 01:22:36,320
stab down into somebody's chest when he's
more than half a foot taller than you are.

1575
01:22:36,788 --> 01:22:37,888
Give me that thing!

1576
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,809
You won't be satisfied till you see this again,
so I'm gonna give you a little demonstration.

1577
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,340
Somebody get up.

1578
01:22:51,048 --> 01:22:51,748
Ok...

1579
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:56,415
Watch this please, I don't
wanna have to do it again.

1580
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,564
I'm about 6 or 7 inches shorter than you, right?

1581
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:11,124
Yeah, maybe even a little more.

1582
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:12,852
Well, let it be more.

1583
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,496
-Hey, that ain't funny!
-What's the matter with you?

1584
01:23:22,772 --> 01:23:23,872
Calm down...

1585
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,200
Nobody's hurt, right?

1586
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,392
Nobody's hurt.

1587
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:29,284
Now...

1588
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:33,538
...there's you angle. Take a look at it. Down and in.

1589
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:37,970
That's the way I would stab a taller
man and that's the way it was done.

1590
01:23:38,536 --> 01:23:41,256
Now go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.

1591
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,674
Down and in! That's how it was done.

1592
01:23:44,168 --> 01:23:46,118
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Let me see that!

1593
01:23:48,172 --> 01:23:50,451
This is a stiletto, not a switchblade.

1594
01:23:51,388 --> 01:23:52,488
I hate these things!

1595
01:23:53,419 --> 01:23:54,503
I grew up with them.

1596
01:23:54,956 --> 01:23:56,356
Have you ever seen them used in a fight?

1597
01:23:56,748 --> 01:23:57,748
Too many of them.

1598
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,836
On my stoop, in my backyard...

1599
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:01,584
...a lot across the street...

1600
01:24:03,392 --> 01:24:05,292
These came with the neighbourhood where I lived.

1601
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,420
It's funny I wasn't thinking of it...

1602
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:11,912
I guess I try to forget those things...

1603
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,184
You can't use this kind of knife that way.

1604
01:24:17,576 --> 01:24:19,576
You have to hold it like this to release the blade.

1605
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,223
In order to stab downwards
you have to change your grip.

1606
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:25,232
Well, how do you use it?

1607
01:24:25,396 --> 01:24:27,196
Underhand, like this.

1608
01:24:28,892 --> 01:24:31,469
Anyone who's ever used one of these
would never handle it any other way.

1609
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,160
Are you sure?

1610
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,191
Yeah, I'm sure. That's
why it's made like this.

1611
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:38,838
Well, we all agree that that boy is
pretty handy with the knife, right?

1612
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:39,808
Yeah, that's right.

1613
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:42,299
You think he could have made the
kind of wound that killed his father?

1614
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,496
Not with the experience he'd had using
these things, no, I don't think he would.

1615
01:24:46,642 --> 01:24:47,745
He'd go for my laying...

1616
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,048
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1617
01:24:50,144 --> 01:24:51,144
No... neither was anyone else.

1618
01:24:51,148 --> 01:24:53,755
You're giving us a lot of mumbo
jumbo, I don't believe it!

1619
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:58,781
I don't think you can determine the type of
wounds this boy might or might not have made,

1620
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,325
simply because he knows
how to handle a knife.

1621
01:25:01,372 --> 01:25:02,772
That's right, that's absolutely right!

1622
01:25:03,584 --> 01:25:04,684
What do you think?

1623
01:25:07,164 --> 01:25:08,064
Well...

1624
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:10,272
...I don't know.

1625
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:11,596
What do you mean you don't know?

1626
01:25:12,144 --> 01:25:13,144
I don't know!

1627
01:25:17,672 --> 01:25:18,472
How about you?

1628
01:25:21,984 --> 01:25:23,984
Hey listen, listen, listen...
I'll tell you something...

1629
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,872
Now, I'm a little sick of this whole
thing already, you know?

1630
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,840
I mean, all this yapping is getting us nowhere!

1631
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:30,871
So, I'm gonna break it up here.

1632
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:32,924
I'm changing my vote to not guilty!

1633
01:25:33,024 --> 01:25:34,024
You're what?

1634
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,120
You heard me. I... I've had enough!

1635
01:25:36,248 --> 01:25:37,967
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1636
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:40,606
Hey listen, you... You just
worry about yourself!

1637
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:41,568
He's right!

1638
01:25:42,112 --> 01:25:43,512
That is not an answer!

1639
01:25:44,696 --> 01:25:46,596
What kind of man are you?

1640
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,808
You have been sitting here,
voting guilty with everyone else,

1641
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:53,374
because there are a couple of baseball
tickets burning a hole in your pocket?

1642
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:58,996
And now you say you're going to change your vote
because you've had enough with all the talking?

1643
01:25:59,216 --> 01:26:00,016
Alright, listen buddy...

1644
01:26:00,148 --> 01:26:01,448
You cannot do this!

1645
01:26:02,376 --> 01:26:04,476
You cannot play like this with a man's life!

1646
01:26:04,888 --> 01:26:05,888
What is wrong with you?

1647
01:26:06,052 --> 01:26:08,912
It is a terrible and ugly thing to do!
Do you not care?

1648
01:26:09,036 --> 01:26:10,136
Hey, wait a minute!

1649
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,100
You can't talk like that to me !

1650
01:26:12,112 --> 01:26:12,912
I can talk like that to you!

1651
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:16,801
Now, if you want to vote not guilty, then do it because
you are convinced that the man is not guilty,

1652
01:26:16,812 --> 01:26:18,212
not because you've had enough.

1653
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,192
If you want to vote guilty, then vote that way.

1654
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:22,333
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1655
01:26:22,524 --> 01:26:23,624
Hey now, listen buddy!

1656
01:26:23,936 --> 01:26:25,528
Guilty or not guilty?

1657
01:26:25,608 --> 01:26:27,130
I told you, not guilty!

1658
01:26:27,212 --> 01:26:27,812
Why?

1659
01:26:27,984 --> 01:26:29,936
God damn you, I don't have to tell you anything!

1660
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,640
Yes, you do! Say it, why?

1661
01:26:38,104 --> 01:26:39,404
Cause I don't think he's guilty...

1662
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:05,844
Mr. Foreman, I wish to call for another vote.

1663
01:27:07,672 --> 01:27:08,672
Alright jentlemen,

1664
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:11,128
another vote is called for.

1665
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,398
And the quickest way is to show off hands.

1666
01:27:13,988 --> 01:27:14,988
Anybody object?

1667
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,260
All those in favour of not guilty raise your hands.

1668
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:31,339
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 8.

1669
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:36,864
9.

1670
01:27:41,164 --> 01:27:44,127
All those voting guilty, raise your hand.

1671
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:47,326
1...2...

1672
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:53,208
...3.

1673
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:57,284
The vote is 9 to 3 in favour of not guilty.

1674
01:27:57,928 --> 01:27:59,328
I don't understand you people!

1675
01:28:00,116 --> 01:28:03,858
I mean, all these little picky points you
keep bringing up don't mean nothing!

1676
01:28:04,044 --> 01:28:05,044
They don't mean nothing!

1677
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,440
How can you believe this story?

1678
01:28:09,948 --> 01:28:13,693
You're an intelligent man and you're not gonna tell
me that you're not, you know the facts of life.

1679
01:28:14,212 --> 01:28:15,512
Just look at what we're dealing with here.

1680
01:28:15,684 --> 01:28:16,684
You know him!

1681
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,960
You know this kid!

1682
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:22,517
This guy other here, I don't know
what the hell is going on with him,

1683
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:25,785
all that talk about psychiatrists...
Maybe he ought to go to one!

1684
01:28:27,656 --> 01:28:29,200
Now look! Let's talk facts.

1685
01:28:29,876 --> 01:28:32,752
These people are born to lie.

1686
01:28:33,128 --> 01:28:36,331
Now, that's the way they are and no
intelligent man is gonna tell me otherwise.

1687
01:28:36,364 --> 01:28:38,643
They don't know what the truth is!
You take a look at them!

1688
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:39,648
They're different!

1689
01:28:39,764 --> 01:28:44,138
They think different, they act different and they
don't need some big excuse to kill somebody either.

1690
01:28:44,244 --> 01:28:46,020
Well, it's true! Everybody knows it.

1691
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:48,687
Smoking that crack...
Nothing but crack he is!

1692
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,000
Look at him, smart guy...

1693
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,040
...what's that mean, slam the door?...

1694
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,914
Anyway, these people they get all drugged up

1695
01:28:58,668 --> 01:28:59,768
and BANG!

1696
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:01,856
All of a sudden somebody's
lying dead in the gutter...

1697
01:29:01,932 --> 01:29:06,187
Ok, look, nobody's blaming'em for. That's just the
way they are by nature, you know what I mean?

1698
01:29:06,256 --> 01:29:09,653
They're violent! And human life don't
mean as much to them as it does to us.

1699
01:29:11,276 --> 01:29:12,276
Where are you going?

1700
01:29:12,888 --> 01:29:13,888
Where are you going?

1701
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:17,328
Look, while you're in there, maybe you ought to
clean out your ears, maybe you can hear then.

1702
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,760
Now look, listen to me now!

1703
01:29:23,832 --> 01:29:27,243
These spics! They stay high on
dope and they fight all the time...

1704
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:30,302
Look, if somebody gets killed, so
somebody gets killed, they don't care!

1705
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:32,912
They breed like animals...

1706
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:36,869
Ok, sure, there's some good things about them...

1707
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,544
Look, I'm the first guy to tell you that...

1708
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:40,468
I've known some who were ok...

1709
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:42,196
...but that's the exception!

1710
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,094
You know you're a sick man?

1711
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,356
-Sick?
-Why don't you sit down?

1712
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,515
You old son of a bitch!
Who are you?

1713
01:29:49,096 --> 01:29:50,753
No, who the hell is he to tell me that?

1714
01:29:50,812 --> 01:29:53,592
Sick... Look at him! He can hardly stand up!

1715
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:56,535
No, I'm speaking my piece here
today and you're listening!

1716
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,040
-Maybe you should...
-You shut up, you sit down!

1717
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,508
There's not one of them,...
not one, that's any good!

1718
01:30:01,752 --> 01:30:02,952
NOT ONE!!!

1719
01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:04,652
You hear that?

1720
01:30:05,744 --> 01:30:07,644
Sympathetic bastards!

1721
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:10,919
And you were to wonder
you're so god damn smart...

1722
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:13,637
We're facing a danger, don't you know that?

1723
01:30:14,128 --> 01:30:15,816
These wetbacks are multiplying like rabbits!

1724
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:19,934
They come over here illegally and they're
multiplying five times faster than my people!

1725
01:30:20,608 --> 01:30:22,108
That's five times, brothers!

1726
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,476
And they're wild animals!

1727
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,528
They're against us, they hate us!

1728
01:30:26,836 --> 01:30:28,136
They want to destroy us!

1729
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:31,955
They come over here and they benefit
from everything that we've built!

1730
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:34,431
That's right! Don't look at me like that...

1731
01:30:34,524 --> 01:30:35,624
There's a danger...

1732
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:38,304
We are living in a dangerous time, brothers!

1733
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,266
If we don't smack them down, if we don't
do something, every chance we get,

1734
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:44,932
then they're gonna own us!

1735
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:47,233
-They're gonna bring us out of existance...
-Shut up!

1736
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:49,044
...I'm warning you! You listen to me...

1737
01:30:49,668 --> 01:30:50,868
I'm telling you, this boy...

1738
01:30:51,344 --> 01:30:54,456
...put this boy on trial, we got him.

1739
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,040
We got him!

1740
01:30:56,228 --> 01:30:57,328
That's one at least!

1741
01:30:57,671 --> 01:31:00,481
I say that we get him,
before his kind gets us!

1742
01:31:00,592 --> 01:31:02,392
I don't give a damn about the law!

1743
01:31:03,052 --> 01:31:05,176
Why should I? They don't!

1744
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,666
-Now, I'm telling you...
-I've heard enough!

1745
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,972
Won't you just stop all of this!

1746
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,181
Come on, wake up man! We
can make a difference here!

1747
01:31:12,192 --> 01:31:13,292
Sit down...

1748
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,574
... and don't open your filthy mouth again!

1749
01:31:43,328 --> 01:31:44,528
Alright jentlemen.

1750
01:31:45,784 --> 01:31:47,184
Let's finish what we started.

1751
01:31:54,293 --> 01:31:55,910
You have made some excellent points.

1752
01:31:56,496 --> 01:32:02,376
The last one, in which you proved that the boy couldn't have
made that kind of overhand stab wound was very persuasive.

1753
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:05,831
But I still believe the boy is guilty for the murder.

1754
01:32:06,404 --> 01:32:07,704
I have two reasons.

1755
01:32:07,804 --> 01:32:13,692
One: The evidence given by the woman across
the street, who actually saw the murder commited.

1756
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:18,064
... and how... As far as I'm concerned that's the
most important testimony in the whole case!

1757
01:32:18,536 --> 01:32:19,236
Two...

1758
01:32:19,468 --> 01:32:26,439
The fact that the woman described the stabbing by
saying she saw the boy raise his arm over his head,

1759
01:32:26,552 --> 01:32:28,216
over his head, right up,

1760
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,496
and plunge the knife down into his father's chest.

1761
01:32:32,816 --> 01:32:33,856
She saw him do it!

1762
01:32:33,892 --> 01:32:34,892
The wrong way!

1763
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:36,555
That's right, that's absolutely right!

1764
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:39,720
So let's talk about this woman for a minute here...

1765
01:32:40,256 --> 01:32:45,100
She said that she went to bed at
about 11 o'clock that night, yes.

1766
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:48,023
Her bed was next to the window,

1767
01:32:48,048 --> 01:32:53,014
she could look out while lying down and see
directly into the boy's window across the street.

1768
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:55,976
She tossed and turned for over an hour,

1769
01:32:56,068 --> 01:32:57,916
unable to fall asleep. Finally...

1770
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,408
...she turned towards the window,

1771
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,168
at about 10 minutes after 12,

1772
01:33:03,392 --> 01:33:04,992
and as she looked out,

1773
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:09,608
she saw the killing through the
windows of the passing el train.

1774
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,768
She says, the lights went out
immediately after the killing,

1775
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:19,486
but that she got a good look at the
boy in the act of stabbing his father.

1776
01:33:19,588 --> 01:33:26,080
You know, as far as I can see,
this is unshakeable testimony!

1777
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,816
That's what I mean, it's the whole case!

1778
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,680
What do you think?

1779
01:33:34,932 --> 01:33:36,132
What about you?

1780
01:33:39,124 --> 01:33:40,024
Well...

1781
01:33:40,452 --> 01:33:41,852
... I don't know, it's...

1782
01:33:43,188 --> 01:33:46,328
There's so many things to shift through... I... I...
This is pretty complicated business...

1783
01:33:47,736 --> 01:33:50,907
Really, I don't see how we
can vote for an acquiter?

1784
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:52,788
Well...

1785
01:33:53,692 --> 01:33:56,788
...it's just not easy to arrange
the evidence in order.

1786
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,848
You can throw out all the other evidence!

1787
01:33:58,952 --> 01:34:01,956
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1788
01:34:02,868 --> 01:34:04,526
Well... maybe...

1789
01:34:04,552 --> 01:34:05,652
Let's vote now.

1790
01:34:06,524 --> 01:34:08,501
Alright jentlemen, another vote is called for.

1791
01:34:09,204 --> 01:34:10,304
Anyone object?

1792
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,902
I'm changing my vote. I think he's guilty...

1793
01:34:15,444 --> 01:34:16,644
Anybody else?

1794
01:34:16,868 --> 01:34:19,888
What makes you consider this
one vote a personal triumph?

1795
01:34:19,896 --> 01:34:21,396
I'm the competitive type!

1796
01:34:21,652 --> 01:34:25,192
Here's what I think... I think we're a
hung jury, let's take it inside to the judge.

1797
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:26,024
What?

1798
01:34:26,984 --> 01:34:29,500
-You didn't want a hung jury before...
-Well, I do now!

1799
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,120
I... I don't understand that.

1800
01:34:32,512 --> 01:34:33,952
You thought it was immoral.

1801
01:34:34,148 --> 01:34:35,880
I don't anymore...

1802
01:34:38,356 --> 01:34:41,413
People in here are so god damn stubborn!

1803
01:34:42,464 --> 01:34:44,608
We'll never get this done,
we'll be here for a week!

1804
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:46,828
I wanna hear an argument.

1805
01:34:46,912 --> 01:34:48,630
I say we're a hung jury...

1806
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:49,800
Well, come on!

1807
01:34:49,948 --> 01:34:51,673
You're the leader of the cause, what about it?

1808
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:53,448
Let's go over it again.

1809
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,908
We went over it again...

1810
01:34:54,988 --> 01:34:59,824
J. Walter Thomson over here has been
bouncing back and forth like a ping pong ball!

1811
01:34:59,884 --> 01:35:02,352
-Wait a minute... You don't have to call me...
-I apologise!

1812
01:35:02,428 --> 01:35:03,628
On my knees!

1813
01:35:04,028 --> 01:35:04,928
Come on...

1814
01:35:05,404 --> 01:35:06,804
Let's get out from under this thing, eh?

1815
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,880
Alright, alright...

1816
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:11,512
Maybe we can talk about setting
some kind of a time limit.

1817
01:35:11,536 --> 01:35:13,036
-What's the time?
-Quarter after six.

1818
01:35:13,144 --> 01:35:16,744
Quarter after six... Someone
before mentioned seven o'clock.

1819
01:35:16,968 --> 01:35:22,386
I think that's the point at which we might begin to discuss
the question about whether we are a hung jury, or not.

1820
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,680
-Excuse me!
-Yes.

1821
01:35:23,724 --> 01:35:24,824
Don't you feel  well?

1822
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,185
Oh, I feel perfectly well, thank you very much.

1823
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:29,292
I was saying, 7 o'clock would be...

1824
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:33,754
The reason I asked was that
you were rubbing your nose...

1825
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,696
I'm sorry to interrupt...

1826
01:35:37,056 --> 01:35:39,864
...but you made a gesture,

1827
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:42,605
that reminded me of one of the witnesses...

1828
01:35:42,672 --> 01:35:44,772
I was trying to say something here, do you mind?

1829
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:46,972
I think this is important!

1830
01:35:47,224 --> 01:35:49,156
Ok, go ahead, please, go ahead...

1831
01:35:49,164 --> 01:35:50,064
Thank you!

1832
01:35:52,084 --> 01:35:54,284
I hope you'll forgive me for this, but...

1833
01:35:55,388 --> 01:35:57,012
...I was wondering why...

1834
01:35:57,612 --> 01:36:00,288
...why were you rubbing your nose like that?

1835
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:02,364
Come on now, would you please?

1836
01:36:02,684 --> 01:36:03,984
Right now,

1837
01:36:04,288 --> 01:36:06,633
I'm talking to this jentleman here.

1838
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:08,164
Now...

1839
01:36:08,612 --> 01:36:10,189
Why were you rubbing your nose?

1840
01:36:10,568 --> 01:36:12,342
Well, if it's any of your business,

1841
01:36:12,424 --> 01:36:15,169
I was rubbing it because it bothers me.

1842
01:36:15,684 --> 01:36:18,384
Is it because of your eyeglasses?

1843
01:36:18,892 --> 01:36:22,228
It is, yes, it is, could we get on
to something else please?

1844
01:36:22,288 --> 01:36:26,487
Your eyeglasses make those deep
impressions on the side of your nose.

1845
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,560
Yes...

1846
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,280
I hadn't noticed that before...

1847
01:36:31,308 --> 01:36:32,800
They must be annoying.

1848
01:36:33,212 --> 01:36:36,175
Oh yes, oh yes, they are...
Very, very annoying.

1849
01:36:36,264 --> 01:36:37,548
I wouldn't know about that.

1850
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,384
I've never worn eyeglasses.

1851
01:36:41,884 --> 01:36:42,984
20-20!

1852
01:36:43,308 --> 01:36:45,496
Hey come on with the optometrist bit already!

1853
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:50,796
The woman who testified that she saw the killing,

1854
01:36:51,888 --> 01:36:55,268
had those same deep marks on the side of her nose.

1855
01:36:55,344 --> 01:36:56,044
Wow!

1856
01:36:56,216 --> 01:36:57,216
Did you see that?

1857
01:36:59,984 --> 01:37:02,431
Please... please... just a minute!

1858
01:37:02,872 --> 01:37:04,432
Please! Just a minute...

1859
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,240
...and I'll be finished.

1860
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,468
I don't know if any of you noticed that...

1861
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,480
...I didn't think about it then...

1862
01:37:13,992 --> 01:37:17,580
...but, I've been going over her face in my mind...

1863
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,560
She had those marks!

1864
01:37:21,396 --> 01:37:22,896
She kept rubbing them in court...

1865
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:24,639
-He's right!
-He's right, she did do that a lot!

1866
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,780
This woman,

1867
01:37:28,312 --> 01:37:30,112
was about 45 years old,

1868
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:34,035
making a tremendous effort to look 35...

1869
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:36,116
You know, for her first public appearance...

1870
01:37:38,508 --> 01:37:40,880
Dyed hair, heavy make-up

1871
01:37:41,676 --> 01:37:43,476
and brand new clothes...

1872
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:47,216
...which would have been more
suitable on a younger woman...

1873
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,308
...and... no eyeglasses!

1874
01:37:54,304 --> 01:37:55,825
See if you can get a picture a mental picture of her.

1875
01:37:55,996 --> 01:37:58,912
What do you mean no glasses?
You don't know if she wear glasses!

1876
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,516
Just because she was rubbing her nose?

1877
01:38:00,588 --> 01:38:02,388
She had those marks.
I saw them!

1878
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,236
So what? What do you think that means?

1879
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:06,040
I saw them too. He's right!

1880
01:38:06,628 --> 01:38:07,928
I was the closest one to her...

1881
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:09,748
She had those marks!

1882
01:38:09,996 --> 01:38:11,496
What point are you trying to make here?

1883
01:38:11,536 --> 01:38:12,736
She had them!

1884
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:15,616
That's the point I'm trying to
make... she had those marks!

1885
01:38:16,028 --> 01:38:21,677
She had dyed hair and marks on her nose,
now I'm asking you, what does that mean?

1886
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:26,316
Could those marks have been made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1887
01:38:26,656 --> 01:38:27,892
No... no... they couldn't...

1888
01:38:27,948 --> 01:38:29,636
What are you saying?
I didn't see any marks!

1889
01:38:30,652 --> 01:38:32,552
I... I did... yes, I did...

1890
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,120
Strange, I...

1891
01:38:35,656 --> 01:38:37,856
...didn't think about it before, strange...

1892
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,600
What about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say anything?

1893
01:38:40,684 --> 01:38:44,301
Look, there's twelve people in here that
have been concentrating on this case

1894
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:45,888
and eleven of us didn't think of it.

1895
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:47,916
Alright... Clarence Daryl!

1896
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,268
What about the district attorney?

1897
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:54,905
Do you think he'd try to pull a trick like that,
letting her testify without her glasses?

1898
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,665
Haven't you ever met a woman who needed glasses

1899
01:38:56,776 --> 01:38:59,352
but didn't want to wear them because
she thought they ruined her looks?

1900
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:00,516
Yeah, my wife!

1901
01:39:00,608 --> 01:39:02,874
I'm telling you, she walks out of the
house, she takes off her glasses,

1902
01:39:02,968 --> 01:39:05,968
she puts them in her purse, she walks down
the street and starts bumping into shit...

1903
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,168
Maybe the district attorney didn't know either.

1904
01:39:08,932 --> 01:39:10,432
Just what I was gonna say.

1905
01:39:10,592 --> 01:39:11,592
Alright.

1906
01:39:12,248 --> 01:39:15,362
She had marks on her nose, I'm giving you that...

1907
01:39:15,644 --> 01:39:16,944
...from glasses...

1908
01:39:17,324 --> 01:39:19,236
...she never wore them out of the house...

1909
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:22,308
...so that everybody would think she was gorgeous!

1910
01:39:23,304 --> 01:39:27,440
But when she saw that kid killing
his father she was in the house!

1911
01:39:27,488 --> 01:39:28,588
Alone...!

1912
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,096
Do you wear your glasses when you go to bed?

1913
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:32,712
Noone wears eyeglasses to bed, noone...

1914
01:39:32,844 --> 01:39:35,744
Then it's logical to say that she
wasn't wearing hers in bed either.

1915
01:39:35,796 --> 01:39:38,174
-How do you know?
-I don't know, I'm just guessing.

1916
01:39:38,296 --> 01:39:43,140
And I'm also guessing that when she glanced out
the window, she didn't put her glasses on either.

1917
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:46,857
She herself said that she just looked
out the window, the murder took place

1918
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:49,237
and one split second later the lights went out.

1919
01:39:49,556 --> 01:39:51,492
She wouldn't have had time
to put her glasses on then...

1920
01:39:51,536 --> 01:39:52,636
Wait a second!

1921
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,836
And here's another guess.

1922
01:39:53,944 --> 01:39:57,556
Maybe the woman honestly thought
she saw the boy kill his father,

1923
01:39:57,808 --> 01:39:59,808
I say, she only saw a blur!

1924
01:39:59,852 --> 01:40:01,252
How do you know what she saw?

1925
01:40:01,312 --> 01:40:02,912
How does he know these things?

1926
01:40:03,452 --> 01:40:05,324
You don't know what kind of glasses she wore!

1927
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:09,385
Maybe she was farsighted, maybe they were
sunglasses... What do you know about it?

1928
01:40:09,428 --> 01:40:12,664
I only know that the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

1929
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:16,840
She had to identify a person 60 feet
away, in the dark, without glasses.

1930
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,756
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

1931
01:40:19,812 --> 01:40:20,612
Don't give me that!

1932
01:40:20,628 --> 01:40:23,168
You don't think it's possible that
the woman made a mistake?

1933
01:40:23,244 --> 01:40:23,944
No!

1934
01:40:24,104 --> 01:40:25,104
It's not possible...

1935
01:40:25,248 --> 01:40:26,448
No, it's not possible!

1936
01:40:27,872 --> 01:40:29,372
No 12, is it possible?

1937
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:33,836
Yes... it's possible...

1938
01:40:37,112 --> 01:40:38,312
...The kid's not guilty!

1939
01:40:39,632 --> 01:40:42,660
No 10, do you think he's guilty?

1940
01:40:45,024 --> 01:40:46,316
Yes, I think he's guilty...

1941
01:40:46,896 --> 01:40:48,096
...but I couldn't care less.

1942
01:40:48,164 --> 01:40:50,120
You smart bastards... you
do whatever you want!

1943
01:40:50,724 --> 01:40:51,724
How do you vote?

1944
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,444
I vote not guilty.

1945
01:40:55,932 --> 01:40:57,032
Do whatever you want...

1946
01:40:58,128 --> 01:40:59,728
You're the worst son of a...

1947
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,340
I think he's guilty!

1948
01:41:03,848 --> 01:41:05,924
Does anyone else think he's guilty?

1949
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,664
No, I'm... I'm convinced...

1950
01:41:13,428 --> 01:41:14,628
What's the matter with you?

1951
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,934
I now have... a reasonable doubt.

1952
01:41:20,572 --> 01:41:22,109
It's eleven to one!

1953
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:29,782
What about all the other evidence? The knife...
all that other stuff... the whole business!

1954
01:41:30,004 --> 01:41:32,104
You said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1955
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:34,376
You're alone.

1956
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,084
I don't care whether I'm alone or not...

1957
01:41:42,566 --> 01:41:45,244
-...it's my right!
-It is your right.

1958
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,100
What do you want?

1959
01:41:50,164 --> 01:41:51,364
I say he's guilty.

1960
01:41:52,156 --> 01:41:54,715
-We want to hear your arguments.
-I gave you my arguments.

1961
01:41:55,332 --> 01:41:58,080
But we're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.

1962
01:41:58,628 --> 01:42:00,228
We have as much time as it takes.

1963
01:42:06,212 --> 01:42:07,112
Everything...

1964
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:13,210
...every single thing that went on in that courtroom...
but I mean everything... says he's guilty.

1965
01:42:13,216 --> 01:42:15,232
What do you think I am, an idiot or something?

1966
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:17,988
You...

1967
01:42:18,764 --> 01:42:21,168
...lousy bunch of bleeding hearts!

1968
01:42:23,524 --> 01:42:25,124
Well, you're not going to intimidate me!

1969
01:42:27,204 --> 01:42:28,404
I am entitled...

1970
01:42:29,052 --> 01:42:30,668
...to my opinion!

1971
01:42:32,962 --> 01:42:36,648
I can sit in this god damn room for a year!

1972
01:42:42,584 --> 01:42:43,884
Somebody say something...

1973
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,680
Look...

1974
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,048
...why don't you take all that stuff about...

1975
01:42:50,616 --> 01:42:52,402
...the old man, the old man who lived there...

1976
01:42:53,312 --> 01:42:55,412
...who heard everything...

1977
01:42:55,984 --> 01:42:59,152
...or the knife...
What, just because he found one just like it?

1978
01:42:59,176 --> 01:43:00,544
The old man saw him!

1979
01:43:01,504 --> 01:43:02,504
On the stairs!

1980
01:43:02,572 --> 01:43:06,805
What difference does it make how many
seconds it took, what is the difference?

1981
01:43:08,884 --> 01:43:12,326
Every... single thing...

1982
01:43:15,852 --> 01:43:17,352
That knife...

1983
01:43:18,264 --> 01:43:20,925
...falling through a hole in his pocket!

1984
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,472
You can't prove he didn't get to the door!

1985
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:28,100
Sure, you can hobble around here
all you want, but you can't prove it.

1986
01:43:29,176 --> 01:43:30,176
I'm telling you...

1987
01:43:30,484 --> 01:43:36,224
...every single thing... has been
twisted and turned in here!

1988
01:43:38,764 --> 01:43:42,292
That business about the eyeglasses...
You don't know whether she wore glasses...

1989
01:43:42,304 --> 01:43:46,248
The woman testified, god d...! In court!

1990
01:43:48,284 --> 01:43:49,484
What do you want?

1991
01:43:49,548 --> 01:43:50,548
That's it!

1992
01:43:53,284 --> 01:43:55,184
This whole... case...

1993
01:44:01,384 --> 01:44:02,884
...the whole thing about the boy...

1994
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,880
...yelling out...

1995
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,632
...the phrase was...

1996
01:44:11,344 --> 01:44:15,074
..."I am going to kill you"...

1997
01:44:18,068 --> 01:44:20,876
...and he said it to his own father!

1998
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:23,920
I don't care...

1999
01:44:24,376 --> 01:44:26,204
...what kind of a man he was,

2000
01:44:26,332 --> 01:44:28,644
it was his father!

2001
01:44:29,568 --> 01:44:32,780
God damn rotten kid!

2002
01:44:34,856 --> 01:44:38,126
I know what it's like, I know what
they can do, I know how they can...

2003
01:44:38,616 --> 01:44:41,616
...kill you... every day!

2004
01:44:43,832 --> 01:44:45,132
My god...

2005
01:44:45,968 --> 01:44:47,468
...don't you see?

2006
01:44:50,812 --> 01:44:53,112
Why am I the only one who sees?

2007
01:44:56,344 --> 01:44:57,944
Jesus...

2008
01:45:00,072 --> 01:45:04,567
I can feel the knife going in...

2009
01:45:11,312 --> 01:45:12,912
He's not your boy...

2010
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,040
He's somebody else...

2011
01:45:25,244 --> 01:45:26,744
Let him live.

2012
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:32,792
Alright...

2013
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:38,772
Not guilty.

2014
01:46:10,252 --> 01:46:11,952
We've reached a verdict.

2015
01:46:12,036 --> 01:46:14,440
Ok jentlemen, take your
seats in the jurybox.

2016
01:47:37,596 --> 01:47:38,796
Excuse me...

2017
01:47:40,148 --> 01:47:41,448
My name's McCardle.

2018
01:47:42,024 --> 01:47:43,524
-What's yours?
-Davis.

2019
01:47:44,548 --> 01:47:45,448
Well...

2020
01:47:48,576 --> 01:47:49,776
So long...

2021
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,340
