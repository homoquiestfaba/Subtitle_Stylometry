1
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,963
- Girl, get inside.

2
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,022
- Stop starring Elijah.

3
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:08,923
- Why?

4
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:10,925
- Just dont, okay?

5
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,945
- All ridle and move.

6
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,019
- Move on.

7
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:02,943
- Home.

8
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,168
- When can we go in?

9
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,370
- When I say so. Now, stop.

10
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,139
Always complaining.

11
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,373
- I'm not!

12
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,908
- Just hot.

13
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,964
- Pa!

14
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,665
Pa!

15
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:05,865
Stay there!

16
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,207
- They're fresh.

17
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,245
- Did you see anyone?

18
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,984
Don't tell the others.

19
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,023
Clean this up.

20
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,475
- Wait!

21
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,912
- Hey! You better stop
playing before mas--

22
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,350
- Are we in trouble?

23
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,418
- No.

24
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,154
No ,you ain't.

25
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,389
But you gonna be if I catch you.

26
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,273
That's everything.

27
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,443
- Leave a set of clothes in
the cart for each
of you.

28
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,046
- But we just finished
unpacking.

29
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,281
- You heard me.

30
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:52,833
- Good night boys.

31
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,667
- Night.

32
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,568
- Night.

33
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,036
- Night, Lula.

34
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,973
Night, Mama

35
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,409
Good night, father.

36
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,287
- Five of us and no horse.

37
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,656
Phil's got to have 2 months
worth of just removing rock.

38
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,329
Still don't see why
we can't plant cotton.

39
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,301
- It's cause you know some
don't make you
slave to it.

40
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,341
- Tobacco?

41
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,547
- Watch strain backs.

42
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,453
Shred fingers and we
can stand tall.

43
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,023
No.

44
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,059
We're gonna stand on
the tips of
our toes

45
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,463
as we reach for our peaches.

46
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,333
- Peaches?

47
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,396
- Advect

48
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,264
It means no way to the rival.

49
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,233
- Will these grow if I stick
them in the ground?

50
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,502
- No.

51
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,637
- I wasn't asking you.

52
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,539
- He's right,

53
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,174
you need to see

54
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,245
- well, guess I'll just
show Mama where they're

55
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,180
growing when she gets here.

56
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,821
- Hey, we were reading that.

57
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,457
- They're so pretty.

58
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,027
- No they ain't. They
don't make any sense.

59
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,528
- They're art, they
don't need to.

60
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,096
- Then why did she draw
them in there?

61
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,132
- Because there's nowhere
else to draw.

62
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,071
- I wish I could draw
as good as her.

63
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,006
- Well you can't, now give it.

64
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:45,872
- No.

65
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,707
- Give it.

66
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,608
- Elisha!

67
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,485
- Damn it! You scared
my deer,
and I-

68
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,886
- It had already
heard your shot.

69
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,188
- What did you say?

70
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,757
- Look kid, hey now, he didn't
mean nothing
by it.

71
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,891
- What's going on here?

72
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,727
- Look no, wait. Look.

73
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,730
- Why don't you run up
and let the
man talk?

74
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,366
- Do not do this, alright?
Abe, apologize.

75
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,035
Apologize to the man.

76
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:14,868
- Go on.

77
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,070
- Let him go!

78
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,206
- Look, just, we can just
talk this out, okay?

79
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,742
As long as you just let him go,

80
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,112
I'll let y'all hunt
here anytime.

81
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:24,979
Ah!

82
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,587
Lula, just put the rock down.

83
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,623
These men are just here
to shoot their deer

84
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,330
Put the rock down.

85
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,500
Go on.

86
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,879
- Next time a dirty hand
disrespects your family,

87
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,314
you don't hesitate.
Do you hear me?

88
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,085
And as for all you, I bet they
ain't even telling you

89
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,055
why they generously this
here piece of paradise.

90
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,222
- It doesn't matter.
It's ours now.

91
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,524
- For now.

92
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,468
- What he mean they ain't
telling us everything?

93
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,732
- Where'd you come from?

94
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,605
Here.

95
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,342
You sit on this and watch me.

96
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,677
I will teach you how
to make a bed.

97
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,691
Somebody up here?

98
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,650
- What's taking you so long?

99
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,822
Henny, what did you do?

100
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,062
-I don't know.

101
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:03,264
I don't know.

102
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,698
- I was standing right outside
and nothing came
in or out.

103
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,268
- What's going on in here?

104
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,903
- There was someone in the
bed.

105
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,971
It tried to get me.

106
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,242
They were just...

107
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,842
- Stop all this playing.

108
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,677
- I ain't lying, Lula saw it.

109
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,248
- Is this true?

110
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,051
- No.

111
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,653
- Lula, why are you saying...

112
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,622
- Beds will be made
before dinner.

113
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,001
- What?

114
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,403
- Why did you say that?

115
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,039
- He wouldn't have believed
us anyway.

116
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:16,904
- Why are we hiding?

117
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,438
- Hello!

118
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:21,142
- We're not, now be quiet.

119
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,845
- Then I'm gonna see what
business they want.

120
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,621
- Stay here.

121
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:42,930
- Stay here.

122
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,134
- Stay here.

123
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:59,046
- For a while, we only thought
we'd imagined hearing voices.

124
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,117
I'm Tyron O'collen.

125
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,986
This here is Fionagle or

126
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:07,687
Fiona for short.

127
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:10,124
We were just heading into town.
We figured we could
stop by.

128
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:24,537
Well, it's not much but
a bit of a welcome.

129
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,107
- Looks good.

130
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,250
- That's near an infection.

131
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,019
Here.

132
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,231
It's- whoa, hey.

133
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,502
Easy.

134
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,805
It's good. It'll help.

135
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:18,259
Right.

136
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:19,759
Well,

137
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,796
we won't be a bother to
you folks
no more.

138
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,566
Right.

139
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:29,270
We found this on a path and
nearly and run
it over,

140
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,905
I assumed it's yours?

141
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,148
Are you all able to read
that? I though that

142
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,749
it was illegal for a...

143
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,656
- Old man's eyes and word.

144
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,159
House hands had to learn.

145
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,429
- Mother always said the
path of salvation,

146
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,331
was found in those pages.

147
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,335
- I fancy myself more of
a man of science but

148
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,105
I do enjoy a good fiction.

149
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,676
In fact,

150
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,747
I was user lead

151
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,451
to teach Fiona English.

152
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,386
Might have been a little
too ambitious.

153
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,989
Do you ever read any Turo
Dickerson, Powell?

154
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,925
- We were only allowed
the Good Book.

155
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,796
- Times certainly have
changed but...

156
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,638
- Just so you know,

157
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,708
we don't need your handouts.

158
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,148
- I'll tell you what
,

159
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,782
when you're through with them,

160
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,552
You can give them back to me.

161
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,087
Consider it a loan.

162
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,595
Right. Well, that's it for us.

163
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,130
If you need anything,

164
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:05,732
we live just across the field.

165
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,704
- Master always said
it was his right
to shoot

166
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:45,940
any man on his land.

167
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,443
-We count on them,

168
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,913
we gonna have more problems
than just this stubborn field.

169
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,456
- You know the difference
between

170
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,191
a farm and a slave?

171
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,360
- No sir.

172
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:13,766
-One treats his land-- his seed,

173
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:16,736
his tools with respect

174
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,241
cause he knows it's the only
thing keeping
him alive.

175
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,877
The other one just a tool.

176
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,298
- You're not eating your bread.

177
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:54,241
- What's that for?

178
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,110
- Keeps the others out.

179
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,512
- Sure it's not to keep us in?

180
00:22:58,746 --> 00:22:59,713
- Lula, don't say that.

181
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,781
- No. He needs to accept
that we are free

182
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,084
and stop putting us
in a new cage.

183
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,291
- You speak like a goddamn
child about things
you don't

184
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:11,891
know nothing about.

185
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,062
- You're just scared.

186
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,032
Her biggest mistake
was trusting you.

187
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,933
Maybe she'd be the one standing
here if she hadn't

188
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,035
listened to you.

189
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:24,405
- Stop staring.

190
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:50,897
- Eat your food.

191
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,119
- What are you doing out there?

192
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,122
Abe...

193
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,491
Abe, come on.

194
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,393
Let's go to bed.

195
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,528
Come on.

196
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,096
Let's go.

197
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,464
- He's been like that
for a while.

198
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,235
- Why are you awake?

199
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,104
- What are you wearing?

200
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:23,143
- Abe, let's just go lie down.

201
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,345
- He won't move.

202
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:27,247
- Come on, don't wake father.

203
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:29,483
Abe...

204
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,006
- Henrietta, would
you like some tea?

205
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:53,975
Sure you do.

206
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,409
One for you

207
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,879
and one for me.

208
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,315
Here, remember, pinky's
up always.

209
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,250
You have to have your pinky up

210
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,585
when we drink tea.

211
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:05,485
Very classy.

212
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:07,788
- He wasn't upstairs?

213
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,357
- No.

214
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,893
And be careful with that,
besides both of you
are supposed

215
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:14,161
to be reading.

216
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,198
- Don't listen to her.

217
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:20,935
She thinks she's everyone Mama
but really,
she's just

218
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,169
your annoying auntie.

219
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:23,770
- Which still makes me
your older sister.

220
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:25,405
So start reading.

221
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,308
Abe, you out there?

222
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,846
- Reading is stupid. This
place is stupid.

223
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:34,615
I wish we could just
go back home.

224
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:36,918
- Never call it that.

225
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,719
- You said you hate it here.

226
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,288
- N.othing in this house can do
will ever make it
as bad as that

227
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,189
hell

228
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,635
Abe!

229
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,236
Where have you gone?

230
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,605
- Lula

231
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:03,477
- What's wrong with him?

232
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:07,147
- Abe?

233
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:17,824
- Come on.

234
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,493
He's inside.

235
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:25,632
- Warm water.

236
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,267
Not too hot.

237
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:28,970
Abe, can you hear me?

238
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,938
- We need a doctor, not a baker.

239
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:31,872
- I am a doctor

240
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,043
or was studying to be one.

241
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,044
- Why'd you stop?

242
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,146
-Well, around here,

243
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,914
no one wants a visit
from an old colon.

244
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,049
Doctor or not.

245
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:43,084
- Do you know what's
wrong with him?

246
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,785
- Abe, can you hear me?

247
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,324
Where did you say you found him?

248
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,395
- Abe...

249
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:56,263
- Are you okay?

250
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,397
- Where were you?

251
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:04,771
- Why isn't he moving?

252
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,408
- Abe...

253
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,511
Abe...

254
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:15,950
If you're in there, hang on.

255
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,594
It's Lula,

256
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:29,229
right?

257
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:32,399
Keep first to feed him,

258
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,135
keep him strong

259
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,237
and make sure it's small enough
so that he doesn't choke,

260
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:38,739
you got that?

261
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,640
In the mean time, I'll
head to town,

262
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,609
see if I'll get some medicine.

263
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:44,578
- We can't pay you
for this visit,

264
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:46,480
nor that medicine.

265
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,650
I wasn't asking.

266
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:53,787
- He gonna get better,

267
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,456
and his crops gonna grow.

268
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:02,763
People say it's a land
and it ain't right.

269
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:05,665
- There are

270
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,334
rumors, sure,

271
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,237
but that's not what's
happening here.

272
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,671
I went to school with a man
who studies Earth
and soil,

273
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,408
I'm sure he could be of some
help if he knows
it's for me.

274
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:21,149
- Your attention is required
for an officer
of these

275
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,282
United States.

276
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,019
- All lands

277
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:27,287
declared

278
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,057
on the 7th fifteenth

279
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:32,859
shall enter

280
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,594
into profit sharing.

281
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,396
- The bureau decreed this?

282
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,665
- Decreed or not,

283
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,068
you all received these
lands from the victims

284
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:42,236
and those under grace.

285
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:45,438
- Victims? How can you
call them that?

286
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:46,640
- Do not

287
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,176
interrupt

288
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,409
an officer

289
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,913
of the United States.

290
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,048
- Take it easy, lieutenant.

291
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,150
Unless you got color blind

292
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,919
you're wearing blue now.

293
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,087
As I was saying,

294
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,091
this land here hasn't been
tilled for going
on 3 years.

295
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,394
As such, you've been
granted an extension

296
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,197
of one month.

297
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:10,897
- And when is that?

298
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:12,934
- 6 months from yesterday.

299
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,769
- But we just got
here 2 weeks ago.

300
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,538
- And what will your harvest be?

301
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:19,840
- Peaches.

302
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,108
- In 6 months?

303
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:24,878
- Cotton.

304
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:32,452
We gonna grow cotton.

305
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,556
- What did I tell you?

306
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,657
I told you

307
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,721
- They'll die before
they even sprout.

308
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:54,901
- Sour.

309
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:57,604
- Abe, hand me that spoon.

310
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:02,742
Hey, hand me the spoon.

311
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:05,012
- Henny

312
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:06,180
Hello?

313
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,815
I'm talking to you.

314
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:11,818
What's wrong?

315
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:13,321
- I lost Henrietta.

316
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,221
- Who?

317
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,222
- It's my doll.

318
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,092
- Ain't you too old
to have a doll?

319
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,327
- She was my friend.

320
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,727
- What about me?

321
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,730
- You're my sister.

322
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,666
- Now, sisters can't be friends?

323
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,135
- Were you Mama's friend?

324
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:31,671
- No.

325
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:32,739
I mean,

326
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,842
she was our Mama.

327
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:38,678
- See?

328
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,282
Guess I'll never know if Mom
and I could be friends.

329
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:47,221
- So you're saying

330
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,656
you know she's gone?

331
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,693
- I'm just scared

332
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,832
that Abe is gone too.

333
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,502
- We're gonna get
him through this.

334
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:04,271
Okay?

335
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:06,740
By taking care of us first.

336
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:08,675
You understand?

337
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,279
- Where's my son?

338
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:15,282
Where are you hiding him?

339
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,917
Where's my son?

340
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:19,920
- Stop! You're hurting him.

341
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,222
- Where's my son?

342
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,292
What's happening here?

343
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,006
Abe,

344
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:40,975
I'm sorry.

345
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,444
- Go on.

346
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:44,744
- It looks like our old house.

347
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,181
Tyron.

348
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:48,916
Tyron.

349
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,353
- Yeah.

350
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:53,686
Could be a reaction to

351
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:56,723
poison ivy or poison oak.

352
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,026
I have something for him.

353
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,628
You just...

354
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,031
You grind it up

355
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,067
and deliver it with water.

356
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,035
Start off by

357
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:09,136
giving him half of it

358
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,272
cause you'd open half
each day for
5 days.

359
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,540
I know it's complicated,

360
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,041
I wish there were an easier way.

361
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:16,343
- You can measure it with a
string and divide
each day.

362
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:17,744
- Hmm...

363
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:18,979
Yeah. I think--

364
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:22,049
I think you might be smarter
than me.

365
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:23,883
That would work.

366
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,020
- He's always figuring
things like
that out.

367
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:28,055
- We all have our gifts and

368
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,722
yours is currently for caring.

369
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,093
- Henrietta!

370
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,294
There you are.

371
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,731
- What is that doing here?

372
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,036
- Those are Fiona's things

373
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,105
- Thanks so much
for finding her.

374
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,978
- Why
don't you
two go?

375
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,414
- Okay.

376
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:56,716
- And don't go further
than I can see.

377
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,818
- Come on Elisha, let's go.

378
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:05,825
- Lula said not to run off.

379
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,129
- Come on, don't be a baby.

380
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,163
Let's go explore.

381
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:16,937
- Why don't she speak English?

382
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:18,671
Your sister?

383
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:19,974
- Well,

384
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:21,976
where I come from,

385
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:23,611
that's how everyone speaks.

386
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,381
There are, of course, those
who are trying
to erase it.

387
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,383
- Is that why you came here?

388
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,388
-That and an empty stomach.

389
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:40,027
What's up?

390
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,997
That necklace you keep
playing with.

391
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,433
- I found it

392
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:48,269
along with a journal.

393
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:49,170
- Journal?

394
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,406
What did it say?

395
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,942
- I can only read a few pages.

396
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:57,578
Did you know her?

397
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,746
The woman that lived
in my house?

398
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:05,019
- Well, the war begun shortly
after we arrived

399
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:06,187
and

400
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,290
we never really shared
the same views.

401
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:18,532
- Come on, we should go.

402
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,366
- What? No.

403
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:25,105
- People thinks she
cursed our land.

404
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:28,609
- You know, I've heard what
other people think
my whole life.

405
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:31,878
If we spent half the
resources wasted on

406
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,316
silly superstitions on
Science, we couldn't.

407
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:37,817
Who knows?

408
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,019
Send a man

409
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:40,154
to the moon

410
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,356
- Now who's being silly?

411
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,903
- Henny, Elisha,
it's time to go.

412
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,944
How far your land go?

413
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:05,913
- Well you're looking at it.

414
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:09,149
Your land actually surrounds
us on 3 sides

415
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,485
and then, the first
and the other.

416
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:15,022
- At least they can't take
it away from you.

417
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:16,657
Your friend,

418
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,858
the one that knows
about the soil...

419
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,395
- I could ask but

420
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,796
it's complicated.

421
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,766
- What did I tell you two?

422
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,269
- Sorry.

423
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,105
- Thanks Tyron,

424
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:32,872
for everything.

425
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:38,646
- You awake?

426
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,247
- That was you.

427
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,816
- Elisha, you awake?

428
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:45,852
- I'm awake.

429
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:47,787
- So why ain't anyone sleeping?

430
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:49,556
- Because you keep talking.

431
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,132
- I don't like closing my eyes.

432
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,101
- Yeah. I need to go to sleep.

433
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:03,270
- Well whenever I sleep,

434
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:04,871
I start hear her.

435
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:09,443
- Who?

436
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:12,112
- I don't like her either.

437
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:15,916
- You both heard her?

438
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,044
- Why didn't anyone wake me?

439
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,049
What you gonna do with those?

440
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,957
- We need more seed,

441
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,926
not dresses.

442
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,277
- They're here.

443
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,248
- You should have asked
the previous owner

444
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,450
about the land before buying.

445
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,388
- Well, people lie, you know?

446
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:31,959
- So what about it? Can
you fix the land?

447
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:36,363
- Result like this wouldn't
make sense being contained

448
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,165
to just the top soil.

449
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:40,868
- Are we hiding again?

450
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,370
- Tyron says it has
to be his land

451
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:44,838
or his friend won't help us.

452
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:48,175
- Father's gonna be so mad
you gave away
our farm.

453
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:03,490
- Abe, do you know what's
wrong with it?

454
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,396
I promise to stop kicking you
in my sleep if you
come back.

455
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,398
You can even have the
whole blanket.

456
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:13,167
I don't need it.

457
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,340
And Henny found her doll

458
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,409
It was...

459
00:42:38,826 --> 00:42:40,127
Abe, what are you-

460
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,539
- Elijah, time to get
ready for bed.

461
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,274
- Abe, come on, come on.

462
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,588
- I ain't even tired.

463
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,356
- And I wasn't asking.

464
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:10,858
- Elijah!

465
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,460
- Can we just stay up until
father gets back?

466
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,394
- No.

467
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,231
But the man really
gonna help us?

468
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:18,532
- I don't know.

469
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:20,167
I don't want either of
you two going
near him

470
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,269
if he does, understood?

471
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:23,637
Elijah, enough.

472
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,141
- Where is it?

473
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,143
- What?

474
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:31,345
- Mama's Bible.

475
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:34,047
- Oh, you're in trouble?

476
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,649
- But I wanted to show
you something.

477
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,784
- Bed, now. Come on.

478
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,191
- Can you sing to us?

479
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:45,526
- I don't sing.

480
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,127
- Well you used to

481
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:48,462
with Mama.

482
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,366
- Only if you sing with me.

483
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:21,930
- Tyron.

484
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:23,932
- Under the bed, now.

485
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,132
- But you just said-

486
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:26,833
- Now! Help me with Abe.

487
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:38,812
Go, go, go, go.

488
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,318
- Couldn't fill the
first but look.

489
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:48,622
- You're right.

490
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,091
Devil gone and kiss this land.

491
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,394
You got any of your
sister's bread?

492
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,271
- Doctor's not here.

493
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,042
- Who the hell are you?

494
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:08,910
- He'll be back in a few hours.

495
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:10,811
- That doesn't answer
my question.

496
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:13,814
Now I'll ask you again,
who are you?

497
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:17,718
- A friend Tyron's. We
just passing through.

498
00:45:19,252 --> 00:45:22,255
- Friend? Are you getting
cute with me?

499
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:27,894
Maybe I'll just stay, wait
so the doctor
comes back

500
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:31,665
and have a little conversation
with about the company

501
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:32,633
he's been keeping.

502
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:41,174
What's wrong with him?

503
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,012
- We don't know, that's why
we brought
him her.e

504
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,512
Tyron's gonna fix him.

505
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,181
- So it don't like there's
much to fix.

506
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:55,622
Since this is my friend's
house, why don't you
wait outside?

507
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:58,558
- Why don't we both?

508
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:00,193
- You're asking me to wait
outside like
a dog?

509
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:03,031
Where's Fiona? I'm hungry.

510
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,498
- She's with Tyron.

511
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,936
- I thought I told you
to wait outside

512
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,104
and take the lame one.

513
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:13,074
This here is not your home.

514
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:14,174
- You're wrong.

515
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:20,148
- Henny, stay in your
room, please.

516
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:22,749
Let me find Tyron and he
can explain everything.

517
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:26,653
- Find? If you get a man,
it'd be on his
own house.

518
00:46:26,753 --> 00:46:28,388
- He doesn't live here.

519
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,724
- Where are you going?

520
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:35,562
- I just wanted to

521
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,265
tell you I believe you.

522
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:43,171
A good doctor felt sorry and
gave you this
hair broken

523
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,838
land to share crop.

524
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:46,606
- We ain't no share croppers.

525
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,943
- Any more of you?

526
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,980
So you're saying this
is your land?

527
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:55,515
- It's more ours
than any other.s

528
00:46:56,283 --> 00:47:00,220
- You know, a lot of
my friends died

529
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:03,724
because of you, and
you, and you.

530
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,161
Now, the government's just
giving your their
land before

531
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:08,528
they're even cold.

532
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,565
- Tyron was just trynna
help us fix
our land.

533
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:16,670
- Your friend is always
preaching. If I
could just see

534
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:21,808
beyond that bark skin get those
stuff on the inside,
I'd see.

535
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:23,710
We're all the same.

536
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:28,448
What do you say? Should we test
the good doctor's
theory out

537
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,017
on this low one?

538
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:35,322
- We asked you nicely to leave.

539
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:38,025
- What are you gonna
do with that?

540
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,393
- Maybe cut you open?

541
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:44,297
Prove we ain't nothing alike.

542
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,833
You're just a gutless pig.

543
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,405
Run outside. Find Tyron.

544
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:01,916
- Now come on out.

545
00:48:33,948 --> 00:48:34,781
- Abe,

546
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:38,685
Abe...

547
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:44,825
- Where are you?

548
00:48:48,562 --> 00:48:49,596
- How did you do that?

549
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:50,897
- Come on out.

550
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:05,846
Enough games. I'm serious.

551
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:35,442
- Wait no, Elijah, wait. Where
are you going? Stop!

552
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:45,353
- You can keep this cursed plot.

553
00:49:45,418 --> 00:49:46,187
- Elijah.

554
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:47,121
- It's stuck.

555
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:32,792
- This place is cursed.

556
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:46,740
- What are you doing?

557
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:47,975
Hey!

558
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:49,410
- What else do we have to loose
for you to understand

559
00:51:49,477 --> 00:51:51,112
this place ain't right?

560
00:51:51,544 --> 00:51:55,149
- You don't think there's
greater evils outside
these fences?

561
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:56,384
- Mother feared nothing,

562
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:58,551
maybe that's the real reason
she left you!

563
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:10,630
- She had fears.

564
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,036
Her biggest one was loosing you.

565
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:26,613
- Then there's nothing
left to fight over.

566
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:32,019
- Why you be wearing that?

567
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:35,855
- You're right.

568
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:38,926
She'll just come for this too.

569
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:42,096
We don't belong here.

570
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:55,176
- This all they gave you?

571
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,178
For all those dresses?

572
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,449
- They said they were stolen.

573
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:04,185
- Well, that's a lie
and they know it.

574
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:22,503
He said it was kissed
by the devil.

575
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,905
- Devil ain't never
kissed nothing.

576
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,348
- Where are you--

577
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:37,017
Lula.

578
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,387
I can't do this without you.

579
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:43,090
His forty acres are his prison.

580
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:44,992
Not mine.

581
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,398
- What I'm I doing?

582
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,952
Tyron! Fiona! Tyron!

583
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:13,554
- Lula.

584
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,089
- Tyron!

585
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:16,856
- Oh, you're hurt.

586
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:22,762
Look at this mess.

587
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,276
Where's Fiona?

588
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:37,710
- I haven't seen her in days.

589
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,414
- You need a doctor.

590
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:41,781
- I am a doctor.

591
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:49,889
- Malachi thinks
I own your land.

592
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,695
What if anyone else knows
you live here?

593
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,300
Your family could be
in danger tonight.

594
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:03,904
Lula,

595
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:10,377
there's something else,
isn't there?

596
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,746
- Elijah,

597
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:17,817
he's dead

598
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:21,121
- How?

599
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:25,192
- Your friend, he came back.

600
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:30,965
- I'll kill the man.

601
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:31,599
- No.

602
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:32,732
- I'll kill him.

603
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,068
- Calm down, calm down.

604
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:37,404
- I'm sorry.

605
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,808
We need to contact the
authorities.

606
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:47,248
- So they can do more
or the same? No.

607
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,389
I'll figure it out on my own.

608
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:07,167
- She's still not back?

609
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:13,440
- Henny, you need to
get some sleep.

610
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:19,179
- Not without her.

611
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,256
rying

612
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:36,964
- Do you really think--

613
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,065
- Can you read it?

614
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,003
- Yeah.

615
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:49,243
It's just... There's something
about it.
A secret?

616
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:51,878
She was the first to keep

617
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:54,148
even from her husband and...

618
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:05,559
And then he found out and
he laid hands
on her.

619
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:11,532
And he just... He kept
laying hands
on her.

620
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:16,437
- What was the secret?

621
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:19,406
- It doesn't say.
It just says that

622
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:24,945
when the war begun, I prayed
for it to take
my husband.

623
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:26,046
And it did.

624
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:33,120
But that's not all,
it also took my

625
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:36,390
little girl.

626
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:48,068
What?

627
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,240
- Is that all it says?
It says more?

628
00:57:57,578 --> 00:57:58,412
- Lula!

629
00:58:01,548 --> 00:58:02,383
Lula!

630
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:07,287
Lula!

631
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:25,072
- Hey, not now. We're
keeping an
eye out.

632
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,387
Abe, stop.

633
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:00,407
Come on Abe, please.

634
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:26,333
- He's just scared
of loosing you.

635
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,368
- We lost each other years ago.

636
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:30,204
- Lula...

637
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:38,345
If you're not gonna leave my
side, at least let
me escort you

638
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:39,446
home.

639
00:59:40,314 --> 00:59:42,483
We need to make sure
your family
is okay.

640
00:59:57,297 --> 00:59:59,900
- Here, Henrietta
will protect you.

641
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:03,470
Now, stay put until
father gets back.

642
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,609
And if Henrietta starts to--

643
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,544
Abe?

644
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,348
Abe!

645
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,485
Abe, this is no time for games.

646
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:22,789
Abe!

647
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:24,191
Abe?

648
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:51,318
- Henny? Father?

649
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:54,454
- Perhaps they're out
looking for you.

650
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,155
- Tyron?

651
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,158
- What is it?

652
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,228
- I don't know.

653
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,500
- It makes no sense.

654
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:41,568
- It's a puzzle.

655
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:45,372
- You might be smarter than me.

656
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:47,808
- He's always figuring
things like
that out.

657
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:51,445
- He figured it out.

658
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:58,719
- What does it mean?

659
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:04,358
- It's a map.

660
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:07,427
This was my mother's.

661
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:12,633
- That was your mother's--

662
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:13,767
- She left years ago.

663
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:16,703
She must have passed
through here before.

664
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,440
- How on Earth would your
mother pass through this--

665
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:24,444
- Father said, if she ever left
again to never
come back

666
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:26,213
and she never did.

667
01:02:28,983 --> 01:02:31,218
-No, I don't understand
Lula. Lula...

668
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:33,487
- She's gonna be so
happy to see me.

669
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:36,356
- Lula, Lula wait.

670
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,895
- That's it.

671
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:49,302
- Lula!

672
01:02:50,138 --> 01:02:51,638
Lula!

673
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,183
- I don't see how any of this
is gonna bring back
your mother.

674
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:07,654
- She marked this well
on this land for
a reason.

675
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:10,824
If there's anything down there,
a clue or another map

676
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:12,359
to where she went after this,

677
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,861
I have to see for myself.

678
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:00,942
Wait, stop here.

679
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:53,553
I can't move.

680
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:58,092
- Everyone inside,.

681
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:00,360
- Fiona?

682
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:02,562
- We can't climb in these.

683
01:06:03,931 --> 01:06:04,764
- Mama.

684
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:05,933
-You have to hide them.

685
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:09,003
- The map, where is it?

686
01:06:10,503 --> 01:06:11,571
- Safe hands.

687
01:06:13,341 --> 01:06:14,976
- No Mama, you can't trust her.

688
01:06:17,677 --> 01:06:19,446
- Everyone, take my hand.

689
01:06:32,193 --> 01:06:33,261
- Tyron, thank God.

690
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,730
- What are you doing
here? Give
me that.

691
01:06:38,366 --> 01:06:39,399
- I don't understand.

692
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:45,973
- This her?

693
01:06:48,376 --> 01:06:49,442
- No.

694
01:06:51,212 --> 01:06:55,182
No. she's the help.
It's not her.

695
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:00,988
It's nothing.

696
01:07:02,323 --> 01:07:05,558
- It is shit like that when
no one likes
your kind.

697
01:07:08,996 --> 01:07:09,829
- Evening, lieutenant.

698
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:11,299
- Evening.

699
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,034
- Tyron, if you've finished
cleaning the burner
and feeding the

700
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,236
hogs, I'll need your help with
the uniforms for
these fine

701
01:07:15,303 --> 01:07:16,337
fellas.

702
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:19,173
-Oh no, no. We ain't
here for uniforms

703
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:27,781
- Do you want some coffee
or tea then?

704
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:31,651
- Okay.

705
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:35,755
- Where are they?

706
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:40,227
- I don't know who you mean.

707
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:41,895
- They know the truth.

708
01:08:03,616 --> 01:08:04,684
- Check it.

709
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,928
- Nothing.

710
01:08:14,828 --> 01:08:19,033
- Told you there's nothing
there, alright?

711
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:22,669
See?

712
01:08:26,606 --> 01:08:27,674
- Check again.

713
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:29,110
- Tyron.

714
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,456
- These people are my slaves.

715
01:08:42,522 --> 01:08:43,690
- Uh-huh...

716
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,859
- These are my slaves. You
can't take my slaves.

717
01:08:45,926 --> 01:08:47,694
- I'm disappointed in you.

718
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:52,266
Hey, hey alright,
find the others.

719
01:09:02,243 --> 01:09:04,711
- This wasn't part of the
agreement. I gave
you the station,

720
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:06,780
you gave me the land. You never
said anything about killing

721
01:09:06,846 --> 01:09:07,680
anyone.

722
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:10,184
- Yeah, well this is
war and people die.

723
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,852
- He would never have
told you it's
a lie.

724
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,356
They're not runaways,
they're my slaves.

725
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,258
These people are my property!

726
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,459
Tyron!

727
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:20,995
- And here I thought Tyron
was your field bitch.

728
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:23,763
- Be strong, our story
is long ago.

729
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:32,639
- I'm gonna cut you a deal,
alright? You cut
the rope

730
01:09:32,705 --> 01:09:34,674
of your master

731
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:38,812
and I'll set you free.

732
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:51,392
-You confuse freedom with being
free, I will never
cut that rope

733
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:52,326
- Very well.

734
01:09:53,094 --> 01:09:53,928
Tyron,

735
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:01,202
Tyron,

736
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:20,988
go on.

737
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:35,835
- No!

738
01:10:48,282 --> 01:10:49,116
No!

739
01:11:02,363 --> 01:11:04,831
- Take my hand.

740
01:11:09,869 --> 01:11:11,738
- This was a new shirt.

741
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:19,280
I will require your
services after all.

742
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,823
- I don't know how far
she could have gone.

743
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:31,992
- And you just let her go?

744
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:33,427
- You know how stubborn
she can be.

745
01:11:33,494 --> 01:11:36,163
- What the hell is wrong with
you?

746
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:38,898
- Lula!

747
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:34,388
- I'm ready.

748
01:12:58,746 --> 01:12:59,812
- I was worried sick.

749
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:02,116
- Where's father?

750
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:05,852
- He's with the children.

751
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:10,024
- I need to see them.
Just help
me out.

752
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,572
- I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

753
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:29,576
Did you find anything
interesting down there?

754
01:13:30,778 --> 01:13:32,012
- Tyron, what are you doing?

755
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:33,681
- It's just I'm no
fool all times.

756
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:34,982
You see anything?

757
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:38,052
- I told you I didn't
see anything.

758
01:13:38,118 --> 01:13:39,420
- You saw her, didn't you?

759
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:51,898
- Please? Just let me out.

760
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:56,036
- I swore I had seen
your eyes before

761
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,938
but how is that possible?

762
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:01,675
- Please just listen to me.

763
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:05,779
- Of all the farms in the
world, they had to
give you mine.

764
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:13,487
- Tyron, you can make this
right. Together, we
can fix this land

765
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,455
- Cursed?

766
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:17,558
Isn't that how you described it?

767
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:26,333
- I'm coming.

768
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:37,877
-I'm sorry Lula, but human
beings are simply to
selfish to share

769
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,016
- Help! Help! Help!

770
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:53,527
- But it's not any easier if I-

771
01:14:59,466 --> 01:15:01,468
- I'm so sorry.

772
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:04,037
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

773
01:15:05,038 --> 01:15:06,106
- I'm so sorry.

774
01:15:06,974 --> 01:15:07,808
- It's okay.

775
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:10,411
I know everything
is gonna be okay.

776
01:15:12,446 --> 01:15:13,280
It's gonna be okay.

777
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:16,283
- Mother, Tyron betrayed her.

778
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:19,653
- I know.

779
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:53,086
- Abe! Down here.

780
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,022
- I never should have left him.

781
01:15:55,924 --> 01:15:57,591
He took the children.
He took them.

782
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:59,493
- No! No, they're hiding.

783
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:08,669
- Where are they?

784
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:13,574
- Henny?

785
01:16:20,447 --> 01:16:21,648
In here.

786
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:25,085
This whole farm was mama's
station before she
was betrayed.

787
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,721
She never stopped hiding.

788
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:45,739
- Lula, get back.

789
01:16:57,217 --> 01:16:59,419
- She had to keep her promise

790
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:04,725
to always come home, trust me.

791
01:17:24,012 --> 01:17:25,345
Why hasn't she taken me?

792
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:29,249
I need her. I always needed her.

793
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:37,324
- No, no, no

794
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,393
You're strong.

795
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:43,965
I trust you, you're strong
enough to help keep

796
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:45,766
this family together.

797
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,369
Even when no one else could.

798
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:55,309
Every time I look at you, I see
the future in
your eyes.

799
01:17:56,978 --> 01:17:58,478
Your mother saw it too.

800
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:05,686
And now, it's your
Mom who needs you.

801
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:18,799
Go on, I trust you.

802
01:18:21,602 --> 01:18:22,436
I trust you.

803
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:49,496
- Quickly, they're
coming for us.

804
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:52,599
- Henny? Abe?

805
01:19:00,507 --> 01:19:03,077
- Don't make a sound. I
have to get the others.

806
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:04,645
- No, we have to stop.

807
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:08,448
- We leave at night, the next
station is a.

808
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:10,884
- No, you have to stop.

809
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:12,853
- What are you--

810
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:29,803
How did you get this?

811
01:19:30,138 --> 01:19:33,240
- Mama, don't you see? It's me.

812
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:39,780
- Lula!

813
01:19:43,051 --> 01:19:44,785
You've grown so much.

814
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:48,855
But how? I've only been
gone one week.

815
01:19:49,423 --> 01:19:51,725
- You've been gone a long time.

816
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:55,629
- Where am I?

817
01:19:55,896 --> 01:19:56,730
- Home.

818
01:19:58,365 --> 01:19:59,399
You kept your promise.

819
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:12,646
Mama,

820
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,084
where's Henny?

821
01:20:16,349 --> 01:20:18,285
- They
are coming
for us.

822
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,554
- No, they're not.

823
01:20:20,687 --> 01:20:22,689
And if we're gonna survive
this, we have to
have all
of us.

824
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:25,759
You need to return Abe and
tell me where
Henny is.

825
01:20:25,892 --> 01:20:27,594
Just take
my hand.

826
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:31,431
- No, Mama it's time to let go.

827
01:20:55,288 --> 01:20:56,323
- So strong.

828
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:01,294
So beautiful.

829
01:21:03,064 --> 01:21:09,803
You promise, take their
hand whenever
they need.

830
01:21:12,974 --> 01:21:15,308
Be kind to your father.

831
01:21:30,024 --> 01:21:32,859
You are right, no more hiding.

832
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:04,758
- Father!

833
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:07,460
I'm in here.

834
01:22:17,305 --> 01:22:18,139
Father!

835
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,307
- Lula?

836
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:24,778
- Henny? Henny, you're
okay. I found you.

837
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:26,948
- You're okay.

838
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,684
I wanna go home.

839
01:22:32,153 --> 01:22:33,553
- Do you know where we are?

840
01:22:42,063 --> 01:22:48,735
- Father! Father! Where are you?

841
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,004
- Help!

842
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:56,077
- Lula!

843
01:23:13,894 --> 01:23:17,164
- Henny, I'm not gonna let
anything happen
to you.

844
01:23:22,569 --> 01:23:24,906
- Help me. Help me move that.

845
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,484
We can do this.

846
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:43,790
Go, go, go.

847
01:24:00,141 --> 01:24:01,441
- Everything's okay.

848
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:02,642
- See father?

849
01:24:03,144 --> 01:24:04,011
- We got this.

850
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:07,514
- What ya'll doing?
We need to work.

851
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:10,217
- Abe...

852
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:11,919
- Abe, you're back.

853
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:44,751
- They'll take care of
each other over there.

854
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:52,892
- You must live on your
own, are you?

855
01:24:58,232 --> 01:24:59,733
- We picked our last name.

856
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,105
- And what is it?

857
01:25:04,604 --> 01:25:05,672
- Henny Mothers.

858
01:25:06,374 --> 01:25:07,241
- Abraham Mothers.

859
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:08,976
- Lula Mothers.

860
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:12,113
- We're gonna grown peanuts
'till our peaches mature.

861
01:25:17,318 --> 01:25:22,589
- Well incase you ain't heard,
your president
has been shot

862
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:50,384
- By decree of--

863
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:52,019
- It don't matter.

864
01:25:54,854 --> 01:25:59,360
Nothing this letter says can
ever take away what
we've done.
