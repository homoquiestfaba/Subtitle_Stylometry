00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,620
"Come, ye children,
listen to me.

2
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:18,358
I will teach you
the fear of the LORD."

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,028
Psalm 34:11

4
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:26,007
When I was a little girl,
my mother would remind me

5
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:28,881
each night before bed to
open up my heart to God,

6
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:32,246
for he was kind,
merciful and just.

7
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,698
Things changed when my
father left a few years later,

8
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:38,083
leaving her to raise me
and my brothers in a place

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,420
on the edge of the
Mojave Desert.

10
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,174
She never talked of a
kind, merciful God again.

11
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,163
Instead she spoke
of a prophecy.

12
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,513
Of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness

13
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:52,791
and the fate of Mankind
would be decided.

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,167
One night I finally got up
the courage to ask my mother

15
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:01,029
why God had changed, why
he was so mad at his children.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,620
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me,

17
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,744
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."

18
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,653
"Legion"

Lost Angeles, December 23rd
1:02 AM

21
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:21,350
God damn animals. Nights
like this I'd like to take

22
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:24,215
a match to this city so
I could watch all these

23
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,826
motherfuckers burn.

24
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:29,476
Just a good ol' boy
barbecue, eh?

25
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,498
A fresh start. That’s what
this place needs.

26
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,592
Pow!

27
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:37,593
Pow!

28
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,296
Pow!

29
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,124
Jesus...

30
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:58,855
Fuck!

31
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,303
Stop!

32
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:03,572
Drop the bags! Put your
hands on your head!

33
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,161
It’s starting.

34
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,683
There isn’t much time.

35
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:19,480
Shut the fuck up and
drop the bags now!

36
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,009
Hands on your head!

37
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,205
On your head!

38
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,461
Turn around! Turn
the fuck around!

39
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,383
Let him go!

40
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,546
Let him fuck...

41
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,870
What the...?

42
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,299
Burton!

43
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:03,149
What are you doing, Michael?
These weren't your orders.

44
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,450
What did you say?

45
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:08,051
No, I'm following my
own orders now.

46
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:11,203
Then you will die
along with the child.

47
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,529
Burton, you fucking
know this guy?

48
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,833
What the hell is...?

49
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,354
"Paradise Falls"

50
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,980
You okay, Jeep?

51
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:39,059
- Sorry I woke you, Charlie.
- Yeah. Wasn't you.

52
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:42,270
He's been kicking up
a storm all night.

53
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,362
Must know
something I don't.

54
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,322
Another bad dream?

55
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:05,320
It's just stress, Jeep,
that's all.

56
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,892
You do too much
worrying.

57
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,937
About this place.
About your dad.

58
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,370
About me.

59
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,957
You're the only thing I
like to worry about.

60
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,523
See what I mean?

61
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,627
You're worried about a girl
that's eight months pregnant

62
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,541
and it isn't your baby.

63
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,337
It's enough to give
anybody nightmares.

64
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,068
Go ahead and make
fun of me.

65
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:39,115
- Everybody else does.
- Come on.

66
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,089
You know how much I
appreciate everything that

67
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,666
you and Bob are
doing for me.

68
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:52,710
But a month from now, the
baby will have a new family

69
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,881
I need to start to think
about what the hell

70
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,753
I'm gonna do with my life.

71
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,745
You're still going
through with it?

72
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,239
I'm not ready to
be a mother.

73
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,649
Christ, I can barely take
care of myself as it is.

74
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,538
I could help you.

75
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,909
We could do it together.

76
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:21,425
I want to.

77
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,371
You got to stop carrying
the weight of the world

78
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,683
on your shoulders, Jeep.

79
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,130
<i>I don't know whether
I like it very much being</i>

80
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,534
<i>seen around with an
angel without any wings.</i>

81
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:11,356
<i>I've got to earn them and
you'll help me, won't you?</i>

82
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,557
Lord as my witness, Bob,
one of these days that

83
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,923
thing's gonna hit you back.

84
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:28,931
What are you talking
about, Percy?

85
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,904
We got a special
relationship here.

86
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:34,578
Yeah, they got names for
that kind of relationship.

87
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:42,053
<i>But lonely walls,
I'll keep you company.</i>

88
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,535
It's disgusting.

89
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:48,881
You're right.
It is disgusting.

90
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,772
Really. How can she go out
in public looking like that?

91
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:56,504
I don't know. Why
don't we just ask her?

92
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,837
Howard, Don't.
You'll embarrass me.

93
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,063
Audrey, honey?

94
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,345
Your mother was wondering
if you got dressed this morning

95
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,387
with the specific intention
of showing your ass off

96
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,552
to the entire world?

97
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,934
It's because I woke up
hoping to get double teamed

98
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,770
by a couple of meth head
truckers in some bathroom

99
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,854
of a desert shithole.

100
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,288
It's good that we
got stuck here.

101
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:28,277
I feel satisfied with that
answer. I really do.

102
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:32,535
I'm being punished for
something, I know it.

103
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,302
Shit.

104
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,360
Next service in 50 miles.

105
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,604
50 miles?

106
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:21,340
- Merry Christmas.
- What's so merry about it?

107
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:27,372
You know that shit isn't
good for the baby.

108
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,499
Guess I should think
about quitting, then.

109
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:36,459
Before you quit,
can I get one from you?

110
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,508
You can buy a
whole pack inside.

111
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,268
How about I get one
from you and I give you

112
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,752
two from the pack
you're gonna sell me?

113
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,103
I'm kind of lost.

114
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,481
Am I right here?

115
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,905
Not even close.

116
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:04,517
Son of a bitch...

117
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,936
Are there any phone around
here that actually work?

118
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:10,648
Bob will probably let you
use the diner phone

119
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,233
if you ask him nice. Maybe
pay him a little something.

120
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:16,368
I think I can handle that.

121
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:19,923
You got anything in there
to eat? Pancakes, or...

122
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,165
Yup. We got a buttermilk
stack for three seventy-five,

123
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,313
French toast for four
dollars if you're into that.

124
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,945
Personally I like the
pancakes though.

125
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:32,132
- You okay, Charlie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

126
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,056
This guy is just lost.

127
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,496
Who is that?

128
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,568
What do you want
me to do?

129
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:51,522
Talk to him!

130
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:55,065
Things should have been
ready two hours ago.

131
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,432
I hope Salem Lights are
all right, that's all we got left.

132
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,460
Charlie, where have you been?

133
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,672
It's not a resort, we've
got orders stacking up.

134
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:24,320
You best not be
smoking again.

135
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,972
Not in your condition.

136
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:28,095
Bob, see where
I'm at right now?

137
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,515
Can my condition really
get any worse?

138
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:37,176
- Besides, you ain't one to talk.
- What? I quit two years ago.

139
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,903
Yeah? So why are you
still carrying that

140
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,204
fancy lighter around?

141
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:44,049
Gift from my ex-wife.
I'm sentimental.

142
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,108
For when I remember how
much I hate her guts.

143
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,292
Hey, man, you got a
phone I can use?

144
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,954
My cell phone has no
reception, and the

145
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,396
phone booth outside
is busted.

146
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,453
Excuse me, is there any
news about when our

147
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:56,389
car might be fixed?
You said your boy

148
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,742
would have us back on
the road two hours ago.

149
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,981
The rate we're going, we'll
be lucky to make it to

150
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:03,021
Scottsdale by Christmas.

151
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:15,251
Hey. Hood's up on this car.
That mean anything to you?

152
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:16,952
Yeah.

153
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,516
What the hell are you
working on that's so

154
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,550
damn important you're
not doing your job.

155
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:28,684
Found it under a bunch of
stuff in the storage shed.

156
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,978
I know you never liked
throwing anything away

157
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:38,500
- What are you doing?
- What?

158
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:45,498
Jeep, I like Charlie. I do.
And I think it's nice of you

159
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:46,899
- to try to help her out.
- Leave me alone.

160
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,300
How long you gonna follow her
around like a puppy dog?

161
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,200
Cleaning up the messes she
makes while she steps out

162
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:00,716
- with every guy but you?
- Don't say that about her!

163
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:03,422
She's not like that.

164
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,251
Look.

165
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,301
I know it doesn't make
much sense to you.

166
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,412
Sometimes it doesn't make
sense to me either.

167
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,086
I've been having these
dreams about her.

168
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,649
Some of them so bad...

169
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,372
I wish I'd never have
to sleep again.

170
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:36,496
I can't explain it, dad.

171
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,768
I just feel like it's
something I got to do.

172
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:47,887
You know your mother
thought I was crazy.

173
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,162
For wanting to
buy this place.

174
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:53,848
It's all the way up here,
in the middle of nowhere,

175
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,991
But I just knew it was
something I had to do.

176
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:00,259
I couldn't explain it
either. Just like you.

177
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,627
I told your mother:
"Trust me"

178
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:06,505
"You just wait and see,
when they build that mall,

179
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,292
with all the superstores
like they've been planning

180
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,787
on for years, this place
is going to be a goldmine."

181
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,510
Only problem was:
I was wrong.

182
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:18,045
They went and built the
thing in another county

183
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,332
and I looked pretty
damn stupid.

184
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:26,556
And I see you making
the same damn mistake.

185
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:29,864
Believing in something that's
never going to happen.

186
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:36,506
You listen to me, son. It's
time for you to leave here.

187
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:38,229
I don't want to see you
wake up one day

188
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,993
old and pissed off,
realizing you're lost,

189
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:47,049
just like everybody else
that stops here.

190
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,770
Go on. Fix the car.

191
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,403
I want these people out
of here by nightfall.

192
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,535
He's about this close
to wrapping it up.

193
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,105
What is wrong with
you today?

194
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,359
I told you to get
the satellite TV.

195
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,279
But you didn't
want to listen.

196
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,537
What the hell do I
need that crap for?

197
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,223
The History Channel, man.

198
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:58,717
I got all the history
I can take.

199
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:02,305
- That's for sure.
- What's your beef now?

200
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:05,311
You don’t need to be
watching this anyway.

201
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,481
Alright baby. This is
gonna be it, right here.

202
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,168
"This is not a test"

203
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,232
Clear as day.

204
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,405
What the hell is that?

205
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:23,257
Well, they're testing
something.

206
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:24,660
"This is not a test"

207
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,924
That doesn't look
like a test.

208
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,440
Can I just use the phone?

209
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,970
It's back past
the kitchen.

210
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,305
Excuse me, but if this
were an actual emergency,

211
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:40,754
wouldn't they be giving us
instructions on what to do?

212
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,566
Percy, check out that
old radio of yours,

213
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,431
See if there's any
news about the TV.

214
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,882
Put my little man on the phone.

215
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,435
Because a father is
supposed to be able

216
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,500
to talk to his son,
that’s why.

217
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,248
I don't care what your
lawyer said, I got my

218
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:30,339
own lawyer, now put him
on the god damn phone.

219
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,046
Hello?

220
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,493
Your phone is breaking
up, do you hear me?

221
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,575
Shit.

222
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,502
Maybe there was
an earthquake.

223
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:49,080
A lot of people
could be hurt.

224
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,773
Not if it was centered
in the desert.

225
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:52,812
Yeah, could be nothing
to worry about.

226
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:56,927
- So why is the TV out?
- Maybe it was terrorists.

227
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:58,781
Oh God.

228
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:02,077
For crying out loud, there's
no use speculating.

229
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,505
I'll just call my brother
up in Needles,

230
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:04,678
he'll probably
know something.

231
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,790
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

232
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,211
I was just on the phone,
the shit cut off in the middle

233
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:13,745
of my conversation.
I want my money back.

234
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:16,149
This is perfect,
absolutely perfect.

235
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,843
Hey hey, everybody.
Simmer down.

236
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,029
There's nothing to
get excited about,

237
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,930
they're probably just
working on the lines.

238
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,186
Besides, Jeep's going to have
your car fixed in a jiffy,

239
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,574
then you can be on
your way, so...

240
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:28,875
Good.

241
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:24,183
Have a seat wherever
you want ma'am.

242
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:26,350
Specials are on the board.

243
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:36,829
- I already know what I want.
- Okay. What will it be?

244
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,511
- I'll have a steak, please.
- How would you like it?

245
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:41,977
Rare, if you would.
And water, no ice.

246
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:45,551
- Coming right up.
- Charlie, is it?

247
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:49,265
- Yeah
- Unusual name for a girl.

248
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,352
So they say. I'll be right
back with your water.

249
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,748
Hello, I'm Gladys.
Gladys Foster.

250
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,601
Oh, hello Gladys, it's
so nice to meet you.

251
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:03,086
I'm Sandra. And this is
my husband, Howard.

252
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:06,208
What a nice looking
young couple.

253
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,747
What brings you up
to these parts?

254
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:12,088
We're on our way to
Scottsdale, but our car

255
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:15,196
broke down and we're
stuck here until it's fixed.

256
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,197
What a nuisance.

257
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,101
Gladys, the lines seem to
be down around here,

258
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:21,776
the phone and the TV and
I was just wondering

259
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,799
if you might have heard
something on your way up,

260
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,965
about what's going on?

261
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,500
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that, sweetheart.

262
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,506
It'll all be over soon.

263
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:35,756
Okay.

264
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,036
- So what are we looking at?
- I don't know.

265
00:23:46,037 --> 00:23:47,354
It's probably something
wrong with the computer,

266
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,646
but we don't have the
gear to test it here.

267
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,533
Oh, shit.

268
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,728
They're gonna be pissed.

269
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:58,626
Just tell them we'll
call it in and tow it.

270
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:01,915
That's not gonna happen.
The phone's out.

271
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,687
- What?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:09,550
Thank you, dear. How
far along are you?

273
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:11,858
Oh, just about there.

274
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,102
The father must be
very proud.

275
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:17,865
I wouldn't know. He's
out of sight, out of mind.

276
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,727
I see.

277
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:22,491
So I take it you're
not married?

278
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:25,246
- No.
- That's too bad.

279
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:27,679
No, I prefer it that way.

280
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,582
I don't need a man telling
me what to do.

281
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,840
- But what about the baby?
- I've got it under control.

282
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,387
But it's gonna burn.

283
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,242
What did you just say?

284
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,828
I said your fucking
baby's gonna burn.

285
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,189
Go to hell, lady.

286
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:53,347
- Fucking Jesus freak.
- What happened?

287
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,372
All little babies
are gonna burn.

288
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:06,943
Gladys...

289
00:25:06,944 --> 00:25:09,240
Shut up you stupid
fucking cunt. All you do is

290
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,540
- complain, complain, complain!
- What?

291
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:16,010
- What? What?
- Harold, no...

292
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:18,482
I don't know who the
hell you think you are,

293
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,783
but I'd like you to
apologize to my...

294
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,586
You're all going to
fucking die!

295
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:49,757
What the fuck, man?

296
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,607
Shoot her, Jeep!

297
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:10,057
You will never save her.

298
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,396
Shoot that bitch!

299
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:14,952
Shoot her!

300
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,342
Somebody help me!

301
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,167
Don't look at me like that.
I’m trying to help.

302
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:52,051
Calm down. Keep
pressure on his neck.

303
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,666
Easy.

304
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,201
How far is it to
the hospital?

305
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:45,325
How the hell did
she do that?

306
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,624
I don't know.
I don't know.

307
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,718
70, maybe 80 miles.

308
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,678
80 miles?

309
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:54,551
- Please drive faster.
- Okay.

310
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:03,382
What the hell is that?

311
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,461
It's clouds, what do
you think they are?

312
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:10,462
Clouds don't buzz!

313
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,673
I can't believe she was
still standing after Percy

314
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:36,291
hit her with that
frying pan.

315
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:39,852
He broke her fucking
neck, I saw it, I swear.

316
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,331
Did you see the gun
that guy had?

317
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:46,711
What's a guy doing
with a gun like that?

318
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,955
Hey, Jeep.
It's alright, son.

319
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:58,950
I couldn't pull the
trigger. I froze.

320
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:06,949
I saw what I needed
to do. But I was too afraid.

321
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:13,008
She would've killed you.
She would've killed Charlie.

322
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:16,458
Hey. You ain't got nothing
to be ashamed of.

323
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:19,148
You hear me, son?

324
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:21,757
Not everybody can
play the hero.

325
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,521
Especially when it comes
to pulling the trigger.

326
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,978
What happened?
What's going on?

327
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,989
- Gonna get my Bible!
- What for?

328
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,267
Somebody's gotta
start praying.

329
00:29:57,868 --> 00:30:00,629
Jesus, she's burning up.

330
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,540
How is that possible? She's
been dead for an hour.

331
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,273
I don't care how long
she's been dead.

332
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:07,328
The bitch just walked
on the ceiling.

333
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,166
She ain't staying in here.

334
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,730
The old bitch is heavy.
Hold her up.

335
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:15,913
- Where are the flies?
- How am I supposed to know?

336
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,529
Are you asking me to
explain the behavior of a

337
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,525
motherfucking pestilence?

338
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:24,513
Hey. Somebody's coming.

339
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:27,088
Now what?

340
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:34,497
- Alright. Now we're talking.
- What is that? LAPD?

341
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:40,257
- I'm from Vegas, man.
- Give me the gun.

342
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:52,535
Oh my God.

343
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,250
Charlie, wait.

344
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:15,393
Take one more step and
I'll drop you right there.

345
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,408
Is that how you greet
all your customers?

346
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,379
Mister, after what we've
been through you're lucky

347
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,542
we don't shoot you first
and greet you later.

348
00:31:22,543 --> 00:31:25,393
Let me see your teeth.

349
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,973
Teeth, god damnit!
Let me see them!

350
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:35,258
No shark teeth, Pop.

351
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:39,933
Okay then, how about
you tell us your name?

352
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,308
Michael.

353
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,661
Sorry about that, Michael.

354
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:50,050
We had this old lady here,
went crazy in my place.

355
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:52,914
She had these teeth. Never
seen anything like it

356
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,589
Practically bit
a man in half.

357
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,436
What are you doing
out here, anyway?

358
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,587
You don't look like any
policeman I ever saw.

359
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,741
Even the ones from L.A.

360
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:07,479
But he's got to be, right?

361
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,785
Who would be crazy enough
to steal a cop car?

362
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:17,865
- You don't know, do you?
- Don't know what?

363
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:20,067
We don't know anything.
Nothing works, the TV,

364
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,947
the radio, the phone.

365
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:26,094
- I'm running out of time.
- Hold on there, fella.

366
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:29,179
You better start talking or
get the hell out of here.

367
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:37,410
Dad, just tell him
you're sorry.

368
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,636
Hey, hey, hey, Sir!

369
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:44,966
Now I'm sure you don't
want to go spilling blood

370
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,997
for no good reason, in front
of all these decent people.

371
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:50,594
What do you say?

372
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:53,293
Just let Bob go and then
you will be on your way,

373
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:54,838
nice and easy.

374
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,442
They're here.

375
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:17,090
You're gonna need this.

376
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:20,080
- Wait, who's here?
- More like her.

377
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,623
What do you mean like her?

378
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,374
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

379
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:37,483
- Dad, I can handle it.
- He can handle it.

380
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,579
He doesn't have a choice.

381
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,563
Don't do anything brave.

382
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,835
- What's happening?
- Better get back inside.

383
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:08,672
Jeep, come on!

384
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,829
Everybody stay calm!

385
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:47,340
Okay, we're locked in here,
so what do we do now?

386
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,617
Alright, Rambo.
You got us up here.

387
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,500
You mind telling us
what we're fighting?

388
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,196
Listen!

389
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:16,680
You hear what I'm hearing?

390
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:25,227
- What the hell is that?
- Sounds almost like...

391
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:27,340
Ice cream?

392
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:35,984
Can't be fucking
serious, right?

393
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:38,321
There's a safety switch on
the side of your weapon,

394
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:41,646
Push it all the way
down. Two clicks.

395
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:43,718
Now when this starts,
you hold on tight.

396
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:49,884
Otherwise you're gonna
blow your hand off.

397
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,872
What the fuck are you
all looking at me for?

398
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:14,954
"Frosty Treats"

399
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:25,293
Audrey. Honey, listen. It's
the Ice Cream Man.

400
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:03,905
Oh, man, he don't
look that bad.

401
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,556
Oh shit, oh shit,
oh shit.

402
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,214
Oh, damnit!

403
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:11,515
Get ready.

404
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,450
Is that it?

405
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:00,798
Now! Shoot now!

406
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,319
It's just regular people.

407
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,655
Not Anymore!
Keep firing!

408
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:55,632
Don't let them get
near the windows.

409
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,358
Howard!

410
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,660
See what you made
me do, mother?

411
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:47,094
There you are!

412
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,373
Let me go! He's alive!
He's out there!

413
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:20,015
- He's out there.
- He's gone.

414
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:28,248
You okay?

415
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:30,923
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

416
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,314
Thanks.

417
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:39,063
I told you not to
do anything brave.

418
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,914
We got them running.

419
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,068
What happened?

420
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,901
Someone needs to
be on the roof.

421
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:53,074
- I'll go.
- Hold on.

422
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,455
You better start talking.

423
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:09,546
The last time God lost faith
in man he sent a flood.

424
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:14,054
This time, he sent
what you see outside.

425
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:16,621
Are you saying this is
the Apocalypse?

426
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,234
I'm saying this is
an extermination.

427
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:23,356
Those things outside
are just vessels.

428
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:24,965
They're possessed.

429
00:42:24,966 --> 00:42:27,316
The weakest willed are
the easiest to turn.

430
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:30,965
Possessed by what?
Demons?

431
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,066
No...

432
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,626
By angels.

433
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:44,414
Hold on. I don't know what
book you've been reading

434
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:50,158
But in my version the
angels are good guys.

435
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,846
Well the truth, I'm afraid,
is never that simple.

436
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:56,453
Bullshit. I'm not a pastor,
but I've never heard of no

437
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:59,392
Ice Cream Man, or old lady
eating raw meat,

438
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:01,352
jumping on the ceiling
with baby teeth.

439
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:03,333
So I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

440
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:06,501
Hold on. How do you know
so much about them?

441
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,370
Because until last night,
I was on their side.

442
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,393
- So you're saying you...
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

443
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:14,908
Yesterday I was fucking
Santa Claus.

444
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:18,582
You know this is crazy,
right? I mean...

445
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,844
I don't even believe in God.

446
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:23,502
Well that's just fine, Bob, he
doesn't believe in you either.

447
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:27,023
He doesn't believe in
any of this anymore.

448
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,316
I knew this day was coming,
I just didn't think

449
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,615
- I'd be around to see it.
- Come on, Percy!

450
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:33,024
What are we even
talking about this for?

451
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:38,903
Angels, and possessed people.
It's not real! It's...

452
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:41,365
Have you looked
outside, Bob?

453
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:47,082
Those people aren't exactly
our regular customers!

454
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,045
So, are you here to
protect us?

455
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,483
No, not you.

456
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,165
Her.

457
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:00,314
Me? Why me?

458
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,578
Because your child is the
only hope humanity has

459
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,323
of survival.

460
00:44:13,157 --> 00:44:15,653
Wait just a minute.
This can't be happening.

461
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,012
I'm nobody, I'm
just a waitress.

462
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,748
- I don't even own a car.
- None of that matters anymore.

463
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:26,928
Either your child lives
or mankind dies.

464
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,551
So we're supposed to
hold those things off

465
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:33,328
- until the baby gets here?
- That's it.

466
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:35,111
I'm only eight
months pregnant.

467
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,273
This shit can't be
happening, man.

468
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:40,723
How are we supposed to
survive here for a month?

469
00:44:40,724 --> 00:44:43,005
We won't have to.

470
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,680
- It's coming soon, isn't it?
- Yes.

471
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:54,977
Listen. I simply don't care
what you people believe.

472
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:57,444
And those things outside,
they don't care either.

473
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,041
They just want
the child dead.

474
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:04,059
Now, this first attack was
a test of our strength.

475
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,438
The next will be a test
of our weakness.

476
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,720
Now we can sit here
and discuss it...

477
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:13,024
Or you can try
to help me.

478
00:45:13,396 --> 00:45:19,107
But believe me. Something
much worse is on the way.

479
00:45:29,537 --> 00:45:31,705
Sons of bitches.

480
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,967
They're out there,
I can feel them.

481
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:46,925
- So what's with that gun?
- What?

482
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:51,517
Your piece. The one you
killed grandma with.

483
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:54,456
Don't reckon it's for
hunting buck.

484
00:45:56,473 --> 00:46:01,648
- I use it for protection.
- Protection from what?

485
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:04,109
- From people.
- People?

486
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:09,924
- People that be starting shit.
- Regular people, or just...

487
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:13,921
No. Not regular regular
people, but you know...

488
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:16,270
Irregular people, then.

489
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:18,631
Get the fuck out
of here, man.

490
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:23,661
I got my reasons for doing
what I do, and that's that.

491
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:37,539
I've never actually
used it, alright?

492
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:44,089
I may have flashed it,
scared a few folks but,

493
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,277
It never actually fired off.

494
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,275
Not until today.

495
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,684
This shit is crazy, man.

496
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,515
When I was a kid...

497
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:11,338
my father would sit by
my bed every night

498
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,995
before I went to sleep.

499
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:21,009
And he's say to me:

500
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:31,771
"Percy, if you don't
wake up tomorrow,

501
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:38,112
if it turns out that today

502
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:42,117
is your last day on earth.

503
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,850
Will you be proud

504
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:49,875
of what you've
done in this life?

505
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,733
Because if you ain't

506
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:04,129
you better start
getting square."

507
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:22,000
Fuck it.

508
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:42,941
- On the house.
- Thank you.

509
00:48:46,835 --> 00:48:50,433
- You hungry?
- No.

510
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,623
Just because it's the
end of the world

511
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:55,032
doesn't mean you
have to starve.

512
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:58,635
I'm just happy we still
have the gas on.

513
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:13,316
I never really cared
much for beer.

514
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,451
Howard was the beer
drinker in the family.

515
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:36,047
So what did you do?
Before you came here.

516
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:42,525
I was a soldier.
A general in His army.

517
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:49,455
What changed?
What made you leave?

518
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,632
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.

519
00:49:55,352 --> 00:49:59,323
He lost faith. I didn't.

520
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:08,694
How come you still
have faith?

521
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:13,565
I mean, seems like
everything I have faith in

522
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:16,184
cost me nothing
but trouble.

523
00:50:21,898 --> 00:50:31,659
When God chose your kind
as the object of his love.

524
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,093
I was the first in all of heaven
to bow down before you.

525
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:45,065
My love and my hope for
mankind hasn't lessened yet.

526
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:52,967
But I have watched you
trample that gift.

527
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:57,463
I've watched you kill each
other over race and greed

528
00:50:57,464 --> 00:51:02,436
Waging war over dust, rubble
and words in old books.

529
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:07,769
And yet in the midst of
all this darkness

530
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,652
I see some people who
will not be bowed.

531
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:18,310
I see some people
who will not give up.

532
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:22,045
Even when they know
hope is lost.

533
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:29,316
Some people, who realize
that being lost is so close

534
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:31,577
to being found.

535
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:35,892
I see you, Jeep.

536
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:38,390
Fifteen years old, your
mother leaves you,

537
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:41,347
your father withdraws
from the world.

538
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:44,620
And you spend the next
five years of your life

539
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:46,869
helping him find
his way home.

540
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,752
You love a woman, who
has the child of another,

541
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:54,470
and you love her making
a fool of yourself.

542
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:57,699
Even though you know
she may never love you

543
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,500
the way you love her.

544
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,348
You, Jeep.

545
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,010
You are the reason
I still have faith.

546
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:18,265
It's almost time
for the next shift.

547
00:53:09,498 --> 00:53:12,022
You have a question?

548
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:17,971
I question myself.
And so should you.

549
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:24,966
Since their creation, He's
told us only to love.

550
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:29,269
I cannot stop.

551
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,432
They brought this
judgment upon themselves.

552
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:35,500
They are just lost.

553
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,960
It's our place
to guide them.

554
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:41,778
It's our place
to obey.

555
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:43,825
Tell me, Gabriel.

556
00:53:43,826 --> 00:53:46,753
Do you wish to give
Him what he wants...

557
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:48,361
or what he needs?

558
00:53:48,912 --> 00:53:52,250
It's not your test, Michael.

559
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:53,908
How dare you listen
to His heart?

560
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:56,270
Because he made
this one.

561
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,388
It tells me we shouldn't
lose faith now.

562
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:07,645
Too late. The order
has been given.

563
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:09,234
The weak will turn
against the strong

564
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:12,270
and we will undo what
has been done.

565
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:18,612
If you fight him...
???

566
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:02,605
<i>Sandra</i>

567
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:08,058
<i>Sandra</i>

568
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:38,416
Howard?

569
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:05,036
Howard.

570
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:24,279
Help me!

571
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:33,490
- What are you doing?
- He's alive! Let me go!

572
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:43,774
Mom, what are you
doing? Mom, stop!

573
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,212
- Your father is alive!
- He's not, mom!

574
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:46,645
Let go of me!

575
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,225
No!

576
00:57:16,126 --> 00:57:17,880
Percy?

577
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:40,691
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.

578
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:43,898
- Dad...
- Don't!

579
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:52,405
I did this.
He trusted me.

580
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:55,485
Just like your mother,
I let him down.

581
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:57,850
Let everybody down.

582
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:18,140
Here. Mom, If you take
these you'll feel better.

583
00:58:36,961 --> 00:58:39,174
This is your fault.

584
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:43,113
We were only here
because of you.

585
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:46,906
We sacrificed everything
for you.

586
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:52,152
No. You wanted to go.
You said you wanted.

587
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,317
I loved my house.

588
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:58,878
I loved my life, and
you have ruined it.

589
00:58:59,725 --> 00:59:02,243
You ruined everything!

590
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:05,053
- Everything!
- Enough.

591
00:59:05,665 --> 00:59:08,992
You're just gonna sit here
and torture your daughter?

592
00:59:08,993 --> 00:59:12,684
Can you come help me
find a station that works?

593
00:59:35,937 --> 00:59:38,209
Wait! Guys, you gotta
take a look at this,

594
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,505
I'm hearing something.

595
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:43,627
<i>If you're hear my voice,
we're getting the first bits</i>

596
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:47,901
<i>of good news since this
Apocalypse began,</i>

597
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:50,371
<i>nearly 48 hours ago.</i>

598
00:59:50,372 --> 00:59:53,215
<i>A militia has formed on
the outskirts of Las Vegas</i>

599
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:56,038
<i>and has begun to
engage those affected.</i>

600
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,671
<i>Getting unconfirmed reports
of other militias gathering</i>

601
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:03,904
<i>in Death Valley, Zion and
Red Ridge National Park.</i>

602
01:00:03,905 --> 01:00:05,714
Red Ridge, that's like
an hour from here.

603
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:06,730
Does that mean
we can leave?

604
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:08,031
No.

605
01:00:09,263 --> 01:00:11,845
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

606
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:15,123
I don't know about you,
but I gotta get out of here.

607
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:21,002
I won't risk being on the
move when the baby comes.

608
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:24,260
It's too dangerous.

609
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:34,115
Dangerous? What the fuck
you mean too dangerous?

610
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:37,874
<i>...strength to survive. And
have mercy for those</i>

611
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,846
<i>who are already lost.</i>

612
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,482
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
01:01:14,831 --> 01:01:16,120
You okay?

614
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:23,499
The craziest thing is
I don't want this baby.

615
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:29,151
I even went down to the
clinic, did you know that?

616
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,968
I remember sitting in
the waiting room...

617
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:36,035
absolutely sure I was
doing the right thing.

618
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,520
Then I started getting
this feeling.

619
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:46,067
Like if I was falling into
the deepest, darkest

620
01:01:46,068 --> 01:01:48,116
hole imaginable.

621
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:54,529
I couldn't breathe and
I couldn't speak.

622
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:03,426
I kept thinking this must be
what death feels like.

623
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:10,909
And when they called
my name, I just ran.

624
01:02:15,262 --> 01:02:18,042
For a long time I...

625
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,921
I always thought that I could
go back whenever I'd want.

626
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:27,294
And end it like
I'd planned.

627
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,453
But then I started getting
that damn feeling again

628
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:38,566
I knew I had no choice.

629
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:43,651
Somehow this had
already been decided.

630
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:46,939
It made me just...

631
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:54,276
Made me hate this
thing growing inside me.

632
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:59,005
You shouldn't say
things like that, Charlie.

633
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:03,876
It ain't right. You'll
get through this.

634
01:03:03,877 --> 01:03:06,307
I know you will.

635
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:10,380
Why do you have so much
faith in me, Jeep?

636
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,756
God knows I've never given
you or anybody a reason to.

637
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:20,756
Or is it just that you don't
have any other hard-luck

638
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:23,736
cases to follow around,
is that it?

639
01:03:26,963 --> 01:03:29,433
No. You're not the only
one who’s had it hard

640
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,285
around here, okay?

641
01:03:31,628 --> 01:03:35,323
Let me know when you stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

642
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:50,064
- So now you just have to...
- Two clicks. All the way down.

643
01:03:50,065 --> 01:03:54,448
I dated a marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.

644
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:59,190
- My parents hated him.
- I bet they did.

645
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:07,476
My mom was right. It is
my fault we are here.

646
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:11,426
- She didn't mean that.
- Yes, she did.

647
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:12,783
It's true.

648
01:04:12,784 --> 01:04:16,914
The only reason why we're
moving is because of me.

649
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:20,901
They thought my friends
were a bad influence.

650
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:25,504
But I was the bad influence.

651
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:33,529
So really fucked up.

652
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:38,024
When I was a shorty, the
only time my old man ever

653
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:41,516
gave me attention was
when I did something bad.

654
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:43,659
So you know what
I did, right?

655
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,805
What?

656
01:04:44,806 --> 01:04:47,687
I got really good
at being bad.

657
01:04:49,413 --> 01:04:55,413
Problem is, when you get older,
when you have a family,

658
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:58,989
being bad is not so good.

659
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:14,214
Is it over?

660
01:05:20,644 --> 01:05:24,999
- We back in business?
- I don't think so.

661
01:05:37,427 --> 01:05:41,092
- Better go downstairs
- No, I can handle it.

662
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:44,568
- Get downstairs.
- No. I can handle it.

663
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:48,724
Take this just in case.

664
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:55,067
Get ready.

665
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,457
-Wait a minute.
- Kyle, are they...?

666
01:06:17,924 --> 01:06:19,525
Kyle!

667
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,733
Son of a bitch.
It's a trap!

668
01:06:29,734 --> 01:06:31,983
They see them coming
and turn their lights on.

669
01:06:31,984 --> 01:06:36,303
Hey! Get back in your car!
Get back in your car!

670
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:43,522
They won't make it!

671
01:06:45,287 --> 01:06:46,954
Get in the car!

672
01:07:08,005 --> 01:07:10,220
Don't, you're gonna
hit them too!

673
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,001
What the hell is
that guy doing?

674
01:07:30,386 --> 01:07:34,053
Don't open the door.
If you do, we all die.

675
01:07:46,677 --> 01:07:48,043
Now what?

676
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:49,990
Now what?

677
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:01,570
Fooled you.

678
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:07,568
Damn it to hell!

679
01:08:10,618 --> 01:08:13,835
Oh no. Audrey.

680
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,655
You're gonna die now.

681
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,745
She's just a kid,
you can't let her die.

682
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,428
I swear if you don't
do something, I will.

683
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,529
Wait. You stay here.

684
01:08:50,146 --> 01:08:51,497
Open the door.

685
01:09:36,535 --> 01:09:38,201
Run!

686
01:09:40,932 --> 01:09:43,108
- I'll get some water.
- Jeep!

687
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:55,388
Don't be scared. I just want
to play with your baby.

688
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:22,444
- Are you hurt?
- Where is he?

689
01:10:44,194 --> 01:10:46,148
What the hell?

690
01:10:59,512 --> 01:11:01,253
Oh God.

691
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:04,117
It's coming.

692
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,699
Just because I'm a
girl does not mean

693
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,916
I know how
to do this.

694
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,820
Be calm and do
exactly as I tell you.

695
01:11:13,821 --> 01:11:15,651
How can you know
what to do?

696
01:11:21,388 --> 01:11:24,332
What a way to bring
a child into the world.

697
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:35,686
- What the fuck is that?
- He's coming.

698
01:11:35,687 --> 01:11:37,609
- We need to hurry now.
- What do you mean hurry?

699
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,297
This isn't exactly something
we can hurry.

700
01:11:39,298 --> 01:11:40,901
Charlie, I need you
to push now.

701
01:11:40,902 --> 01:11:43,651
You push like you never
pushed before. Push!

702
01:11:43,652 --> 01:11:46,648
- Michael, who is coming?
- Push!

703
01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:04,022
How many bullets do
you have left?

704
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:09,756
Come on!
That’s good!

705
01:12:13,348 --> 01:12:15,789
Charlie, you did it!

706
01:12:17,526 --> 01:12:19,031
You did it.

707
01:12:29,434 --> 01:12:31,220
It's okay.

708
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,896
No, it's okay, your
baby is fine. Look.

709
01:12:33,897 --> 01:12:38,227
It's alright.
Give her some time.

710
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:45,513
Audrey.

711
01:12:53,405 --> 01:12:55,882
He's beautiful.

712
01:12:58,214 --> 01:13:01,051
I remember when
you were a baby.

713
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:04,484
You used to look at
me just like that.

714
01:13:04,485 --> 01:13:06,531
Just like that.

715
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:11,803
Audrey, I'm sorry about
what I said to you before.

716
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,089
- I didn't mean it.
- Yeah.

717
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,448
You're the most precious
thing in the world to me.

718
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:22,584
It's just you and me now.

719
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:32,942
- Are we safe now?
- No.

720
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:37,749
Now, at least, the child
will have a chance.

721
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,935
To grow up.

722
01:13:41,134 --> 01:13:44,380
A chance to lead the
world out of darkness.

723
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:48,258
What happens until then?

724
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:52,172
You'll need to show him how.

725
01:13:54,526 --> 01:13:56,913
What makes you think
I can do that?

726
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:01,233
What makes you think
I want to do that?

727
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:06,043
If he's so important,
why don't you take him?

728
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:16,111
Because his journey is yours.

729
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:50,448
Michael, we need to go.

730
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,277
The possessed can't go
near the child, but he sent

731
01:14:52,278 --> 01:14:54,796
someone who can,
someone like me.

732
01:14:54,797 --> 01:14:57,474
- Like you?
- Gabriel.

733
01:14:57,475 --> 01:14:59,957
He's come here to do
what I wouldn't.

734
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,751
You were the one who was
supposed to kill the baby?

735
01:15:02,752 --> 01:15:05,281
That's the order
you didn't obey?

736
01:15:05,282 --> 01:15:07,295
- We need to go.
- What is he talking about?

737
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:08,889
Go grab whatever
weapons we have left.

738
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:10,287
- What are you talking about?
- We need to go now.

739
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:12,066
- Tell me!
- Now!

740
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,887
The baby. The baby was
never meant to be born.

741
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:28,355
The future has been
unwritten. The child lives.

742
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:31,499
And while he does,
there's still hope.

743
01:15:32,872 --> 01:15:34,323
Audrey!

744
01:15:37,123 --> 01:15:38,517
- Mom!
- Come, come.

745
01:15:38,518 --> 01:15:40,134
- What are you doing?
- I heard them say.

746
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:43,207
They just want the baby.
I will give them the baby.

747
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,254
- Then they'll let us go!
- Give him back to me!

748
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:49,203
Why!? You didn't want
him in the first place!

749
01:15:52,612 --> 01:15:56,167
Come on, Audrey.
Audrey, come with me!

750
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:03,235
It's just one baby.

751
01:16:04,437 --> 01:16:06,357
It's just one baby.

752
01:16:51,638 --> 01:16:52,328
No!

753
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:55,469
No, Jeep, not now!

754
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:59,686
The child! Get the
child out of here!

755
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:02,566
- What about you?
- Don't be afraid.

756
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:07,709
Find the Prophets. Learn to
read the instructions.

757
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,211
Prophets? What Prophets?
What instructions?

758
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:44,396
I knew he'd send
you, Gabriel.

759
01:17:45,956 --> 01:17:49,048
You were always so
eager to please him.

760
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:54,921
Unlike you.
The rebellious son.

761
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:13,965
Your wings. They would
have helped you now.

762
01:18:14,787 --> 01:18:17,006
To not feel that burden
is a dream.

763
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:32,436
You think you can defy Him
and not pay the price?

764
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:36,583
The child lives.

765
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,077
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

766
01:18:51,404 --> 01:18:54,419
Yours is a fools sacrifice, Michael.

767
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:58,637
You can help them run
but they won't escape.

768
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,074
Neither will you, my brother.

769
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,635
I'm not running anymore.

770
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:27,798
That's enough.
There's another way.

771
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:46,861
There is no other way.

772
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:47,708
That's enough.

773
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:33,020
You wanted to live
like one of them.

774
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:41,385
Now you die
like one of them.

775
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:07,425
Jeep. You arm.

776
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:14,078
The instructions.

777
01:23:29,326 --> 01:23:33,568
Sorry. We're out of business.

778
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:01,616
Okay.

779
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:03,823
We need to figure out
our weapon situation.

780
01:24:03,824 --> 01:24:06,437
Hopefully Michael didn't take
everything out of the car.

781
01:24:06,438 --> 01:24:07,738
Look around.

782
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,164
I've got a flare gun
and a couple of...

783
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:29,860
Audrey, flare gun!

784
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:42,678
Hurry!

785
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:06,383
Do it!

786
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:37,872
Jeep?

787
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,477
- The baby?
- Alive.

788
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,773
Audrey?

789
01:26:31,287 --> 01:26:32,983
Give me the child.

790
01:26:37,988 --> 01:26:39,177
No.

791
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,278
Then death will
come to you both.

792
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:51,593
No!

793
01:26:59,304 --> 01:27:01,375
Why do you continue to fight?

794
01:27:03,378 --> 01:27:06,436
When you know all hope is lost.

795
01:27:12,464 --> 01:27:14,053
Fuck you.

796
01:27:23,475 --> 01:27:27,036
This can't be.
You've disobeyed Him.

797
01:27:27,888 --> 01:27:30,209
You gave him what he asked.

798
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:34,302
I gave him what he needed.

799
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:04,732
When I was a little girl...

800
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:07,750
my mother spoke of a prophecy.

801
01:29:07,751 --> 01:29:09,977
Of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness

802
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:13,290
and the fate of mankind
would be decided.

803
01:29:13,255 --> 01:29:15,496
One night I finally got up
the courage to ask my mother

804
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:18,762
why God was so mad
at his children.

805
01:29:20,165 --> 01:29:25,010
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me,

806
01:29:26,203 --> 01:29:29,148
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."
