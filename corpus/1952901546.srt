Whats thatpaying these days?

67
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,145
Three thousand

68
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,114
Youre right ltis

69
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,494
Thought thatwas you

70
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,797

No ls cash okay?

74
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,041
Yeah l guess

75
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,735
Letme guess:

76
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,435
You guys joinedfor the action

77
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,189
GortonHex, inaccordance with martial lawEdict9235,

78
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:09,461
you are hereby sentenced to execution,via injection squad

79
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,770
Anylastrequests?

80
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,098
Fine,then

81
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,203
Wait,you bastards

82
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,067
ltis dictated bylaw that l divulge the sequence
ofinjection to the convicted

83
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,917
Youwill be injectedthree times
Once byeach one ofus

84
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:29,650
One syringe containsVistersine,
a lethal compoundwhen mixed --

85
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,083
With Zoxin,which isin another syringe

86
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,590
The thirdsyringe contains a placebo

87
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,298
None ofus issure who haswhich drug,

88
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:44,258
Andin thiswaynone ofushas tolive with the guilt
of administeringthe fatal dose

89
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,010
ln my opinion however,

90
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,538
thisis an extreme waste ofmanpower

91
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,415
And its notmuch fun

92
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,352
lhate itwhen they getall foamylike that

93
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,158
Hey, Ugly

94
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,603

101
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,181
Could be worse

102

How?

103
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,787

especiallyif theyhave the Planetfall

370

Do you think l shouldcall them back?

371
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,798

Wise move pickingthis stuffup before you get
toomuch further into the Zone

518
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,919
Whats the big idea about thisZone anyway?

519
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:48,783
Well, some electrical interference as you
get closer to Montenegro is a given

520
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,256
Mainthing toworryaboutthough is the shippinglanes

521
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,462
ltsa no-flyzoneTheyve all
been diverted to the south

522
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:59,400
Seems ships have been going down in the Zone mysteriously

523
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,811
Hey! Does your daddyknowyoure --

ltis crucial thatwe stick to the original plan

665
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,860
l cantimpress uponyou howimportantitis
thatwe getto it first

666
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,566

675
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,208
Lets go

676
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,819
Looks Dicey

677
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,151
OkayThe wayl see it:

678
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,247
Our first optionis tocontinue downthe bridge,

679
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,923
the second is tocircuit the chasm to the East
and find anotherway around

680
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,256
l saw this

681
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,023
What?

682
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:32,829
ln myvision,at the Snooze Bar
l saw this bridge

683
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,495

We have reason tobelieve the bridge isbad, sir

687
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,339
Bad? Whatkindofbad?

688
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,177

690
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,847
Thatsfine, but the Easterndirectiontakes us
deeper into theVZ and possible danger

691
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,192
Like what?

692
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,195
Thisiswhere your unitwas killed by the Psions, isntit?

693
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,167

more predictable, like burning hotlava, sir

696
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,306
Verywell Proceed

697
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,443
Shall we continue east, sir?

698
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,920

699
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,350
