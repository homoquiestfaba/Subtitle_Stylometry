00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,478
You'll notice a place
for candidates

359
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,812
to put pros and cons,

360
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,747
reasons why they think
they should be elected

361
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,350
and why the incumbent
totally fricking sucks.

362
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,789
Same with Los Angeles
and New York.

progressive Seattle,

366
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:55,666

council passed an ordinance

forbidding candidates from
mentioning their opponents

368
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,271
in their voter pamphlet
statements.

369
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,341
It's total bullshit!
Just bullshit!

370
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,910
They've rigged the whole
tottering system

371
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,445
to stay in power!

372
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,214
Well, I'm sure you're
making a valid point

373
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,616
and we'll give it--

374
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,750
it's not just that!

375
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,752
It's the incumbent
can say

376
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,320
whatever the hell
he wants!

377
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,422
He can brag,
he can manipulate,

his voting record.

pet parakeet

380
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,662
and grill it in the
microwave for breakfast.

381
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,798
But can a challenger target
these inane insanities?

382
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,400
Can he expose it

383
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:33,437
in the one document that 
most voters actually read? No!

384
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,377
Fuck. Sorry.

if we're wrong here,

Some would say
you're using this lawsuit

390

to take advantage
of the free media.

391
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,870
Well, it's true
that every candidate

who's challenging
an incumbent

393
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,208

as possible.

He's on TV!
It's grant!

395
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,579
It's too important for
the people to be exposed

396
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,682
to all ideas, brilliant,
constructive, idiotic.

397
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,584
Exposure, it's an issue

398
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:25,223

Mass transit
is a social justice issue.

When you hear McIver pimping
his light rail plan,

411
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:25,883
the sound you really hear
is that of a giant toilet

412
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:29,520
flushing away
the city's under-class.

413
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,757
I mean, he'll never build
this so-called light rail

414
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,393
'cause it's just
a giant ploy.

415
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,496
A train five times
the size of any trolley?

416
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,465
It'll never stop even close
to fast enough.

00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,703
It'll run over children
and cats and dogs

until they have to put up
heavy fences and walls,

419

the neighborhood, folks.

so if you have
any questions--

we need contributions

we need volunteers.

431
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:45,429
We can't do this on our own,
so, if...

because everything
they're saying

436
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,876
is not packaged or scripted
or paid for by big business.

The greed
of those at the top

has always affected the lives
of those less fortunate,

those less willing
to steal with impunity,

560

and that's why
I want to ensure

that our police
and firefighters

I did not vote
for George Bush.

the question.

to punch me out.

that's meaningful

on the calendar

depends on what we want
Seattle to be,

upon our ability to choose
our future willfully

for this?

00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,029
of being in position
on city council

on the future

into that future,

do we push development

Do we want to be a city
of automobiles, huh?

the necessary sacrifices
