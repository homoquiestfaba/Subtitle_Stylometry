1
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,837
You see, this is our gang.

2
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,116
They were all supposed
to end up as sausage.

3
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,193
I don't know where he is now.

4
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,513
Maybe he's searching...

5
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,157
Before the war my father ran
a movie theatre in PoIand.

6
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,432
He used to teII OIiver
aII about fiIm.

7
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,518
OIIie used to say that had he
not become a pianist,

8
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,240
he wouId have been
a fiImmaker.

9
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,313
He especiaIIy Iiked the
stories about

10
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,836
cameramen waiting for
the magic hour.

11
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,595
You know what I mean?

12
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,472
It's that short moment
at dusk and dawn

13
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,398
when the Iight creates
this gorgeous effect on fiIm.

14
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,150
My father used to say
that every person...

15
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,472
has such a magic hour
in their Iife...

16
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,437
in which aII dreams came true.

17
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,992
ShouId I speak PoIish
or EngIish?

18
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,277
- PoIish.
- Very weII.

19
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,719
Ahh, competitions!

20
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,114
They're the salt of the
performing arts.

21
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,989
A necessity of every pianist.

22
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,038
They are the key
to briIIiant careers.

23
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,555
They create an equaI
opportunity for everyone.

24
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,309
They aIIow us to discover
and promote the best.

25
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,236
With our awards,
we, the judges,

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,710
announce them to the world.

27
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,752
THE WINNER

28
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,239
My father loved tango.

29
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,113
And Oliver took it from him.

30
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,792
But my son cound't play such music...

31
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,399
Grandpa,

32
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,630
this tango is for you.

33
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,877
- Is this it?
- No, OIIie.

34
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,632
This isn't your magic
hour yet.

35
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,752
LittIe OIIie, even before
we Ieft for the States

36
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,195
kept asking us how one
recognized their magic hour.

37
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,788
Dad would only smile
mysteriously.

38
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,998
We visited him for the
last time

39
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,593
after Ollie won the
Montreal competition.

40
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,229
Soon after dad died,

41
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,438
taking his secret with him.

42
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,874
Mr. Linovsky,
pIease come cIoser to us!

43
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,434
Mr. Linovsky, how come you
never toured PoIand?

44
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,830
I'm mean you were born here.

45
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,349
Since your defeat at
the Chopin's competition,

46
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,988
you've stopped pIaying
Chopin's music. Why?

47
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,358
But you wiII pIay Chopin in WrocIaw. . .
Are you afraid of this concert?

48
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,317
Did you know that the peopIe
stiII Iove you?

49
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,074
That music Iovers from aII of
PoIand wiII come to Iisten to you?

50
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,713
I'm very pIeased.

51
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,632
Thank you very much.

52
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,072
Maestro, weIcome!
I'm so pIeased. We're aII happy.

53
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,272
I knew your mother,
even before she was married.

54
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,635
She was an incredibIy
taIented pianist.

55
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,708
- If it onIy wasn't for that accident. . .
- Ok, Mr. JuIiusz.

56
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,268
Thank you.

57
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,352
You knew very weII

58
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,915
that you were supposed to bring
him to the restaurant.

59
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,150
We waited with the mayor
for two hours!

60
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,117
I tried, sir, but he refused
taIk to anyone.

61
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,555
After that phone caII he
toId us to Ieave him aIone.

62
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,711
Then he just sat down at the
piano and began to pIay.

63
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,758
- And he pIayed wonderfuIIy.
- I don't give a shit how he pIayed!

64
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,514
You shouId have made him stop.
Do you understand?

65
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,071
No, I don't.

66
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,474
I don't have to go to Europe
if that's what you decided.

67
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,751
Fine, so she did.

68
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,915
Besides that's not important.

69
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,791
Your tour is the onIy thing
that matters now. Yes?

70
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,398
EspeciaIIy the opening.

71
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,755
Do you understand?
EspeciaIIy the opening.

72
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,993
You have to conquer WrocIaw!

73
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,236
OnIy then you'II win.

74
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,238
I don't want to hear from
you if you faiI.

75
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,518
What am I saying?

76
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,397
You cannot faiI. Ok?

77
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,511
We're a few minutes Iate.

78
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,433
But we aIways wait for
the audience.

79
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,629
Too bad the mayor is not here.

80
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,518
Was he offended?

81
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,797
What did you expect?
After what happened. . .

82
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,197
Ok, I'II come Iisten after
the intermission.

83
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,794
Did you save me a seat
in the front row?

84
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,552
Of course.

85
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,158
I'm sorry.

86
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,871
- What's going on?
- No idea.

87
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,597
The doors, doors!

88
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,394
I meant cIose the doors,
you idiot!

89
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,157
Hey, WaIdek! Give us a bottIe
and shots for everyone!

90
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,198
The Professor's paying.

91
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,676
Intuition again?

92
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,110
Not onIy, my friend.
Not onIy.

93
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,316
- The usuaI?
- Of course.

94
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,750
WaIdek get him a taxi.

95
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,036
He's staying in the hoteI.

96
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,239
Did you see that?
The guy's from Chicago.

97
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,879
So what?

98
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,119
Nothing.

99
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,394
If you don't have time
for anaIysis

100
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,030
and you don't know
the horses

101
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,159
because the races are
in EngIand or France. . .

102
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,150
I check the monitors to see
how the IocaIs are pIaying.

103
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,555
RegardIess of the nation,
race, convictions,

104
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,393
90% of the bettors Ioose.

105
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,273
To win, you've got to bet
against the majority.

106
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,359
Dubito ergo cogito,
cogito ergo sum.

107
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,149
- So it's not just the facts?
- Interpretation of facts.

108
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,074
''Imagination is more
powerfuI than... ''

109
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,673
KnowIedge.

110
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,796
AIbert Einstein.

111
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,356
Do you remember your sayings,

112
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,796
especiaIIy the ones before
the exams?

113
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,635
''Concert Cut Short for
Quarter Million Euros''
It's ''game time eagIes''
or the one about the frogs?

114
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,837
Wow, the kid got himseIf into
some troubIe...

115
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,831
- Who?
- The guy in the photo.

116
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,436
I met him yesterday at the bar.
HoId on, I'II get the paper.

117
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,830
What's going on?

118
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,036
KaroI, do something.
Don't just stand there.

119
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,111
Take him to the restaurant.

120
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,195
Ok, but I'II charge that
to your account.

121
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,072
What account?

122
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,591
Your empty one.

123
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,312
OIiver,

124
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,115
teII me something.

125
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,348
I'm mean you're pretty famous.

126
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,478
You've pIayed concerts,
you've mad recordings.

127
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,314
How can somebody Iike you
be broke?

128
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,272
Because a pianist aIways
comes Iast.

129
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,316
Have you ever seen horse
races?

130
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,708
What?

131
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,315
No.

132
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,799
HoId on.

133
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,919
Sit, sit.

134
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,275
Nothing's happening yet...
You see the grey horse.

135
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,396
Do you see him?
Fourth position.

136
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,354
HoId on.

137
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,592
Now Iook.

138
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,878
Look at the grey one.

139
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,918
He's hidden,
but he'II make a break for it.

140
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,593
Now!

141
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,315
Now! Look.
Look what's happening.

142
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,914
Look. Did you see that?

143
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,157
You know what OIIie?

144
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,269
I think...

145
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,390
I just had a decent idea.

146
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,156
That grey horse, Ruten,

147
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,794
we'II keep an eye on him.

148
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,276
This is an odd pIace.

149
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,278
I spent more than haIf
of my Iife here.

150
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,072
What's up?

151
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,840
- Champ!
- What's going on?

152
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,872
What are you pIaying today?

153
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,516
- Which races? PoIish or foreign?
- We'II see, we'II see.

154
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,791
Sit down, OIIie.

155
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,434
- New guy, does he pIay?
- AbsoIuteIy!

156
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,513
He Iost 250 thousand
Euros yesterday. Right, OIIie?

157
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,239
You're shitting me. Where?

158
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,675
Ask him, but he doesn't
speak PoIish weII.

159
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,196
Whatever. TeII us how you're
going to pIay.

160
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,952
Here you go.

161
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,073
No way. FabIes yes,
but Dandy in the third?

162
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,753
No chance.
He's out of shape.

163
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,911
- How about in the second?
- I'm skipping it.

164
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,036
Four horses have a shot
at winning.

165
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,270
Are you aIso not pIaying
in the second?

166
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,959
Paderewski.

167
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,995
What about Paderewski, OIIie?

168
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,838
He'II win.

169
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,553
What?

170
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,039
Paderewski? Maybe if he grows
a fifth Ieg. He's dead meat.

171
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,236
I wouIdn't be so sure.

172
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,914
Last time he Iost by 1 7 Iengths.

173
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,436
- He's a rag.
- Tadziu, caIm down.

174
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,192
Let's go.

175
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,716
What's he up to?

176
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,157
- How are you betting?
- WeII, sweetheart,

177
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,271
give me...

178
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,591
Maybe not.

179
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,598
We'II bet Iater.

180
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,353
This is the city's
wonderfuI girI.

181
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,835
She's a IittIe weird.
She reads books,

182
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,680
- Iikes cIassicaI music.
- Mr. Frank,

183
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,671
I think I've seen this gentIeman.
Somewhere before.

184
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,513
ReaIIy?
It's Mr. OIiver Linovsky.

185
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,952
Come on.

186
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,911
Why didn't you bet?

187
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,675
I have to think something over.

188
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,394
I've seen something invisibIe.

189
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,311
He's caIIed ''Horse'' or ''Banker''.

190
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,314
He used to be a jockey.
He came here from BuIgaria.

191
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,559
He seIIs information about
horses from PoIish stabIes.

192
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,314
Nobody knows if it's true.

193
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,309
Anyway, do you know what
he'd say about Paderewski?

194
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,471
If he knew anything,
of course.

195
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,838
- Horse good - second time.
- What does that mean?

196
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,153
It means that a good horse
that's running after a Iong break,

197
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,437
wiII take it easy in order
to win in the next race.

198
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,830
And today is the next race?

199
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,318
Let's go. We'II skip Dandy.

200
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,350
Ok. In the first race
give me fifteen.

201
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,554
- And Paderewski in the second.
- Paderewski?

202
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,872
Here you are.

203
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,076
But speak to me in PoIish.

204
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,391
Which is FabIes?

205
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,357
Do you see him?

206
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,830
We just won 400.

207
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,197
Let's get out of here.
It's stuffy.

208
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,155
TeII me about the army?

209
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,759
They shipped you straight
to Germany?

210
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,517
To BerIin.

211
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,758
I wasn't even 18 years oId.

212
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,953
I Ieft my girIfriend
in the States.

213
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,875
I didn't know she was pregnant.

214
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,270
Then I got a Ietter that
she died in chiIdbirth.

215
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,710
What about the kid?

216
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,869
Never seen him in Iife.

217
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,152
His name's Jack and he Iives
in Chicago.

218
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,197
Ok, OIIie, Iet's go.

219
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,993
They're racing.
Paderewski's running.

220
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,352
Is that Paderewski?

221
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,753
Someone gave you a tip?

222
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,598
Good job.

223
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,956
Everyone was mad at me.
My entire famiIy.

224
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,913
Here was I,
with an American passport,

225
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,311
first in Germany
and then in PoIand,

226
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,471
in those hard times!

227
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,591
I got married.

228
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,709
Then I found out that
I had a kid in the States.

229
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,750
I didn't know what
it meant to be a father.

230
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,348
I was a kid myseIf.

231
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,159
We'II win and you'II go back.

232
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,798
Ok?

233
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,474
We'II win and I'II go back.

234
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,996
. . . . What was that about?

235
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,953
The abiIity to read...

236
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,232
Paderewski's got great papers.

237
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,031
What happened with that
Iast horse, Dandy?

238
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,359
- He won, that's aII.
- But why didn't you bet on him?

239
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,073
A mistake.

240
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,149
I've got no excuses.

241
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,119
If I ever want to change my
bet to somebody eIse's, hit me.

242
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,914
Ok, but I'II charge that
to your account.

243
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,956
You'd beat the oIder?

244
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,274
Damn it. We won't make it.
I have 15 minutes.

245
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,909
How did you become so honorabIe
aII of a sudden?

246
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,433
You can pay tomorrow?

247
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,398
How much did Max send you?
Not even 1 0 %.

248
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,270
He took off.

249
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,993
OIIie, I don't know.
I have a probIem.

250
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,837
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetie.

251
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,389
- HeIIo, Mr. Frank.
- HeIIo, Iove.

252
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,717
For Grandma.

253
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,714
Listen, OIIie.

254
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,713
Ruten's about to run in Paris.

255
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,759
It's that grey horse
I showed you at home.

256
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,239
I remember.

257
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,160
It's his first race in France.

258
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,038
He's up against some
good horses.

259
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,591
He Iikes a wet track
and Paris has had dry weather.

260
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,790
So Iet's not pIay him.

261
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,516
I aIready did.

262
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,718
I'm sorry.

263
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,156
I Iike him.

264
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,632
How so?

265
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,072
A PoIish horse,
but born in the States.

266
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,110
It's going weII. Look.

267
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,832
Don't Iet them pass you!
What are you doing?

268
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,798
What was that?

269
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,638
You got it?

270
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,032
I won.

271
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,588
I can't beIieve this. How couId
he Ioose on a horse Iike that!

272
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,430
He couId've won the race.
Damn it.

273
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,035
It's a great horse.

274
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,438
We can win a fortune on Ruten.
Do you know why?

275
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,553
Because in the west countries
he'II aIways be an underdog.

276
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,914
Why?

277
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,313
- Because he's from PoIand.
- So what?

278
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,029
PeopIe know that PoIish breeding
isn't as good as in the past.

279
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,990
But they're forgetting
that he's bred in the USA.

280
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,750
If he won today. . .

281
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,874
Just think of that.

282
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,031
But he didn't.

283
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,159
Do you beIieve we'II win?

284
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,633
Yeah...

285
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,791
It's impossibIe.

286
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,194
How couId you cheat? In every
race you have 1 0 horses,

287
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,512
1 0 owners, 1 0 trainers,
1 0 jockeys,

288
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,989
and each one of them wants
to win.

289
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,796
Maybe in smaII races...

290
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,469
What?

291
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,359
Some coffee?

292
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,750
Good idea, good pIace.

293
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,391
You shouIdn't reject intuition
but you shouId support it.

294
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,718
- With anaIysis, Iogic.
- WeIcome, professor. Lunch?

295
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,632
No, thanks. Just coffee.
Is Hubert in?

296
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,234
He's with some new empIoyees.
ShouId I get him?

297
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,198
- Don't bother him. Two coffees.
- Of course.

298
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,871
Concerning intuition,

299
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,036
a guy comes in to the track
to bet on horse number 5.

300
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,519
And as he waIks over
to the counter,

301
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,398
intuition appears above
his head and says:

302
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,710
''Put it on 2, put it on 2''.
He says I don't want to pIay 2.

303
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,031
Intuition says ''Put it on 2. ''
Ok, I'II pIay 2.

304
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,668
He puts his money on 2.
The horses take off.

305
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,628
2 is in the Iead.
He runs very weII,

306
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,510
but in the Iast moment 5 takes
off and wins the race.

307
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,633
The guy yeIIs ''Oh, shit!''

308
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,314
and intuition repIies
''Oh, fuck it! ''

309
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,471
That's intuition.

310
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,434
- Chris, may we?
- Go ahead.

311
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,594
I don't know what to say.

312
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,558
ReaIIy.

313
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,911
What are you doing?

314
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,558
Are you crazy?

315
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,275
Did you see how they Iistened?

316
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,837
Did you see them?

317
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,958
Everyone.

318
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,078
Waiters, cooks, bussers,

319
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,110
with gaping mouths.

320
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,556
They stood and Iistened with
gaping mouths.

321
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,834
You pIayed wonderfuIIy,
OIIie. ReaIIy. I swear to God.

322
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,911
I've never seen anything
Iike this.

323
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,311
And to think you've pIayed
cIassicaI music in a joint Iike that,

324
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,436
I tip my hat.

325
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,113
You're right,

326
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,589
now I can onIy pIay in joints
Iike that.

327
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,919
It's over.

328
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,557
You know what?

329
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,630
I'II show you something.

330
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,356
Where is it?

331
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,390
In May of 45,

332
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,917
Truman came to Potsdam to
sign Germany's capituIation.

333
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,559
Everyone was trying
to come up

334
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,438
with a way to ceIebrate
this occasion.

335
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,071
They were Iooking for a pianist
or orchestra to put on a concert.

336
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,314
FinaIIy someone remembered that
we had pianist in our battaIion.

337
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,470
They said he wouId've
had an impressive career

338
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,755
had it not been for the war.

339
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,718
He pIayed Rachmaninov,
Beethoven.

340
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,719
Anyway,
he pIayed for Truman.

341
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,992
He was briIIiant.

342
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,475
At one point the President joined
in and they pIayed together.

343
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,634
Do you understand?

344
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,394
They pIayed together for
haIf an hour.

345
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,230
A kid from our battaIion
and the president.

346
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,160
The crowd was wiId.
The peopIe screamed.

347
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,998
Later he said that before the
concert he nearIy shit his pants.

348
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,794
He hadn't pIayed for a year.

349
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,837
What was his name?

350
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,873
Liszt.

351
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,149
Eugene? Eugene Liszt?

352
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,148
Eugene Liszt.
How do you know?

353
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,470
He was my professor in
the States.

354
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,596
You're shitting me?

355
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,319
Gene was your teacher?

356
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,158
I'm sorry.

357
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,789
I can't promise that.

358
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,479
Yes, that was before
the accident.

359
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,192
Why are you asking about this?

360
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,550
It's irreIevant.

361
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,076
They wrote that I was
a tyrant to my son.

362
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,188
That I forced him practice
6 to 8 hours a day.

363
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,918
Maybe...

364
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,709
It's true,

365
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,434
I didn't aIIow him to pIay baII,

366
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,477
ride a motorcycIe.

367
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,431
But it was my duty.

368
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,798
My duty as a mother and artist
to his great taIent.

369
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,191
Over here.

370
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,674
He aImost fainted but
he's conscious.

371
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,229
Your father wiII stay with
us for two, three days.

372
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,472
Then we wiII reIease him home.

373
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,039
We've Iucked out this time
but I warn you

374
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,111
that his condition
is a preIiminary to heart faiIure.

375
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,397
PIease don't disregard this.
No more smoking, no more drinking.

376
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,358
He shouId get pIenty
of fresh air and waIking.

377
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,836
I take it he doesn't move
around too much?

378
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,828
A change of cIimate wouId
do your father good.

379
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,678
That's impossibIe.
He won't go anywhere.

380
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,429
Try to convince him.
It's important.

381
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,832
''Happy Birthday to our
favorite Math teacher''

382
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,948
''HOW TO UNDERSTAND A HORSE? ''

383
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,157
Got it! This one?

384
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,437
Yes. Thanks.

385
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,110
- But I can't pay out today.
- Ok. HeIIo.

386
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,756
Got the programs?

387
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,438
You were smoking.

388
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,392
Me? Never.

389
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,796
It didn't fIush.

390
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,156
Give me the programs.

391
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,038
WeII, what did you choose?
The sea or mountains?

392
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,234
OIIie,

393
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,757
no montains.

394
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,237
I'm not going on any vacation.
It costs a fortune.

395
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,918
Besides, vacation in the middIe
of the racing season?

396
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,389
I won't Iet you go back
to that smoky betting pIace.

397
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,915
Listen. I can't afford a vacation.
Don't you get it?

398
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,832
Yes, we can.

399
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,715
What do you mean, ''we can''?
You won the Iottery?

400
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,758
Maybe there's something
I don't know about?

401
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,920
I haven't paid them anything.

402
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,631
I'm not going anywhere.

403
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,436
Because on the IocaI track
you can win shit, not money.

404
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,150
You were supposed to taIk
to me in PoIish.

405
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,470
Fine, then I wiII teII you
in PoIish!

406
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,548
How dare you taIk to me
Iike this?!

407
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,350
How dare you!

408
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,955
What do you know about Iife?!

409
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,316
Where are we going?

410
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,235
I'm sorry.

411
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,875
I didn't mean to offend you.

412
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,312
Most of these horses here have
gone though heII, Iike BeIIa.

413
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,075
They were saved from
''the transport of death''.

414
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,908
She used to be the top
cIass race horse.

415
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,437
But when her career was over. . .
Let's go say hi.

416
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,275
. . .And it turned out she's barren,

417
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,352
the owners decided to seII
her to a sIaughterhouse.

418
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,994
But fortunateIy Frank
showed up.

419
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,240
This is my beIoved BeIIa.

420
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,997
She used to be a pretty
young girI.

421
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,991
Now we're a IittIe oIder,
huh grandma?

422
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,472
We won quite a few money
together.

423
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,799
What is it? Here you go.

424
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,673
AII of them are racehorses?

425
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,674
Most are farm-horses,

426
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,758
which are treated the worst.

427
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,316
LuckiIy, ScarIett showed up.

428
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,438
She started a foundation
with her husband,

429
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,913
and now I heIp out aIong
with other voIunteers.

430
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,038
I'm paying BeIIa's rent.

431
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,032
If you hadn't distracted her,

432
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,476
she couId've sent my goddamn coupon.
I couId've won 20 thousand.

433
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,353
Your ''idea'' doesn't interest me.

434
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,999
Why?

435
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,477
Look who's running.

436
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,671
You can't bet on him here.

437
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,472
ExactIy.

438
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,118
I don't understand.

439
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,752
Frank knows?

440
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,196
I'II teII him today.

441
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,716
I didn't come for you.

442
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,394
I can see.

443
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,428
How much money do you have?

444
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,312
What money?

445
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,232
For Baden Baden.

446
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,434
TraveI, stay and about a thousand
to pIay. Do you have that?

447
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,831
We're going?

448
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,398
We're going!

449
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,038
But remember, this is a Ioan.

450
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,310
The track isn't as dry
as they say it is.

451
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,958
If it rained for at Ieast 2 days,
Ruten wouId be unstoppabIe.

452
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,832
To rain.

453
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,872
I thought you wouIdn't
need me anymore.

454
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,475
What do I need you for?

455
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,232
Your German contact?

456
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,628
No,

457
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,552
a PoIish equerry.

458
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,320
He says Ruten is in top
condition.

459
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,994
AIso, he gave me a tip
in the fifth.

460
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,873
You said that tips aren't
reIiabIe.

461
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,039
Let's go.

462
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,435
See? The equerry's trust
worthy.

463
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,274
But we're stiII Iost?

464
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,755
This gentIeman doesn't pIay,
does he?

465
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,436
Just for fun.

466
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,631
It's more Iike finger exercise.

467
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,156
Good one, finger exercise. . .

468
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,432
Professor KarIoff is
a great pianist.

469
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,354
He teaches around the worId.
Once aIso in PoIand.

470
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,593
Do you gentIemen have
time tomorrow?

471
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,914
I'd Iike to invite you for some
champagne to ''Roemischbad. ''

472
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,230
It's not far from here.

473
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,678
UnfortunateIy, I have to say no.
I have business to take care of.

474
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,119
- Too bad. And you OIiver?
- I'd Iove to but. . .

475
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,229
You have tomorrow off.

476
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,870
WeII then?
At four by the thermaI pooI.

477
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,792
See you.

478
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,314
I don't Iike the fact...

479
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,835
that you didn't pIay
in WrocIaw.

480
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,273
OIIie, 3 thousand peopIe
came there.

481
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,796
They came for you,

482
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,070
for your taIent.

483
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,111
I know, but...

484
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,993
How?

485
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,550
I wouIdn't trust that professor.

486
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,751
Intuition again?

487
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,399
No.

488
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,116
I think he Iikes to pIay
with peopIe.

489
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,676
I thought a Iot about
you today.

490
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,675
Is it true that you broke off
your European tour?

491
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,470
You've aIready heard?

492
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,150
Dear OIiver,
may I caII you that?

493
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,715
You know our circIe.

494
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:51,596
You shouIdn't have done it.
I hate to meddIe in your affairs.

495
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,231
It'II be difficult to get
back to. . .

496
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,199
My pIace in the Iine?

497
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,030
The queue wasn't too Iong.

498
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,916
CouId you wait for me
by the tabIe?

499
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,797
I'm pIeased.

500
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,073
Dieter!

501
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,390
Did you know, that not Iong ago,

502
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,390
I considered you the greatest
taIent in the worId? Not onIy I.

503
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,314
If it wasn't for that
unfortunate competition...

504
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,551
Remember?

505
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,872
I took away your victory
in Warsaw.

506
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,239
What?

507
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,157
You know professor JakowIew?

508
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,312
After the second round
of eIiminations

509
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,436
he approached me with
a proposition.

510
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,273
I wouId Iend him one point,

511
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,835
in exchange for two in some
other competition.

512
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,316
I don't understand.

513
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,509
A simpIe favor.

514
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,198
I subtract a point from his
pupiI's most dangerous adversary.

515
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,957
Then, in the future
he wiII return the favor.

516
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:56,353
- That's absurd. It's impossibIe.
- You must reaIize,

517
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,995
that aII artistic competitions
are fiction.

518
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,158
Think about it.

519
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,039
How can you measure
and compare

520
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,192
the immeasurabIe
and incomparabIe?

521
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:18,077
Competition is a vioIation
of art. It feeds on it.

522
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:25,671
The ruIes of chivaIrous
rivaIry are a charade.

523
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,278
Those courtesies,

524
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,672
or vuIgar swindIes,

525
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,474
are an every-day affair.

526
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,877
I understand your feeIings.

527
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,914
StiII, I reaIize that you must
return because you're exceptionaI.

528
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,515
The newspapers caIIed him
,,the big Iooser''.

529
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,398
The jury?

530
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,358
Of course, they cheated him.

531
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,471
OIiver said something...

532
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,875
that sounded pretty naive
and sentimentaI -

533
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,994
that the prize didn't matter...

534
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,875
but onIy the music...

535
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,989
and those who Iove it.

536
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,675
OIIie! Are you asIeep?

537
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,398
- OIIie?
- No.

538
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,112
CIose your eyes.

539
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,071
What do you hear?

540
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,273
I don't know.

541
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,431
That's the sound...

542
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,712
of 25 thousand Euros!

543
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,632
OIIie I did it!

544
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,032
- I figured it out aII by myseIf!
- You see, that's what I toId you!

545
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,156
AII the favored horses Iost.

546
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,512
I got Iucky outsiders three times.
Three times!

547
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,115
Now onIy Ruten has to win

548
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,999
and I think I'II go to those
god-dammed States.

549
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,952
Pack your things.

550
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,995
Now?

551
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:53,119
Now the gentIemen are
changing hoteIs,

552
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,033
because they can afford it!

553
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,195
It's beautifuI.

554
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,278
For your wife?

555
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,314
No,

556
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,233
for Mom.

557
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,838
Very nice.

558
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,640
Why didn't you buy anything?

559
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:12,668
What couId I say to my grown up
son whom I never met?

560
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,875
Son, I bought you
a shiny watch?

561
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,758
If I was him, I'd kick my
ass off the stairs.

562
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,399
So you're not going?

563
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,597
I don't know.

564
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,514
Frank,

565
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,836
Iet's get whisky.

566
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,911
She hired ''mechanic''.

567
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,920
- A mechanic.
- What?

568
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,118
She hired a mechanic.

569
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,478
Then what?

570
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,593
Nothing.

571
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,718
A few days Iater we went
back to the States.

572
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,557
You didn't try to Iive
your own Iife.

573
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,709
I'II take a waIk. Ok?

574
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,352
OnIy you and I wiII know

575
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:58,516
that you were truIy great
on the day of your demise.

576
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,554
Perhaps it's just a whim?

577
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:32,950
Or perhaps it just amuses me
to appaII the music worId.

578
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,551
I'm afraid you have
no choice, OIiver.

579
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,758
Where were you?
You were gone a Iong time.

580
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,875
- Did those professors Ieave?
- Yes.

581
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,191
I did it differentIy.

582
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,868
I thought we were waiting
for Ruten.

583
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,758
- I aIready pIayed him.
- For how much?

584
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,239
Come, come!

585
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,230
I pIayed for everything
we had.

586
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,598
For 25 thousand Euros
at 7 different bookies.

587
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,592
Different combinations.

588
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,159
In each Ruten is in first pIace.

589
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,270
Exacta, trifecta and win.

590
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,431
For every exacta they pay
out 1 00 to 1 .

591
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,230
For a trifecta
- 700 even 800 to 1 .

592
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,996
And we got that multipIied by 1 000.
Got that?

593
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,112
For every 1 00,
we get 1 00 thousand.

594
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,317
For every 700,800 times 1 000.

595
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,597
At the track you can win
onIy what's in the pooI.

596
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,512
1 00 thousand maximum.

597
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,038
But the money at the bookies
is separate from the pooI?

598
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,679
That's the whoIe point.

599
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,798
OIIie,

600
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,948
we can win a fortune!

601
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,273
Even a miIIion.

602
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,953
- MiI..?
- Quiet.

603
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,356
MiIIion Euros.

604
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,956
With one condition.

605
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,189
Ruten has to be first.

606
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,916
And if he's second?

607
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,870
That's not an option.

608
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,077
We Ioose.

609
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,392
Are you asIeep?

610
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,991
I can't sIeep.

611
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,714
BeautifuI rain, huh?

612
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,119
Ruten must be getting
impatient.

613
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,152
OIIie! We're screwed!

614
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,348
Shit!

615
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,988
- What?!
- It's aII gone!

616
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,479
What?! How?!

617
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,632
Ruten is finished!
He has breathing probIems. Fuck!

618
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:20,232
But. . .

619
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,311
- How much money do you have Ieft?!
- A thousand, maybe.

620
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,995
Give it to me!
We have to hedge out bets.

621
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,319
- The race has started!
- Fuck!

622
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,355
Ruten won!

623
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,353
You hear! Come one!
Come one!

624
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,993
HeIp!

625
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,710
Frank wake up!

626
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:29,635
After winning he'd aIways
bring money for the poor kids.

627
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,148
He wanted to buiId
a daycare center,

628
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,709
ever since the city shut
its down.

629
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,193
He pretty much avoided church.

630
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,311
He said that he didn't
need a middIeman to taIk to God.

631
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,392
Now we can start.

632
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,993
RafaI!

633
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,231
Did you know that Frank
was twice imprisoned?

634
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,393
First time during the StaIinist
era for his American passport.

635
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:03,035
The communists considered
him a spy.

636
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,589
Then during the 80's
martiaI Iaw he got arrested

637
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,194
for the distribution
of banned Iiterature.

638
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,229
After that his famiIy in
America stopped taIking to him.

639
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,030
- Did you know about that?
- I just don't know why.

640
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,236
It's hard to say.

641
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,149
My guess is out of ignorance.

642
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,034
They didn't understand
the situation.

643
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,197
Your hand!

644
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,151
Hand, OIIie!

645
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,832
Fix it.

646
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,397
''If you're reading this,

647
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,790
it means that we've missed
each other.

648
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,356
I'm returning to Poland.

649
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,678
For ever.

650
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,798
I wanted to do so for
a long time

651
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,554
but I didn't have enough
courage until now.

652
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:28,955
Your disappearance and broken
off tour thought me something.

653
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:34,999
I understood that you need
time to find yourself, despite me.

654
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:39,191
Be happy, however you want''.

655
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:58,159
- Come on, guys!
- Frank is back!

656
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,236
See you soon.
