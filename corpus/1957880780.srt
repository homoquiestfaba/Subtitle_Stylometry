00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,499
Oh she's the Annie Oakley of
the 80s.

520
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:03,457
You never heard of her?

521
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,540
[Mike] Dude it's the 80s. I
haven't even heard

522
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,080
of the Annie Oakley of whenever
Annie Oakley was.

523
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,371
My nephew and that lazy manager
of hers is handling her.

524
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:13,910
Yeah but you know they do a lot
of low rent stuff.

525
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,868
Perform for a supermarket.

526
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,617
Department store grand
openings.

527
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,617
You know what those things are
like?

528
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:22,241
[Kevin] You know. River
dredging, hospice dedications,
orphanage closings.

529
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,115
She could hit the big time.

530
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,240
She's a fantastic lady Peter.

531
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,531
And she handles a gun like
nobody I've ever seen.

532
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,029
Well, it sounds like old Alex

533
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,736
should have us over for dinner
tonight huh?

534
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:34,069
Definitely.

535
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:34,860
I will on one condition.

536
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,401
[Mike] Both of you agree to not
actually come.

537
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:41,275
Are you gonna find pigs big
enough for this rig you're
carrying?

538
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:44,815
It's big enough for the loch
ness monster.

539
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:47,439
This is just for casting
practice.

540
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,230
[Kevin] I wish the producers of
this movie

541
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,645
had a little more casting
practice.

542
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,187
I want to do real good in it.

543
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,186
I'll be back in a minute.
Alright.

544
00:24:55,186 --> 00:25:01,682
[Bill] Oh listen. I'm switching
to a denim mumu.

545
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:03,183
Why don't you just show him how

546
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,973
you hang those big ones Peter?

547
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:06,473
Okay. Watch this.

548
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,888
Never misses. Buffalo Bill with
a fishing rod.

549
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:10,555
[Mike] Yeah remember in 1985
when all the

550
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:14,178
cool kids were referencing 19th
century frontier showmen?

551
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:18,135
You better be glad you didn't
get no skin off my hiney.

552
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:19,842
I'd sure take some of yours.

553
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:22,383
Maybe you should show Jesse
Jamison how

554
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:24,174
you handle that rod of yours
Peter?

555
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:26,631
[Kevin] Just to clarify. I'm
making reference to your penis.

556
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:30,671
An organ used for sex, which I
have totally had a lot of.

557
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:34,920
Alex why don't take these two
turds with ya.

558
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,503
[Bill] Take some of mine too. I
have many turds.

559
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,793
A surfeit of turds.

560
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:43,375
I beg you Alex. Too many turds.

561
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,874
Let's do it.

562
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:47,915
Hey Jay! Would you like to go
along with us up to

563
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:51,206
the creek for a little fun and
relaxation?

564
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,829
Me? Alone with you two?

565
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:55,370
[Kevin] Ha ha ha. It's well
understood in this community

566
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,827
that they're sexual predators.

567
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,993
Why don't you come along and we
can take all our clothes off?

568
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:02,700
I think I'll be safer if I stay
here, and keep my clothes on.

569
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,698
[Bill] Ah, my wedding night.
That goes for my wife.

570
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,448
No time for partying.

571
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,198
You boys leave her alone.

572
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:12,654
Anyway I have to work.

573
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,362
So, maybe next time.

574
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:16,320
Okay, maybe next time.

575
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,236
Wow yes ma'am.

576
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:18,943
MAYBE!

577
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,651
[Mike] She and the farmer
should pose for the

578
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:23,858
best version of American Gothic
ever.

579
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:25,358
Anytime.

580
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:27,857
Wow. Yes ma'am.
Okay see ya!

581
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:32,397
[Kevin] And the scene enters
its 53rd incomprehensible
minute.

582
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,313
Might as well just be me and
you.

583
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:36,728
Drink a few beers and go
fishing?

584
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,519
(indistinct)

585
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,559
They're silly.

586
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,768
(screaming)

587
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,641
[Bill] Shoeless Joe Jackson?

588
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:50,098
Probably not.

589
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:55,096
[Mike] Hmm. No I'm sorry. Based
on the headshots,

590
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:57,845
the best I can do is a Lash
Larue movie.

591
00:26:57,845 --> 00:26:59,552
Interesting portfolio Miss
Jamison.

592
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,551
Very interesting.

593
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:04,009
You present your credentials
quite well.

594
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,883
[Kevin] But I'm afraid we don't
need our tables lengthened. Ha
ha.

595
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:10,049
Nevertheless I've always felt
that gun shows

596
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:11,090
and things of that sort,

597
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,506
are about as exciting as a
bowel movement.

598
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,505
[Bill] And I've had some
thrillers!

599
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:18,129
No. I've never compared
entertainment

600
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:19,794
to a bodily function before.

601
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:22,127
[Mike] Besides Adam Sandler
movies.

602
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,502
Comes in here.

603
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:25,834
What I'm saying is, that acts

604
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:29,540
like gun shows, just do not
have punch.

605
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,040
[Kevin] Have you considered
adding an old guy with a whip?

606
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,456
Style.

607
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,621
You know what i'm saying.

608
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,537
I only know you're not talking
about my show.

609
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:41,327
The Diamond Booking Agency
needs acts with class.

610
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,993
[Bill] Have I mentioned I
rarely wear pants?

611
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:47,575
Besides mill towns and county
fairs.

612
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:50,074
We book acts and talent for
some of the most

613
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:52,115
prestigious social events in
the country.

614
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:56,779
[Mike] We're doing the grave
digger monster truck's bar
mitzvah.

615
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:59,528
That's why I'm here.
Of course.

616
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:02,111
And you know it takes a great
deal of

617
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,985
skillful and well schooled
talent to fill

618
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,817
the needs and demands of our
clientele.

619
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:09,358
[Kevin] I take meetings just to
berate people.

620
00:28:09,358 --> 00:28:11,857
Provide entertainment for all
types of occasions.

621
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,065
Sounds like you need me.

622
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:14,814
We need people with something
special.

623
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:18,397
People who can take something
as dated and dull as a gun

624
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,271
show, and turn it into a.

625
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,977
[Bill] A rodeo where a monkey
rides a dog. (Kevin laughs)

626
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:25,852
A momentous event.

627
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:27,101
A momentous event?

628
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:29,350
Now you're talking about my
show.

629
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,307
Oh? Really?

630
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:32,765
Oh yes.

631
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:33,848
A momentous event?

632
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:35,931
[Mike] Are they still talking
about bowel movements?

633
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,680
Yes Mrs. Diamond.

634
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,722
Your gun show?

635
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:41,138
A momentous event.
A momentous event?

636
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:44,219
[Kevin] Okay someone hit the
movie. It's stuck. (Bill
laughs)

637
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,719
Not exactly what I hear.

638
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,343
But it's pretty close.

639
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:50,050
And if what my talent scout and
advisers

640
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,716
are telling me is true Miss
Jamison.

641
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:56,132
[Bill] You're wanted for felony
destruction of property at a
motel.

642
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:57,714
With us.

643
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:00,046
With the help of the Diamond
Booking Agency.

644
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,753
[Mike] Where I work as a
secretary.

645
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:05,794
You can have not only the best
gun show on earth.

646
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:09,834
But the greatest gun show the
earth has ever seen.

647
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,916
We ARE that big.

648
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,207
[Kevin] Despite our office
being

649
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:16,249
in a middle school teacher's
lounge.

650
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:18,331
With the help of Diamond
Booking, you will never

651
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:23,454
have to play one of those
backwoods performances again.

652
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:27,618
♪ ♪

653
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:30,534
♪ ♪

654
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,908
Whoo! Whoo!

655
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:36,116
[Mike] I can't wait until that
gun show comes to our backwoods
town.

656
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,906
Wait, she did what?

657
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:41,030
Oh I did myself again! We're
back to nature!

658
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,696
Give me one of those beers.

659
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:44,945
[Kevin] Oh even the fishing
trips in Brokeback Mountain

660
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:48,403
didn't involve stripping off
your clothes this quickly.

661
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:50,818
Where's that beer at?

662
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:53,109
I'm coming! I'm coming!

663
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:54,108
Here.

664
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:55,400
Cool that boy off a little bit.

665
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,522
[Bill] Actual depiction of the
Budweiser canning process.

666
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:00,689
You already look like a lunatic.

667
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:04,312
Oh! Kiss my shorts brother!
We're in the country!

668
00:30:04,312 --> 00:30:07,144
Come on! It's time to let loose
and have a little bit of fun!

669
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:10,185
[Mike] This is the son that
Snuffy Smith

670
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,475
and Louisie don't talk about.

671
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:14,183
What the hell's wrong with you?

672
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,556
Not this Garbo. What's wrong
with you? I came out here to
get loose!

673
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:18,889
Enjoy myself. Have a little
fun!

674
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,306
Well tighten up.

675
00:30:20,306 --> 00:30:21,264
I came out here to relax.

676
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,845
[Kevin] He didn't question the
rifle until right now?

677
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:25,762
It's a jungle man. Wild beasts!

678
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,261
Hungry predators! Here!

679
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,052
Come on! Fire a few rounds!

680
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:31,385
Loosen up a little bit.

681
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,967
Come on, kill some animals.
Enjoy yourself!

682
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,966
[Bill] That's how Michael Vick
greets his house guests.

683
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:40,256
I don't feel like making a fool
out of myself today.

684
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,880
Okay Andrew? I came out here

685
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,046
with the need to get a little
relaxation.

686
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:45,462
[Mike] One of these guys is
gonna smeegle

687
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:48,420
the other one by the end of
this trip.

688
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,127
Alright?

689
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:53,917
Man, you're already getting
dull.

690
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,125

show, will be

865
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,826
stretched beyond your
imagination.

866
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:12,950
[Bill] Like I could shoot at a
watermelon?

867
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,074
[Mike] Let's not go nuts.

868
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:19,489
(horn honks)

869
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,031
[Kevin] The Diamond booking
agency.

870
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:24,487
Enjoy our views of the good
part of downtown.

871
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:25,653
Okay Mrs. Diamond.

872
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:29,818
After this week, no more
backwoods performances.

873
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,942
[Bill] Uh Jesse the thing where
you leave a room,

874
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,483
take a long walk, then continue
a conversation.

875
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,065
You're doing it again honey.

876
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,523
Oh, Jesse.

877
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:41,106
I was wondering when you were
gonna come back.

878
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:42,605
[Mike] Yeah you appear to be
deep

879
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,270
in contemplative thought.

880
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,520
Two more days, Wes isn't here
yet.

881
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,227
Looks like we'll be going to
Alex's place after all.

882
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,059
[Kevin] Alex just felt a chill
run down his spine.

883
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:54,516
Maid came in and wanted to
clean up.

884
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:56,974
I told her not to bother. I
needed to sleep.

885
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:59,223
After, working like I did last
night.

886
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:02,680
[Bill] This is usually right
behind Coffee is for Closers

887
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,471
on those greatest film
monologues lists.

888
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:06,595
Looks like we're gonna be
buying a new door Jesse.

889
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:11,178
[Mike] Aw. Hate it when my back
hair

890
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:13,093
melds with my bed sores.

891
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,176
Time and energy I spent last
night,

892
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,591
and that agent's secretary
turns out to be a real loser.

893
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:19,965
[Kevin] On an unrelated note,
mind getting me

894
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:23,131
some white castle to eat
shirtless in bed?

895
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,629
After you left.

896
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,795
Said she couldn't talk her boss
into booking us.

897
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,587
Not even for one single show.

898
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:29,961
God that burns me up.

899
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:32,960
[Bill] Like the firey VD that's
already burning my genitals.

900
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,542
You know it's amazing how some
people

901
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,167
abuse their little bit of
power.

902
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,790
[Mike] Like how I pose as
Hacksaw Jim Duggan

903
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,831
to get free oil changes.

904
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,456
Being abused by young girls.

905
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:45,455
You know what I mean Jesse.

906
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:46,662
Yes I do Frank.

907
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:48,495
I know exactly what you mean.

908
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:50,619
[Kevin] And I'm trying really
hard not to picture it.

909
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,161
Absolutely nothing booked after
this week.

910
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,951
And the reason for that is you
have no discipline.

911
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:56,408
The only time you ever manage
to get

912
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:58,200
anything booked at all is by
pure luck.

913

[Bill] Well don't forget his
raw hear suit sensuality.

914
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:03,781
Impress some gullible young
girl

915
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,321
and get her into bed with you.

916
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,072
Well I'm tired of it.

917
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:08,821
[Kevin] I feel queesier every
time they say "young girl".

918
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:10,278

1212
00:51:55,788 --> 00:51:58,829
[Mike] And why didn't you crawl
in with me?

1213
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:00,202
Said something about a sheriff

1214
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:02,410
taking a woman out of Wes'
cabin?

1215
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,535
It was close to midnight.

1216
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:05,492
But I'm afraid you're not gonna
be very happy

1217
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:07,491

did.

1218
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,116
What did you do?

1219
00:52:08,116 --> 00:52:09,740
[Kevin] Tried to get out of
this movie.

1220
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,574
Missing our dinner engagement.

1221
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:13,156
Last night, I asked the sheriff
to find Wes for me.

1222
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:14,864
What's so wrong about that?

1223
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,029
You needed to find your show.

1224
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:18,070
Besides, Peter and Andrew never
showed up.

1225
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,486

before. Pretty bad.

1226
00:52:20,486 --> 00:52:22,444
[Bill] Yeah yeah. You're a bad
cook.

1227
00:52:22,444 --> 00:52:25,234

whip lying around huh?

1228
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:29,482
Well when they find Wes I'm
gonna fire him.

1229
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:30,482

1234
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:40,728
I was disappointed because as
an intelligent young lady

1235
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:42,769

long time ago.

1262
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,779
Now why would he stop and camp
so close to his cabin?

1263
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:06,111
Wes is completely
irresponsible.

1264
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:08,693
[Mike] And he loves proximity
camping!

1265
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:10,484

car.

1266

were made.

What's going on? The place is
like a booby trap!

With strings and pots and pans.

1416
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:42,619
You'll have to forgive my
paranoia Alex.

1417
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:45,076
[Mike] But get out! Get out!
Get out!

1418
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:46,908
Have to sleep without some kind
of alarm.

1419
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:49,449
Well where did you get the idea
for this?

1420
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,740
From an old western movie?

1421
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,447
[Bill] Yeah Gene Autry would
always string up pots before
bed.

1422

I've got a show tomorrow.

1423

Jesse do you think you can do a
show

1424
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,487
with most of your guns stolen?

1425
01:01:00,487 --> 01:01:01,611
I'd better be able to.

1426
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:03,527
The Diamond Agency people will
be

1427
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:04,817
watching me very carefully.

1428
01:01:04,817 --> 01:01:07,816
[Kevin] I learned all my lines,
and now I am acting them.

1429
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:10,815
And if I don't come through and
look really god,

1430
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:13,565
I'm afraid they'll go back to
Mrs. Diamond.

1431
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:15,730
And there goes my star studded
contract.

1432
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,605
Well Jesse if there's anything
you can use in my store,

1433
01:01:18,605 --> 01:01:21,062
you're more than welcome to it.

1434
01:01:21,062 --> 01:01:22,019
Thank you Alex.

1435
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:23,186
[Mike] Sounds less like dialog
and more like

1436
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:26,227
a chain restaurant assistant
manager interview.

1437
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:27,892
That thing couldn't breathe
when

1438
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,308
Peter broke the tank tube.

1439
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:31,723
Peter thinks they're from
another world.

1440
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:33,265
From another world?

1441
01:01:33,265 --> 01:01:34,889
[Bill] Heard that from a soap
opera.

1442
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:37,347
Do you realize how far advanced
a person would have to

1443
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:39,679
be in order to come in from
outer space?

1444
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,719
[Kevin] We're talking junior
college level, minimum.

1445
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:45,968
It would be so barbaric and
terrible

1446
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,509
as the thing that attacked you.

1447
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:50,217
If the human race is any
example Alex,

1448
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:51,840
then I think it's quite
rational.

1449
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,382
[Mike] Hmm. Yep. I'm sure
there's a lesson

1450
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:55,756
in that for all of us, if I
knew what

1451
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:58,047
the HELL they were talking
about.

1452
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:03,711
[Bill] Back after this word for
Lash Larue custom hernia
trusses.

1453
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:06,418
(indistinct)

1454
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:08,917
[Kevin] Quick stop at Brad
Wessley's place.

1455
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:11,707
Have a bloody Mary. Some
breakfast perhaps.

1456
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:15,248
Oh hell I forgot.

1457
01:02:15,248 --> 01:02:16,581
Damn truck.

1458
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:21,495
[Mike] Wilford Brimley shouts
"diabetes!" from the bushes.

1459
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:27,410
[Bill] (laughs) This man is
truly a gift to us here at
RiffTrax.

1460
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,659
Thank you, this guy.

1461
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,575
Oh!

1462
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:35,865
[Kevin] Oh! Didn't notice your
titanic mass right in front of
me.

1463
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:38,448
Are you looking for Alex?
Yeah is he home?

1464
01:02:38,448 --> 01:02:40,322
Yeah. Go on in.

1465
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,070
(Luger stutters)

1466
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,778
[Mike] This isn't just social
awkwardness.

1467
01:02:43,778 --> 01:02:47,735
He creates his own gravity
field.

1468
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:48,942
(sounds of cans)

1469
01:02:48,942 --> 01:02:54,773
What in the hell is going on
around here?

1470
01:02:54,773 --> 01:02:56,731
[Bill] More importantly, what
the hell

1471
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,315
was HE doing in HER bedroom?

1472
01:02:58,315 --> 01:03:03,646
But if any of those outlaws
come around, we'd have sure
heard them.

1473
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,894
[Kevin] You know he probably
shouldn't drink before lunch.

1474
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:09,767
[Bill] (stutters indistinctly)

1475
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:12,100
Your name is Luger?

1476
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,974
Well it sure as hell ain't.

1477
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,265
[Mike]Yep.
It sure as hell ain't bread
fruit.

1478
01:03:17,265 --> 01:03:19,181
[Bill] He's got us there.

1479
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:20,930
You gotta go this way.

1480
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,513
I wonder if Mr. Stud came back
last night?

1481
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:25,137
He wouldn't come here.
Why not?

1482
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:28,719
Whenever he gets loose, he goes
to George's filling station.

1483
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,384
They feed him like he was an
elephant down there.

1484
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:34,425
[Bill] Now back to strangling
junior samples here.

1485
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:37,840
Well I think I'll check on him
before I leave.

1486
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,423
He won't be there.

1487
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,671
He likes George's food a lot
better than he likes mine.

1488
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:43,920
By the way, did you finish
breakfast?

1489
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,712
Sure did. It was awful.

1490
01:03:45,712 --> 01:03:49,043
[Kevin] Ah come on. Who doesn't
like gin waffles?

1491
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:52,251
Oh hell hold still!

1492
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:58,499
[Mike] Even the bald nobbers
scratch their heads and say
"what the hell?"

1493
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:01,913
(birds chirping)

1494
01:04:01,913 --> 01:04:05,454
[Bill] Lash runs a brother's
keeper theme park.

1495
01:04:05,454 --> 01:04:08,036
Mr. Stud?
Mr. Stud?

1496
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:11,951
[Kevin] Suddenly Wilt
Chamberlain pops out of the hay.

1497
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:13,243
He's not there right?

1498
01:04:13,243 --> 01:04:14,492
No he isn't.
Yeah I told you.

1499
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:18,990
[Mike] The horse refuses to
answer to MR. Stud

1500
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,780
ever since he got his
doctorate.

1501
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,946
(heavy breathing heard)

1502
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:26,363
[Kevin] Also the air takes her
for their sleep apnea?

1503
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:30,652
(growling)

1504
01:04:30,652 --> 01:04:35,692
[Bill] Oh yeah, that was a good
horse.

1505
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:39,065
Well Jesse?
Well Alex?

1506
01:04:39,065 --> 01:04:42,565
I can't say the last couple of
days have been fun.

1507
01:04:42,565 --> 01:04:44,605
[Mike] Or coherent. (Bill
laughs)

1508
01:04:44,605 --> 01:04:46,479
When things get back to normal
I hope you'll figure this

1509
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:49,727
a good place to spend a few
days once in a while.

1510
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:51,519
Oh I'm sure that I will Alex.

1511
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:53,976
[Kevin] And I'd love to see
that sporting goods store you
OWN sometime!

1512
01:04:53,976 --> 01:04:58,392
Having guilt feelings about
what those monsters are doing
are ya?

1513
01:04:58,392 --> 01:04:59,516
Aw only a little.

1514
01:04:59,516 --> 01:05:02,598
[Bill] Guilt feelings. Also
known as guilt.

1515
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,097
Listen young lady your career
is important.

1516
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:09,220
You're not the police, and it's
not your responsibility

1517
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,803
to go around looking for
hobgoblins.

1518
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:14,343
[Mike] The hobgoblins just
murdered my nephew.

1519
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,260
Ha ha ha. We have fun.

1520
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:18,675
Work out my credit problem not
to learn some new self defense
technique.

1521
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:21,673
Well we were just stringing you
up a little bit Luger.

1522
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:23,048
You sure did look funny!
(laughter)

1523
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:27,963
[Kevin] I laughed so hard the
left side of my body is still
numb! Ha ha ha!

1524
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:32,919
Now Jesse drive slow.

1525
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:38,501
[Bill] Helvetica drunk is a
registered font for the Jesse
Jamison gun show.

1526
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,542
Be sure and give me a call.

1527
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:42,040
I'd like to know if Mr. Stud
got in all right.

1528
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Sure thing Alex.

1529
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,039
[Mike] Unfortunately the only
thing Mr. Stud

1530
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,496
got into was Richie Tennenbaum
headbands.

1531
01:05:52,994 --> 01:05:59,534
[Kevin] Wonder if the organic
fertilizer tastes as good as
the synthetic?

1532
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,614
[Bill] If it weren't for
approaching cars interrupting
him,

1533
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:08,239
God knows how many things he'd
eat from the ground.

1534
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,403
Hey cow girl!
Hi!

1535
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:16,319
[Mike] Ya'll got dibs on that
corn nut in your tire treads?

1536
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:20,567
Have you been eating candy?

1537
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:23,525
Uh, candy.

1538
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,940
[Kevin] Never ask this guy what
he's been eating,

1539
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,022
wearing, or sleeping underneath.

1540
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:32,062
Do you know what this is?

1541
01:06:32,062 --> 01:06:36,061
[Bill] A question that guy asks
his doctor weekly.

1542
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:36,976
It's a motor ma'am.

1543
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,601
Do you know what's wrong with
