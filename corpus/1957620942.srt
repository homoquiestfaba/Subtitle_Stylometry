- [man] Yeah, it's all ours.

00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,417
[man] Leave the door open.
The others are right behind us.

- [child] They're always so slow!
- [man] Always slow.

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,355
Yeah, by car, Mom.

15
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,402
Do you ever try and see things
from someone else's perspective?

16
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,883
Holy shit!

17
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,060
Yeah, it's pretty impressive!

18
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,107
No. Holy shit! It's so ugly.

22
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:24,046
- The dust is back.
- I'll get a vacuum.

23
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,353
Steve, I wanna show you
your room. Come on.

24
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,846
A play room, cool!

25
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,153
- And you set up all my games.
- Just for you.

[deep rumbling]

27
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,949
I don't know why we have to keep all
these creepy paintings and old stuff.

28
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:00,691
Well, they came with the house.

29
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,954
We'll probably get rid
of most of it.

30
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,565
Here, this will cheer you up.

31
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,921
- [Mom] Stevie, come on.
- Coming!

32
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,405
[Steven] Yes! All our stuff!

33
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,973
- [sarcastic] Yay, belongings.
- I thought you'd be pleased.

34
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:25,107
- You know nothing about me, Mom.
- [Dad] Ellie.

35
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,023
You might like this room.
Follow me.

36
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,462
Come on.

37
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,992
You know, when I was a kid,

38
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,864
I would have loved to have
lived in a place like this.

39
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,178
What's in there?

40
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:56,965
That's the cellar.

42
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,324
Why don't you check it out?

43
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,251
It's filthy.

44
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,515
[Mom] I like to think of it
as character.

45
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,346
[Dad] Yeah. Nothing to see here.

46
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,057
[rattling handle] Get me out!

47
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,843
There's something wrong
with the lock.

48
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,846
- C'mon, it's not funny.
- Hang on, Ellie.

49
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,195

- [Mom] OK, just wait. Calm down.

52
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,384
Get me out!

53
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,343
Brian, there's a key.
Over there, there's a key.

54
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,650
- C'mon! Mom!
- We've got the key.

55
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:16,044
- Just a minute.
- Get me out!

56
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,833
- Hang on.
- Please, c'mon!

57
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,444
Mom!

58
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,449
Get me out!

59
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,800
Get me out!

60
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,240
- I'm done here.
- Ellie.

61
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,590
- I'm not staying in this house!
- [Brian] That's weird.

[knock on door, door opens]

63
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,269
You OK?
Can I come in?

64
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,453
Hm...

65
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,023
Listen, I wanted to ask
your opinion about something.

66
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,681
What does this
make you think of?

67
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,469
Absolutely nothing.

68
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,297
But do they look like
they're having fun?

69
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,128
They look like
brainwashed sheep.

70
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,913
C'mon, Mom, don't you have focus
groups for this sort of thing?

71
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,307
[sighs] Well, I wanted
your perspective.

72
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,137
- I hate your job, Mom.
- OK. [sighs]

73
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,315
Listen, I need you to watch
Steven tonight.

74
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:56,144
We have to go into the office,
but we won't be late, I promise.

75
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,147
So, you're leaving us here
on our first night?

76
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,019
Come on, Ellie.
This one's a big deal.

77
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,370
This one's important, OK?

78
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,677
Fine.

79
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,158
Thanks.

80
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,644
Why did we have to move here,
Mom?

81
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,126
I'm doing this for you guys.

82
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,302
- So that you have a better life.
- No, you're not.

83
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,566
You're doing it for yourself.

84
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,180

[fox barking, owls hooting]

88
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,636
- [man] Where are your parents?
- [Ellie] They're in work.

89
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,421
You're kidding?
You've just moved in.

90
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:00,164
Yeah, they've an important pitch
tomorrow.

91
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,558
She says they need it
to survive.

92
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,388
I hope they go bust
and we have to sell the house.

93
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,390
Come on, Ellie.
Maybe it won't be that bad.

94
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,002
I don't know.

95
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:16,528
I just miss everyone.
I miss you.

96
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,922
Why don't you come and hang out?

97
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:22,099
- I could come stay with you.
- [creaking]

98
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,841
- Yeah, why don't you?
- Just a minute.

99
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,757
- You OK?
- It's nothing.

100
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,367
[screams]

101
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:30,281
Ellie?

102
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,895
- Is everything OK? Ellie?
- I'm gonna kill you.

103
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,592
Ellie!

104
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:41,336
This is Sophie,
19-year-old vlogger, influencer.

105
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,556
She's living
a jet-set lifestyle.

106
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,384
Except she's not.

107
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,952
She's an actress and we plan
to present her as a real vlogger

108
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,737
with a real-life narrative.

109
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,696
Now, these are some of the
initial ads which we will run

110
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,438
on all social media platforms
to support the video content.

111
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,312
You changed the colour
of her bracelet?

112
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,271
Oh, we thought it was too...

113
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,665
- [phone vibrating]
- Change it back.

114
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,320
- I can take it.
- [sighs] I got it.

115
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,717
Ellie, what's up?

116
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,719
- [video game playing]
- Mom, Steven keeps messing.

117
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,243
He won't stay in bed.

118
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,768
- [game] We're going in!
- [Mom] Put him on the phone.

119
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:25,641
- Hello?
- Steven, come on, behave.

120
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,643
- Or you'll be sorry for a week.
- OK.

121
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,646
[sighs]

122
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:34,824
So, the target audience is
pretty self-explanatory,

123
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,957
- 16 to 19-year-olds.
- What did I miss?

124
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,574
Where did you get this?

125
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,012
I found them in there.

126
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,710
What the...?

127
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,585
I've had it with this house.

128
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,981
Morgan from my class told me
the house was owned by a witch

129
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,157
who made a pact with the devil.

130
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,159
What? It's true!

131
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,729
What's that?

132
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,702

- Five...

142
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,689
- [switches off]
- That's enough.

143
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,215
- OK, bed.
- Ugh! [footsteps away]

144
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,397
[tense music on TV]

145
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:14,968
Naomi?

146
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,672
Naomi?

[deep rumbling]

148
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,073
[on TV] Hello?

00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,368
[tense music on TV]

150
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,460
Naomi?

00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,964
[electricity fizzing]

152
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,629
This demographic, teenage girls,
they respond well

153
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,805
to aspirational marketing
and social competition,

154
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,938
so can we create
a weekly vlogging chart

155
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,201
where vloggers compete
to receive the most likes?

156
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,203
Who's the prettiest?
Who gets the guy?

157
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,032
- Natural selection.
- Law of the jungle.

158
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:06,557
No, we call the competition
Natural Selection.

159
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,560
- Nice.
- [phone vibrating]

160
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,954
[sighs] Ellie!

161
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,522
Mom, all the lights
have gone out.

162
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,742
Are the wall sockets out, too?

163
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,529
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right.

164
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:24,227
We have to see if the power's
cut or if we've blown a fuse,

165
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,838
so I need you to go down
and check the circuit breaker,

166
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,840
see if any of the trip switches
are down.

167
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,842
I'm not going down
to that cellar.

168
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,149
I'm not kidding you.
I'm leaving now.

169
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,587
Ellie, can you just do this one
thing for Steven, if not for me?

170
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:39,025
What if he wakes up in the dark
and no one's there?

171
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,333
Fine.

172
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,292
Listen, I'll stay on the line
with you.

00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:02,048

00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,106
[door creaking]

177
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,816
Are you OK?

178
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:39,650
I can't see anything. I don't
know if I can do this, Mom.

179
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,957
I know you can do this.

180
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:47,615
Mom, I'm scared.
I'm sorry, I can't.

181
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:51,575
You know what I do when
I'm scared, to clear my mind?

182
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,273
- I count.
- Ah, no, not that, Mom.

183
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,579
No, listen, there's ten steps
to the bottom.

184
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,320
You counted them?

185
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,802
Would you just... Could you just
trust me for once?

186
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,981
- I'll try.
- Good.

187
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,592
Now, I want you to count each
step, can you do that?

188
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,465
- Yes.
- OK, just listen to my voice

189
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,249
and nothing else,
just focus on the counting.

190
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,816
Concentrate on that.

191
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,353
One.

192
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,443
- Good. Next step.
- [Ellie's trembling breaths]

193
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,055
- Two.
- OK, keep going.

194
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,625
- Three.
- [door creaks]

195
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,105
You're doing well.

196
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,889
That's great, OK? Four.

197
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,509
Four.

198
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,036
Four.

199
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,698
It's OK, it's fine.
Keep breathing.

200
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,265
Concentrate.

201
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,096
- Five.
- You're halfway there.

202
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,887
Six.

203
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,066
Just four more.

204
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,025
OK? Don't quit now.
You're doing great, Ellie.

205
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,723
Just keep counting.

206
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,073
Seven.

207
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,687
Eight.

208
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,211
Good.

209
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,087
Nine.

210
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,961
One more.

211
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,278
Ten.

212
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,803
You're at the bottom. Can you
see the pillar in front of you?

213
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,197
[dreamily] Eleven.

214
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:16,590
Twelve.

215
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,245
Thirteen.

216
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,421
Fourteen.

217
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,119
Fifteen.

218
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,991
Sixteen.

219
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,515
Seventeen.

220
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,952
Eighteen.

221
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,172
Nineteen.

222
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,609
Twenty.

223
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,002
Twenty-one.

224
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,179
Twenty-two.

225
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,833
Twenty-three.

226
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,314
Twenty-four.

227
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,536
Twenty-five. Twenty-six.

228
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,452
Twenty-seven.

229
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,671
Twenty-eight.

230
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,327
Twenty-nine. Thirty.

231
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:03,289
[Brian] Ellie?

232
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:06,292
- Ellie?
- Ellie!

233
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,091
She's not here.

234
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,010
[Steven] What's going on?

235
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,236
- [emergency radios chatter]
- Ellie!

236
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,674
Ellie!

237
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,853
Ellie!

238
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,210
Ellie!

239
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:59,519
- I think she's run away again.
- Right. She's done this before.

240
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,522
Yeah, she'll turn up after
a few days in a friend's house.

241
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,406
[whistle blows]

242
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,760
[whistle blows]

243
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,841
Why don't you go inside
and play?

244
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,157
[crying]

245
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,352
[sobbing]

246
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,619
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

247
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,458
She was right.

248
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,375
About what?

249
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,815
When she said I didn't know
who she was any more.

250
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,387
She's grown up
and we haven't even noticed.

251
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,478
No, she's still
a little girl to me.

252
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,655
There's no way she ran away.

253
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,573
She was angry, you know,
she's upset with us.

254
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,535
You didn't hear her voice.

255
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,757
Counting.

256
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,274
Hello?

257
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:56,756
Oh, I'm so sorry. I totally
forgot. I'll be right there.

258
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,082
I'm sorry, Steven.

259
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,520
I completely forgot.

260
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,349
[sighs] Did Ellie come back?

261
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,743
No.

262
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,353
Not yet.

263
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,287
[phones ringing,
hum of conversations]

264
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,463
[man] We've talked
to her friends.

265
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,770
We've pulled CCTV from
every bus and train station,

266
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,337
but no leads, unfortunately.

267
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,821
We've checked
her social media history

268
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:04,171
and there's a lot of harassment.

269
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,175
Quite nasty bullying.

270
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,090
Did she mention this to you?

271
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,530
No.

272
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,533
Well, don't worry,
she gave as good as she got.

273
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,364
She didn't run away.

274
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,497
Why do you say that?

275
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,674
Something happened
in the cellar.

276
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:30,850
I heard her voice, it was...

277
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,940
She didn't sound right.

278
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,248
Have you tracked her cell phone?

279
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:43,689
Er... Her phone pinged off
the Three Rock mast at 8.42pm.

280
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:47,562
That was me. I...
I talked to her.

281
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:52,611
Can't you just please
check the house again?

282
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:56,353
Where I last talked to her in
the cellar, for clues, anything.

283
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,878
I can come up and take a look
again, if you want.

284
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:01,402
What about specialists?
Forensics?

285
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,404
It's not a criminal case.

286
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:04,710
I'm really sorry.

287
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:45,751

297
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:29,098
Steven? Come here.

[ball clatters]

299
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:43,852
How was Ellie the night...
the last night?

300
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:45,680
The same as always.

301
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,206
Is there anything
that you forgot to tell us

302
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,817
or anything strange?

303
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,341
We played that.

304
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,566
Go on.

305
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,702
[typing]

306
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,875

[voices on two-way radio]

309
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,938
It's paint, plant-based

310
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,941
so the chlorophyll shows up
as red under the UV light.

311
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,813
It's very old. It's been there
since the '50s, maybe.

312
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,686
Do you know anything
about the house's history?

313
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,602
No, no.
We bought it at an auction.

314
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:35,518
House and contents -
got it for nothing.

315
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:38,913
Couldn't really turn down
that opportunity for the kids.

316
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:43,178
I think, um... Might have been
an elderly lady?

317
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:46,312
Who needed to make a quick sale
for nursing home costs?

318
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,358
Well, the team haven't found
anything else

319
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,404
that would give us
cause for concern.

320
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,190
I'm afraid that's all we can do
for tonight.

321
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,975
I'll follow up with you
in the morning.

322
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,110
I promise you
we're doing everything we can.

323
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:04,330
Thanks. I'll show you out.

God! Steven!

327
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:59,472
- What's the matter?
- I wet the bed.

328
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:04,303
It's OK. Come on.
Let's get you changed.

329
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,567
OK.

330
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,831
What happened to Ellie?

331
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,445
I don't know, Steven.

332
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,058
But whatever did happen to her,
I promise you

333
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,973
that we will do everything in
our power to get her back, OK?

334
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,671
- OK.
- OK.

336
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,893
Get some sleep.

337
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,989
Hey, this is Ellie.

338
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:42,689
I can't answer the phone
right now, I guess I'm away,

339
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:44,995
but I'll try and get back to you
as soon as I can.

340
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,346
- Probably when I'm home.

00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,151
Nineteen.

360
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,545
Twenty.

361
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,982
Twenty-one.

362
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,202
Twenty-two.

363
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,596
Twenty-three.

364
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,207
Twenty-four.

365
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,775
Twenty-five.

366
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:11,560
Twenty-six.

367
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,084
Twenty-seven.

368
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,478
Twenty-eight.

369
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,785
Twenty-nine.

370
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:21,396
Thirty.

371
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,659
Thirty-one.

372
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:26,096
Thirty-two.

373
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,751
Thirty-three.

374
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:31,754
- Thirty-four...
- [lifts latch]

375
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,756
Thirty-five.

376
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,236
Thirty-six.

377
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,369
- [door creaking]
- Thirty-seven.

378
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,676
Thirty-eight.

379
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,069
Thirty-nine.

380
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,638
Forty.

381
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,031
[counting stops]

382
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:53,994
[ball clattering]

383
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,563
[clattering continuing]

384
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,004
[clattering continues and fades]

385
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,357
[birds cawing]

386
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,922
- You been up all night?
- I couldn't sleep.

387
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:40,361
What is that? What does it mean?

388
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,320
Have you thought about it?

389
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,757
There's these symbols
above all the doors.

390
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:48,238
And they're different,
but they're similar, right?

391
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:51,590
And this... This is on the floor
in the cellar.

392
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:54,767
It's some kind
of mathematical equation.

393
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,944
We're going to get her back, K.
We are.

394
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,992
She was being bullied.

395
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,692
On her social media.

396
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,826
We didn't even notice.

397
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:16,136
It's because of me
they think she's a fraud.

398
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,312
They don't agree
with what she stands for

399
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,488
just cos she's different,
doesn't want to follow the pack.

400
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:23,404
- I swear, those bitches...
- I know, I know, hey.

401
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,406
All we can do is we support her,
OK?

402
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,800
But it makes sense,
why she ran away.

403
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:31,934
It does. I just wish
she could have talked to us.

404
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:35,111
I feel so useless. I want to do
something but I don't know what.

405
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,200
She's definitely coming back.

406
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,555
I'm going to have
to go in today.

407
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,688
Yeah, they loved the pitch.

408
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,995
The last thing we need
is the business going under

409
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,518
and us losing everything.

410
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,653
[phone ringing]

411
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,438
Rob Clayton.

412
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,875
Rob, it's Keira Woods
from the auction.

413
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:02,225
You'll have to be
a bit more specific, I'm afraid.

414
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:06,229
- We bought the XAÁOS property.
- Yes. What can I do for you?

415
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,014
We're having some problems
with the house.

416
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,450
I wondered if you had
any information

417
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,452
on the previous owner.

418
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:14,455
Not much. She's the daughter
of a well-known academic

419
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,457
who owned the house originally.

420
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:19,895
Do you have a name or a contact?

421
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,681
We only dealt
with her solicitor, I'm afraid.

422
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,814
- But leave it with me.
- OK, thank you.

423
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,033
[beep]

424
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,590
Erica, I need a favour.

425
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:07,726
- Shoot.
- I sent you an email.

426
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,467
Oh.

427
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:13,688
Can you find out what font
or language these are?

428
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,691
- And what they mean?
- Yeah, they look familiar.

429
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,650
- Leave it with me.
- Great.

430
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,218
We're talking about
target demographics,

431
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:25,134
16 to 19-year-olds with a focus
on leaving cert students...

432
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,919
Congratulations.

433
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:32,228
We just loved
your Natural Selection campaign.

434
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:33,708
Thank you.

435
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:36,102
We had a similar campaign
go viral last year

436
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,278
with the hashtag
"follow your heart".

437
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:40,498
A wonderful campaign.

438
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,283
We really like the simplicity
of the competition.

439
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:45,459
Simplicity is key.

440
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,593
I can't remember who said it,
and I am paraphrasing, but...

441
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:53,293
..the receptivity of the great
masses is very limited...

442
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,950
[distorting, echoing]
Their intelligence is small

443
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,822
but their power of forgetting
is enormous.

444
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:01,823
Nice.

445
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,479
Excuse me.

446
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,096
Hey, Keira.

447
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,664
It's Hebrew,
Hebrew glyphs, to be exact.

448
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,797
So, they don't mean anything
individually

449
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,147
but when I put them
in a certain order,

450
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,628
they spell "leviathan"?

451
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:26,631
Some sort of sea creature
in Jewish mythology.

452
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,417
Thanks.

453
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,815
[vehicle approaching]

454
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,831
[door slams]

455
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:57,444
- Where's Dad?
- He had to work late.

456
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,797
What happened to your face?
Let me see.

457
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:06,061
Morgan said Ellie was dead,
so I hit him and he hit me back.

458
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,125

Sum... Epsilon...

Partial One equals...

DY by DX...

467
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:51,776
One.

468
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,388
Two.

469
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:58,783
[Steven] Three.

470
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:02,482
Four.

471
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,702
Five.

472
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,705
Six.

473
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,142
Seven.

474
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,885
Eight.

475
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:18,324
Nine.

476
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:21,457
Ten.

477
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,372
Steven!

478
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,028
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

479
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,074
Why are you doing that?
Counting?

480
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,511
Was I?

481
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:34,906
I thought you were playing
your game.

482
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,299
Y-yeah.

483
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:38,605
OK.

484
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,961

[slams]

488
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,296
[Steven] Mom!

489
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:45,863
Steven.

490
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:49,649
Steven?

491
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,610
- Steven?
- Mom, help!

492
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:58,571
Steven.
What are you doing in there?

493
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:03,358
- Help, I'm stuck!
- Just a second. I'm right here.

494
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,015
Hang on a second.

495
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,888
Wait. Steven?

496
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,455
- Do you have the key?
- No.

497
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:16,110
- The lock is jammed.
- It's dark, Mom, I'm scared.

498
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,720
Hang on, I'm right here,
just outside.

499
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:19,897
Hang on.

500
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,732
Steven.

501
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,997
Steven!

502
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,521
Who are you talking to?

503
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:38,350
- Where were you?
- I fell asleep in the playroom.

504
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,483
- It's all right. OK.
- What's happening?

505
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:44,182
- I thought I heard something.
- [door rattles]

506
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,531
Shush.

507
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:49,535
- [creaking]
- Don't move.

508
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:56,934
[electricity fizzes]

509
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:30,271
- [flicking switch]
- [Steven] Mom.

510
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:33,927
[whispers] Stay there.

511
00:49:44,285 --> 00:49:45,765
Mom!

512
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,898
[Keira] Steven!

513
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:50,770
- Steven!
- It's stuck.

514
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:52,119
I can't get it open.

515
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:07,265
[door rattling, creaking]

516
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:14,402

[deep growl]

519
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,020
Steven!

520
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:27,502
Steven, try pulling on the door.

521
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:28,677
I am!

522
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,117
[Keira] The key!
What about the key?

523
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,254
I can't reach it.
I need to get a chair.

524
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:41,734
Hurry up!

525
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:47,914
Hurry up!

526
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,006
- That's it.
- [deep growling]

527
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:57,489
Steven! Hurry!

528
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:03,930
- [♪ sinister choral]
- I still can't get it to work.

529
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:23,341
- One, two, three...
- [growl, exhalation]

530
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:28,824
- Steve, what's up?
- Dad!

531
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,870
Mom's stuck
and I can't get her out.

532
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:34,178
Brian.

533
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:56,200
[Brian sighs]

534
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,942
He's asleep, finally.

535
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:03,598
What happened, K?

536
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:05,905
The lights went out
and I got stuck in the cellar.

537
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,430
There was something in there.

538
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,652
- Something?
- Yeah, I heard something.

539
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,570
It was in there with me.
A presence.

540
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,314
Take a look. I dropped my phone.
It fell down the steps.

541
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,186
It's not there any more.
It disappeared.

542
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,232
I'm sure your phone
is still there.

543
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,364
I also found out about the
family that used to live here.

544
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:32,323
The Fetherstons.

545
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,283
They all went missing, all
of them except their daughter.

546
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:40,592
Missing, Brian. Just like Ellie.

547
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:43,116
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I don't know!

548
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,074
I just know that our daughter is
missing and something very wrong

549
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:47,251
is happening in the place
that she disappeared.

550
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,560

I'm sorry,
I'm looking for Dr Fournet.

557
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:14,294
- Who are you?
- Keira Woods.

558
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:17,819
- I made an appointment with...
- What can I do for you?

559
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:19,430
Um...

560
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,312
Where did you get this?

561
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,401
I bought John Fetherston's
family home.

562
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,883
It was engraved on the floor
in the cellar.

563
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:47,240
"Delta point vector sum epsilon
partial I equals 1N DY by DX."

564
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:56,728
Call me Remi, please. I haven't
got used to this doctor thing.

565
00:54:56,771 --> 00:55:01,036
You see, I was in a car crash
and a bang to the head

566
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,909
changed the parts of my brain
we don't usually use

567
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:07,173
and...
well, now I'm a bloody genius!

568
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,439
How does that work?

569
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:15,224
Before the accident I could
barely add double numbers.

570
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,575
But afterwards,

571
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:20,752
I began to understand
the language of mathematics.

572
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:22,536
I began to see patterns
in everything

573
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,147
and somehow make sense
of the universe.

574
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:27,585
That's my magic trick.

575
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:30,065
I'm able to visualise
mathematical structures.

576
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:33,286
That's pi,
that's Hawking radiation

577
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,201
and that's a quantum star.

578
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:42,774
Who was he, Fetherston?

579
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:45,733
Well... You're standing
in his old office.

580
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:48,736
He was a colleague
of Erwin Schroödinger.

581
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,870
- Nobel Prize winner
- Cat in a box.

582
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,700
- Yes, the cat.
- Yeah, I never understood it.

583
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,094
It's simply his way
of illustrating

584
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:02,315
the misrepresentation
of having quantum particles

585
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,317
existing in two states.

586
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:10,454
The cat in the box
is either dead or alive.

587
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:13,935
We can't tell until we open
the box to observe it.

588
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:16,982
So, until we do so,
the cat is both dead and alive.

589
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:24,163
- I'm sorry, did I say something?
- No, no.

590
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:29,298
My daughter is missing, so...

591
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:30,996
I'm very sorry to hear that.

592
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:33,868
Please continue.

593
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:37,611
Well, Schroödinger came
to Ireland in the '40s

594
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:41,528
to escape the Nazis and work on
his unified field theory here.

595
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:45,445
Fetherston worked closely with
him until his son became ill

596
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,795
and he disappeared
from academic circles.

597
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,494
Completely disappeared? I mean,
does anyone know what happened to him?

598
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,060
No. It's a mystery.

599
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:54,367
He has a daughter, Rose,

600
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,630
who you must have purchased
the house from.

601
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,328
I don't think
she ever recovered.

602
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:01,679
Never really spoke
about what happened.

603
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,988
I can't visualise this yet but
at first glance, your problem,

604
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:10,557
your equation is definitely a
representation for a dimension.

605
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,559
Or dimensions.

606
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:14,169
There seems to be one variable

607
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,520
that's interchangeable
for each dimension.

608
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:19,131
It's incredibly complex, like
nothing I've ever seen before.

609
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,396
Can you leave it with me
and I'll come back to you?

610
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,311

Hello, Keira Woods.

615
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,699
Keira, it's Remi Fournet here.

616
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:08,223
- Is everything OK?
- Yes, why?

617
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,312
I called you a few times and...

618
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:13,446
Oh, you know, I lost my phone. I
just managed to replace it now.

619
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,144
That's strange.
Someone answered.

620
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:19,147
- What did they say?
- It was counting.

621
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:21,933
Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

622
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,458
I wasn't sure if you were OK
or what was going on.

623
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:28,374
- Keira?
- No, I'm OK.

624
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:31,159
I wanted to let you know

625
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,901
that I spoke to a colleague in
France about your equation.

626
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:36,643
He seems to think it's related
to a branch of mathematics

627
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,820
created by alchemists
in the 12th century.

628
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:42,431
He likened it to more
of an incomplete sequence

629
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:44,956
or an unfinished incantation.

630
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:48,612
It's a very peculiar sequence
and it does seem to refer

631
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:51,528
to dimensions,
but it's incomplete, as I said.

632
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,442
Sorry I can't be more help.

633
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,793
Well, thank you
for looking into it for me.

634
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,099
There is one other piece
of information.

635
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:00,275
My colleague has come across
a similar one

636
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,451
engraved in a house in Belgium.

637
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,671
An infamous house, actually,

638
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:08,196

vanished into thin air.

These are the engravings
above the door.

646

They're Hebrew.
They mean "leviathan".

647
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:01,249
Like I said, I don't know
what these triangles represent

648
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:03,817

they mean, look what it says.

01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,169

the place, called it XAÁOS,

the void before time, the abyss.

654
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:18,615

Keira in Greek means Dark Lord

656

- That's ridiculous!
- It also means dark-haired.

658

And about the cellar.

713
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:17,886
I know you've lost your family.
I know what that's like.

714
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,367
I've lost my daughter, so if
there's something that you know,

715
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:22,761
will you please, please tell me?

716
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,247
Leviathan!

717
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,465
Yes.

718
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:38,429
One of the seven
princes of hell.

719
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,651
What is it?

720
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,351
That isn't its name.

721
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:52,008
Whose name? Rose, tell me.

722
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:56,273
My father brought it
into our world.

723
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,580
Your father? He was a scientist.

724
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:03,497
He was, until my brother Jack
got sick

725
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,282
and science couldn't help him.

726
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,112
It's OK.

727
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,288
Please take your time.

728
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:16,989
Mathematics are supposed
to make sense of the universe,

729
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,513
to make order from chaos.

730
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:24,431
But all he succeeded in doing

731
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,825
was bringing darkness
into the world.

732
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:33,310
A darkness that has existed
since before the universe began.

733
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,009
Something ancient.

734
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:43,276
Something that has been known...
by many names.

735
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,105
Where is my daughter?
Is she still in the cellar?

736
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:49,587
It's not just the cellar.
It's the whole house!

737
01:08:41,943 --> 01:08:44,120
[phone ringing]

738
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,515
[Remi] Hello, Keira...
[line crackles]

739
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:50,082
One...

740
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:53,694

[line whistling, crackling]

741
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,392

743
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:02,633
[distant owl hoots]

744
01:10:06,724 --> 01:10:09,335
[drone whirring]

745
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,954
Hey.

746
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:21,695
Look at this.

747
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:28,180
These are the shapes
from over the doors, OK?

748
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:32,663
Five acute triangles.

749
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,317
And a pentagon.

750
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:38,886
OK, and there's more.

751
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,457
[stops whirring]

752
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:45,589
[beeping]

753
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:52,726
[Brian] Leviathan the sea
serpent is misdirection.

754
01:10:57,209 --> 01:11:00,256
These are the Hebrew glyphs
over the five points.

755
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:07,567
Look.

756
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,966
Baphomet.

757
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:19,492
It's some sort of demon

758
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:22,539
that the occultists and
the Knights Templar worshipped.

759
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:25,063
Some sort of gatekeeper
or soldier in hell.

760
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:33,158
- An ancient evil.
- Look, look at the fingers.

761
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:36,727
Just like in the painting.
And there.

762
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:41,297
[Keira] Solve Coagula?

763
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:44,822
This whole house has been
designed around it.

764
01:11:53,134 --> 01:11:54,962
[beep, whirring begins]

765
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:26,472
Schroödinger's cat.

766
01:12:26,516 --> 01:12:29,214
That's Ellie - neither dead
nor alive until we find her.

767
01:12:35,046 --> 01:12:37,004
[crackles]

768
01:12:37,962 --> 01:12:41,357
- Delta... Point vector...
- What's that?

769
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,750
Sum... Epsilon...

770
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:46,797
Partial One equals... 1N...

771
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:50,540

772
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:54,152
- One...
- One.

773
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:58,156
- Two.
- Two.

774
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,680
That's the mathematical equation
on the cellar floor.

775
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:02,682
I'm positive it's Fetherston.

776
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:05,381
- He's reading it out loud.
- But what does that mean?

777
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,732
- I think it opens the box.
- Seven...

778
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,865
Eight...

779
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:17,480
Nine...

780
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,311

- [Keira] Steven!

786
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,635
[Brian] Steven?

787
01:14:36,907 --> 01:14:38,343
Brian.

788
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,185
Check upstairs.

789
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:06,937
Steven?

790
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,700
He's gone.

791
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:36,532
[distant clattering]

792
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:44,888
[clattering approaching]

793
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:06,562
[Steven, faintly] Forty-one...
Forty-two...

794
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:11,001
- Forty-three... Forty-four...
- Shush.

795
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:14,004
Forty-five... Forty-six...

796
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,658
Do you hear that?

797
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,756
Steven!

798
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,196
Carry him, quickly.

799
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:45,818
- Take this off.
- [gasps]

800
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:49,082
He's so hot. Come on, Steven.
You're OK.

801
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:53,391
- What happened?
- Nothing. You're safe now.

802
01:16:55,219 --> 01:16:57,351
- I'm thirsty.
- I'll get him some water.

803
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,658
Tell me, Steven.
Did you see Ellie?

804
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:01,573
I don't know.

805
01:17:02,313 --> 01:17:04,707
- I can't remember.
- It's OK. I'm sorry.

806
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,668
You're so hot.

807
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:11,888
Here, let me take this off.
[gasps]

808
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:18,634
What is it?

809
01:17:20,287 --> 01:17:21,724
Nothing.

810
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:29,993
- I remember.
- What do you remember?

811
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:34,258
I rode the beast
with seven heads and ten horns.

812
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:41,526
Fifty... Forty-nine...

813
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:45,051
- Forty-eight...
- Brian!

814
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:46,836
Forty-seven... Forty-six...

815
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:50,274
Brian. Brian.

816
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:56,236
Forty-three... Forty-two...
Forty-one... Forty...

817
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,412

821
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:20,391
Please, Brian. Come back to me.
