00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:50,762
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

6
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:54,563
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

7
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:58,229
Although he had
everything his heart desired

8
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:03,334
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

9
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,777
But then, one winter's night

10
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:09,111
an old beggar woman
came to the castle

11
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,743
and offered him a single rose

12
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:15,516
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

13
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:18,182
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

14
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:23,094
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

15
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,260
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,393
for beauty is found within

17
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,996
and when he dismissed her again

18
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:35,007
the old woman's ugliness
melted away

19
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,771
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

20
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,303
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

21
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,044
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

22
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,781
and as punishment,
she transformed him

23
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,413
into a hideous beast

24
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:52,721
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

25
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,693
and all who lived there.

26
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,128
Ashamed of his monstrous form

27
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:00,691
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

28
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,794
with a magic mirror
as his only window

29
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,498
to the outside world.

30
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:10,669
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

31
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,441
which would bloom
until his 21st year.

32
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,314
lf he could learn
to love another

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,515
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

34
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,615
then the spell would be broken.

35
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:31,097
lf not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

36
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,065
( thunder crashing )

37
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,331
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,430
and lost all hope

39
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:44,706
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

40
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,247
( rooster crowing )

41
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,284
( birds twittering )

42
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:16,909
* Little town,
it's a quiet village *

43
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:21,710
* Every day
like the one before *

44
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:26,208
* Little town,
full of little people *

45
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:31,850
* Waking up... to... say... *

46
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:32,756
Bonjour!

47
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,656
Bonjour!

48
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,660
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

49
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:35,285
Bonjour!

50
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,955
* There goes the baker *

51
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,864
* With his tray like always *

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,097
* The same old bread
and rolls to sell *

53
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,967
* Every morning just the same *

54
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,529
* Since the morning
that we came *

55
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,267
* To this poor
provincial town... *

56
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,297
Good morning, Belle.

57
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,309
Good morning, Monsieur.

58
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:51,310
Where are you off to?

59
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,310
The bookshop.

60
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,540
l just finished
the most wonderful story

61
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,479
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

62
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:57,642
That's nice.

63
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:58,946
Marie! The baguettes.

64
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,509
Hurry up!

65
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:01,521
* Look, there she goes *

66
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,023
* The girl is strange,
no question *

67
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:07,493
* Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell? *

68
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,290
* Never part of any crowd *

69
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,194
* 'Cause her head's
up on some cloud *

70
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:15,167
* No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle *

71
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,361
* Bonjour *

72
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,370
* Good day *

73
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,133
* How is your family? *

74
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,139
* Bonjour *

75
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,162
* Good day *

76
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,072
* How is your wife? *

77
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,940
* l need six eggs *

78
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,445
* That's too expensive *

79
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,745
* There must be more
than this provincial life... *

80
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,274
-MAN:
Ah, Belle.
( bell jingles )

81
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,286
Good morning.

82
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,184
l've come to return
the book l borrowed.

83
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,188
Finished already?

84
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,416
Oh, l couldn't put it down.

85
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:38,481
Have you got anything new?

86
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,523
( chuckling )

87
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,684
Not since yesterday.

88
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,092
That's all right.

89
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,153
l'll borrow... this one.

90
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,255
That one?

91
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,697
But you've read it twice.

92
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,963
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

93
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,367
daring sword fights

94
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,234
magic spells, a
prince in disguise.

95
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:55,469
lf you like it
all that much, it's yours.

96
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,499
-But, sir...
-l insist.

97
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,543
Well, thank you.

98
00:04:58,645 --> 00:04:59,839
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,403
* Look, there she goes *

100
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,041
* That girl is so peculiar *

101
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:07,383
* l wonder
if she's feeling well *

102
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,183
* With a dreamy, far-off look *

103
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,951
* And her nose stuck in a book *

104
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:15,087
* What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle *

105
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:20,998
* Oh, isn't this amazing? *

106
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:30,466
* lt's my favorite part
because you'll see *

107
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,708
* Here's where she meets
Prince Charming *

108
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,481
* But she won't discover
that it's him *

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,921
* Till Chapter Three *

110
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,948
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

111
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:49,484
* Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty *

112
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,759
* Her looks have got
no parallel *

113
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,664
* But behind
that fair facade *

114
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,794
* l'm afraid
she's rather odd *

115
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,770
* Very different
from the rest of us *

116
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,636
GROUP:
* She's nothing like
the rest of us *

117
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:04,474
* Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle *

118
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,478
( gun fires )

119
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:09,277
( panting )

120
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,306
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

121
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,409
You're the greatest hunter

122
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,646
in the whole world.

123
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,314
l know.

124
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,323
No beast alive
stands a chance against you

125
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,291
and no girl,
for that matter.

126
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,292
lt's true, Lefou

127
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,726
and l've got my sights set
on that one.

128
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,491
LEFOU:
The inventor's daughter?

129
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:27,327
She's the one-- the lucky girl
l'm going to marry.

130
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,425
But, she...

131
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,765
The most beautiful girl in town.

132
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:30,929
l know, but...

133
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,733
That makes her the best

134
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,433
and don't l
deserve the best?

135
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,496
Well, of course.

136
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,768
l mean, you do, but...

137
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,041
* Right from the moment
when l met her, saw her *

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,180
* l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell *

139
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,980
* l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell *

140
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,976
* Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me *

141
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:52,047
* So, l'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle *

142
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,061
* Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy? *

143
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,156
* Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute *

144
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:02,861
* Be still, my heart,
l'm hardly breathing *

145
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:06,360
* He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute *

146
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,669
-* Bonjour * * Pardon *
-* Good day * * Mais oui *

147
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,642
-* You call this bacon? *
-* What lovely grapes *

148
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,269
-* Ten yards * * Some cheese *
-* 'Scuse me * * One pound *

149
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,312
* l'll get the knife *

150
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,313
* Please let me through *

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,404
* This bread * * Those fish *

152
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,437
* lt's stale * * They smell *

153
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,507
* Madame's mistaken *

154
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,812
* There must be more *

155
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:21,421
* Than this provincial life *

156
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:25,152
* Just watch, l'm going
to make Belle my wife *

157
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,158
* Look, there she goes *

158
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,854
* A girl who's strange
but special *

159
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:32,193
* A most peculiar mademoiselle *

160
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,756
* lt's a pity and a sin *

161
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,562
* She doesn't quite fit in *

162
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,363
* 'Cause she really is
a funny girl *

163
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,701
* A beauty but a funny girl *

164
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,733
* She really is a funny girl *

165
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,905
* That Belle... *

166
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,882
GASTON:
* Bonjour, bonjour. *

167
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,120
( song ends )

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,348
Hello, Belle.

169
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,083
Bonjour, Gaston.

170
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,250
Gaston,
may l have my book, please?

171
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,418
How can you read this?

172
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,552
There's no pictures.

173
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,653
Well, some people
use their imagination.

174
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,755
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

175
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:06,799
out of those books

176
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,562
and paid attention
to more important things...

177
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:10,728
like me.

178
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,567
( gasping and sighing )

179
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,106
The whole town's
talking about it.

180
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,166
lt's not right
for a woman to read.

181
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,974
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

182
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,536
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

183
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,173
( chuckling ):
Why, thank you, Belle.

184
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:24,478
What do you say you and me

185
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:25,984
take a walk over to the tavern

186
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,576
and take a look
at my trophies?

187
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,383
Maybe some other time.

188
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:30,548
What's wrong with her?

189
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,579
She's crazy.

190
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,148
He's gorgeous.

191
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,524
Please, Gaston, l can't.

192
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,791
l have to get home
to help my father.

193
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,830
Good-bye.

194
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,331
( laughing ):
That crazy old loon--

195
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,832
he needs all the
help he can get.

196
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,834
( laughing )

197
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,495
Don't talk about my father

198
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,434
that way.

199
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,166
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

200
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,902
My father is not crazy.

201
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:49,964
He's a genius.

202
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,943
( explosion and whistling )

203
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,410
( both laughing )

204
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:54,708
Ooh!

205
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,384
( man coughing )

206
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,685
( coughing ):
Papa?

207
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,192
How on earth did that happen?

208
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,694
Doggone it!

209
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,559
Are you all right, Papa?

210
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:14,363
l'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

211
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,197
You always say that.

212
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:17,396
l mean it this time.

213
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,369
l'll never get

214
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,736
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

215
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:21,899
Yes, you will

216
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,273
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

217
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,242
Humph!

218
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,213
And become
a world-famous inventor.

219
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,216
You really believe that?

220
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,774
l always have.

221
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:33,911
Well, what are we waiting for?

222
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,581
l'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

223
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,022
Hand me that, uh...

224
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,752
dog-legged clincher, there.

225
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,590
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

226
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,754
l got a new book.

227
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:48,233
Papa, do you think l'm odd?

228
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,529
My daughter? Odd?

229
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,470
Where would you get
an idea like that?

230
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,597
Oh, l don't know.

231
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,507
lt's just that l'm not sure
l fit in here.

232
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,976
There's no one
l can really talk to.

233
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,775
What about that Gaston?

234
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,542
He's a handsome fellow.

235
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:06,416
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

236
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,147
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

237
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,586
Well, don't you worry

238
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,557
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

239
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:14,025
of a new life for us.

240
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,618
l think that's done it.

241
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,527
Now, let's give it a try.

242
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,292
( whistle blowing )

243
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,594
( steam hissing )

244
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,931
( gears clanking )

245
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,237
( whirring )

246
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,043
lt works!

247
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,377
lt does?

248
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:36,575
( glass breaking )
-lt does!

249
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:37,583
You did it!

250
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,879
You really did it!

251
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,647
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

252
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,951
l'm off to the fair!

253
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,422
( grunting )

254
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:45,685
Good-bye, Papa.

255
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,123
Good luck.

256
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,288
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while l'm gone.

257
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,069
( nickers anxiously )

258
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,138
We should be there
by now.

259
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:10,240
( hooting )

260
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,444
Maybe we've missed
the turn.

261
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:14,385
l guess l should have taken...

262
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,853
Wait a minute.

263
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,957
( nickering )

264
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:22,291
Let's go this way.

265
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,296
( nickering )

266
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,890
( distant roaring )

267
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,662
( birds chirping )

268
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,007
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

269
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,531
We'll be there in no time.

270
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:52,680
( creatures calling )

271
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,284
( alarmed nickering )

272
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,886
This can't be right.

273
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,625
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

274
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,463
We'd better turn around.

275
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,901
( distant howling )

276
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,369
Whoa...

277
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,805
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

278
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,803
Oh...!

279
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,412
Oh, look out!

280
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:12,639
Oh, look out!

281
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,373
( screeching )

282
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,009
Whoa!

283
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,019
Whoa, boy!

284
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,886
Back up, back up, back up!

285
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,981
Good boy, good boy.

286
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:26,048
That's it.

287
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,116
Back up!

288
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,889
Steady, steady.

289
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:29,986
Now, steady.

290
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,360
( wolf howling )

291
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,386
( whinnying )

292
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,195
Philippe, no!

293
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,470
Philippe.

294
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:44,305
( thunder rumbling )

295
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:46,140
Oh...

296
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,040
( menacing growls )

297
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,212
( gasping )

298
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,550
( growling )

299
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:59,319
( wolf howling )

300
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:00,825
( growling )

301
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,828
( grunting )

302
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,354
( thunder crashing )

303
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,195
( menacing growl )

304
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,201
Help!

305
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,604
ls someone there?!

306
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,128
Help!

307
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,730
( growling )

308
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,213
Oh!

309
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,202
( crying out )

310
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,771
( wolves snarling )

311
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,751
( gasps )

312
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,457
( thunder crashing )

313
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,098
( creaking )

314
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,566
What...?

315
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:44,593
Oh...

316
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:45,934
( creaking )

317
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,333
( voice echoing ):
Hello?

318
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:53,935
Hello?

319
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,312
MALE 1 :
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

320
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,648
MALE 2:
Keep quiet; maybe
he'll go away.

321
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,949
ls someone there?

322
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:05,685
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

323
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,693
l don't mean to intrude,
but l've lost my horse

324
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,924
and l need a place to stay

325
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,022
for the night.

326
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,067
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

327
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,692
Shh!

328
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:17,700
( sizzling )

329
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:18,770
( yelping )

330
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,500
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

331
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,065
Who said that?

332
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,110
Over here.

333
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,406
Where?

334
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:27,343
Allo.

335
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,846
( gasps )

336
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:28,812
( grunts )

337
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,713
( groans )

338
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,545
lncredible.

339
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,281
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

340
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,380
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

341
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:38,856
How is this accomplished?

342
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,051
Put me down at once!

343
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,093
Stop that!

344
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,116
( giggling )

345
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,496
Stop that, l say.

346
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,464
( chuckling )

347
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,465
Ow!

348
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,557
( yelling )

349
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:51,597
Huh... Close that at once.

350
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,104
Do you mind?!

351
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,504
l-l beg your pardon.

352
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,475

( squeaking )

356
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,509
( sniffling )

357
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,679
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

358
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,847
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

359
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:11,890
Thank you.

360
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,152
COGSWORTH:
No, no, no.

361
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,525
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

362
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:20,328
l demand
that you stop right there.

363
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:21,567
Oh, no, no!

364
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,535
Not the master's chair.

365
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,127
( barking )

366
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,364

367
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:27,633
l am not seeing this!

368
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:32,235
( chuckling ):
Well, hello there, boy.

369
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,371
( friendly panting )

370
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:37,676
What service.

371
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,481
All right,
this has gone far enough.

372
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,009
l'm in charge here.

373
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,386
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

374
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:45,981
lt'll warm you up
in no time.

375
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,026
No. No tea.

376
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,357
No tea!

377
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,056
( giggling )

378
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,621
His mustache tickles, Mama.

379
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,633
Oh!

380
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,895
( chuckling )

381
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,061
Hello.

382
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,161
( ominous rumbling )

383
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,107
( clattering )

384
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,802
Uh-oh.

385
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,868
Oh...

386
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,683
( growling deeply )

387
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,581
Ah...

388
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:14,586
There's a stranger here.

389
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,110
Master, allow me to explain.

390
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,179
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

391
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,485
He was cold and wet...

392
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,390
( roaring thunderously )

393
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,895
Master, l'd like
to take this moment to say

394
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,863
l was against this
from the start.

395
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,092
lt was all his fault.

396
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,294
l tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

397
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,566
( roaring
thunderously )

398
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,332
( gasping )

399
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,399
Who are you?

400
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:38,671
What are you doing here?

401
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:41,179
l-l-l was lost in the woods,
and, and...

402
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,145
You're not welcome here!

403
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,241
l-l-l'm sorry.

404
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,444
What are you staring at?!

405
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,509
N-Nothing.

406
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,817
So, you've come to stare

407
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,220
at the Beast, have you?!

408
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,587
Please, l meant no harm!

409
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,490
l just needed
a place to stay.

410
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,427
l'll give you
a place to stay.

411
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,588
Oh, no...!

412
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,927
Please! Oh, no!

413
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:01,398
( door slams
with an echoing thud )

414
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,501
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

415
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,905
huh, Gaston?

416
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,569
Yep. This is her lucky day.

417
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,578
( thudding )

418
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:14,909
( Gaston clears throat )

419
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:18,007
l'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

420
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,712
But first l'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

421
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,721
( laughing )

422
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:23,720
( sobbing )

423
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,381
And you, Lefou--
now, when

424
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,948
Belle and l come
out that door...

425
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:27,958
Oh, l know, l know!

426
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,426
l-l strike up the band.

427
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,829
( playing ''Here Comes the Bride''
at fast tempo )

428
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:33,957
Not yet!

429
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,728
Sorry.

430
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,769
( knocking )

431
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,978
( groans )

432
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:48,274
Gaston.

433
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,076
What a pleasant surprise.

434
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,411
lsn't it, though?

435
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,577
l'm just full of surprises.

436
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,746
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

437
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,756
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

438
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,917
This is the day...

439
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,482
Hmm.

440
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:02,721
Yeah.

441
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,696
This is the day your
dreams come true.

442
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,924
This is the day your
dreams come true.

443
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:08,262
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

444
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,792
Plenty. Here, picture this:

445
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,896
A rustic hunting lodge

446
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:17,033
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

447
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:20,169
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

448
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,611
while the little ones

449
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,308
play on the floor
with the dogs.

450
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,543
We'll have six or seven.

451
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,447
Dogs?

452
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:26,451
No, Belle!

453
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,679
Strapping boys,
like me.

454
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,687
lmagine that.

455
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:29,688
And do you know

456
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,246
who that little
wife will be?

457
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,257
Let me think.

458
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,315
You, Belle.

459
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,519
Gaston, l'm...

460
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,857
l'm...

461
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,157
speechless.

462
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,687
l really don't
know what to say.

463
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:40,732
Say you'll marry me.

464
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,894
l'm very sorry,
Gaston, but...

465
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:44,936
but...

466
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,232
l just don't deserve you.

467
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,103
-Whoa!
-( water splashes )

468
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:51,871
( playing
''Here Comes the Bride'' )

469
00:18:58,684 --> 00:18:59,912
( pig oinks )

470
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,179
( squeals )

471
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,222
So, how'd it go?

472
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,655
( grunts )

473
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,023
l'll have Belle for my wife.

474
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,824
Make no mistake about that!

475
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:12,831
Touchy.

476
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:13,923
( snorting )

477
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,635
ls he gone?

478
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,835
( chickens clucking )

479
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,173
Can you imagine?

480
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,075
He asked me to marry him.

481
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,638
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

482
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,379
* Madame Gaston *

483
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,046
* Can't you just see it? *

484
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,553
* Madame Gaston *

485
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,920
* His little wife *

486
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,083
( clucking, bleating )

487
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,718
* No, sir, not me *

488
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,089
* l guarantee it *

489
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:46,723
* l want much more
than this provincial life *

490
00:19:55,908 --> 00:20:00,868
* l want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere *

491
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,609
* l want it more
than l can tell *

492
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,417
* And for once
it might be grand *

493
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,913
* To have someone understand *

494
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:19,625
* l want so much more
than they've got planned. *

495
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,536
( horse neighs )

496
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:24,764
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

497
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,236
Where's...?

498
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,364
Where's Papa?

499
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,770
Where is he, Philippe?

500
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,035
What happened?

501
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:31,440
Oh, we have to find him.

502
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,343
You have to take me to him.

503
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,349
( ominous music playing )

504
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,225
What is this place?

505
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,591
( snorting )

506
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:50,652
( neighing )

507
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:51,663
Philippe, please!

508
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:52,721
Steady!

509
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,323
( neighing continues )

510
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,697
Steady.

511
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:58,726
( gasps )

512
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:01,035
Papa.

513
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,974
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

514
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,307
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

515
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:07,869
Serve him tea.

516
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,437
Sit in the master's chair.

517
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:10,880
Pet the pooch.

518
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,884
l was trying
to be hospitable.

519
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:13,850
( door creaking )

520
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:15,444
( echoing ):
Hello?

521
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,354
ls anyone here?

522
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,121
Hello? Papa?

523
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,254
Papa?

524
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,423
Are you here?

525
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:29,467
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

526
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:32,868
Now, Chip, l'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

527
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,372
Really, Mama.
l saw her.

528
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,372
Not another word.

529
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,374
But...

530
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,375
lnto the tub.

531
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,376
Woop...

532
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,378
Well! l saw a girl
in the castle!

533
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,972
See? l told you.

534
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,983
lrresponsible,
devil-may-care

535
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:46,951
waxy-eared,
slack-jawed...

536
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:48,146
BELLE:
Papa?

537
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:50,854
Did you see that?

538
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,348
( gasps )

539
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,790
lt's a girl!

540
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,122
l know it's a girl.

541
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,059
Don't you see?

542
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,256
She's the one--

543
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:59,958
the girl we have
been waiting for.

544
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,398
She has come
to break the spell!

545
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,764
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

546
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:07,939
Papa?

547
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,235
( door creaks )

548
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,605
Papa?

549
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,672
Hello?

550
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,646
ls someone here?

551
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:17,012
Wait!

552
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,040
l'm looking for
my father. l...

553
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,680
That's funny.

554
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:26,680
l'm sure there was someone.

555
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,192
l-ls anyone here?

556
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,489
MAURlCE:
Belle?

557
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,529
Papa!

558
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,126
H-How did you find me?

559
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,690
Oh, your hands
are like ice.

560
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:36,860
( coughing )

561
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,301
l have to get
you out of there.

562
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,964
Belle, l want you
to leave this place.

563
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:41,097
Who's done this to you?

564
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,505
No time to explain.

565
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,508
You must go! Now!

566
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:44,564
l won't leave you!

567
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,110
What are you doing here?

568
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:47,110
Run, Belle!

569
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:48,773
Who's there?
Who are you?

570
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,475
The master of this castle.

571
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:51,345
( snarling )

572
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,146
l've come for my father.

573
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:54,584
Please let him out.

574
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:55,881
Can't you see he's sick?

575
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,014
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

576
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,581
But he could die.

577
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:00,955
Please, l-l'll do anything.

578
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,553
There's nothing you can do.

579
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:04,721
He's my prisoner.

580
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,298
Oh, there must be
some way l can...

581
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,390
Wait!

582
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,735
Take me instead.

583
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:18,538
You?!

584
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,578
You would...

585
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,045
take his place?

586
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,070
Belle, no!

587
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,083
You don't know
what you're doing!

588
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,278
lf l did,
would you let him go?

589
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:31,948
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

590
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,793
Come into the light.

591
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,562
( gasps )

592
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:48,765
No, Belle!

593
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,969
l won't let you do this!

594
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,571
You have my word.

595
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,614
Done!

596
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,639
( door unlocking )

597
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:01,584
No, Belle,
listen to me.

598
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,178
l'm old.
l've lived my life.

599
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,244
Wait.

600
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:04,982
Belle!

601
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:05,682
Wait!

602
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,420
No, please spare my daughter.

603
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:09,586
Please!

604
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:10,992
She's no longer
your concern.

605
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,121
( grunts )

606
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:13,563
Take him
to the village.

607
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,566
Let me out!

608
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,862
Please let me out!

609
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,630
Let me out!

610
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,467
Please! Oh, please!

611
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,964
( sobbing )

612
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,600
Master?

613
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,645
What?

614
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,147
Since the girl is going
to be with us

615
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,479
for quite some time

616
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,543
l was thinking that you
might want to offer her

617
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,247
a more comfortable room.

618
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,949
( fierce growling )

619
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,855
Then again, maybe not.

620
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,291
( sobbing )

621
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:45,262
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

622
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:47,288
l'll never see him
again.

623
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,460
l didn't get
to say good-bye.

624
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:52,333
l'll show you to your room.

625
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,770
My room?

626
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,239
But l thought...

627
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,299
You want to stay in the tower?

628
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,104
No.

629
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,303
Then follow me.

630
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,526
( gasping )

631
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:22,131
Say something to her.

632
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,192
Huh? Oh.

633
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,728
l, uh, hope you like it here.

634
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:32,902
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

635
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:34,276
except the west wing.

636
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:35,143
What's in the west...?

637
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,114
lt's forbidden!

638
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:45,322
Now, if you need anything

639
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,348
my servants will attend you.

640
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,859
Dinner.
lnvite her to dinner.

641
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,590
You will join me
for dinner.

642
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,722
That's not a request!

643
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,129
( door slams )

644
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,395
( gasping )

645
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:01,771
( sobbing )

646
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:10,043
( wind whistling )

647
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,850
GASTON:
Who does she think she is?

648
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:16,719
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

649
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,723
No one says no
to Gaston.

650
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,779
Darn right.

651
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,088
Dismissed, rejected...

652
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,617
publicly humiliated.

653
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:26,061
Why, it's more
than l can bear.

654
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,122
More beer?

655
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,097
What for?

656
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,430
Nothing helps.

657
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,730
l'm disgraced.

658
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:31,996
Who, you?

659
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,339
Never!

660
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,274
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

661
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,176
* Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston *

662
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:42,112
* Looking so down
in the dumps *

663
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,708
* Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston *

664
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:50,117
* Even when taking
your lumps *

665
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:53,056
* There's no man in town
as admired as you *

666
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:56,822
* You're everyone's
favorite guy *

667
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:59,965
* Everyone's awed and
inspired by you *

668
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:06,700
* And it's not very hard
to see why *

669
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,705
( women cooing )

670
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,708
* No... one's... *

671
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,209
* Slick as Gaston *

672
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,110
* No one's quick
as Gaston *

673
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:18,446
* No one's neck's as incredibly
thick as Gaston *

674
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:22,214
* For there's no man in town
half as manly *

675
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:24,722
* Perfect, a pure paragon *

676
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:28,214
* You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley *

677
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,727
* And they'll tell you
whose team *

678
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,388
* They prefer to be on *

679
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:33,453
Ooh!

680
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:37,696
* No... one's...
been like Gaston *

681
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:39,363
* A kingpin like Gaston *

682
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:41,406
* No one's got a full cleft *

683
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,964
* ln his chin
like Gaston *

684
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:46,739
* As a specimen, yes,
l'm intimidating *

685
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:49,906
* My, what a guy, that Gaston *

686
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,449
* Give five ''hurrahs!'' *

687
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,485
* Give 12 ''hip-hips!'' *

688
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:58,184
* Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips *

689
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:01,715
* No... one... *

690
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,193
* Fights like Gaston *

691
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,923
* Douses lights like Gaston *

692
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:08,228
* ln a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston *

693
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,497
* For there's no one
as burly and brawny *

694
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,903
* As you see,
l've got biceps to spare *

695
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,431
* Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny *

696
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,840
* That's right *

697
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:22,142
* And every last inch of me's
covered with hair *

698
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,477
* No one hits like Gaston *

699
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:24,948
* Matches wits like Gaston *

700
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:29,113
* ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston *

701
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:31,485
* l'm especially good
at expectorating *

702
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:32,455
* Ptooey! *

703
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:35,493
* Ten points for Gaston! *

704
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:36,926
* When l was a lad *

705
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,930
* l ate four dozen eggs *

706
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,058
* Every morning
to help me get large *

707
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:43,465
* And now
that l'm grown *

708
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,264
* l eat
five dozen eggs *

709
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:51,276
* So l'm roughly
the size of a barge *

710
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:54,540
* No... one... *

711
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,281
* Shoots like Gaston *

712
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,078
* Makes those beauts
like Gaston *

713
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,949
* Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston *

714
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:05,218
* l use antlers
in all of my decorating *

715
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:07,589
* My, what a guy *

716
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:12,120
* Gaston! *

717
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,164
( screaming )

718
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,896
( cheering )

719
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:17,903
Help!

720
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:18,835
Help!

721
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,734
Someone help me!

722
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:20,737
Maurice?

723
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,305
Please, please!

724
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:22,533
l need your help.

725
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,700
He's got her...

726
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:25,403
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

727
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:26,444
Who?

728
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,445
Belle. We must go.

729
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,447
N-Not a minute to lose.

730
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:30,538
Whoa!

731
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:31,844
Slow down, Maurice.

732
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:33,874
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

733
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,250
A beast!

734
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:37,915
A horrible, monstrous
beast.

735
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,550
( laughter )

736
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,687
ls it a big beast?

737
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:44,717
Huge!

738
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:46,253
With a long ugly snout?

739
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:47,390
Hideously ugly.

740
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,093
And sharp,
cruel fangs?

741
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,158
Yes, yes.

742
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:51,668
Will you help me?

743
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:52,761
All right,
old man.

744
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,168
We'll help you out.

745
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,173
You will?

746
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,274
Oh, thank you.

747
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,105
Thank you.
Thank you!

748
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:58,310
( grunting ):
Oh!

749
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,107
( grunting ):
Oh!

750
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:03,204
Crazy old Maurice.

751
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,306
He's always good
for a laugh.

752
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:09,376
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

753
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:13,380
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

754
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:17,486
* Lefou, l'm afraid
l've been thinking *

755
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:18,826
* A dangerous pastime... *

756
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,830
* l know *

757
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,492
* But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father *

758
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,299
* And his sanity's
only so-so *

759
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:28,829
* Now the wheels
in my head *

760
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,464
* Have been turning *

761
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,273
* Since l looked at
that loony old man *

762
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,247
* See, l promised myself *

763
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,374
* l'd be married to Belle *

764
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:41,374
* And right now,
l'm evolving a plan *

765
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,408
lf l...

766
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:43,443
( whispering )

767
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:44,455
LEFOU:
Yes?

768
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:45,513
Then we... ( whispering )

769
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:46,546
No! Would she...?

770
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,523
Guess!

771
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,617
Now l get it!

772
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,457
BOTH:
Let's go!

773
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:53,487
* No... one... *

774
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,159
* Plots like Gaston *

775
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,065
* Takes cheap shots
like Gaston *

776
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:00,128
* Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston *

777
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:05,666
TOWNSFOLK:
* So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating *

778
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,235
* My, what a guy! *

779
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,444
* Gaston! *

780
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:18,988
Will no one help me?

781
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,015
( wind whistling )

782
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,823
( sobbing )

783
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,194
( knock on door )

784
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,358
Who is it?

785
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,765
Mrs. Potts, dear.

786
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,830
l thought you might
like a spot of tea.

787
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,840
But you're... you're a...

788
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,169
Ooh!

789
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:38,174
Careful.

790
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:39,141
This is impossible.

791
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:40,678
l know it is.

792
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,543
But here we are.

793
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,277
l told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

794
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,683
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

795
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,743
Slowly now.

796
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,311
Don't spill.

797
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:51,982
Thank you.

798
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,685
Want to see me
do a trick?

799
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,852
( inhales )

800
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,088
MRS. POTTS:
Chip!

801
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,153
Oops. Sorry.

802
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,756
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

803
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,495
We all think so.

804
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,025
But l've lost my father

805
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,038
my dreams... everything.

806
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:08,664
Cheer up, child.

807
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,038
lt'll turn out

808
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,066
all right
in the end.

809
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,338
You'll see.

810
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:14,538
Oh, listen to me.

811
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,012
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

812
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:17,071
to get on the table.

813
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,083
Chip!

814
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:20,414
Bye.

815
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:23,080
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

816
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,612
Oh, let's see what l got
in my drawers.

817
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:28,182
Ooh! How embarrassing.

818
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,318
( nervous laughter )

819
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:30,350
( clears throat )

820
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,022
Ah, here we are.

821
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,496
You'll look ravishing

822
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:34,828
in this one.

823
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,457
That's very kind
of you, but...

824
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,069
l'm not going
to dinner.

825
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,697
Oh, but you must.

826
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:43,105
( sputtering )

827
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,008
Dinner is served.

828
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,103
( snarling )

829
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,841
What's taking so long?

830
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,746
l told her to come down.

831
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,080
Why isn't she here yet?

832
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,847
Oh, try to be
patient, sir.

833
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,717
The girl has
lost her father

834
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,882
and her freedom,
all in one day.

835
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,254
Master, have you thought

836
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:03,284
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

837
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:04,761
Of course l have.

838
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,127
l'm not a fool.

839
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:07,495
Good!

840
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:10,296
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

841
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,633
and poof!
The spell is broken.

842
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,639
We'll be human again
by midnight.

843
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:16,470
Ooh, it's not
that easy, Lumiere.

844
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,770
These things take time.

845
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,834
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

846
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,845
Oh, it's no use.

847
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:24,710
She's so beautiful, and l'm...

848
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:25,841
Well, look at me!

849
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,122
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

850
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,487
l don't know how.

851
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:33,855
Well, you can start

852
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,517
by making yourself
more presentable.

853
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,754
Straighten up.

854
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,490
Try to act like
a gentleman.

855
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,997
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

856
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:41,999
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

857
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,728
Come, come,
show me the smile.

858
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,698
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

859
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,467
lmpress her
with your rapier wit.

860
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,303
But be gentle.

861
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:51,832
Shower her
with compliments.

862
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:52,865
But be sincere.

863
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:53,878
And above all...

864
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:55,743
BOTH:
You must control your temper!

865
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,872
( doorknob rattling )

866
00:33:56,915 --> 00:34:00,018
Here she is!

867
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,645
Good evening.

868
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,789
Well, where is she?

869
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:05,778
Who? Oh.

870
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:06,813
( giggles )

871
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,324
The girl, yes.

872
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,588
The... girl.

873
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:12,824
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

874
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:16,492
Circumstances being
what they are...

875
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:18,058
She's not coming.

876
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:20,264
What?!

877
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,670
But, your grace...!

878
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,833
Your eminence!

879
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,933
( yelling )

880
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,414
l thought l told you
to come down to dinner!

881
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:31,779
BELLE:
l'm not hungry.

882
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,784
You come out, or l'll...

883
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,615
l'll... l'll break down
the door!

884
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:36,813
Master...

885
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,380
l could be wrong,
but that may not be

886
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:42,359
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

887
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:45,852
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

888
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:48,797
But she is being so difficult.

889
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,425
Gently, gently.

890
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,170
Will you come down to dinner?

891
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,399
No.

892
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,702
Hmm?

893
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:57,833
Ah, ah, ah!

894
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,138
Suave, genteel.

895
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:02,112
lt would give me
great pleasure

896
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:04,172
if you would join
me for dinner.

897
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:05,307
( clearing throat )

898
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,543
( mumbling ):
We say please.

899
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,142
Please.

900
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:08,982
No, thank you!

901
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,544
You can't stay in there forever!

902
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:11,919
Yes, l can.

903
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,653
Fine. Then go ahead
and starve!

904
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,957
lf she doesn't eat with me

905
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:20,521
then she doesn't eat at all.

906
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:21,554
( roaring )

907
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,499
( door slams )

908
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:25,002
Oh, dear.

909
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,871
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

910
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,635
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

911
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:31,505
and inform me at once

912
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:33,238
if there is
the slightest change.

913
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,211
You can count on me,
mon capitan.

914
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,680
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

915
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:40,707
and start cleaning up.

916
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:44,347
l ask nicely,
but she refuses.

917
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,152
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

918
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,321
Show me the girl.

919
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,028
Well, the master's
really not so bad

920
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,293
once you get
to know him.

921
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,027
Why don't you
give him a chance?

922
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,729
l don't want to
get to know him.

923
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,271
l don't want to
have anything

924
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,000
to do with him!

925
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,870
( groans )

926
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,967
l'm just fooling myself.

927
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:09,036
She'll never see me
as anything...

928
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:11,809
but a monster.

929
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,254
lt's hopeless.

930
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:36,599
GlRL:
Oh, no!

931
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,767
LUMlERE:
Oh, yes!

932
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:38,798
Oh, no!

933
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:40,037
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

934
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,375
l've been burned
by you before.

935
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:43,380
( chuckling )

936
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:44,642
( gasps )

937
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,043
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

938
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,285
Come on, Chip,
into the cupboard

939
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,027
with your brothers
and sisters.

940
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,585
( yawning )

941
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:59,459
But l'm not sleepy.

942
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:01,123
Yes, you are.

943
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,793
No, l'm not.

944
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,961
l work and l slave all
day long and for what?

945
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:09,097
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

946
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,368
Oh, stop your grousing.

947
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,399
lt's been a long night
for all of us.

948
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:15,344
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

949
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,143
After all,
he did say please.

950
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,149
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

951
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,707
he'll never break...

952
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,582
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

953
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,579
l am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

954
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:29,890
This is Lumiere.

955
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,156
Enchante, cherie.

956
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:33,663
lf there's...
Stop that!

957
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,131
...anything we...
Please!

958
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,657
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

959
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:38,691
Ow!

960
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,067
l am a little hungry.

961
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:41,071
You are?

962
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,766
Hear that?
She's hungry.

963
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,807
Stoke the fire.

964
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:44,569
Break out
the silver.

965
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:46,042
Wake the china.

966
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,602
Remember what the master said.

967
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,704
Oh, pishposh.

968
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:51,908
l'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

969
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:53,108
All right, fine.

970
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,914
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

971
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,422
Cogsworth, l am
surprised at you.

972
00:37:57,422 --> 00:38:00,118
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

973
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,285
We must make her
feel welcome here.

974
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,022
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

975
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,153
Well, keep it down.

976
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,187
lf the master finds out
about this

977
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,425
it will be
our necks.

978
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,798
Of course, of course.

979
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:13,633
But what is dinner
without a little music?

980
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,536
Music?

981
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,371
Ma chere
mademoiselle.

982
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:22,641
lt is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

983
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,773
that we welcome you tonight.

984
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,873
And now

985
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,349
we invite you
to relax.

986
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,716
Let us
pull up a chair

987
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:31,414
as the dining room
proudly presents...

988
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,447
your dinner.

989
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,821
* Be... our... guest *

990
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,295
* Be our guest *

991
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,322
* Put our service
to the test *

992
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,198
* Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie *

993
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,863
* And we provide the rest *

994
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,429
* Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres *

995
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:51,339
* Why, we only live
to serve *

996
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:52,775
* Try the gray stuff *

997
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,936
* lt's delicious *

998
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,242
* Don't believe me,
ask the dishes *

999
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,441
* They can sing,
they can dance *

1000
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:00,815
* After all, Miss,
this is France *

1001
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:04,879
* And a dinner here
is never second best *

1002
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,424
* Go on, unfold your menu *

1003
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,585
* Take a glance and then *

1004
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:10,628
* You'll be our guest *

1005
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:11,855
* Oui, our guest *

1006
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,887
* Be our guest *

1007
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,263
* Beef ragout,
cheese souffle *

1008
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,268
* Pie and pudding
en flambe *

1009
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,361
* We'll prepare and serve
with flair *

1010
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,532
* A culinary cabaret *

1011
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:24,768
* You're alone
and you're scared *

1012
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:26,901
* But the banquet's
all prepared *

1013
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,912
* No one's gloomy
or complaining *

1014
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:31,073
* While the flatware's
entertaining *

1015
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,310
* We tell jokes,
l do tricks *

1016
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:35,615
* With my fellow candlesticks *

1017
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:39,623
* And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet *

1018
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,716
* Come on and lift your glass *

1019
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,420
* You've won your own
free pass *

1020
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:44,553
* To be our guest-- *

1021
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,062
* lf you're stressed *

1022
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,224
* lt's fine dining
we suggest-- *

1023
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,632
* Be our guest,
be our guest *

1024
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,465
* Be our guest! *

1025
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:55,802
( mournfully ):
* Life is so unnerving *

1026
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:58,865
* For a servant
who's not serving *

1027
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,141
* He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon *

1028
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,943
Get off!

1029
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:07,484
-( sleigh bells jingling )
-* Ah, those good old days
when we were useful *

1030
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,042
Huh?

1031
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:11,078
* Suddenly, those good
old days are gone *

1032
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,955
( groans ):
Oh!

1033
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,959
* Ten years
we've been rusting *

1034
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,291
* Needing so much more
than dusting *

1035
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,354
* Needing exercise *

1036
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:21,956
* A chance
to use our skills *

1037
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,432
( howling )

1038
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:27,199
* Most days we just
lay around the castle *

1039
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,227
( grunting )

1040
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:29,739
* Flabby, fat and lazy *

1041
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,867
* You walked in
and oops-a-daisy! *

1042
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,774
* lt's a guest, it's a guest! *

1043
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,608
* Sakes alive,
well, l'll be blessed *

1044
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,671
* Wine's been poured, *
And thank the lord *

1045
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:39,614
* l've had the napkins
freshly pressed *

1046
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,982
* With dessert,
she'll want tea *

1047
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:43,576
* And, my dear,
that's fine with me *

1048
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,748
* While the cups
do their soft-shoeing *

1049
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:47,814
* l'll be bubbling,
l'll be brewing *

1050
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,622
* l'll get warm,
piping hot *

1051
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,753
* Heaven's sake,
is that a spot? *

1052
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,525
* Clean it up, we want
the company impressed *

1053
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:56,726
* We've got a lot to do *

1054
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:58,598
* ls it one lump or two? *

1055
00:40:58,636 --> 00:40:59,364
* For you, our guest *

1056
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:00,529
* She's our guest *

1057
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:01,799
* She's our guest *

1058
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:03,363
* She's our guest *

1059
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:06,069
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

1060
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,475
( screams )

1061
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,412
* lt's ten years since
we've had anybody here *

1062
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:10,436
* And we're obsessed *

1063
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,711
* With your meal,
with your ease *

1064
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,581
* Yes, indeed,
we aim to please *

1065
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,951
* While the candlelight's
still glowing *

1066
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:21,388
* Let us help you,
we'll keep going *

1067
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:25,623
* Course... by... course *

1068
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:27,722
* One by one *

1069
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,427
* Till you shout,
''Enough, l'm done!'' *

1070
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:34,802
* Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest *

1071
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,931
* Tonight you'll prop
your feet up *

1072
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,532
* But for now, let's eat up *

1073
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:42,706
* Be our guest,
be our guest *

1074
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,578
* Be our guest *

1075
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:53,080
* Please be our guest! *

1076
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,485
Bravo!

1077
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:57,858
That was wonderful.

1078
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:58,987
Thank you.

1079
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,191
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

1080
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:03,132
Good show, wasn't it?

1081
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes, everyone.

1082
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:07,934
My goodness, look at the time.

1083
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:09,870
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

1084
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:12,432
Oh, l couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

1085
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,501
lt's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

1086
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:15,603
Enchanted!

1087
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:16,635
( laughing )

1088
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,739
Who said anything

1089
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:19,647
about the castle
being enchanted?

1090
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,709
lt was you, wasn't it?

1091
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:23,515
l figured it out for myself.

1092
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:26,386
( grunting and groaning )

1093
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,654
l'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

1094
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,251
Oh, would you
like a tour?

1095
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:31,955
Wait a second,
wait a second.

1096
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:33,793
l'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

1097
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,163
We can't let her
go poking around

1098
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,226
in certain places, if
you know what l mean.

1099
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,737
Perhaps you'd like
to take me.

1100
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:42,170
l'm sure you know
everything

1101
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:43,969
there is to know
about the castle.

1102
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:46,977
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

1103
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:49,241
Yes, l do.

1104
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,440
As you can see

1105
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,348
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

1106
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:55,682
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

1107
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,883
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

1108
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,288
This is yet another example

1109
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,349
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

1110
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,758
and, as l always say

1111
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:05,955
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

1112
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,895
( chuckling )

1113
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,661
Uh, where was l?

1114
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,960
As you were.

1115
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,470
Now, then, if l may
draw your attention

1116
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,804
to the flying buttresses
above the...

1117
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:19,332
Uh, Mademoiselle?

1118
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,106
( barking )

1119
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:26,640
What's up there?

1120
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:27,651
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

1121
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:28,982
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

1122
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:30,383
in the west wing.

1123
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:32,412
Dusty, dull, very boring.

1124
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,981
Ah, so that's the west wing.

1125
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,789
Nice going.

1126
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,796
l wonder what
he's hiding up there?

1127
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,797
Hiding?

1128
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,298
The master is
hiding nothing.

1129
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,130
Then it wouldn't
be forbidden.

1130
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,602
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

1131
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,332
uh-uh, uh...
see something else.

1132
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:51,102
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

1133
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:52,131
maybe later.

1134
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:53,575
Th-The gardens or-or

1135
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:55,545
the-the-the-the
library, perhaps.

1136
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,807
You have a library?

1137
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,439
( laughs ):
Yes, oh, indeed.

1138
00:43:58,482 --> 00:43:59,574
With books.

1139
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:00,811
Scads of books!

1140
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:01,875
Mountains of books!

1141
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,908
Forests of books!

1142
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:03,943
-Cascades!
-Longboats!

1143
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:05,045
Swamps of books!

1144
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:06,954
COGSWORTH:
More books than you'll

1145
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:09,083
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

1146
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:11,617
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

1147
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:13,687
who ever set pen
to paper.

1148
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:33,383

1149
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,322

1152
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:07,015
Oh!

1153
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,747
( gasps )

1154
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:29,336

( snarling )

1159
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:54,721
Why did you come here?

1160
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:56,699
l'm... l'm sorry.

1161
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:59,362
l warned you never
to come here.

1162
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,597
l didn't mean any harm.

1163
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:03,368
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

1164
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,501
Please, stop.

1165
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,340
Get out!

1166
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:09,107
( gasping ):
No!

1167
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:13,082
( echoing ):
Get... out!

1168
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:25,754
Where are you going?

1169
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,093
Promise or no promise

1170
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,894
l can't stay here
another minute.

1171
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:31,265
Oh, no, wait,
please.

1172
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:32,394
Please wait.

1173
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,461
( neighing )

1174
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:49,449
( gasping )

1175
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,978
( snarling )

1176
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,893
( terrified neighing )

1177
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh!

1178
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:25,186
( screams )

1179
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:26,746

Oh!

( wind whistling )

1191
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,780
Here now.

1192
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:01,284
Oh, don't do that.

1193
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:02,945
( growling )

1194
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:07,388
Just hold still.

1195
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:08,721
( roaring )

1196
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:09,817
That hurts!

1197
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:11,827
lf you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1198
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:13,328
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1199
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:14,490
this wouldn't
have happened!

1200
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:17,591
lf you hadn't frightened me,
l wouldn't have run away!

1201
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,536
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1202
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:22,835
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1203
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:27,342
Now hold still.

1204
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,243
This might sting a little.

1205
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,338
Hmm?

1206
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:31,746
( groaning )

1207
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:35,081
By the way, thank you.

1208
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,019
For saving my life.

1209
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,386
You're welcome.

1210
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:52,202
l don't usually
leave the asylum

1211
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,861
in the middle
of the night

1212
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:57,067
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1213
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,233
( coins clinking )

1214
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:59,799
Ah.

1215
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:01,174
l'm listening.

1216
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:02,644
lt's like this.

1217
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,808
l've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1218
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,818
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1219
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,011
( snickering )

1220
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,214
Turned him down flat.

1221
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:14,018
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1222
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:15,025
He was in here tonight

1223
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,925
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1224
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:19,656
Maurice is harmless.

1225
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:22,359
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1226
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,799
to keep him
from being locked up.

1227
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:26,632
( laughs )

1228
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,908
Yeah. Even marry him.

1229
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,034
So you want me

1230
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,345
to throw her father
into the asylum

1231
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:37,075
unless she agrees
to marry you.

1232
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:39,411
Oh, that is despicable.

1233
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,747
( laughs )

1234
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:42,115
l love it!

1235
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,085
MAURlCE:
lf no one will help me

1236
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,817
then l'll go back alone.

1237
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,587
Yes, is that everything?

1238
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,457
l don't care
what it takes.

1239
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:53,986
l'll find that castle,
and somehow

1240
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:55,895
l'll get her out of there.

1241
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:57,867
( wind howling )

1242
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:01,602
( pounding )

1243
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:03,299
Belle? Maurice?

1244
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:04,306
Oh, well.

1245
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,308
( laughs )

1246
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:07,139
l guess it's not going
to work after all.

1247
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:09,645
They have to come
back sometime.

1248
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,275
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1249
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,681
Lefou...

1250
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:17,744
don't move
from that spot

1251
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:19,551
until Belle and
her father come home.

1252
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,785
But, but, l...

1253
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:23,156
( grunting )

1254
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:25,127
Aw, nuts.

1255
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:38,236
( barking )

1256
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,770
( laughing )

1257
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:52,355
l've never felt this way
about anyone.

1258
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,755
l want to do something for her.

1259
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,316
But what?

1260
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:58,452
Well, there's the usual things.

1261
00:51:58,495 --> 00:51:59,792
Flowers, chocolates.

1262
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,627
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1263
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,462
Ah, no, no.

1264
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,866
lt has to be something
very special.

1265
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:08,167
Something that sparks
her interest.

1266
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:09,467
Wait a minute!

1267
00:52:12,276 --> 00:52:16,235
Belle, there's something
l want to show you.

1268
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:20,340
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1269
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:23,943
lt's a surprise.

1270
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:29,481
( door creaks )

1271
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:36,622
Can l open them?

1272
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,658
No, no. Not yet.

1273
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:41,330
Wait here.

1274
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:46,975
Now can l open them?

1275
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,671
All right.

1276
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:49,940
Now.

1277
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,847
( gasps )

1278
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:01,023
l can't believe it!

1279
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:03,285
l've never seen
so many books in all my life!

1280
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,021
You-You like it?

1281
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:06,723
lt's wonderful!

1282
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:08,697
Then it's yours.

1283
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:10,632
Oh, thank you
so much.

1284
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,328
Oh, would you
look at that!

1285
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,370
l knew it would work.

1286
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:15,564
What?
What worked?

1287
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:18,336
lt's very
encouraging.

1288
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:20,035
lsn't this exciting?

1289
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:21,508
l didn't see anything.

1290
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:22,705
Come along, Chip.

1291
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,441
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1292
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:25,947
But what are
they talking about?

1293
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,314
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1294
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:36,848
( gasps )

1295
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:38,918
( slurping )

1296
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,700
( slurping )

1297
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:56,746
( giggling )

1298
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,790
BELLE:
* There's something sweet *

1299
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,494
* And almost kind *

1300
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:19,797
* But he was mean *

1301
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,134
* And he was coarse
and unrefined *

1302
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:26,164
* And now he's dear,
and so unsure *

1303
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:28,871
* l wonder why l didn't see it
there before *

1304
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,241
( birds chirping )

1305
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,691
BEAST:
* She glanced this way *

1306
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,253
* l thought l saw *

1307
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:48,889
* And when we touched *

1308
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:51,025
* She didn't shudder
at my paw *

1309
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,762
* No, it can't be *

1310
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,828
* l'll just ignore *

1311
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:58,864
* But then she's never looked
at me that way before *

1312
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:07,509
BELLE:
* New and a bit alarming *

1313
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:16,016
* Who'd have ever thought
that this could be? *

1314
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:22,862
* True that he's no
Prince Charming *

1315
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,459
* But there's something
in him *

1316
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:30,997
* That l simply didn't see... *

1317
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:32,200
* Well, who'd
have thought? *

1318
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:33,242
* Well, bless my soul *

1319
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:34,368
* Well, who'd
have known? *

1320
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:35,343
* Well, who indeed? *

1321
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:36,437
* And who'd
have guessed *

1322
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,947
* They'd come together
on their own? *

1323
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:38,913
* lt's so peculiar *

1324
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:39,916
* We'll wait and see *

1325
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,783
* A few days more *

1326
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:47,256
* There may be something there
that wasn't there before... *

1327
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,087
You know,
perhaps there is

1328
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:52,253
* Something there
that wasn't there before *

1329
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:54,024
What?

1330
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:57,533
* There may be something there
that wasn't there before. *

1331
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,125
What's there, Mama?

1332
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:00,533
Shh!

1333
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,197
l'll tell you
when you're older.

1334
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:04,240
( kisses )

1335
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:05,506
Right, then!

1336
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,339
You all know why we're here.

1337
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:10,904
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1338
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:12,846
to create the most magical

1339
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:15,613
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1340
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:16,914
( laughs )

1341
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:18,284
''Or beast...''

1342
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:20,915
( cricket chirping quietly )

1343
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,754
Right.

1344
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:24,226
Need l remind you

1345
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:27,890
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1346
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:29,125
the spell will never be...

1347
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,064
broken!

1348
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:32,568
Very well.

1349
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:34,593
You all know your assignments.

1350
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:36,538
Half of you to the west wing.

1351
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:38,438
Half of you to the east wing.

1352
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,500
The rest of you, come with me.

1353
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:44,073
( barking )

1354
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:45,081
( yells )

1355
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:46,548
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth

1356
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,551
and let nature take its course.

1357
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:51,281
lt's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1358
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:55,290
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1359
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:57,127
You know... a little.

1360
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:58,321
Besides, they must fall in love

1361
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,158
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1362
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,629
Ah, human again.

1363
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:03,189
Human again.

1364
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:06,258
Yes, think
what that means.

1365
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:09,169
( bells tolling )

1366
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,800
* l'll be cooking again *

1367
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:13,742
* Be good looking again *

1368
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:17,543
* With a mademoiselle
on each arm *

1369
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,243
* When l'm human again *

1370
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,978
* Only human again *

1371
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:25,476
* Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm *

1372
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:27,251
* l'll be courting again *

1373
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,224
* Chic and sporting again *

1374
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:32,228
* Which should cause
several husbands alarm *

1375
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:34,924
* Ha, ha!
l'll hop down off this shelf *

1376
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:36,830
* And tout de suite be myself *

1377
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:39,927
* l can't wait
to be human again *

1378
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:44,066
* When we're human again *

1379
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,938
* Only human again *

1380
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:48,877
* When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more *

1381
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:53,713
* When we're human again,
good and human again *

1382
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:56,309
* Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer? *

1383
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:58,354
* l'll wear lipstick and rouge *

1384
00:57:58,421 --> 00:57:59,718
* And l won't be so huge *

1385
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:03,385
* Why, l'll easily fit
through that door *

1386
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,291
* l'll exude savoir faire *

1387
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:07,330
* l'll wear gowns,
l'll have hair *

1388
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:10,458
* lt's my prayer
to be human again *

1389
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,230
( crashing )

1390
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:17,197
* When we're human again *

1391
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:19,139
* Only human again *

1392
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:22,475
* When the world once more
starts making sense *

1393
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:24,139
* l'll unwind, for a change *

1394
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:25,738
* Really? That'd be strange *

1395
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:29,047
* Can l help it
if l'm t-t-tense? *

1396
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:30,518
* ln a shack by the sea *

1397
00:58:30,554 --> 00:58:32,317
* l'll sit back, sipping tea *

1398
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,688
* Let my early
retirement commence *

1399
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:37,420
* Far from fools made of wax *

1400
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,157
* l'll get down to brass tacks
and relax! *

1401
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:44,962
* When l'm human again *

1402
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:48,459
* So sweep the dust
from the floor *

1403
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:52,032
* Let's let some light
in the room *

1404
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,734
* l can feel, l can tell *

1405
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:56,837
* Someone might break the spell
any day now *

1406
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,507
( barking )

1407
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:02,006
* Shine up the brass
on the door *

1408
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,918
* Alert the dust pail
and broom *

1409
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:06,980
* lf it all goes as planned *

1410
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:12,393
* Our time may be at hand
any day now *

1411
00:59:12,462 --> 00:59:15,795
* Open the shutters,
and let in some air *

1412
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:19,802
* Put these here,
and put those over there *

1413
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,271
* Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears *

1414
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:26,002
* And throw them away *

1415
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,771
( clears throat )

1416
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:34,878
* We'll be human again *

1417
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,079
* Only human again *

1418
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,782
* When the girl
finally sets us all free *

1419
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:42,383
* Cheeks a-blooming again *

1420
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:44,324
* We're assuming again *

1421
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:47,330
* We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre *

1422
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:48,524
* We'll be playing again *

1423
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:50,897
* Holidaying again *

1424
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:52,959
* And we're praying
it's ASAP *

1425
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:54,061
( cat snarls )

1426
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,105
* We will push, we will shove *

1427
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,070
* They will both fall in love *

1428
00:59:58,174 --> 01:00:01,974
* And we'll finally
be human again... *

1429
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,071
For never was a story
of more woe

1430
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:08,676
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1431
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:10,083
( sighs )

1432
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:12,621
Could you read it again?

1433
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,817
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1434
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:17,053
Uh, all right.

1435
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:19,960
Uh...

1436
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:22,089
Uh... l can't.

1437
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:24,828
You mean,
you never learned?

1438
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:27,098
l learned... a little.

1439
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,798
lt's just been so long.

1440
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,103
Well, here, l'll help you.

1441
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,732
Let's start here.

1442
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:36,507
Here.

1443
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:38,514
Okay, ''Twoe...''

1444
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:39,515
''Two.''

1445
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:41,676
''Two... l knew that.

1446
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:44,380
Two households...''

1447
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:48,481
* We'll be dancing again *

1448
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,186
* We'll be twirling again *

1449
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,752
* We'll be whirling around
with such ease *

1450
01:00:53,797 --> 01:00:55,128
* When we're human again *

1451
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,823
* Only human again *

1452
01:00:56,866 --> 01:01:00,529
* We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes *

1453
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,504
* We'll be floating again *

1454
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:03,801
* We'll be gliding again *

1455
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,503
* Stepping, striding
as fine as you please *

1456
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:10,877
* Like a real human does *

1457
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:14,441
* l'll be all that l was *

1458
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:19,011
* On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn *

1459
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:22,616
* And we're all *

1460
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:27,892
* Human again! *

1461
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:37,368
( sighing )

1462
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,568
( growls )

1463
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,579
Tonight is
the night.

1464
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:46,377
l'm not sure l can do this.

1465
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,041
You don't have time to be timid.

1466
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,314
You must be bold, daring.

1467
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:52,116
Bold, daring.

1468
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,289
There will be music...

1469
01:01:57,327 --> 01:01:59,693
romantic candlelight...

1470
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,697
provided by myself.

1471
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,221
And when the moment
is right

1472
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:05,062
you confess your love.

1473
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:07,069
Yes, l con...

1474
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,935
l-l... No, l can't.

1475
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:11,440
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1476
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,704
More than anything.

1477
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,472
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1478
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:18,878
Voila!

1479
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:21,281
Oh, you look so... so...

1480
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:23,251
Stupid.

1481
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:26,380
Not quite the word
l was looking for.

1482
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:28,447
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1483
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:30,858
( clearing throat )

1484
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:34,261
Your lady awaits.

1485
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:36,094
( chuckles )

1486
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,177
( clears throat )

1487
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:04,155
* Tale as old as time *

1488
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:08,358
* True as it can be *

1489
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,523
( barking )

1490
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,568
* Barely even friends *

1491
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:15,196
* Then somebody bends *

1492
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:17,136
* Unexpectedly *

1493
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:21,538
* Just a little change *

1494
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:27,309
* Small, to say the least *

1495
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:29,943
* Both a little scared *

1496
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:33,183
* Neither one prepared *

1497
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:35,953
* Beauty and the Beast *

1498
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,821
( gulps )

1499
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,727
* Ever just the same *

1500
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:46,461
* Ever a surprise *

1501
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:48,629
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1502
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:51,401
* Ever as before *

1503
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:53,840
* Ever just as sure *

1504
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:57,404
* As the sun will rise *

1505
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:03,648
* Tale as old as time *

1506
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,282
* Tune as old as song *

1507
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:11,521
* Bittersweet and strange *

1508
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:14,028
* Finding you can change *

1509
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:17,031
* Learning you were wrong *

1510
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:23,701
* Certain as the sun *

1511
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,641
* Rising in the east *

1512
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:28,906
* Tale as old as time *

1513
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:31,709
* Song as old as rhyme *

1514
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:34,774
* Beauty and the Beast *

1515
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,580
Shh!

1516
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,315
* Tale as old as time *

1517
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:45,555
* Song as old as rhyme *

1518
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:52,727
* Beauty and the Beast. *

1519
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:54,930
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1520
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,336
lt's past your bedtime.

1521
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:58,670
( yawns )

1522
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,108
Good night, love.

1523
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:13,853
( insects humming )

1524
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:28,025
Belle?

1525
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:31,665
Are you... happy
here with me?

1526
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:33,572
Yes.

1527
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:40,047
What is it?

1528
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,812
lf only l could see
my father again

1529
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,479
just for a moment.

1530
01:05:44,554 --> 01:05:45,919
l miss him so much.

1531
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:54,496
There is a way.

1532
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:58,223
This mirror will show
you anything...

1533
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:01,702
anything
you wish to see.

1534
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,569
l'd like to see
my father, please.

1535
01:06:09,212 --> 01:06:11,442
( coughs )

1536
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:12,674
Papa?

1537
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:13,943
Oh, no.

1538
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:16,281
He's sick.

1539
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,911
He may be dying

1540
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:19,922
and he's all alone.

1541
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:28,586
Then, you must go to him.

1542
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:29,927
What did you say?

1543
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:31,024
l release you.

1544
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,535
You are no longer my prisoner.

1545
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:34,968
You mean...

1546
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:36,164
l'm free?

1547
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,264
Yes.

1548
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:40,502
Oh, thank you.

1549
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,703
Hold on, Papa.

1550
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:45,009
l'm on my way.

1551
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:46,845
Take it with you

1552
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:51,320
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1553
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:53,151
and remember me.

1554
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:57,417
Thank you for
understanding

1555
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:58,790
how much he needs me.

1556
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,597
Well, Your Highness,
l must say

1557
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:12,197
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1558
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,435
l knew you had it in you.

1559
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:14,704
( laughs )

1560
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:16,244
l let her go.

1561
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:17,576
( chuckles )

1562
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:18,944
Yes, yes.

1563
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:20,005
Splen...

1564
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:23,017
You what?

1565
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:24,576
How could you do that?

1566
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:26,019
l had to.

1567
01:07:26,122 --> 01:07:27,111
Yes, but...

1568
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:28,123
( sputtering )

1569
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:29,021
Why?

1570
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:32,822
Because... l love her.

1571
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:34,352
ALL:
He did what?

1572
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,590
Yes.

1573
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:37,360
l'm afraid it's true.

1574
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,799
She's going away?

1575
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:40,894
But he was so close.

1576
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:42,666
After all this time

1577
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:45,435
he's finally learned to love.

1578
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:48,137
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1579
01:07:48,177 --> 01:07:49,735
But it's not enough.

1580
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:52,178
She has to love him
in return.

1581
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:55,548
COGSWORTH:
Now it's too late.

1582
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:57,883
( roaring )

1583
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:06,859
Papa! Papa!

1584
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,428
( gasping )

1585
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,971
Ooh.

1586
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:24,138
They're back.

1587
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:26,676
Belle?

1588
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,716
Shh.

1589
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:29,149
lt's all right, Papa.

1590
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,278
l'm home.

1591
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,514
l thought l'd never

1592
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:35,113
see you again.

1593
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:37,023
l missed you so much.

1594
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:38,025
but the Beast?

1595
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:40,028
Did you...
How did you escape?

1596
01:08:40,062 --> 01:08:41,359
l didn't escape, Papa.

1597
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:42,625
He let me go.

1598
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:44,029
That horrible beast?

1599
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:47,159
But he's different now, Papa.

1600
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:49,501
He's changed somehow.

1601
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:54,737
Hi.

1602
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:57,712
Oh. A stowaway.

1603
01:08:57,747 --> 01:09:01,183
Why, hello there, little fella.

1604
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:03,014
Didn't think
l'd see you again.

1605
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:04,542
Belle, why'd you go away?

1606
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,178
Don't you like us anymore?

1607
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:08,349
Oh, Chip, of course l do.

1608
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:09,722
lt's just...

1609
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:14,363
( knocking )

1610
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,557
May l help you?

1611
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:17,565
l've come to collect
your father.

1612
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,067
My father?

1613
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,069
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1614
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:23,298
We'll take good care of him.

1615
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:25,833
My father's not crazy.

1616
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,706
He was raving like a lunatic.

1617
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,574
We all heard him, didn't we?

1618
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:31,546
( all agreeing )

1619
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,072
No, l won't let you.

1620
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,082
Belle?

1621
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:37,779
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1622
01:09:37,854 --> 01:09:39,822
Just how big
was the beast?

1623
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:41,517
( chuckles )

1624
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:45,083
He was... l mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1625
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:46,889
l-l'd say
at least eight...

1626
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:48,328
No, more like ten feet.

1627
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:49,331
( laughing )

1628
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:53,426
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1629
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:54,697
( all laughing )

1630
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,931
lt's true, l tell you.

1631
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:58,907
Get him
out of here.

1632
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:00,272
Let go of me.

1633
01:10:00,309 --> 01:10:01,401
No!

1634
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:03,503
You can't do this.

1635
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:04,705
Poor Belle.

1636
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,214
lt's a shame
about your father.

1637
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,979
You know he's
not crazy, Gaston.

1638
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,919
Hmm, l might be able
to clear up this...

1639
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:13,683
little misunderstanding.

1640
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:14,814
lf...

1641
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:15,687
lf what?

1642
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,692
lf you marry me.

1643
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:18,694
What?

1644
01:10:18,728 --> 01:10:20,355
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1645
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:21,385
Never.

1646
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,057
Have it your way.

1647
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:23,928
Belle.

1648
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:27,159
Let go of me.

1649
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:28,670
My father's not crazy

1650
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:29,830
and l can prove it.

1651
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:32,101
Show me the Beast.

1652
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,335
( roaring )

1653
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:36,709
( crowd gasping )

1654
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:38,076
WOMAN:
ls it dangerous?

1655
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,945
Oh, no, no, he'd
never hurt anyone.

1656
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:43,417
Please, l know he looks vicious

1657
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,079
but he's really
kind and gentle.

1658
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:46,711
He's my friend.

1659
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:47,949
lf l didn't know better

1660
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,550
l'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1661
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:53,117
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1662
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:57,366
She's as crazy
as the old man.

1663
01:10:57,366 --> 01:11:00,733
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1664
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:01,667
-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

1665
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:02,671
We're not safe

1666
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:04,229
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1667
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:06,036
l say we kill the Beast!

1668
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:07,040
( cheering )

1669
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:08,906
* We're not safe
until he's dead *

1670
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:10,537
* He'll come stalking us
at night *

1671
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:12,478
* Set to sacrifice
our children *

1672
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:14,278
* To his monstrous appetite *

1673
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:16,148
* He'll wreak havoc
on our village *

1674
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:17,709
* lf we let him wander free *

1675
01:11:17,787 --> 01:11:21,450
* So it's time to take
some action, boys *

1676
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:26,621
* lt's time to follow me *

1677
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:28,323
( cheering )

1678
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:30,229
* Through the mist,
through the woods *

1679
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:32,063
* Through the darkness
and the shadows *

1680
01:11:32,168 --> 01:11:34,534
* lt's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride *

1681
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:38,005
* Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle *

1682
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,476
* And there's something
truly terrible inside *

1683
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,206
* lt's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones *

1684
01:11:44,246 --> 01:11:47,613
* Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast *

1685
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,618
* Hear him roar, see him foam *

1686
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:51,313
* But we're not coming home *

1687
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:52,787
* Till he's dead *

1688
01:11:52,822 --> 01:11:54,517
* Good and dead *

1689
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:55,649
* Kill the Beast! *

1690
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:57,283
No, l won't
let you do this.

1691
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:59,851
lf you're not with us,
you're against us.

1692
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:00,953
Bring the old man.

1693
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:02,624
Get your hands off me.

1694
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:05,030
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1695
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:06,396
Let us out!

1696
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:09,131
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1697
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:10,195
Who's with me?

1698
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,797
( cheering )

1699
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:13,865
* Raise your torch,
mount your horse *

1700
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:16,241
* Screw your courage
to the sticking place *

1701
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:18,746
* We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way *

1702
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,544
* Through the mist,
through the wood *

1703
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,210
* Where,
within a haunted castle *

1704
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:24,879
* Something's lurking
that you don't see every day *

1705
01:12:24,954 --> 01:12:28,481
* lt's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain *

1706
01:12:28,524 --> 01:12:31,687
* We won't rest
till he's good and deceased *

1707
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,524
* Sally forth, tally ho *

1708
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:35,189
* Grab your sword,
grab your bow *

1709
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:36,721
* Praise the lord,
and here we go. *

1710
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:40,200
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1711
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:42,500
l have to warn the Beast.

1712
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:44,438
This is all my fault.

1713
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:46,407
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1714
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:47,773
Now, now.

1715
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:49,333
We'll think of something.

1716
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:53,609
Ah!

1717
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:56,514
( thunder claps )

1718
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:58,952
* We don't like
what we don't understand *

1719
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:00,717
* ln fact, it scares us *

1720
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,350
* And this monster
is mysterious at least *

1721
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:04,882
* Bring your guns,
bring your knives *

1722
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,450
* Save your children
and your wives *

1723
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:09,589
* We'll save our village
and our lives *

1724
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:11,031
* We'll kill the Beast! *

1725
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,532
COGSWORTH:
l knew it.

1726
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:14,968
l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1727
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:17,768
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1728
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,034
( barking )

1729
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,303
Could it be?

1730
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:21,138
ls it she?

1731
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:22,576
Sacre bleu!

1732
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,635
lnvaders.

1733
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:24,907
COGSWORTH:
Encroachers.

1734
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,311
POTTS:
And they have
the mirror.

1735
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:27,372
Warn the master.

1736
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:29,350
lf it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1737
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:30,374
Who's with me?

1738
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:31,408
Ah!

1739
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:33,445
Take whatever booty
you can find

1740
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:36,583
but remember,
the Beast is mine!

1741
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,354
* Lights ablaze, banners high *

1742
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:40,055
* We go marching into battle *

1743
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:42,825
* Unafraid, although
the danger just increased *

1744
01:13:42,898 --> 01:13:44,593
* Raise the flag,
sing the song *

1745
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:45,964
* Here we come,
we're 50 strong *

1746
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:48,526
* And 50 Frenchmen
can't be wrong *

1747
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,368
* Let's kill the Beast! *

1748
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,503
-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

1749
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:57,068
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1750
01:13:57,113 --> 01:13:58,341
( shouting )

1751
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,211
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1752
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:02,012
This isn't working.

1753
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,552
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1754
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:07,021
Wait, l know.

1755
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:09,353
( shouting )

1756
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:12,224
What shall
we do, Master?

1757
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,786
lt doesn't matter now.

1758
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:16,889
Just let them come.

1759
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:20,265
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1760
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:21,496
Kill the Beast!

1761
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:23,004
( complete silence )

1764
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:35,142
Now!

1765

1772
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:57,500
Yes!

1773
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:01,007
( whistle blowing )

1774
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,771
Here we go.

1775
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:06,004
( whistle tooting )

1776
01:15:06,115 --> 01:15:07,707
What the devil?

1777
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,079
Belle, look out!

1778
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:19,453
You guys got to try this thing.

1779
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,258
( screaming )

1780
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:25,829
Up here

1781
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,199

1782
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:29,864
( man yelling )

1783
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,032
( singing operatic note )

1784
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:47,886
Oh!

1785
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:50,926

And stay out!

Get up!

1808
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,536
What's the matter, Beast?

1809
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:18,944
( laughing )

1810
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,882
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

( groans )

1812
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:29,957

Let's go, Philippe.

1819
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:45,440
( whinnying )

1820
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:51,777
( groans )

1821
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,811
( growling )

1822
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:10,658
Come on out and fight!

1823
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:16,203
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1824
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,002
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1825
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:21,440
when she had someone like me?

1826
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,405
( growling )

1827
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,983
lt's over, Beast.

1828
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:36,752
Belle is mine!

1829
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:43,824
Let me go. Let me go.

1830
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:45,595
Please, don't hurt me.

1831
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:46,658
l'll do anything.

1832
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:48,329
Anything!

1833
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,677
( Gaston moaning )

1834
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:04,447
Get out.

1835
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:06,681
Beast!

1836
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:07,882
Belle?

1837
01:19:15,798 --> 01:19:17,993
Belle?

1838
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:26,105
You came back.

1839
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,077
( thud )

1840
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:31,305
( roaring )

1841
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:42,052
( screaming )

1842
01:19:42,124 --> 01:19:43,819
( scream stops )

1843
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:50,957
( panting )

1844
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:07,214
You...

1845
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:08,909
You came back.

1846
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:10,612
Of course l came back.

1847
01:20:10,652 --> 01:20:12,415
l couldn't let them...

1848
01:20:12,454 --> 01:20:14,388
Oh, this is all my fault.

1849
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:16,823
lf only l'd gotten
here sooner.

1850
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:20,351
Maybe... it's better...

1851
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:21,692
it's better this way.

1852
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,062
Don't talk like that.

1853
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:25,725
You'll be all right.

1854
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:26,893
( coughing )

1855
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:27,924
We're together now.

1856
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,437
Everything's
going to be fine.

1857
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:31,666
You'll see.

1858
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:34,972
And... at least...

1859
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,740
l got to see you...

1860
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:39,474
one last time.

1861
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:46,477
( exhales )

1862
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,851
No. No.

1863
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:55,853
Please... Please...

1864
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:57,832
Please, don't leave me.

1865
01:20:57,866 --> 01:21:00,027
( sobbing )

1866
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:03,936
l love you.

1867
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:21,779
( sobbing )

1868
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:43,901
* *

1869
01:21:58,527 --> 01:21:59,687
* *

1870
01:22:15,844 --> 01:22:17,106
* *

1871
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:35,520
* *

1872
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:42,836
Belle.

1873
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:44,532
lt's me.

1874
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:01,516
lt is you.

1875
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:23,870
* *

1876
01:23:34,156 --> 01:23:36,522
Lumiere.

1877
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:39,186
Cogsworth!

1878
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,422
Mrs. Potts!

1879
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:42,623
Look at us.

1880
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:44,188
Mama, Mama.

1881
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:45,597
( barking )

1882
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,635
( chuckling )

1883
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:51,002
My goodness.

1884
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,904
lt is a miracle.

1885
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:55,705
( Belle laughing )

1886
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:03,683
( sighs )

1887
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:05,084
L'amour.

1888
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:08,919
( lusty laugh )

1889
01:24:08,957 --> 01:24:11,255
Well, Lumiere,
old friend.

1890
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:12,590
Shall we let bygones
be bygones?

1891
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:13,594
Of course, mon ami.

1892
01:24:13,628 --> 01:24:15,255
l told you she would
break the spell.

1893
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:17,925
l beg your pardon,
old friend

1894
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:20,298
but l believe
l told you.

1895
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:21,996
No, you didn't--
l told you.

1896
01:24:22,037 --> 01:24:24,369
You most certainly
did not, you pompous

1897
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:25,964
paraffin-headed
peabrain.

1898
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:28,737
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

1899
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:29,937
Take that.

1900
01:24:29,978 --> 01:24:31,969
( quarreling continues )

1901
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:37,851
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

1902
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,854
Of course, my dear.

1903
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,049
Of course.

1904
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:45,150
Do l still have
to sleep in the cupboard?

1905
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:46,353
( laughing )

1906
01:24:46,428 --> 01:24:47,690

1907
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:53,895
* Certain as the sun *

1908
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:56,301
* Rising in the east *

1909
01:24:56,338 --> 01:24:59,273
* Tale as old as time *

1910
01:24:59,307 --> 01:25:01,571
* Song as old as rhyme *

1911
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:07,947

( intro to ''Beauty
and the Beast'' begins )

1916
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:40,343
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh *

1917
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:50,956
* Tale as old as time *

1918
01:25:50,992 --> 01:25:56,624
* True as it can be *

1919
01:25:56,665 --> 01:26:00,294
* Barely even friends *

1920
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:03,304
* Then somebody bends *

1921
01:26:03,338 --> 01:26:09,334
* Unexpectedly *

1922
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:15,680
* Just a little change *

1923
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:18,982
* Small to say the least *

1924
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,989
* Both a little scared *

1925
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:25,390
* Neither one prepared *

1926
01:26:25,427 --> 01:26:30,831

01:26:54,856 --> 01:26:58,155
* Whoa, oh-oh *

1933
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:00,991

1945
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:14,365
* Learning you were wrong *

1946
01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:17,701
