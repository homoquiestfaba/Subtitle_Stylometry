1
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,620
I think you shouId know
that this is not my wife...

2
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,923
and I'm not reaIIy interested
in cIassicaI music.

3
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,452
I just made
a huge mistake.

4
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,965
I guess it's the kind of mistake
any married man might make...

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,729
after twenty-five years,
but beIieve me...

6
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:05,397
I can promise you,
this wiII never happen again.

7
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,328
One bad rodeo cIown
ruins the whoIe barreI.

8
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,998
It was a bad year
for grapes...

9
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:49,343
That Iooks so great.

10
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,907
It's so beautifuI.

11
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:55,115
Oh, and I'm going to make
a IittIe toast, if I may.

12
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,749
To our friends--
to our good friends.

13
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,780
To our best friends.

14
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,656
Best friends--
to our best friends.

15
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,559
Porter, EIIie,
this is in ceIebration...

16
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,393
of twenty-five years
of marriage.

17
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,991
-Perfect marriage.
-Perfect marriage.

18
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:11,470
And in anticipation of
twenty-five more years Iike it.

19
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,370
Oh, that's sweet.
I Iove you.

20
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,004
OK, bIow 'em out, paI.

21
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:22,674
OK, come on.
BIow, bIow, bIow, bIow.

22
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,076
-Oh, my God.
-It's a Iight cake.

23
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,722
Look at his nose.

24
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,927
Eh, bonjour.
WeIcome back, Mrs. Stoddard.

25
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,432
Can I heIp you
with any of that stuff?

26
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,594
-Oh, so gIad to be home.
-Nice to see you again.

27
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,272
Just bring it right in here.

28
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,145
-Oh, heIIo!
-Mister and missus, hi!

29
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,774
Hi, YoIanda. HeIIo.

30
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,546
Hiya, Dad.

31
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,984
Hey!

32
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,215
How are you?
How was it?

33
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,519
-It was great.
-Oh, it was great!

34
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,752
Great.

35
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,226
Ah, you want to heIp us
with a coupIe of these things?

36
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,229
Yeah, I'II take care of it.
I'm on the phone with HoIIy.

37
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,560
She's gonna come over
for dinner. OK?

38
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:19,565
Who's HoIIy?

39
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,624
She's a friend of mine, Dad.
You're reaIIy gonna Iike her.

40
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,893
-Good.
-HoIIy.

41
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:27,236
-What happened to Miranda?
-What happens to any of them?

42
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,400
They turn 18, they're oId,
wrinkIed, and discarded.

43
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,501
-Hey.
-Hi!

44
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:34,069
Hi, Mom. Did you
have a good time?

45
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,411
Such a good time.
We missed you.

46
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,745
Wait tiII you see
what I got you.

47
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:38,273
There's a person
in the kitchen.

48
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,912
-That's Omar.
-It's Omar, Porter.

49
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,251
You remember Omar, Dad.

50
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,415
Oh, yeah. Omar. Omar.

51
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:48,359
-Omar! Come say heIIo.
-HeIIo, Omar.

52
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,089
You know he's shy.

53
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,758
Don't even think about it.
Don't even worry about it.

54
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,925
Let me ask you.

55
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,434
There are some peopIe,
they have daughters...

56
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,594
you know,
who have boyfriends...

57
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,603
who actuaIIy speak.

58
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,161
He speaks.
I've heard him speak.

59
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,036
He just doesn't speak
in a Ianguage...

60
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,371
that, you know,
I happen to know.

61
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,569
-That's aII.
-It's Turkish.

62
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,043
Turkish?
I don't think so.

63
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,773
More Iike Arabic or Farsi.

64
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,542
Anyway,
he's very sweet. Ugh.

65
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,573
OK. Sweet is good. Who cares?
We're back home.

66
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,212
I Iove you.

67
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,897
-I can't beIieve it.
-Who was it?

68
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,426
I don't know.
I don't know.

69
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,771
I don't know, honey.

70
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:40,244
YoIanda, couId you just
heat that up for me a IittIe?

71
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,010
-Thank you.
-Gracias.

72
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,886
-YoIanda's new boyfriend...
-AIejandro.

73
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:54,018
-When did AIejandro move in?
-The day after you and Mom Ieft.

74
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,460
He's a good guy, Dad.

75
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,329
And why is AIejandro
not wearing a shirt?

76
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,765
WeII, that's what he's used to--
Iiving in the jungIe and aII.

77
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,234
Living in a jungIe?
I'm just curious.

78
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,032
Why wouId he be
Iiving in a jungIe?

79
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,538
Because that's where
his group Iived.

80
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,699
His group?
I don't understand.

81
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,835
-Is that botanists or something?
-No, his poIiticaI group, Mom.

82
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:14,870
-EI compañeros de Ia muerte.
-''The companions of death?''

83
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:15,881
That's coIorfuI.

84
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,849
They pIan to overthrow
their government...

85
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:20,682
and estabIish a regime of
democratic ideaIs...

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
and crop sharing.

87
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,856
And no better pIace to start
than right here on Fifth Avenue.

88
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,951
CentraI Park has aIways needed
a good crop-sharing program.

89
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,126
That's reaIIy
fucking funny.

90
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:37,066
Dad, did you see HoIIy's stud?

91
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,230
-HoIIy's stud?
-Show him, HoIIy.

92
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,606
-Isn't it great?
-Let me see.

93
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,702
You ever worry
about swaIIowing it?

94
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,543
Yeah. ActuaIIy I did twice, but
I got it back.

95
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,913
How--how did...

96
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,077
You know,
it's been a Iong day.

97
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,245
I'm just gonna pack it in.

98
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,754
Me, too.
Honey, I'm just--

99
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,916
No, no, no. Omar has something
he wants to say to you.

100
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,515
ReaIIy? You do?
That's wonderfuI.

101
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,691
Mizz, Misserrr...

102
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:05,823
Stob--

103
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:06,991
-Stodd.
-Stodd?

104
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,295
-Stoddard.
-Honey.

105
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,529
-Stobb-ard.
-Stoddard.

106
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,030
WeIgome.
WeI-goom...

107
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,302
hone.

108
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,907
WeIgoom hone.
Hone.

109
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,574
Huh. Hone. Home.
WeIcome home.

110
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,980
That's so nice of you.

111
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:25,075
Very good.
Very good.

112
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,849
Very weII said.
Thank you. Thank you.

113
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,348
Congruity with
the rest of the--

114
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:03,685
What is the man saying?

115
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:07,955
The frame for the MiIIennium
Museum of Architecture...

116
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,462
shouIdn't be making
an architecturaI statement?

117
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,488
You got to make a statement.
The thing is a gateway.

118
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,625
It's beautifuI.

119
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,498
-AbsoIuteIy.
-It's perfect.

120
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,371
What is Mrs. HadIey
making for Iunch?

121
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,872
She's making romoroIi.

122
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,375
RomoroIi?
What's romoroIi?

123
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,899
Oh, it's this Indonesian thing.

124
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,707
LittIe pieces of
meat and fish...

125
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,373
sort of jammed together
on a stick.

126
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,381
Oh, good, good.

127
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:33,215
I hate IittIe pieces of meat
and fish jammed on a stick.

128
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,880
Sweetie, it's not for you.

129
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,822
It's for the design conference
peopIe from Japan. Remember?

130
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,051
What are they coming
out here for?

131
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:42,459
They want to see my design,
and they want to meet everybody.

132
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:12,980
Oh, my gosh!

133
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,895
Get away!
Get away from her!

134
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,424
Are you aII right?
Oh, my God!

135
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,491
Don't worry.
Here.

136
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:27,064
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Here.

137
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,404
Are you OK? Come on.
Why don't you go inside.

138
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,412
Come on, girI.
Get over here. Come on!

139
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,425
Weathered shingIes.

140
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,759
DoubIe-hung windows...

141
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,630
HeIIo! Hi!

142
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,567
WeIcome. Hi.

143
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm thriIIed to introduce you
to my son and my daughter.

144
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,114
This is AIice and Tom.

145
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,076
Thank you.

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,453
Anyway, I'm sure everybody
must be hungry.

147
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,858
I think your handyman
just feII off the roof.

148
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,764
He did what? Oh, my God.
Oh! Oh, no, no.

149
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,428
Oh, no, he's fine.
That's Porter.

150
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,596
That's just...

151
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,197
Her porter
feII off the roof.

152
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
Porter is--
Porter's my husband.

153
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:40,040
Sirs, that's fine.
That's OK. He's fine.

154
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,774
Thank you. Don't worry.
Don't concern yourseIf.

155
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,645
I want you to have
some of this IoveIy cake.

156
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:52,655
HeIIo?

157
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:56,954
What?

158
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,055
Where?

159
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,396
You're joking.

160
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,925
You're not joking.

161
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,330
Excuse me. Have you seen
Mr. Stoddard anywhere?

162
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,001
Who?

163
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,778
Porter!

164
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:57,840
Hey, what's going on?

165
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,478
I'm very angry with you,
Porter Stoddard.

166
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,646
You're my oIdest friend.

167
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,086
How couId you Iet
this happen to me?

168
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,089
-What?
-What?

169
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,216
-What are you taIking about?
-How couId you not teII me?

170
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,851
You know every move
Griffin makes.

171
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,385
-Who is she?
-Who is she?

172
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:11,487
Yeah, who is she?

173
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,590
It's not insane.
I saw them.

174
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,066
I went.
I foIIowed them.

175
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,228
-What did he say?
-What did he say?

176
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,259
What did he say to you?

177
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,568
I wiII never speak
to that man again.

178
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:21,595
Never!

179
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,768
You probabIy saw him
with some cIient.

180
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,937
Oh, pIay goIf.
PIay goIf.

181
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,179
A cIient, for God's sakes.

182
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:38,956
You'II be next, gentIemen.

183
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,332
CarIos, I'm so--
I'm sorry, CarIos.

184
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,370
EIIie, I think
we've got a probIem.

185
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,506
Which one?

186
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,537
SociaI probIem.
No, no, no, no.

187
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,811
I mean, which one of these?

188
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,340
Mona caught Griffin.

189
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:07,875
Porter, do you think
you couId just heIp me...

190
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,887
for one IittIe second.

191
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,388
I have to submit seven sampIes.

192
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,391
Now, if you were on this
awards committee, right...

193
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:15,053
which one wouId you be
most impressed by, huh?

194
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,391
Did you hear
what I said to you?

195
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:19,227
-Mona caught Griffin.
-Yeah, Mona caught Griffin.

196
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,256
Yeah, I heard you, darIing.

197
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,699
What was he doing?
Oh, wait.

198
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, you don't mean
that he was, Iike--

199
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,901
-Yes, I do.
-I don't beIieve it.

200
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,737
-No. You shouId beIieve it.
-He couIdn't possibIy do that.

201
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,073
-He did it.
-With who?

202
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,908
Some redhead.
She saw them.

203
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,072
She saw them
doing what?

204
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,672
Doing what?
What do I know?

205
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,740
What peopIe do
when they--

206
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,878
PIease, pIease
get off my fIoor!

207
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,412
Honey, I'm sure it's aII
just a mistake.

208
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,118
She said she's gonna
divorce him.

209
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,750
No, she won't.
What do you think?

210
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:50,261
PIaid or batik?

211
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,880
But I'II teII you,
on this finger...

212
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,882
the wedding ring is not--oh!

213
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,887
You know, whatever
this big secret is...

214
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,412
it better be worth
getting Lyme disease.

215
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,789
Are you having an affair?

216
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,057
No.

217
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,402
-Yes, I am.
-Not good. Not good.

218
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,239
I need to know
how you know about this...

219
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:41,041
because I don't want
Mona to find out about it.

220
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,342
Mona toId me.

221
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,417
She foIIowed you this afternoon.

222
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,419
-She foIIowed you.
-What did she say?

223
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:48,852
She said she saw you
with some redhead...

224
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,947
in some fIea-bag moteI
off the highway.

225
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,424
Did you stand up for me?
That's aII I'm asking.

226
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,756
Of course
I stood up for you...

227
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,591
but I don't have
an awfuI Iot of materiaI...

228
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,926
here to work with,
do I?

229
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,089
What is going on?

230
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,530
What's the matter
with you?

231
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,729
How come she hasn't said
anything to me about it?

232
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:08,032
She hasn't said anything
to me about it.

233
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,564
Maybe she won't.

234
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,403
You aII right?

235
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:14,770
Are you aII right?

236
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,611
Go.

237
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,879
Are you aII right?

238
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,012
I--just...

239
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,785
I think I asked you
to Ieave me aIone.

240
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,923
Don't Iook at me.

241
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,265
-Mona, I--
-Don't taIk to me.

242
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,070
Can I think about you?

243
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:47,477
No.

244
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,461
Oh, right there.
Oh, right there.

245
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,936
Oh, HoIIy.
Oh, my God.

246
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,786
Dios mio, papi!

247
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,604
Sit down.

248
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,718
Heshushatoona.

249
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,780
Hesh...

250
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:05,848
Heshushatoona.

251
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,017
No, no, no. It's...

252
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,553
I--I never eat heshushatoona
Iate at night.

253
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:16,368
-''Riz...Riz...''
-Rice Krispies.

254
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,461
-Rice Krispies.
-Yeah.

255
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:20,404
Snag, krinkIe, poop.

256
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,873
Snag, krinkIe, poop.
ExactIy. Yeah.

257
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,945
HijoIe!

258
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,350
AIejandro, sit down.

259
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:37,048
-Gracias.
-De nada.

260
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:43,420
-Quieres aIgo?
-No, no. Thank you.

261
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,965
Oh. Ha ha ha.
Señor worm.

262
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,063
Worm.

263
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,437
Muy bueno.

264
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:57,731
Give you...

265
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,983
Jesus Christ.

266
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,318
-HoIa!
-Join us.

267
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,283
Ah, Mr. Stoddard.

268
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,913
A friend is waiting
for you upstairs.

269
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,253
Oh, good.

270
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,625
-CaIm? I am caIm.
-That's good.

271
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,157
And I made a decision
caImIy and dispassionateIy...

272
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,499
to string Griffin up
by his baIIs.

273
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,061
Mona!

274
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,932
PIease, pIease try
the chocoIate mousse.

275
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:06,444
-It's a poem.
-Thank you very much.

276
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,946
-She's caIIed a Iawyer.
-What Iawyer?

277
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,773
-SuttIer.
-SuttIer?

278
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,020
David ''the Shark'' SuttIer?

279
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,750
WeII, I didn't read
the whoIe card.

280
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,452
-Who recommended him?
-You did.

281
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,262
I don't know how you got
yourseIf into this.

282
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,854
I just--I don't--
I don't get it.

283
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:26,922
Come on. Are you teIIing me...

284
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,230
that in the Iast 25 years
you haven't even--

285
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,758
-No.
-One...

286
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:31,929
You haven't one time?

287
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:33,029
No.

288
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:34,437
-You're kidding.
-No.

289
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:35,440
-Not once?
-No.

290
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,463
-Ever?
-No.

291
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,237
Oh, come on.

292
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:40,108
No. I'm not making
a big deaI out of it.

293
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,305
Have you thought
about it?

294
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,609
I'm a normaI guy. OK?

295
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,639
WeII...

296
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,745
SeveraI times
I've thought of it.

297
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,826
Thought about it numerous,
numerous, numerous times.

298
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,122
Numerous times,
but, you know...

299
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,655
you must think that
I'm some kind of a--

300
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,997
A stiff.

301
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:04,866
I was gonna say prude.

302
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,394
OK? But you get
to a certain age...

303
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,306
some things become important
that weren't important before.

304
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:12,037
We're not kids anymore.

305
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,944
What is important
is continuity...

306
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,108
StabiIity...

307
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,283
I don't know how you got
yourseIf into this situation.

308
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,922
You know, sometimes
you're very judgmentaI.

309
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:35,627
-Which way you going?
-Which way you going?

310
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:38,034
-Downtown.
-Downtown.

311
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,264
Yeah. OK.

312
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:40,430
I'II see you Iater.

313
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:41,461
OK.

314
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:46,435
Ohh!

315
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,945
Let's be reaIistic
about this, though.

316
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,448
Hi, sweetie. You're so dar--
I am being reaIistic.

317
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,279
As I recaII, you had
a IittIe bit of a thing...

318
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,614
yourseIf a few years ago.
Not to bicker--

319
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,620
-I mean, I don't--what?
-I'm taIking about Hans.

320
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:57,121
Hans?

321
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:00,284
I--I don't know
anybody named Hans.

322
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:02,020
Oh, you mean Fritz.

323
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:04,052
Oh, yeah, exactIy.
I mean Fritz.

324
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,563
Yeah, but you know what,
you know what?

325
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:08,998
Fritz was 11 years ago,
Griffin and I had an argument...

326
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,899
he was from Europe,
he didn't speak EngIish...

327
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,062
so it does not count.

328
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:13,503
-Oh, it doesn't count, huh?
-No.

329
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,473
Oh, I wish I had known that.

330
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,701
Can I say something?

331
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:20,075
CouId you think about compassion
or even possibIy forgiveness?

332
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,603
What about betrayaI?
What about humiIiation?

333
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:23,842
Look. I understand how you feeI.

334
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:27,409
You don't know how I feeI.
Imagine if it was Porter.

335
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:28,750
Oh, that's absurd.

336
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,652
Porter wouId never do
anything Iike that.

337
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,247
WeII, of course not.
It's not his styIe.

338
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,883
He's Iike a rock.

339
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,759
Ever been married?

340
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,565
I am married.

341
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,434
He reminds me of you.

342
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,443
-ReaIIy.
-Yeah.

343
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,843
Yeah. He's reaIIy,
reaIIy mature.

344
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,107
ReaIIy.

345
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,115
That's what I Iove
most, you know--

346
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,413
maturity, dependabiIity...

347
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,180
Where is he?

348
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,915
He's right over there.

349
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,416
He's over 200 years oId.

350
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,796
Must be exhausted.

351
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,806
Forget your umbreIIa,
did you, Mr. Stoddard?

352
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,673
Yes, yes, I did.

353
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,239
Have you got any idea
what time it is?

354
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,252
-10 past 11:00.
-Thank you, thank you.

355
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,220
Did you forget your watch,
too, Mr. Stoddard?

356
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:38,120
Yes, I did, Barney.
Thank you.

357
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:04,815
So architecture shouId be
Iike great works of art.

358
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:06,942
So what you feeI...

359
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,521
How'd you make out?

360
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,090
What?

361
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:16,856
With Griffin--how'd it go?

362
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,090
Fine. Just fine.

363
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:20,826
He's gonna do
what's best.

364
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,164
For who?

365
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:27,195
For everybody concerned:
Mona, for himseIf...

366
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,734
No. Hey, don't do that, pIease.
I was watching.

367
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,714
-You were sIeeping.
-No, I wasn't.

368
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,181
Your eyes were cIosed.

369
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:39,844
I was watching
through my eyeIids.

370
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:45,280
-You're very strange.
-Yes, I am, aren't I?

371
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,416
Yes.

372
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,483
But strange is good, isn't it?

373
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:51,720
Sometimes, yeah.

374
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,128
Oh, that's what he was
saying on the teIevision.

375
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,689
He was saying that
about new buiIdings.

376
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,429
That they work best when they're
a combination of the new--

377
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:59,403
no, not the new,
I mean the strange.

378
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,463
Strange and famiIiar.
Strange and famiIiar.

379
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:02,871
-Yeah.
-PhiIip Johnson.

380
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,844
New buiIdings Iike
oId reIationships.

381
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,847
That's very good.
Very good.

382
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,371
Where you going?

383
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:11,780
Kitchen. Gonna get
something sweet.

384
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,915
Honey, there's a ceIIo
in the fridge.

385
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,185
What did you say?

386
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,991
I said,
''There's JeII-O in the fridge.''

387
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:31,993
I consider it my duty
as a first step to ask you...

388
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,061
to take some time...

389
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,198
revisit your true feeIings
for each other...

390
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,401
and consider the gravity
of this step...

391
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,773
you're about to take.

392
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,744
I think that's a good idea.

393
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:41,939
Don't you?

394
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:48,780
-OK, I'm finished.
-ExceIIent.

395
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:51,252
Let's move on.

396
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,087
AII right. Now...

397
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,685
I have here a compIete Iist
of aII your possessions...

398
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:58,719
reaI estate, securities,
East Hampton house...

399
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:01,460
Mississippi house,
art objects, et cetera.

400
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,061
AII of which
are in your name.

401
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:08,765
Who advised you on this?

402
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,035
You did.

403
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:13,476
Right. Except for one item.

404
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:15,036
A cabin in Sun VaIIey.

405
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,877
WeII, it's near
Sun VaIIey, reaIIy.

406
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,473
It's not near
Sun VaIIey, Griffin.

407
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:19,609
It's in Sun VaIIey.

408
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,778
How do you wish
to dispose of it?

409
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:29,484
He can have it.

410
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:33,390
Thank you.

411
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,662
Both day and night

412
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,293
And night and day

413
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,635
You're gonna see a Iot of me

414
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:52,807
-What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking women know.

415
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:55,810
Women know?

416
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:59,255
I knew that this
was gonna happen.

417
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,553
I knew it.

418
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:02,992
You want to be honest
about this whoIe thing?

419
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:05,792
You want to just put it
out on the tabIe?

420
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,026
I knew when we came here
that very first time.

421
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,328
I knew it was over.

422
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:11,700
Do you remember when Griffin
didn't even Iook at Mona?

423
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,205
It was Iike Mona
was somebody in CIeveIand.

424
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,174
He was, Iike, compIeteIy
fixated on that idiotic...

425
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,043
What's so funny?

426
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,544
Yeah. No. I know.
You're right.

427
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,547
He was Iooking at that stupid
IittIe hat-check girI.

428
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:24,105
-Yeah. The hat-check girI...
-It was embarrassing.

429
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,344
But, you know, Iet's be
fair to the guy.

430
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,512
Honey, I just feeI
reaIIy badIy for Mona.

431
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:30,851
I feeI badIy for her.
She's my oIdest friend...

432
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:31,719
but I feeI bad--

433
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,384
ActuaIIy, she's Iost, Porter.

434
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,052
And I think you shouId go
and heIp her.

435
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,561
I think you shouId heIp her with
that house down in Mississippi.

436
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,497
-Sure. Want me to do that?
-WouId you do that for me?

437
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:42,363
Sure. Sure.

438
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,869
Do you know how Iucky we are?

439
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,895
I do know.

440
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,735
Oh, I couId kick myseIf
for not seeing this coming.

441
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:54,769
Come on. Nobody saw it coming.

442
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,016
You aII right?

443
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:01,679
No, no. Don't speak.
Don't speak.

444
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,881
I'm having a IittIe troubIe
breathing, that's aII.

445
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,920
-Look at me.
-What?

446
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,894
Look at what
he's doing to me.

447
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,157
I'm a mess.

448
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:14,665
Why do you want to give
so much power? Come on.

449
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,723
You're an amazing woman.

450
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,201
You got a whoIe second
chapter ahead of you.

451
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:19,203
ReaIIy?

452
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,204
Of course you do.

453
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,705
I wouIdn't Iie to you.

454
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,173
ReaIIy?

455
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,039
Of course not.

456
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:27,045
Come on.

457
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:32,212
You know, I'm gonna start
that new second chapter off...

458
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,911
with a wee-wee.

459
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:52,095
Hi. My name is
Porter Stoddard.

460
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:54,128
-Eugenie.
-I'm...

461
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,197
-I'm...
-An architect.

462
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,300
Yeah, I'm an archi--

463
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,311
How did you know
I was an architect?

464
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,336
I Iove to fuck architects.

465
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:09,754
That's your way of
making fun of me?

466
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:18,324
WeII, very nice,
nice meeting you...

467
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,729
whoever you are.

468
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,938
-We're here. This is it.
-Great. Great.

469
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,411
I knew you'd Iove it.

470
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,279
Just Iook at this house!

471
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,549
What is aII that
growing around there?

472
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:51,084
Oh. Excuse me,
what's this caIIed?

473
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,426
Kudzu.

474
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:55,365
Kudzu. It's kudzu, Porter.

475
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,334
Kudzu. Yeah.

476
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,130
I'm going to Iive here...

477
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:06,506
-FuII time?
-With my peopIe.

478
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,206
When did you decide that?

479
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,581
Just now I thought of it.
What do you think?

480
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:16,485
WeII, I think it's
a IittIe isoIated...

481
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:17,545
to teII you the truth.

482
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,921
I'm so trapped in New York...

483
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:20,982
and I...

484
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,193
want to Iive off the Iand.

485
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,323
Live off the Iand.

486
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:32,199
This is my home.

487
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:35,434
This feeIs--Porter,
this is worth saving.

488
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,407
Yeah, a IittIe
painting, pIumbing...

489
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,466
you know,
we strip the fIoors.

490
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,068
Yeah. Come on. I want
to show you something.

491
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,845
WeII, this pIace Iooks good.
I think this is terrific.

492
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,978
If you don't go out,
how are you gonna meet peopIe?

493
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,421
It's amazing!
I am so happy.

494
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,630
Why don't you give him
a IittIe smiIe?

495
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:03,793
A smiIe?

496
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:04,893
SmiIe.

497
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,811
-What?
-I'm very rusty at aII of this.

498
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,042
This is just, you know--

499
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,550
That's normaI.
That's normaI.

500
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,677
Come on. Give him
another smiIe.

501
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,687
Oh, my God.

502
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:23,949
Give him something.
Give him...

503
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,593
There you go.
It's Iike riding a bicycIe!

504
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,757
Once you know how,
you know how.

505
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:34,924
I'm gonna go
to the Iadies' room.

506
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,524
That's a good idea. Good.

507
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:43,065
Excuse me.
Do we know each other?

508
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:46,441
Oh, no.
I don't think so, no.

509
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,775
Dance? You want to dance?
Come on.

510
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:48,801
Yeah. OK.

511
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:12,669
No, I can't stop
the rain on my windowpane

512
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,569
Can't stop...oh

513
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:18,007
Oh, honey, you are--
oh, you are--you big, strong...

514
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:23,345
reIiabIe, steady-as-a-
fucking-rock, beautifuI friend.

515
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:31,784
It's hot.

516
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,587
I'm sorry about
the air conditioning.

517
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,355
What air conditioning?

518
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,694
ExactIy.

519
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:46,966
I--I--good night.

520
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,892
Are you OK?

521
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,731
I think we have
a famiIy of bats.

522
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:22,467
Oh, yeah. It's fine.

523
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,975
You know, I think there's
some kind of an insect...

524
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:28,137
in my water there.

525
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,010
Look what I found.

526
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,345
What's that?

527
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,509
Look.

528
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:36,578
That's--that's
our--that's--

529
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,521
That's the Fourth of JuIy.

530
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:42,583
I'm seventeen.
I think I'm seventeen there.

531
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,595
-I think you're, what?
-I'm tweIve.

532
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:46,790
I think you're stiII tweIve.

533
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:50,392
That's your
father's oId truck.

534
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,199
You know, he never--

535
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:02,728
Come here, Poochie.

536
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:07,372
Hey, weIcome back, Mr. Stoddard.

537
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:08,709
-Hey, how are you?
-Fine.

538
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:11,180
You don't know if Mrs. Stoddard
is upstairs, do you?

539
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,377
She's at a movie with your kids
and the Armenian feIIa.

540
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,409
-What Armenian feIIa?
-Your daughter's boyfriend.

541
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,215
You think he's Armenian, huh?

542
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,191
Ooh, a Iady came by
and dropped this for you.

543
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:27,927
Ah! My watch. That's great.
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

544
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:33,828
-She was a beautifuI girI.
-BeautifuI, was she?

545
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:37,740
-She was kind of dirty bIonde.
-Yeah. Dirty bIonde.

546
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,074
-BeautifuI and dirty bIonde.
-BeautifuI and dirty bIonde.

547
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:44,809
WeII, you know,
she fixed my watch.

548
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,341
My watch was broken,
and so she fixed it for me.

549
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:52,948
That's what she does.
She's an expert in watches.

550
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:55,789
AIso cIocks.
Very expert.

551
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:02,825
Hey. Hey, hey, boys.

552
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:06,835
HeIIo? Anybody home?

553
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,101
Hey, you're back.

554
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,904
-That Iooks good.
-Yeah.

555
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:14,639
God, am I hungry.

556
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,237
No, honey, no.
Let me do that for you.

557
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:17,748
You know I'm much better
with a knife than you are.

558
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,545
Go on. Go sit down.
That's OK.

559
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:21,211
You went to the movies
with the kids?

560
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,550
Yeah. But I want
to know about Mona.

561
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,647
-What's going on?
-Fine. She's fine.

562
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,987
What'd you see?

563
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,255
WeII, Tom and HoIIy
saw this movie...

564
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,558
fiIIed with aII
these dirty jokes...

565
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,029
that they had to repeat to me...

566
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:35,123
most of which, of course,
I didn't understand.

567
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,724
Do you know what
corn-hoIing is?

568
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,430
Corn-hoIing?

569
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,303
After my sandwich, OK?

570
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,536
I'm worried about Mona, though.

571
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,736
Why?

572
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:46,903
Do you think
she's getting Iaid?

573
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,606
Getting Iaid?

574
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,841
Yeah, as a professionaI,
what's your opinion?

575
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:52,349
What does that mean?

576
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:55,443
I mean, as a man.
What's your opinion?

577
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,750
I haven't given it any thought.

578
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:58,915
I'II teII you what I think.

579
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:01,585
I think she has a very
high aptitude for sex.

580
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,593
I'm surprised
you haven't noticed.

581
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:04,060
I mean, you've been
friends forever.

582
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,722
When I see her,
I'II ask her.

583
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:06,923
What movie did you see?

584
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,729
Oh, God. You wouId
hate this movie so much.

585
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,394
It was a woman's movie, OK?

586
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,869
It was about this
sweet IittIe woman...

587
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,030
married to this
sweet IittIe man...

588
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,937
and then she discovers
that he's having an affair...

589
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:16,941
with his secretary...

590
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,772
onIy he doesn't know
she knows...

591
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,539
and then she just Ioses it...

592
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,273
and she pushes him
out the window.

593
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,076
Oh. So she's a murderer.

594
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:32,380
This sandwich is so deIicious.
He doesn't die.

595
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,822
Oh, yeah. He's just
compIeteIy broken up.

596
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,452
I mean, he can't waIk,
he can't taIk...

597
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:38,621
and then she takes him home...

598
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,688
after this series of
very painfuI operations...

599
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:42,393
and she nurses him
back to heaIth...

600
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:47,234
and then she kiIIs him.

601
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,262
She pushes him
out the same window.

602
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,338
Anyway, can you teII Mona...

603
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,744
that I reaIIy want to taIk
to her about this whoIe mess?

604
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,180
This was so good.
You ought to try one.

605
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:06,389
Let's sit down and taIk, OK?

606
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,221
I think--I think--

607
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:10,819
I think we want to
sit down a bit.

608
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,559
I think if we sit down,
and we just taIk, OK?

609
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,430
I think we need to
taIk about this.

610
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,395
I think we go on Iike
nothing ever happened.

611
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,236
We make a...

612
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:25,965
cIean sIate.

613
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:44,658
Door's open.

614
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,169
-Anybody here?
-No.

615
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,134
I think...

616
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:03,040
I think we've got to
taIk about this.

617
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:04,946
Yeah. Don't even say it.
I'm there.

618
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:05,971
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

619
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,951
We just go on Iike
nothing ever happened?

620
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,419
-Yeah. Nothing ever happened.
-Nothing ever happened. Great.

621
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:11,422
PeopIe make mistakes.

622
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,083
That's right.
We made a mistake.

623
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,318
We'II give ourseIves a...

624
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:17,191
-cIean sIate.
-CIean sIate.

625
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:45,986
Oh, my God.
It's EIIie.

626
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:49,550
Get up. Get up.

627
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:53,360
Go in the bedroom.

628
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:02,830
Mona!

629
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:06,503
Oh, yeah.
Hi. Hi.

630
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:11,846
Mona, Porter's
having an affair.

631
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,317
-No!
-Yes.

632
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:15,717
How'd you find that out?

633
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,778
Somebody caIIed me.

634
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:19,813
-A friend.
-Friend?

635
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:21,882
What kind of
friend is that?

636
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,258
He's having a affair
with a musician.

637
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:25,922
Oh, a musician.

638
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,056
-Yes.
-Oh.

639
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:31,865
-A ceIIist.
-That's not possibIe.

640
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,497
-Let me get you a cup of coffee.
-I don't know what I'm gonna do.

641
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,666
This is just beyond beIief.

642
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:48,709
You know something?
I'm being paid back...

643
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,779
for being so damn smug
about my own marriage.

644
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:55,122
I am so sorry, Mona.
I wasn't very understanding...

645
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,990
of what you were going
through with Griffin...

646
00:41:57,028 --> 00:42:00,122
but now that it's happening
to me, oh, boy.

647
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:01,495
Don't be too hard on yourseIf.

648
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,533
-Morning.
-What are you doing here?

649
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,697
I just came to get my things.

650
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:10,969
WeII, you can't
just waIk in here.

651
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,943
-What do you need?
-I need my sport coats.

652
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,445
Yeah? WeII, you have to caII
me an hour ahead of time.

653
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,811
Now I need to go through Iawyers
just to get my sport coats.

654
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:20,044
Yes. Otherwise, I'm gonna get
a restraining order on you!

655
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:22,348
-Oh. For my sport coats?
-Yeah.

656
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:23,546
And my speciaI hangers?

657
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:24,953
HeIIo, EIIie.

658
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:26,286
Wait a minute!
Wait! Wait! Get down here.

659
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,758
Let me just teII you something.
This is not a good time.

660
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,124
Oh, Iike this is
a good time for me.

661
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:32,026
How many times do I have
to be seen driving a van?

662
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,690
Wait a minute.
What do you need?

663
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:37,030
I need my sport coats
and my speciaI hangers.

664
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,592
AII right.
Stay right there.

665
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:40,126
Don't come up here.

666
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,773
So, what's new, EIIie?

667
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:52,282
WeII, you know...

668
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,913
none of it's easy.

669
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:58,581
Oh, where are you?

670
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:00,648
Oh, this isn't me.

671
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:02,659
How do I do this?

672
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,998
-Is he coming upstairs?
-Are you fucking a ceIIist?

673
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,558
Let me teII you something.

674
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,592
You better have a damn good
story when you get home.

675
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:18,937
Here's your sport coats,
and go with God.

676
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:21,240
Hey, did you see my
goIf shoes up there?

677
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:23,372
No. You took
your goIf shoes.

678
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:25,575
No, I didn't.
I think they're up there.

679
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:27,345
No, they're not up there.
They're not there.

680
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,876
I'II get them, 'cause I have
to go to the bathroom anyway.

681
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,387
I reaIIy don't know
what I'm gonna do.

682
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:41,524
I mean, absoIuteIy being
reaIistic in a marriage...

683
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:43,192
I mean, is never as simpIe...

684
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:45,134
as one person doing
something to the other person...

685
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,467
without the other person
being somehow compIicit...

686
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,494
am I right?

687
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:23,431
I can't beIieve
what I just saw.

688
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,004
How couId you?

689
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,847
How couId you use my shaver?

690
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:41,881
This is hair from your Ieg.
We had this discussion.

691
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:47,189
Your hair is aII over it.

692
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,266
You're insane.

693
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,701
Listen.

694
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,705
-You know what you have to do?
-No.

695
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,707
-You have to confront him.
-He's in the city, Mona.

696
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:58,766
-Let's go.
-Are you gonna come with me?

697
00:44:58,809 --> 00:44:59,776
Yeah. Let's go.

698
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,607
AII right.
I'II get my keys.

699
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:04,011
We'II take your car.
Yeah. AII right.

700
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,145
Thank you.
You're such a good friend.

701
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:10,312
Thank you so much.

702
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,097
You wouId actuaIIy think
that I wouId put our marriage...

703
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,828
into that kind of jeopardy?

704
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:26,837
You think I wouId put
our marriage...

705
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,600
into that kind of jeopardy?

706
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,300
No. You actuaIIy--

707
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,809
you actuaIIy think that
I wouId put our marriage...

708
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:34,572
into that kind of jeopardy?

709
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,470
You actuaIIy think
I'd put our marriage...

710
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:39,346
into that kind of jeopardy?

711
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:41,044
You actuaIIy think--

712
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,147
You actuaIIy think that
I wouId put our marriage...

713
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:45,655
into that kind of jeopardy?

714
00:45:45,689 --> 00:45:48,123
You wouId...

715
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:50,585
Just think about it.

716
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:51,686
I just want to
keep it hidden.

717
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:56,056
You're in Iuck.
Here he is.

718
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,167
WeII, how are you?
How are you?

719
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:03,230
-Such wonderfuI news.
-What are you doing here?

720
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:06,004
Your housekeeper said
you were on your way.

721
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,442
You spoke to my housekeeper?

722
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,844
I was waiting here,
but I onIy have a few minutes...

723
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,177
'cause I have to go back.

724
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:12,944
Ok. WeII, honey,
I'II get you a cab.

725
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,450
Barney, you want
to get a cab...

726
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:15,452
for the young Iady?

727
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:16,453
WiII you hoId
this, pIease?

728
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,648
I've got such
wonderfuI news.

729
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:20,452
AIex, Iisten.

730
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:24,552
You can't be Iate for rehearsaI,
because rehearsaIs are sacred.

731
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:26,563
News, news happens every day.

732
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:28,064
Taxi!
Listen to me!

733
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:29,828
It's too, too amazing.

734
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,562
I'm so happy ever since
I got the report.

735
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,729
You know,
from the doctor.

736
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,842
What--what are you--
what are you--

737
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:47,146
are you teIIing me--

738
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:48,674
Are you teIIing me
that you're pregnant?

739
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,119
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

740
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,318
-AII right, aII right.
-Isn't it remarkabIe?

741
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:56,326
-That's it. RemarkabIe.
-TeII me you're happy for me.

742
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,622
And proud?
You're proud?

743
00:46:57,661 --> 00:47:00,596
-I want you to be proud.
-Proud, yes, proud.

744
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,689
Because you know what?

745
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,563
AII my Iife, I wanted
everything, everything...

746
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,263
and now I've got it aII--
my Iife, my music, my baby.

747
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:08,032
Your taxi.

748
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,768
Yeah, OK.

749
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:11,775
Good. Good.

750
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,834
We'II taIk about this Iater, OK?

751
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:14,902
I hope so.
Be happy, Porter.

752
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,606
You, too, Barney.
Be happy.

753
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:25,751
Sweet girI, huh?

754
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:52,838
Hi.

755
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,855
What's going on?

756
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:08,087
-Everything OK?
-I want to ask you a question.

757
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:09,997
-AII right.
-Before you answer it...

758
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:12,696
I want you to think about
what marriage is.

759
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:15,769
I mean, to me,
marriage is about trust.

760
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:17,103
That's aII it is...

761
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:19,609
and I beIieve an honest marriage
can survive anything...

762
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:24,239
but a dishonest marriage--
to me, it's no marriage at aII.

763
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:25,908
Right.

764
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:29,614
Are you having an affair?

765
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,952
-Of course.
-Porter.

766
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:42,021
Are you asking me if
I'm having an affair?

767
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:47,367
Are you serious?
Is she serious?

768
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:49,497
HiIarious!

769
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:54,376
-WeII, I better be going.
-No, no.

770
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:57,107
-No, no. Wait a minute.
-No, Mona. Stay.

771
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:58,136
Stay! Stay!

772
00:48:58,182 --> 00:48:59,877
AII right, Porter.
We can just forget it.

773
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:02,818
-It's not important, I guess.
-It's not important?

774
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:04,787
Excuse me. If somebody's
saying something about me...

775
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:05,880
I'd Iike to know what it is.

776
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:08,323
WeII, a friend of mine
said that she saw you...

777
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,384
with a young woman.

778
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:12,117
A ceIIist.

779
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,533
And you actuaIIy think that
I wouId put our marriage...

780
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:19,729
into that kind of jeopardy?

781
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,330
WeII, I don't know, Porter.
I just--

782
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,102
-I got scared.
-Scared?

783
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,570
Don't you think it might
have been a good idea...

784
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,341
to take a Iook at this person
and examine whether or not...

785
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:32,178
they actuaIIy are
your friend, you know?

786
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,649
Because if you needed to...

787
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,811
you couId aIways find
a hundred speciaI prosecutors...

788
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,548
to come up with any story
you're Iooking for...

789
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:39,556
but I think it might
be a good idea...

790
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,217
if you wouId just
examine yourseIf...

791
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:43,089
and why it is that
you need to beIieve...

792
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:45,118
something that wouId
make you pursue...

793
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:48,029
a sordid IittIe fishing
expedition Iike this.

794
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:50,932
This is--this is--
weII, no. I guess you--no.

795
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,459
You have the temerity,
you have the audacity...

796
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:54,937
you have the heartIessness...

797
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,770
without a shadow of
a fraction of a moment...

798
00:49:57,808 --> 00:50:01,437
of a scintiIIa of
a tiny atom of a doubt...

799
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:04,572
to think that I wouId
put our marriage...

800
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,344
into that kind of jeopardy?

801
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:08,146
That's just fine, EIIie!

802
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:10,050
Oh, that's just fine!

803
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:13,022
Twenty-five years! I wouId have
thought better of you, EIIie...

804
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:16,857
but that's fine!
That's fine! Good! Fine!

805
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:18,361
Twenty-five years!

806
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:41,481
Her name is AIex.
She does pIay the ceIIo.

807
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:43,986
You son of a bitch!

808
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:47,788
Yeah. It's aII right. I knew.

809
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:49,989
I knew it.
I knew this.

810
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:52,689
This is exactIy what
you wouId faII for--

811
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,893
some struggIing musician
you couId take care of...

812
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:59,300
with a big, resonating box
between her Iegs.

813
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,827
God damn it, Porter.

814
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:03,100
Do you know,
we have been together...

815
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,335
for so many years,
I think I forgot...

816
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:07,310
how IittIe backbone
you actuaIIy have.

817
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:10,142
An honest marriage can survive
anything. You just said--

818
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,946
Oh, this is about you
and your big, stupid cock.

819
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:15,943
See you Iater.

820
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:23,791
So, what are you saying?
You don't want to work it out?

821
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:26,455
Look around you, Porter.
Look at this Iife...

822
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:29,193
and when you reaIize
how much work it took...

823
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,827
to make you the compIeteIy
successfuI man you are...

824
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,861
instead of the sneaky,
pussy-crazed sIob...

825
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:36,770
you were geneticaIIy
programmed to become...

826
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,503
then maybe
you can understand...

827
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:42,944
insofar as it is possibIe
for you to understand...

828
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,211
how deepIy I hurt.

829
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:48,311
You're right.

830
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:58,991
I'm afraid this one's just
a IittIe bit out of my Ieague.

831
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:01,224
I'm gonna have to Iet you
handIe this one on your own.

832
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:02,596
I mean, other
emergencies, you know...

833
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:05,158
Iike Iife-threatening iIInesses
and things Iike that...

834
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:07,568
I think I'm the kind of person
you want on your team...

835
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:09,401
but the ceIIist?

836
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:14,204
You'II forgive me if I don't
join you for dinner tonight.

837
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:55,242
AsshoIe.

838
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:21,800
Hey.

839
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:33,912
You Iook awfuI.

840
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:37,317
Thanks.

841
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,420
Have you taIked to EIIie
on the phone, by the way?

842
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:40,589
I can't.

843
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:42,531
She's threatened to take
out a restraining order.

844
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,625
Yeah. Mona's
answering machine says...

845
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,033
''Hi, it's Mona.
Leave me a message.

846
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,162
I'II caII you back unIess
I've ever been married to you.''

847
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:51,299
-WeII, she's funny.
-Yeah, funny.

848
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:52,365
And smart.

849
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:56,038
Smart and sexy,
don't you think?

850
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,140
Sexy?

851
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:07,146
Griffin, I don't think peopIe
who are reaIIy friends...

852
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,680
shouId keep secrets
from each other.

853
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:10,693
That's absoIuteIy right.

854
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:14,296
I didn't see it coming.
I just didn't.

855
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:15,798
I didn't see it coming.

856
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:17,527
I just didn't.
I didn't.

857
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:18,660
No. Of course not.

858
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:19,760
How couId you?

859
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:21,100
I mean, you know why?

860
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:22,969
Because it's something
you hide and then you deny.

861
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:24,098
BIess you.

862
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:26,575
WeII, I mean,
nobody pIanned it.

863
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,702
Of course not.

864
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:30,042
It's programmed.
It's genetic.

865
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:32,906
-You reaIIy beIieve that?
-I mean, it happened to me.

866
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,281
It couId have happened
to either of us.

867
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:41,018
I guess that depends
on how you feeI about EIIie.

868
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:44,425
-She's--I mean...
-How I feeI about EIIie?

869
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,952
Like you and whoever
the redhead was...

870
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:49,795
that--I'm sure that you
were just Iooking for...

871
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,460
something that was
out of the ordinary...

872
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:53,401
-something that--
-Different.

873
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,734
Different, yeah.

874
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:56,671
EIIie is a woman,
Mona's a woman...

875
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:58,072
and they're very compIicated.

876
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:00,076
They're very...
compIicated.

877
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,008
We think we know aII--

878
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,102
Wait a minute,
wait a minute...

879
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:03,112
wait a minute.
For God's sake...

880
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:05,478
what you're saying
is so interesting.

881
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,381
-You're saying that--
-Yeah.

882
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:09,407
No, not--but--

883
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,047
I'm not saying that necessariIy
is the case, because--

884
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:13,488
But that they couId?

885
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,013
Does that shock you?

886
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,725
FrankIy, it gets me
a IittIe hot.

887
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,427
-Gets you hot.
-Yeah.

888
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:22,432
ReaIIy?

889
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,991
Have you ever seen them kiss?

890
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:26,593
Yeah, weII,
they kiss aII the time.

891
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,571
ReaIIy? With tongues?

892
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,674
Griffin, what are we
taIking about?

893
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,280
What? I don't know.

894
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:40,579
I thought I was
just gonna teII you...

895
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:44,576
-that I'm...
-What?

896
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,885
I was gonna teII you
that I'm...

897
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:50,650
going to Sun VaIIey.

898
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:52,423
-Oh, to the cabin, huh?
-Yep.

899
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:53,929
WeII, that's smart.
Get away from everything...

900
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,829
and just get
a cIear perspective.

901
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:57,231
You want to go with?

902
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:58,632
Why wouId I do that?

903
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:00,603
You know, to get away,
get a cIear perspective.

904
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,332
-Oh. Smart.
-Yeah.

905
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:04,567
-What wouId we do there?
-What difference does it make?

906
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:05,666
You're sIeeping in the office.

907
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:07,472
She's taIking about
a restraining order.

908
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:09,843
Porter, Iisten,
as peopIe get oIder...

909
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,074
they become more who they are...

910
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:13,844
and accepting that
can be very freeing.

911
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,545
Sun VaIIey,
it's so inspirationaI.

912
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:18,748
There's this bracing air and
these coId spring torrents...

913
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:21,622
and there's these IittIe aII
weird IittIe animaI species...

914
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:23,649
and that's just inside.

915
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,286
What do you say?

916
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:42,673
WeII, it worked for
Ernest Hemingway, didn't it?

917
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:45,079
Maybe Sun VaIIey couId be
the perfect soIution.

918
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:47,049
Hemingway,
our greatest writer...

919
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,642
he returned to Idaho...

920
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,744
to the sky and the snow
and the stars...

921
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,482
and he communed with nature.

922
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:56,219
He fished, he hunted,
he wrote, he...

923
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,922
he shot himseIf.
Oh, weII.

924
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,062
-Nice.
-What do you think?

925
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:12,405
Nice wood. Nice wood.
Who buiIt it?

926
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:13,534
ActuaIIy, beavers buiIt it.

927
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:15,545
There used to be a river that
fIowed right through here.

928
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:17,342
ReaIIy?
And the teIephone?

929
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,369
Where's the teIephone?

930
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:19,473
There is no phone.
I toId you...

931
00:57:19,516 --> 00:57:21,416
it was just gonna be
you, me, and the woIves.

932
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,612
This pIace cIeans up
so niceIy.

933
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:24,620
What are the sIeeping
arrangements?

934
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:27,817
That's it.
Just one mattress.

935
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:32,261
-You don't snore, do you?
-No. OnIy in the daytime.

936
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:34,627
At night I just,
you know, tend to weep.

937
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,154
Look, why don't
I take the couch?

938
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,224
Because then,
it'II be Iike we're married.

939
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:40,293
Yeah, I think we'II be
very happy together.

940
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:42,931
WeII, you know, or not.

941
00:57:42,973 --> 00:57:45,100
Yeah. Or not.

942
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,339
This is...

943
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:29,147
freezing.

944
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:04,777
I'm OK.

945
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:27,671
Do you have worms?

946
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,872
-FIy fishing?
-Yeah.

947
00:59:29,913 --> 00:59:31,744
You never fIy fish
with anything aIive.

948
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:32,770
Dead worms.

949
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:34,147
What are you gonna be
doing for HaIIoween?

950
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:35,674
Where are you fishing?

951
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,153
-The river.
-Right.

952
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:40,850
Did you ever consider
getting a spinning outfit?

953
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,654
Maybe for HaIIoween, huh?

954
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:45,490
-How deep is this river?
-Not very deep.

955
00:59:45,528 --> 00:59:47,052
So, do you want beetIes,
ants, or wet nymph?

956
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:48,155
Wet nymph?

957
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:50,166
Yeah. You know,
a bug in its nymph phase.

958
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,259
It fIoats to the surface,
hatches, dries its wings...

959
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:53,860
fIies into a bush,
crashes into the water...

960
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:54,871
Iays its eggs and then dies.

961
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,998
-Oh, my God.
-Where's the maIe?

962
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,029
MiIes away.

963
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,043
WeII, isn't that
a famiIiar story?

964
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,780
Your pumpkin.

965
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:14,483
This is EIIie Stoddard.

966
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:16,549
I'm not in, or I'm asIeep.

967
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:17,787
Leave a message.

968
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:23,222
EIIie, it's me.
Pick up, wiII you?

969
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:26,899
WiII you pIease pick up?
I need to taIk to you.

970
01:00:26,937 --> 01:00:29,497
AIice, don't even
think about it. AII right?

971
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,530
I need to taIk to you.
PIease?

972
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,399
Sorry--

973
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:38,005
Goes Iike this first.

974
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:40,846
HoId stiII. Got it.

975
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:46,218
HeIIo!

976
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:48,816
HeIIo! Up here!

977
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,396
Hi. Remember me from
the pIane to Mississippi?

978
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

979
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:58,133
My name's Eugenie.

980
01:00:58,168 --> 01:00:59,396
Eugenie CIaybourne.

981
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:00,960
Porter. Porter Stoddard.

982
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:02,699
Yes, I know.
Porter Stoddard.

983
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,730
This is my friend Griffin.

984
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:10,212
Why don't you come see me?
I'm at the Iodge.

985
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:12,840
Oh, I don't
get into town much.

986
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:14,440
I reaIIy need to see you.

987
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:17,248
I have something very
important to teII you.

988
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:18,982
What about?
What do you--

989
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:20,455
Watch it, watch it.

990
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:23,247
You aII right?

991
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:28,789
Oh, I bruised myseIf
on the rock.

992
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:52,188
Hi.

993
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:53,814
-Hi.
-How are you?

994
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:54,949
Oh, sit down. Sit down.

995
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:58,188
-You remember Griffin?
-Oh, I Iove the name Griffin.

996
01:01:58,228 --> 01:01:59,627
I had a IoveIy friend
named Griffin.

997
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:00,993
LoveIier than me?

998
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:02,692
He died terribIy young.

999
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,935
In Borneo.
We were to be married.

1000
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,302
-Sorry.
-That is too bad.

1001
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:11,204
A native tribe found him...

1002
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,540
fIoating in his canoe,
haIf-deIirious.

1003
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:16,238
And they took him
back to their wagas.

1004
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:17,337
Wagas?

1005
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,745
That's what they caII
their huts.

1006
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:20,682
Right.

1007
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:21,911
And they tended to him...

1008
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,578
and nursed his wounds
and aII, and...

1009
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,123
When he was better...

1010
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,561
they cooked him and ate him.

1011
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:39,826
Do you mean they actuaIIy--

1012
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,063
Do you mind if we
don't taIk about this?

1013
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:42,628
It's terribIy upsetting.

1014
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:47,436
Where are you going?

1015
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:51,747
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to my waga.

1016
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:53,305
You can handIe this
on your own.

1017
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:07,724
It's amazing how much
this pIace has changed.

1018
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:08,992
When my parents buiIt
their house...

1019
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:12,195
it was just ranchers
and a few ski bums.

1020
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,600
Your parents
have a house here?

1021
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,433
My father
stiII Ioves to ski.

1022
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,963
He won a goId medaI
in the biathIon.

1023
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:20,874
-The biathIon?
-Skiing and shooting.

1024
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,378
Wow. Shooting and skiing.
When was that?

1025
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:26,439
-What OIympics?
-I'm not teIIing you.

1026
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:32,279
1952. OsIo.

1027
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:40,895
He--he came up here
to be with Ernest.

1028
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,158
He was devoted.

1029
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,495
-Ernest Hemingway?
-Yes.

1030
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:47,200
Are they here right now?

1031
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:48,898
I'd Iove to meet 'em.

1032
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:50,769
-My parents?
-Yeah.

1033
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:09,654
Your parents are
very traditionaI.

1034
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,455
They're gonna Iike you
very much.

1035
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,222
Buttons!

1036
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:20,124
Daddy.

1037
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:28,201
What the Sam HiII
is that noise? Mother?

1038
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:30,212
Daddy, this is Porter Stoddard.

1039
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:33,306
You Iook a IittIe soft.
Are you out of shape?

1040
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:36,375
I do my 100 sit-ups every day.

1041
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,983
-HeIIo.
-Who's the stud?

1042
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:41,820
Mother, this is Porter Stoddard.

1043
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,621
So, what brings you
up the mountain?

1044
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,152
A vacation.

1045
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:49,392
Vacation.

1046
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:56,964
KiIimanjaro is
a snow-covered mountain...

1047
01:04:57,006 --> 01:05:00,407
19,710 feet high.

1048
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:03,503
Said to be the highest
mountain in Africa.

1049
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:08,074
The western summit
is caIIed by the Masai...

1050
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:12,952
Negaji negai--
a house of God.

1051
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:17,323
CIose to the summit Iies
the dried and frozen carcass...

1052
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,385
of a Ieopard.

1053
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:23,229
No one has ever expIained
what the Ieopard was seeking...

1054
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:24,733
at that aItitude.

1055
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:26,632
Hemingway.

1056
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:30,995
I understand that you were
an intimate of Hemingway's.

1057
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,337
Intimate?

1058
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,275
Is that some kind
of homo thing?

1059
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,744
Take your finger
out of your bunghoIe, Peregrine.

1060
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,110
Where's my drink?

1061
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:39,444
Where's the swizzIe stick?

1062
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:41,848
Just stir it with that big
swinging dick of yours.

1063
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:44,648
Aren't they wonderfuI?

1064
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,814
Eugenie teIIs me...

1065
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:49,086
that you won the goId medaI
in the biathIon.

1066
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,992
It was 1952. Norway.

1067
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:53,393
It snowed heaviIy--

1068
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:56,728
Just give him his fucking drink,
you oId muff-diver.

1069
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:58,290
Mother, pIease.

1070
01:05:58,334 --> 01:05:59,494
Henry, you cocksucker...

1071
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,025
couId we have some ice
over here, pIease?

1072
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,697
Don't pay
any attention to her.

1073
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:04,866
Nah. Thank you.

1074
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:06,898
Mother, I think you reaIIy
have a probIem.

1075
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:09,571
You are damned right
I have a probIem.

1076
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:11,136
He won't do it
to me anymore.

1077
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,512
Yes, his Iimp carrot is
the root of aII my probIems.

1078
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:16,518
AII my doctors teII me so.

1079
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:18,144
Cheers.

1080
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:21,350
Every motherfucking
one of them.

1081
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:29,391
Fucking...
going back upstairs.

1082
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:36,329
With 6-foot drifts...

1083
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:38,237
there's no getting down
the mountain tonight.

1084
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:39,798
So, good night, Stoddard.

1085
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:41,969
You'II be sIeeping
in Button's room...

1086
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,174
and Button's
sIeeping in my den.

1087
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,583
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night, Daddy.

1088
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:04,593
That tickIes.

1089
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:23,481
-Hi.
-Hi.

1090
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:26,318
-Oh, no.
-What?

1091
01:07:26,356 --> 01:07:28,119
They can't be down here.
They'II be angry.

1092
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:29,146
Who?

1093
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:34,485
Thomas has Stuffy.

1094
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,055
BoogIy Boo has FIuffy.

1095
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,500
The other Ted has PiIIow
and FIoppy.

1096
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:41,025
And Rocket has Stiffy.

1097
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:42,230
Stiffy?

1098
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:43,260
Yeah.

1099
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:46,200
Do you think this
is a good idea?

1100
01:07:46,242 --> 01:07:47,300
I think your father
was pretty cIear...

1101
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:48,310
about not, you know--

1102
01:07:48,344 --> 01:07:50,244
-You're fIoppy.
-No, I just--

1103
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,804
You be FIoppy.
I'II be FIuffy.

1104
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:56,341
Oh, OK.

1105
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,142
I'm FIoppy?

1106
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:22,109
Hi, Mr. CIaybourne.
We're just pIaying.

1107
01:08:22,145 --> 01:08:24,773
I'm--I'm FIoppy.
You know this game?

1108
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:28,181
Yes. I know FIoppy weII....

1109
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:31,747
and aII his friends.

1110
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:40,754
Stoddard, I'm not a prude,
but Iet me put it this way:

1111
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:44,358
Button is a princess,
you see.

1112
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,027
And that makes you
the prince.

1113
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:49,469
And the prince
must fight a dragon...

1114
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:50,733
to get to his princess.

1115
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:56,875
I am that dragon.

1116
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:01,574
And you, Button...

1117
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:06,078
are my BoogIy Boo.

1118
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:08,383
Oh, Daddy.

1119
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:14,087
Stoddard...

1120
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,468
Night, Daddy.

1121
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:35,406
Ah, OK.

1122
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,009
I'm so sIeepy.

1123
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:38,350
You don't want to pIay?

1124
01:09:38,387 --> 01:09:40,321
WeII, I'm a IittIe sIeepy.

1125
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,654
WeII, Iet's just cuddIe.

1126
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:44,182
-OK.
-OK.

1127
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,227
Just because you made
one bad choice in a woman...

1128
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,238
doesn't mean we need
to sit around here aII night.

1129
01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:31,763
I mean, reaIIy, there's
pIenty of fish in the sea.

1130
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:33,499
I wonder what fish say.

1131
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:35,067
''Hey, there's pIenty
of chicks on the beach.''

1132
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,674
Hey, Iook who's here.

1133
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:45,354
Happy birthday to you

1134
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:48,448
Happy birthday to you

1135
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:53,190
Happy birthday, Mr. President

1136
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,522
Happy birthday to you

1137
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:58,727
Remember?

1138
01:10:58,768 --> 01:10:59,996
From the hardware store.

1139
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:01,731
You asked me what I was
doing on HaIIoween.

1140
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,363
This is what i'm doing.

1141
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:04,771
I'm going to the party
with you guys.

1142
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:07,401
-That's fantastic.
-We can't do that.

1143
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:09,070
-Why not?
-Yeah. Why not?

1144
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,409
Because we're on a sort
of a retreat.

1145
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:13,540
Wow, who's reading SoIzhenitsyn?

1146
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,073
That's fantastic.

1147
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:16,914
Aren't they great,
the Russians?

1148
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,945
Dostoyevsky, GogoI, Turgenev.

1149
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:23,220
AII that gIoom
and IoneIiness and desperation.

1150
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:25,090
Are you guys gay?

1151
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:26,094
Hey, I don't mind.

1152
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:28,426
CoupIe of guys out here...

1153
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,432
in the middIe of nowhere
reading books about men...

1154
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:32,093
aII jammed in prison together.

1155
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:36,195
HuddIed together for warmth
and companionship.

1156
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:37,705
WeII, you know,
there's no reason...

1157
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,934
we couIdn't go to the party...

1158
01:11:38,975 --> 01:11:42,206
for just, Iike, an hour, huh?

1159
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:43,211
What are you taIking about?

1160
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:44,769
Where are you going?

1161
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:45,872
To get your costumes.

1162
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:48,008
What do you
think of Pushkin, huh?

1163
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,444
Hey, you're going as Pushkin.

1164
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:55,286
A kiss on the hand

1165
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:58,191
May be quite continentaI

1166
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:03,255
But diamonds
are a girI's best friend

1167
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:06,462
A kiss may be grand

1168
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:10,700
But it won't pay the rentaI
on your humbIe fIat

1169
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,139
This is stupid, Tom !

1170
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:15,769
Why wouId your father come to
a godforsaken pIace Iike this?

1171
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:19,008
Maybe he wanted to get away
from irritating women.

1172
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:20,379
Maybe that's it.

1173
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,974
Where are you going?

1174
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:24,179
I'm gonna see if anybody
here couId heIp us, OK?

1175
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,589
Champagne and a cherry.

1176
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:34,095
WiII you get me
another margarita?

1177
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,097
Thank you.

1178
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:36,598
Hey, I need another margarita.

1179
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:37,599
I'm sweating.

1180
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:38,793
-You're what?
-I'm sweating.

1181
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:39,801
You shouId be sweating.

1182
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,393
It's hot,
and you're a poIar bear...

1183
01:12:41,437 --> 01:12:45,339
and we're in the continentaI
United States.

1184
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:47,604
Listen, I want to go taIk
to that spider by the door.

1185
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:50,168
-Which spider?
-The one with the 6 Iegs.

1186
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:51,770
WouId you just keep
MariIyn occupied...

1187
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:53,008
for just a coupIe minutes?

1188
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:54,016
No.

1189
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,642
For the King?
For the King?

1190
01:12:55,685 --> 01:12:56,652
You'd do it--

1191
01:12:56,686 --> 01:12:58,381
I need a margarita.
I'm sweating.

1192
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:00,981
I think the straw
went down my Ieg.

1193
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:03,355
She was the onIy one
who had sympathy for him...

1194
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:06,020
because he was so deaf
from the beIIs.

1195
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:07,029
What?

1196
01:13:07,063 --> 01:13:08,724
He was deaf from
the beIIs, you know.

1197
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:10,994
And EsmeraIda is the
onIy one who feIt bad...

1198
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:12,898
and had pity towards him
because he was deaf.

1199
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,334
-What?
-He was deaf!

1200
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:16,798
Hi. You know...

1201
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:17,965
I gotta teII you,
I'm a Ieg man...

1202
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:21,067
and these two
have been driving me crazy.

1203
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:23,135
The whoIe outfit.
It's fantastic.

1204
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:24,237
Yeah. Yeah. Yours, too.

1205
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,214
Thank you.

1206
01:13:26,248 --> 01:13:28,148
Are you EIvis
or EveI KnieveI?

1207
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:39,158
I'm gonna have to get out
of here in a IittIe bit, OK?

1208
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:41,459
I'm sorry.
I'm not in a very...

1209
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:03,552
-I stiII don't--
-EIvis. It's EIvis.

1210
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:04,985
Oh. Heh. EIvis.

1211
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:26,701
You know what?
You're wrong.

1212
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:27,868
You're just wrong.
That's aII.

1213
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:28,877
You're generaIizing.

1214
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:30,378
AII men are not the same.

1215
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:33,575
AII I'm saying is that
in my experience--

1216
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:35,049
What experience!

1217
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:36,711
You're 19 years oId,
for God's sakes.

1218
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:37,776
You don't
have any experience!

1219
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,653
AII I'm saying is that
it's a scientific fact...

1220
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,247
that the connection
between the bIood suppIy...

1221
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,020
to the brain
and the bIood suppIy...

1222
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,459
to the penis
are basicaIIy the same.

1223
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:48,759
Hey, you know what?
Just don't taIk anymore.

1224
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:12,550
What the heII is that?

1225
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:32,339
There's gotta be a hoIe
in here somewhere.

1226
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,613
There's peopIe here.

1227
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:46,678
What a surprise.

1228
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:48,818
Dad?

1229
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,397
I can't get
this thing off.

1230
01:15:56,432 --> 01:15:59,560
This is Auburn.
This is my friend Auburn.

1231
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:02,298
This is HoIIy,
and this is Tom.

1232
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:04,738
-That's my son, Tom.
-Oh.

1233
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:05,762
Let's go.

1234
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:16,582
Where you going, Tom?

1235
01:16:40,743 --> 01:16:43,712
OK, OK. If there's
one thing I know now...

1236
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:45,373
it's that nothing
matters anymore...

1237
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:48,042
except going back
and fixing this mess.

1238
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:51,382
Making EIIie Iisten to me
whether she wants to or not.

1239
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,888
Letting her see
how much I care.

1240
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:55,584
Just taking her in my arms...

1241
01:16:55,624 --> 01:16:58,559
and saying,
''EIIie, I am your husband.

1242
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:03,827
I am not a poIar bear.
I am not a poIar bear.''

1243
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:17,404
Stay here.

1244
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:22,547
I wish he wouIdn't
get so upset.

1245
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,449
WeII, he is upset.
That man Ieft you...

1246
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:26,249
in the middIe of the night
without a word.

1247
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:27,846
Left you Iike a used KIeenex.

1248
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,551
Oh, Mother, but if
it doesn't bother me--

1249
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:30,888
Left you Iike a $2.00 hooker.

1250
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,338
Oh, dear.

1251
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:49,741
WeII, did you kiII it, oh,
great, white asshoIe hunter?

1252
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:07,696
If there's one positive thing
that's come from this trip...

1253
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,164
it's that I've reaIIy grown
to Iove that cabin.

1254
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:58,076
-How are you?
-Oh, God. I'm meeting Didier.

1255
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:00,104
Didier, huh?
Listen, Iisten.

1256
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:02,344
Things are very cIear now.
Things are very cIear.

1257
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:06,150
I'm compIeteIy committed
to my wife and to my marriage...

1258
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:08,088
and I aIways wiII
be, but I just--

1259
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,090
I don't want you to think...

1260
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,216
that I'm the kind
of person who's not...

1261
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:12,853
going to step up
and take fuII responsibiIity.

1262
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,090
You know what I mean
by responsibiIity?

1263
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,620
FuII responsibiIity?

1264
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:18,860
Huh? Yeah, for
the baby, I mean.

1265
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:20,869
A baby? A baby?

1266
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:23,497
You're having a baby?

1267
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:25,029
Oh, my God.

1268
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:29,806
Of course, you'II be taking
responsibiIity at your age.

1269
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:31,176
What about your wife?

1270
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:32,840
She must be thriIIed
having a baby.

1271
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,209
Taxi!

1272
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,377
Don't you have, Iike,
two grown chiIdren aIready?

1273
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,083
Listen, there's nothing
to be frightened of, Porter.

1274
01:19:42,124 --> 01:19:44,718
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

1275
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:51,262
It sounds Iike you have
the perfect reIationship.

1276
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,824
I mean, Didier and I do, too...

1277
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:53,926
and it's not easy,
because I'm--

1278
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:56,961
I'm so unpredictabIe
and Didier's such a Ioner.

1279
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:59,439
But when he found out
that he's gonna be a daddy...

1280
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:01,966
that's Iike--it changed
everything between us, you know?

1281
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,810
But Iisten, you know
when we first met?

1282
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:05,814
Yeah.

1283
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:08,578
-I had no idea.
-No idea? What?

1284
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:09,879
That I was pregnant.
I had no idea.

1285
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:11,249
ReaIIy?

1286
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:13,254
-Yeah. Wish me Iuck, OK?
-Good Iuck, good Iuck.

1287
01:20:13,288 --> 01:20:16,052
-Good Iuck, Porter.
-Good Iuck.

1288
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:24,326
Can I taIk to Tom, pIease?

1289
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:27,995
-Stoddard no aqui.
-Ha ha! No aqui.

1290
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:29,060
¿Donde?

1291
01:20:29,104 --> 01:20:30,071
If you know
what I mean.

1292
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:31,732
Institute Design.

1293
01:20:31,773 --> 01:20:34,742
-Institution of what?
-Institute Design.

1294
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:38,234
OK. AII right, gracias.

1295
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,043
Hasta Iuego.

1296
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:49,447
Tom, wait. Shit.

1297
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,669
Now, if you'II pardon,
it's tabIe number 11.

1298
01:21:05,707 --> 01:21:08,437
Your award wiII be
the penuItimate.

1299
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:11,241
The penuItimate?
Oh, my God.

1300
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,908
Oh, dear. OK, aII right.
Prepare to bow.

1301
01:21:15,717 --> 01:21:16,706
HeIIo.

1302
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:24,923
Have you ever stopped
to think about...

1303
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,928
how IittIe we know
about each other?

1304
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:30,662
Good, good--

1305
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,034
Sorry.

1306
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,899
Thank you so much.

1307
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:36,768
I wouId Iike
to say a few words...

1308
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:39,797
about dinnerware
and cutIery, where it's been.

1309
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:40,830
Mom.

1310
01:21:43,912 --> 01:21:44,879
What?

1311
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:46,608
WouIdn't it be nice
if Dad were here?

1312
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:47,637
I'm sorry, AIice.

1313
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:49,048
I don't want to taIk
about that right now.

1314
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:50,676
I know, but Iisten--

1315
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:54,050
Oh, my God.

1316
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:56,455
Oh, you stained it.

1317
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:58,482
I'II take care of it.
I'II handIe it.

1318
01:21:58,527 --> 01:22:00,256
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, AIice.

1319
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,492
She spiIIed some
wine on her, um...

1320
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:06,831
Listen, I've got to teII
you about the redhead.

1321
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:08,836
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

1322
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:10,098
-Yes, I do.
-Why?

1323
01:22:10,138 --> 01:22:12,072
Because we're best friends.
That's what best friends do.

1324
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:13,506
They share certain
important detaiIs.

1325
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,737
Not now, OK?

1326
01:22:15,777 --> 01:22:17,074
That Iooks awfuI.

1327
01:22:17,112 --> 01:22:18,306
I know what I'm gonna do.

1328
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:19,507
I'm just gonna Iead
a nice, simpIe...

1329
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:21,607
quiet, contempIative,
ceIibate Iife.

1330
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,584
I'm just gonna pIunge
into work. Excuse me.

1331
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:26,179
WeII, you're very Iucky that
you get to pIunge into work.

1332
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:28,519
Oh, and I have aIways been
so jeaIous of you, EIIie.

1333
01:22:28,557 --> 01:22:30,320
Oh, reaIIy?
Have you reaIIy?

1334
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:31,553
WeII, yeah, you're--

1335
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:32,560
WeII, Iet me
teII you something.

1336
01:22:32,594 --> 01:22:33,788
Here's the truth.

1337
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:35,023
I've aIways been
jeaIous of you.

1338
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:37,930
-What?
-Yes, yes.

1339
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:40,797
-That cracks me up.
Why?

1340
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:44,067
Because I think Porter aIways
had a kind of thing for you.

1341
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:46,802
You did? ReaIIy?

1342
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:50,169
EIIie--

1343
01:22:50,212 --> 01:22:52,612
-Hi.
-Hi, heIIo.

1344
01:22:52,648 --> 01:22:54,081
Oh, that's so sad.

1345
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:55,777
That beautifuI suit.
You need white wine.

1346
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:58,149
-White wine?
-PuIIs the red right out.

1347
01:22:58,186 --> 01:22:59,847
Oh. What were
you saying? Just--

1348
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,651
What do you mean?
What I was saying?

1349
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,749
Oh, yeah, about him
having, Iike, a thing--

1350
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:04,816
That's a very pretty
coIor of Iipstick.

1351
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,986
Oh, it's caIIed
''Evening Rose.''

1352
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:06,995
You want to try it?

1353
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,894
Oh, no, no.
Thanks very much.

1354
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,056
ActuaIIy, it's for Iuck.

1355
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:11,065
I wear it whenever I pIay.

1356
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:12,327
What do you pIay?

1357
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:15,666
Oh, RaveI, Stravinsky,
Bach, Haydn--

1358
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:16,830
No, I meant what instrument?

1359
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:18,169
EIIie.

1360
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:20,902
This is a beautifuI
buiIding.

1361
01:23:20,942 --> 01:23:22,773
I just Iove architecture,
don't you?

1362
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:24,972
My fiancé is an architect.

1363
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:26,310
Architect?

1364
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:27,610
We're going to eIope tonight.

1365
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:30,277
Oh, that's
so romantic. God.

1366
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:32,446
You shouId use
hair spray on that.

1367
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:34,182
-Hair spray?
-I promise.

1368
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:37,123
I de-stained an entire sofa
once with hair spray.

1369
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:39,320
Let's try it.
Thank you very much.

1370
01:23:39,361 --> 01:23:41,761
You know, I have a friend
who is an architect.

1371
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:43,094
Maybe your fiancé
knows him.

1372
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:44,359
What's his name?

1373
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:46,924
Hey, excuse me.
This thing isn't over, is it?

1374
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:48,833
No, no, no, but I think
you've missed dinner.

1375
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,462
Oh, that's OK.
I ate on the pIane.

1376
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:52,700
How'd you get
that yeIIow stain?

1377
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:54,106
Both: yeIIow.

1378
01:23:54,142 --> 01:23:55,370
ActuaIIy, I wasn't
even invited.

1379
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,604
I'm kind of sneaking in.

1380
01:23:56,645 --> 01:23:57,634
Why?

1381
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,647
Oh, boy, it's
a Iong story. Um--

1382
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:00,807
Mom.

1383
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,840
Oh, aII right.
OK, aII right.

1384
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:04,442
We're coming.
We're coming.

1385
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:05,475
Bye-bye.

1386
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:09,818
I've got to teII
you something.

1387
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:10,825
Go ahead.

1388
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:11,883
OK, this is difficuIt.

1389
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,623
Just say it.
Just say it.

1390
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:22,901
''O tan-faced prairie-boy...

1391
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:29,108
''before you came to camp
came many a weIcome gift;

1392
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:33,513
You came, taciturn,
with nothing to give.''

1393
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:37,651
What are you
taIking about?

1394
01:24:37,686 --> 01:24:40,416
''We but Iook'd
on each other, when Io!

1395
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:44,016
More than aII the gifts
in the worId you gave me.''

1396
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,026
What?

1397
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,551
''O Tan-faced Prairie-Boy.''

1398
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:48,927
Whitman.

1399
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:51,091
Make the Iight, pIease.

1400
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,131
Hi.

1401
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:59,000
-What are you doing here?
-WeII, I came to see you.

1402
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,029
Why?

1403
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:07,281
Porter, I want to teII Mona
something reaIIy important.

1404
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:08,646
What?

1405
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:09,809
That I'm...

1406
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,250
-What?
-That I'm...

1407
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:13,015
What, what,
what, what?

1408
01:25:13,054 --> 01:25:15,454
-That I'm--
-Pay the man, wiII you?

1409
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,514
Wait. Porter.

1410
01:25:16,558 --> 01:25:18,617
Porter, just a second.

1411
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,184
PIease, um...

1412
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:22,219
And you came aII
the way here just to--

1413
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:23,424
Yeah, I feIt Iike
I owed it to to you.

1414
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:26,593
He aIso said that
she is the onIy woman...

1415
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:28,034
that he has ever Ioved...

1416
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,627
and he thinks about her
aII the time...

1417
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,002
and you and your sister.

1418
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,702
And that without you aII
his Iife wouId be meaningIess.

1419
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:35,869
Can't you understand?

1420
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,902
It's Iike getting rid
of this great burden...

1421
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,880
and now I can move
forward with my Iife...

1422
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:41,405
you know, naked and unashamed.

1423
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,941
WeII not,
you know, naked, but--

1424
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:45,384
but certainIy unashamed.

1425
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,047
And none of this, Porter,
wouId have happened...

1426
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:50,114
if I hadn't gone into that
IittIe cafe down in Tribeca.

1427
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:53,616
AII I wanted was a cafe au Iait,
and I got WaIter!

1428
01:25:53,662 --> 01:25:55,459
Wish me Iuck.

1429
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:01,397
EIIie, your handyman.

1430
01:26:02,437 --> 01:26:06,533
Oh, no. Shh...
Oh, this is--

1431
01:26:09,611 --> 01:26:11,203
I'm sorry.
This is not the pIace--

1432
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:12,804
You're embarrassing--

1433
01:26:12,848 --> 01:26:14,179
you're embarrassing my famiIy...

1434
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:15,547
you're embarrassing
my friends...

1435
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:17,449
and you're
embarrassing yourseIf.

1436
01:26:17,486 --> 01:26:19,454
WouId you pIease pipe down.

1437
01:26:19,488 --> 01:26:20,682
I'm sorry, sir.
I said I'm sorry.

1438
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,747
Do we have a probIem here?

1439
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,850
Just pipe down, OK?

1440
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,326
OK, if somebody's
gonna pipe down...

1441
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:28,454
I think you're gonna be
the one that pipes down.

1442
01:26:28,497 --> 01:26:29,930
Security!

1443
01:26:34,336 --> 01:26:35,803
You don't have
to expIain anything.

1444
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:37,099
Oh, yes, I do.

1445
01:26:40,842 --> 01:26:41,831
AII right,
aII right.

1446
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:52,118
Mona, I'm gay!

1447
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:58,391
I'm a proud, gay,
human person.

1448
01:26:58,426 --> 01:26:59,757
Bravo.

1449
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:12,802
Did he say ''gay''?

1450
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:17,574
Good night, gentIemen.
Good-bye.

1451
01:27:26,521 --> 01:27:29,319
Where are you going?

1452
01:27:29,357 --> 01:27:31,917
Porter, where are you going?

1453
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,019
What--Porter,
what are you doing?

1454
01:27:34,062 --> 01:27:35,723
Oh, that's a bad idea.

1455
01:27:41,603 --> 01:27:46,336
Our next awardee has shown us
that the art of fabric design...

1456
01:27:46,374 --> 01:27:48,342
is not onIy aIive and weII...

1457
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:51,368
but fIourishing.
EIeanor Stoddard.

1458
01:27:51,413 --> 01:27:53,347
Oh, thank you.

1459
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:57,949
Oh, my God.

1460
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:10,854
Oh, Roberta.
Thank you very much.

1461
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:15,431
I--here.

1462
01:28:22,744 --> 01:28:25,338
Oh. Hi.

1463
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,972
Do you know her?

1464
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,983
No, no.

1465
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:30,484
That ceIIist?

1466
01:28:30,518 --> 01:28:32,247
-Yes, yes.
-Oh, man.

1467
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,282
She's the ceIIist, right?

1468
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:37,382
What?

1469
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:38,619
Porter, Iisten, I--

1470
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,390
I have to taIk to you
about something eIse--

1471
01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:43,158
Hi.

1472
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:46,222
-Hi.
-Hi.

1473
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:49,066
Um...
heIIo again. Hi.

1474
01:28:49,104 --> 01:28:50,071
Hi.

1475
01:28:50,105 --> 01:28:51,572
You know what? I wouId
just Iike to teII you...

1476
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:53,767
that you have
a reaIIy great son...

1477
01:28:53,808 --> 01:28:55,469
and a great husband.

1478
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,477
Nothing happened, you know.

1479
01:28:56,511 --> 01:28:58,035
We were just in the snow,
and I was on top of him...

1480
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:00,206
kind of near his face
so it Iooked...

1481
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:02,978
Iike, um, weII,
he'II expIain it to you.

1482
01:29:03,018 --> 01:29:04,451
Get some sIeep, OK?

1483
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:10,757
Is there any woman in this room
you haven't sIept with, Porter?

1484
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:12,191
ObviousIy not.

1485
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:14,127
Everybody back.

1486
01:29:17,132 --> 01:29:18,394
Back.

1487
01:29:18,433 --> 01:29:19,798
Aah! Oh, my God.

1488
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,965
You refused my hospitaIity...

1489
01:29:28,009 --> 01:29:30,034
you insuIted
my beIoved daughter--

1490
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,443
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

1491
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,522
Sir, can you expIain
who this man is?

1492
01:29:41,556 --> 01:29:43,421
Can you expIain
any of this?

1493
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,447
Sir?

1494
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,060
AII right, can we just
turn our attention...

1495
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,860
to the Iast page
of the possessions Iist.

1496
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:52,628
Is there anything
missing from it?

1497
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:55,431
-Yes, WiIIie and CharIie.
-Ooh, your chiIdren.

1498
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,903
No, no, no.
Our dogs.

1499
01:29:56,938 --> 01:29:58,405
Yes, of course.
The dogs.

1500
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,668
And I'II keep the dogs.

1501
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,676
I think the dogs wouId be
better off with me.

1502
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,235
-Why wouId you say that?
-They're happier with me.

1503
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:05,769
You're the one who
said they adored me.

1504
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:06,906
They're intimidated by you.

1505
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:08,415
They just pretend
to adore you.

1506
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,712
You see, they're highIy
inteIIigent dogs--

1507
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:10,718
Let's settIe the dog issue--

1508
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:11,946
They Iove being
in the country...

1509
01:30:11,986 --> 01:30:13,886
where they were trained.
I did that.

1510
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,856
You did that.
The country.

1511
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:18,017
I don't think we decided
who gets the house.

1512
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:19,151
I have.

1513
01:30:19,194 --> 01:30:21,458
I designed the house--
it took two years.

1514
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:22,827
I buiIt aII those rooms
for the kids...

1515
01:30:22,864 --> 01:30:24,627
with my own hands.
Did you do that?

1516
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,258
I furnished the house--
it took 7 years.

1517
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:28,633
I gave birth to our two kids
with my own Ioins.

1518
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:29,796
Did you do that?

1519
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:33,069
So, I guess I'II be
Iiving in the apartment.

1520
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:34,097
Yeah?

1521
01:30:36,444 --> 01:30:38,674
Did I say that?
I don't beIieve I said that.

1522
01:30:38,713 --> 01:30:40,271
Hi.

1523
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:41,612
Hi.

1524
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:42,843
Didn't mean to scare you.

1525
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:45,182
Oh, no, you didn't scare me.

1526
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:47,347
You startIed me.
I just wasn't expecting--

1527
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:48,514
-To see me?
-To see you.

1528
01:30:48,556 --> 01:30:49,523
Ever?

1529
01:30:49,557 --> 01:30:51,320
No, of course not.
Not ever.

1530
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:53,156
I mean, I knew I'd bump
into you someday.

1531
01:30:53,194 --> 01:30:54,559
BIess you.

1532
01:30:54,596 --> 01:30:56,723
God, have you ever thought of
having this stuff cIeaned?

1533
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:58,289
I think about it constantIy.

1534
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,766
That one comes
with a surgicaI mask.

1535
01:30:59,801 --> 01:31:01,291
Don't be funny.

1536
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:03,429
What I have come here
to say is very serious.

1537
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:04,597
You Iook great, by the way.

1538
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,266
And don't say fIattering
things, either.

1539
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:08,673
OK. I'II do my best.

1540
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:11,042
Anything eIse
I shouId try to avoid?

1541
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:12,979
I'II teII you as we go aIong.

1542
01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:16,541
How's EIIie?
Have you seen here?

1543
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:18,950
-I taIked to her.
-How is she?

1544
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:20,852
-Terrific.
-Good.

1545
01:31:22,924 --> 01:31:24,858
How's Porter?

1546
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:26,451
FabuIous.

1547
01:31:26,494 --> 01:31:28,291
One birch-bark canoe.

1548
01:31:28,329 --> 01:31:29,387
I'II take the canoe.

1549
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,397
The canoe goes
with the house.

1550
01:31:30,431 --> 01:31:31,398
You hate the canoe.

1551
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:32,729
I don't hate the canoe.
I hate rowing.

1552
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:33,893
You get seasick.

1553
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:35,664
I Iike getting
seasick sometimes.

1554
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:37,432
And besides,
the kids Iike--

1555
01:31:37,472 --> 01:31:38,496
The kids? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1556
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,734
What are you
taIking about?

1557
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:40,763
We haven't taIked
about the kids yet.

1558
01:31:40,809 --> 01:31:41,776
WeII, we're taIking
about them right now.

1559
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,141
CouId we taIk about
the chiIdren Iater?

1560
01:31:43,178 --> 01:31:44,304
That's a whoIe
different issue.

1561
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:45,539
The chiIdren are 65.

1562
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,639
I think they're oId enough
to decide for themseIves.

1563
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,206
OK, weII, I think
my daughter wiII decide...

1564
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,308
she wants to be
with her father.

1565
01:31:50,351 --> 01:31:51,716
Oh, so now you want
to spIit up the kids?

1566
01:31:51,753 --> 01:31:52,742
Yeah, fine, fine.

1567
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:54,015
If that's what's
fair, that's fine.

1568
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:55,682
OK, so fair?
So what?

1569
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:57,623
You want one kid
and you want one dog...

1570
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:58,717
and you want
haIf the canoe.

1571
01:31:58,760 --> 01:31:59,988
Good. A haIf a canoe
wouId be fine.

1572
01:32:00,028 --> 01:32:01,757
I don't think so,
Porter, and I don't think...

1573
01:32:01,796 --> 01:32:03,320
that that wouId hoId up
in any court in the Iand.

1574
01:32:03,364 --> 01:32:05,195
PIease, Iet's not
taIk about courts.

1575
01:32:06,534 --> 01:32:08,126
Mona, you don't
have to teII me.

1576
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:09,761
Yes, just Iet me get this out.

1577
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:11,271
PIease, Griffin.

1578
01:32:11,306 --> 01:32:13,103
Don't fuck it up.
I am teIIing you...

1579
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:15,905
there are some things
that are better Ieft unsaid.

1580
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:17,571
We don't need
to know everything.

1581
01:32:17,612 --> 01:32:19,170
Griffin, can you
Iook me in the eye...

1582
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:20,511
and say that
there are some things...

1583
01:32:20,548 --> 01:32:22,880
that are best Ieft unsaid?

1584
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:24,748
Have you Iost your mind?

1585
01:32:24,786 --> 01:32:26,777
After Iiving 20 years
of a Iie...

1586
01:32:26,821 --> 01:32:29,051
when the truth wouId
have served us better?

1587
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,251
And knowing what I know now,
at Ieast I couId have had...

1588
01:32:31,292 --> 01:32:32,884
haIf a chance
of a Iife with somebody...

1589
01:32:32,927 --> 01:32:35,225
who wouIdn't make me
feeI Iike a faiIure.

1590
01:32:37,031 --> 01:32:43,402
And I spent aII those years
buying Iingerie to--

1591
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:47,272
who did you think I was buying
it for, Griffin, you?

1592
01:32:47,308 --> 01:32:48,798
Some of it.

1593
01:32:48,843 --> 01:32:50,071
WeII...

1594
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:51,669
I feIt cheap in the red teddy.

1595
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:55,111
OK, I've--that's a joke.

1596
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:57,276
PIease.
Honey, pIease don't--

1597
01:32:57,318 --> 01:32:58,512
Mona, Mona,
Iisten to me.

1598
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:00,282
I know. I know.

1599
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:01,310
-You know?
-Yes.

1600
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:03,449
And it's OK.

1601
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:04,924
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

1602
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:07,086
Oh, honey, you
know everything?

1603
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:08,095
Yes.

1604
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:09,096
Oh...

1605
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,963
Oh, doesn't this feeI good?

1606
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,059
Let's just recapituIate.

1607
01:33:14,102 --> 01:33:16,935
The Lartique photographs,
the Stark chairs.

1608
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:20,566
What about the season tickets
to the MetropoIitan?

1609
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:24,339
WeII, I'II take them.
I mean, did you ever use them?

1610
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:26,506
OK, that Ieaves
just one item.

1611
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:30,711
A first edition of FitzgeraId's
''Tender is the Night.''

1612
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,117
Did you ever read it?

1613
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:36,221
I read it out Ioud to you.
You had pneumonia.

1614
01:33:38,259 --> 01:33:39,521
You cried at the end.

1615
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:46,025
Excuse me.

1616
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:52,199
Women tend to respond
strongIy to it.

1617
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,298
It's very sentimentaI.

1618
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:56,138
I cried, too.

1619
01:33:56,177 --> 01:33:57,974
I prefer ''Gatsby,'' myseIf.

1620
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:00,037
Did you ever read it
to your wife?

1621
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:03,778
No. ActuaIIy, she doesn't
Iike the sound of my voice.

1622
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,183
Did I say something funny?

1623
01:34:09,223 --> 01:34:12,249
No, you didn't.
You said something sad.

1624
01:34:12,293 --> 01:34:15,660
WeII, I think we've done
very weII here.

1625
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:18,325
-Don't you, EIeanor?
-Yeah.

1626
01:34:24,038 --> 01:34:26,165
Very, very weII.

1627
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:27,504
Because if you think
you've been treated unfairIy...

1628
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:30,773
-in this process--
-No, it's been very fair...

1629
01:34:31,846 --> 01:34:33,211
After aII, Porter,
if you hadn't--

1630
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:34,805
I mean...

1631
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:36,714
none of this wouId have
happened if you hadn't--

1632
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:37,911
I'm sorry. What?

1633
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:40,921
WeII, if he hadn't done the...

1634
01:34:40,955 --> 01:34:44,482
aII the things that...
if he...you know, EIIie...

1635
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:46,686
if he hadn't had--
had reIations with--

1636
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:49,196
Oh, come on!
He's right! He's right!

1637
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,197
It's cIear, Iook at it.

1638
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,358
I've been
a thoughtIess sIeazebag.

1639
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,662
That's exactIy right.

1640
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:55,532
Look what I've done.
Just Iook at it.

1641
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,437
I've caused pain to everybody
in my Iife that I Iove:

1642
01:34:58,473 --> 01:35:00,805
my kids, my innocent kids...

1643
01:35:00,842 --> 01:35:02,867
my friends,
everyone that I know.

1644
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,435
My dogs! I've caused
pain to my dogs.

1645
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,107
And cIearIy I must have
been wiIIing...

1646
01:35:07,148 --> 01:35:08,479
to sacrifice everything...

1647
01:35:08,516 --> 01:35:10,746
that meant anything
at aII to me in my Iife.

1648
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:13,015
Porter, Iet's not
go overboard, aII right?

1649
01:35:13,054 --> 01:35:16,285
So you're not the perfect person
you thought you were.

1650
01:35:18,526 --> 01:35:21,324
I have no idea
who I thought I was.

1651
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:22,624
The onIy thing that I know...

1652
01:35:22,663 --> 01:35:25,689
is that I'm not
who I was when we met.

1653
01:35:25,733 --> 01:35:27,132
I'm not a kid. You know?

1654
01:35:27,168 --> 01:35:29,534
And I know now that
no empty phiIandering...

1655
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:30,969
is gonna make me
feeI Iike one...

1656
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:32,905
'cause the onIy thing
that I feIt...

1657
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,407
when I tried it was IoneIy.

1658
01:35:35,943 --> 01:35:37,638
Just IoneIy.

1659
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:39,578
And I know I'd do anything
to get you back...

1660
01:35:39,614 --> 01:35:40,581
but I've Iost you.
I know that.

1661
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:41,582
I got to Iive with that.

1662
01:35:41,616 --> 01:35:44,813
But you are who you were
when we met.

1663
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:47,514
You're just as beautifuI,
you're just as smart...

1664
01:35:47,555 --> 01:35:48,681
and you're just as honest...

1665
01:35:48,723 --> 01:35:51,851
as you were the day that
I feII in Iove with you.

1666
01:35:54,729 --> 01:35:56,390
And I am a fooI.

1667
01:35:58,566 --> 01:35:59,658
And I know that.

1668
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:07,104
So, is there anything Ieft?

1669
01:36:18,886 --> 01:36:21,116
There's a whoIe Iot Ieft.

1670
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,629
WeII, what did you expect, huh?

1671
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:35,795
I mean, come on.
Is your marriage perfect?

1672
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:38,203
Have you ever been a fooI?

1673
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:39,467
You got to keep trying, right?

1674
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:41,475
You got to keep trying,
and you got to keep hoping.

1675
01:36:41,509 --> 01:36:42,806
You got to keep hoping,
I mean...

1676
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:43,970
HeIIo, Porter.

1677
01:36:44,011 --> 01:36:45,774
There's aIways something Ieft...

1678
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:48,213
if two peopIe have ever
reaIIy Ioved each other.

1679
01:36:48,249 --> 01:36:50,376
And...

1680
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:52,352
I've never Ioved anyone eIse.

1681
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:59,486
Who knows? Maybe someday
she'II Iet me back in the door.

1682
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:04,157
Or maybe after a whiIe
she'II even Iet me upstairs.

1683
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:08,602
But, for now...

1684
01:37:08,636 --> 01:37:12,128
Iet's just hope she
Iets me down off this roof.
