1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,738
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,828
(soft music)

3
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,749
- [Lena] My name is Lena and
that's my husband, Chris.

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,818
(police sirens)

5
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,220
Here's what I remember.

6
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,957
I was 30 years old carrying
my first and only child

7
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,926
and we just got married.

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,863
It wasn't long before he
was taken away from me.

9
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:42,534
I, I hit rock bottom and was
left to figure it all out.

10
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,171
(police sirens)

11
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,978
Now I'm here.

12
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,281
It's been five years since
my husband's been gone.

13
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,617
I spent all of our savings.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,719
I lost my salon too.

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,824
So here I am back renting one
and I can barely afford that.

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,364
- [Terry] Hey mommy.

17
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,233
- [Lena] That's Terry.

18
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,200
So tired.

19
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,301
She's my closest friend.

20
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,769
I've known her for a while now.

21
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,572
She's been helping
with all of this.

22
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,774
You know what?

23
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,710
I think I'm gonna run out
and get something to eat.

24
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,977
That's what I'ma do.

25
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,411
- Yes. Can you grab
me something please?

26
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,314
- Oh no. You still
owe me from last time.

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,816
- I could owe you
hugs and kisses.

28
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,050
- Terry.

29
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,953
- Mm. You gonna leave
your bestie hangin?

30
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,822
- I'm about to run
out for lunch y'all.

31
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,157
Y'all want something?

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,358
- No, no thank you.

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,693
- All right. I'll be back.

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,264
Ah feels good in here.

35
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,466
Can I get my usual please?

36
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,334
- I got you.

37
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,169
- How you doing?

38
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,169
- All right.

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,471
- Hey, yo Black. What's good?

40
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,873
- What up, man? Hey,
let me get my usual.

41
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,941
You know how I do it?

42
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,176
- [Cook] I got you.

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,111
- I do believe I
was here before you.

44
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,312
- Oh, my bad.

45
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,580
I ain't mean to skip
in front of you.

46
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,949
Put her food on my
tab just because.

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,786
- No, I, I don't need
you to buy me anything.

48
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,021
- You might not want me to,

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,290
but I'm gonna do it
cuz I want do it.

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,925
- Thank you, sir.

51
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,726
- Wait, what you, hold on.

52
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,228
I know you hear me
talking to you. Hold on.

53
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,665
Why you in such a
rush? Pace yourself.

54
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,933
- What? You, you buy me food.

55
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,434
So you think I owe
you a conversation?

56
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,405
- I mean, I was kind of hoping
you'd pay me in another way.

57
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,041
- Oh. Okay. (laughs) Bye.

58
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,243
- Hold on wait.
I'm just playing.

59
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,744
Learn how to laugh.

60
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,246
You know what I mean? You
don't gotta be uptight.

61
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,247
I promise you.

62
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,185
- So what? I mean you think
you buy me a $20 takeout plate

63
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,253
and what?

64
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,589
- I mean $20. I mean.

65
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,424
- Oh, okay.

66
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,258
That's what we doing.

67
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,491
- Yeah.

68
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,360
- Okay. You know
what? I better go.

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,194
- How about this?

70
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,461
- I better. I better go.

71
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,729
- Look before you
go. Before you go.

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,898
I know you got places
to be. Before you go.

73
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
Here put your number in there.

74
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,704
- What is it, Black? Right?

75
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,772
I don't know you. Okay.

76
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,241
And honestly, to know me

77
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,510
is to know food is not gonna
get you my phone number.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,279
- Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,782
I was raised to give
a woman what she want.

80
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,323
Look, I run the South side

81
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,759
and pretty soon I be
running the whole city.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah.

83
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,295
They call me Black.

84
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,367
But since you won't give me
your number, just take mine.

85
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,835
How that sound?

86
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,741
Don't think too long. What's up?

87
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,577
- All right. Here.

88
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,746
- That's more like it.

89
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,217
And look, text me if you
need anything. Seriously.

90
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,218
Anything.

91
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,389
You got it? Lock me in.

92
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,224
- Wait on it. Wait on it.

93
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,958
- B L A C K, all right?

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,128
Enjoy your food by the
way. Now you can leave.

95
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,431
Ay yo G. What's good
with that food, man?

96
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
- [Terry] All right.
You look better.

97
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,941
- Mm.

98
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,777
- What happened?

99
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,777
- Oh man.

100
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,548
So I got you some food.

101
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,217
- Oh, you love me.
Thank you mama.

102
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,686
- Ah shit, what time is it?

103
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,521
- Ooh, it is.

104
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,355
- What time is it?

105
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,289
- Almost two o'clock.

106
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,623
- Okay. Let me run to the back.

107
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,791
Hubby's gonna call me, okay?

108
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,626
- Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,627
- I'll be right back.

110
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,798
Here we go.

111
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,370
(text keys)

112
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,206
(sighs)

113
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,367
- Well dang, that was quick.

114
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,568
- Girl. Yeah.

115
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,971
He said he had to
call me back. So man,

116
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,374
I feel like these calls are
getting shorter and shorter.

117
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,575
- About a year to go, right?

118
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,576
- [Lena] Yeah.

119
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,915
I miss my baby and
Miles needs his father.

120
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,119
But he did say he might get
released a little early.

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,688
So I'm hoping, please.

122
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,823
- Nice. I know you happy.

123
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,227
- It's just, it's just so
hard without him, you know?

124
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,528
I just want my old life back.

125
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,330
- I know. I know you do.

126
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,133
And that means a
new location, ma'am?

127
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,300
- Oh yeah.

128
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,236
A new place. A new
life. A new everything.

129
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,071
- Right.

130
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,905
- Okay.

131
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,139
- You deserve it.

132
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,373
Oh, before I forget,
I gotta shoot out.

133
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,975
I gotta go handle
some stuff. So.

134
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,944
- You gotta leave
earlier again, Terry?

135
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,548
I better not catch you on them
streets, twerking and stuff.

136
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,517
(Terry laughs)

137
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,453
Be like, Hey a a a a.

138
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,722
- I'm not. Whatever
girl. Whatever.

139
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,323
No, I gotta go
handle some stuff,

140
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,826
but I will see you tomorrow.

141
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,630
And let me get my
stuff real quick.

142
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,998
But thanks for the food.

143
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,833
(smooches) Love you.

144
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,667
- Whatever. Be safe.

145
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,667
- Bye girl.

146
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,006
- All right.

147
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,910
- Man. What y'all think about
LeBron man and Michael Jordan?

148
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,178
- Man. Nobody stand LeBron man.

149
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,814
I'm an MJ fan, man. What

150
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,949
- That's right. MJ

151
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,218
- Man LeBron can

152
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,686
- Nah, and Jordan got six rings.

153
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,687
- Man.

154
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,522
- Six rings. That's it.

155
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,657
- End of it.

156
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,825
(door chimes open)

157
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,092
- This dude is

00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,421

174
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,224
- Okay.

175
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,124
- Oh my bad.

176
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:12,959

177
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,826

Oh yeah. Come here. Let me see.

00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,330
- Hey daddy, what's up?

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,231
- How you doing?

00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,331
- I'm doing well.

182
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,565
- Oh, you brought me something?

183
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,833
- I just wanted to give

184
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,435
Oh, let my OG see

Look at him. Your glasses foggin

00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,738
- Come on Black. They

00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,739

00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,542
- Be ready tonight.

189
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,710
- Of course. Of course.

00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:32,945
- We got slow
rollin working late.

191
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:33,945
Don't be late.

192
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,715
(door chimes open)

193
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,748
- See that?

194
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,585
(everyone cheering for Black)

195
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,155
Yo. I got. Hey, hands

196
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,323
- Oh, that's nothin.
OG, that's nothing, man.

197
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,558
- Seriously?

198
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,826
- That's normal for
me. That's light.

199
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,094
- Light?

200
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,529
- That's my weekday
chick. You feel me?

201
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,796
- Nah, you don't act
like that's your weekday.

202
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,398
That ain't. Come on
Black. Keep it real.

203
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,333
- Nah, I keep it real with
you. Look this right here.

204
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,603
This is what I'm
really after. Yeah.

205
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,338
- She alright, man.

206
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,408
You know, you know I ain't
but she outta your league.

207
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,143
I ain't even gonna
lie to you Black.

208
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,378
(everyone laughing)

209
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,146
I ain't. I'ma keep it
real with you Black.

210
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,415
She a little outta your
league and she kinda stuck up,

211
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,350
but I mean.

212
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,717
- OG, OG, OG, OG.

213
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,718
- At the end of the day.

214
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,654
- I know you the
OG and all that.

215
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,121
Let me tell you this though.

216
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,923
Ain't a woman on this earth
that's outta my league.

217
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,457
- Got you. Got you.

218
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,525
- She's perfect for me. She
might be outta your league.

219
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,960
What league you in? MLB?

220
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,395
(everyone laughing)

221
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,232
- Don't do me like that,
Black. Don't do me like that.

222
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,668
- I got another cancellation!

223
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,803
- Girl, I'm gone.

224
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,774
- All right, girl. I'm
right behind you. Damn.

225
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,677
- [Girl] Ms. Morgan's outside.

226
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,981
- Lena!

227
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,588
- Look, I know Ms. Morgan.

228
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,157
I'm gonna have your money.
Just gimme a couple days.

229
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,225
- A couple of days?

230
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,494
You're four months
behind on your rent.

231
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,965
And yet here you are
asking me for more time.

232
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,068
- Actually it's three
months and 28 days.

233
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,070
- Oh, don't play with me.

234
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,105
Don't do that.

235
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,307
Now you get me my money.

236
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,910
I don't want part of it.
I don't want half of it.

237
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,681
I want all of it. Or I'm
shutting this shop down.

238
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,782
You understand me?

239
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,786
Now I gave you time.

240
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,956
I gave it to you because
I believed in you.

241
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,962
I saw something in
you that I saw in me.

242
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,565
But you are not the
woman. I thought you was.

243
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,766
- Ms. Morgan. Don't.

244
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,127
- You're not a
woman of your word.

245
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,537
Now get me my money!

246
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,641
- I said, I will
have your money.

247
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,275
- I hope you do.

248
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,582
Because if you don't,
you won't have a shop.

249
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,453
So you make up your mind
because I'm going to do it.

250
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,994
(door creaks open) Get it!

251
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,532
(door slams)

252
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,141
♪ You, you, you, you. Say
you're freakin' baby. ♪

253
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,977
- [Robotic Voice]
This boy got a hit.

254
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,884
- Hey, sugar.

255
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,153
- You're late.

256
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,790
- I know. I'm sorry.

257
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,426
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

258
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
- You know I don't like
it when you're late.

259
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,097
- I know. I know. I'm sorry.

260
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,667
I was registering for classes.
I came as fast as I could.

261
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,737
You should be proud of me
knowing that I'm in school.

262
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,805
- School?

263
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,806
- Yeah.

264
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,377
- Okay.

265
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,648
What you think you about
be? A lawyer or some shit?

266
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,852
(laughs) Okay. Okay. Look.

267
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,853
I tell you what.

268
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,094
This should help you
with your little tuition.

269
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,002
That's what I thought.

270
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,839
Look, I know a spot
around the corner.

271
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:25,177
- All right. Let's roll.

272
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,549
Please don't.

273
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,489
- We need and admire your
beautiful bald head. The end.

274
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,225
How is that for a story?

275
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,228
- Mama. Can we read
it one more time?

276
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,364
- No. We'll read it
again tomorrow, okay?

277
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,932
- Okay.

278
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,534
- Okay.

279
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,369
Guess what?

280
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,369
- What?

281
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,972
- Daddy might be
coming home soon.

282
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,240
- Really?

283
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,742
- Really. And you
know what else?

284
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,210
- What?

285
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,371
- He's gonna be upset if
you're not getting any sleep.

286
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,016
Mhm. So get some sleep, okay?

287
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,317
- Okay.

288
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,587
- Okay. All right.

289
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,693
I'll tuck you in.

290
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,196
You got it?

291
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,065
Where's the other
one? There you go.

292
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,236
All right.

293
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,337
- Mommy?

294
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,806
- Yes, baby.

295
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,941
- I love you and I'm glad
daddy is coming back.

296
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,947
- What? You love me?
Uhuh. I love you.

297
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,315
(child laughing)

298
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,150
And that makes the two of us.

299
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,820
(smooches) Good night.

300
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,745
(soft music)

301
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,364
(sobbing)

302
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,010
(text sent chimes)

303
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,949
(soft music continues)

304
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,229
(vibration of phone)

305
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,728
(text sent chimes)

306
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,032
This is where everything
started to change.

307
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,636
They say desperate times
call for desperate measures.

308
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,239
And I admit I was desperate.

309
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,646
- Hi. Yes, girl!

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,649
Everybody knows that I am
the superstar up here in

311
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,184
Lena's salon.

312
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,319
- Glitter, don't you start
that foolishness today.

313
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,755
- A a a y'all heard
what she called me.

314
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,756
Glitter!

315
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,529
I bring in high end clients
to the trenches. Okay?

316
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, and here's one
of my clients now.

317
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,138
Ladies, let me introduce
y'all to Ms. a Tiffany Fox.

318
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,307
- [Everybody] Hey.

319
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,542
- Hiya. Hi Glitter.

320
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,644
- Hey girl. I ain't
seen you in a while.

321
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,680
- I know I've been on the road.

322
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,815
But you have to come home
so you can get me together.

323
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,886
- Yes, because I don't know who

324
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,389
you been letting do your hair,

325
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,290
but you know I'm gonna
get you together.

326
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,625
I'm gonna get you to, I'm
gonna get you together.

327
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,162
- I'm gonna take this
outside. I'll be back.

328
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,830
- Oh, so we taking
private calls now?

329
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,233
- Shut it up Glitter!

330
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,804
(door closes)

331
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,506
- She worried
about taking calls.

332
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,642
She need to be worried
about getting her shop back.

333
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,511
- Oh, Glitter.

334
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,611
- [Woman] Glitter!

335
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,852
- That's none of your business.

336
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,185
- You defended her.

337
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,222
But you know Lena used to have
all the celebrity clients.

338
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,692
I'm the only one
still with mine.

339
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,962
- She's going through a
rough time. (speaks Spanish)

340
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,065
- Yeah. Well.

341
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,301
- Whatever she
said. I don't know.

342
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,336
- It's been too long.

343
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,240
Time to make somethin

344
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,442

Shake shake shake sh shake.

348
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,216
- Focus on your client.

349
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,217
- Girl. Stop it.

350
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,390
- Hey.

351
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,628
I'm at the shop working. Yeah.

352
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,463
What you doing?

353
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,804
No. I don't, I don't
have any plans.

354
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,344
Where are you
taking me? (laughs)

355
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,883
Okay. I'll be ready.

356
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,452
Later.

357
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,197
(laughs) Oh. Mm. Mm mm mm.

358
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,907
(hip hop music plays)

359
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,516
- I got this. Of course.
Anything for you.

360
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,385
- Wow. This is nice.

361
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,888
- Yeah. I figured you
would like this place.

362
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,656
- How you figure that?

363
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,092
- Cause I'm dealing with
somebody with class and taste.

364
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,261
It's the way I like it.

365
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,495
- You right.

366
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,702
I know him over there.

367
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,905
- Oh yeah. Heavy.

368
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,074
- He actually used to work with
my husband back in the day.

369
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,011
- Yeah. Me and Chris
both worked for Heavy.

370
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,649
- What, what, what
did you just say?

371
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,319
- Me and your husband.
Both worked for Heavy.

372
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,554
- No, no, no.

373
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,235
I heard what you said.
Like what the fuck?

374
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,293
- Calm down. We are in public.

375
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,661
I didn't think it
was a big deal.

376
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,662
- Oh.

377
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,200
- Don't look like that.

378
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,034
- Ah.

379
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,267
- Don't make that face.

380
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,469
I ain't gotta be
in your life long.

381
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,939
I know where your husband is.

382
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,473
And by the looks of it

383
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,977
you too damn fine to be
stressing about anything.

384
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,682
If you really want me gone
after this is all over,

385
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,784
I'll be done out your life.

386
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,919
That's your call.

387
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,589
But in the meantime,

388
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,659
I said in the meantime.

389
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,897
You see him? That's our key.

390
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,133
How well you know him?

391
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,803
- I mean, we used to go
to school back in the day.

392
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,074
- See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

393
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,642
History.

394
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,579
That's the easiest way to get
what you want outta somebody.

395
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,015
I bet he trust you too.

396
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,284
- What are you implying?

397
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,887
- I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

398
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:01,627
Look, we gotta
strategize, right?

399
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,828
- I.

400
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,763
- Because you tired
of struggling.

401
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,631
I don't wanna see you struggle.

402
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,232
You just wanna win.

403
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,636
And with me you will always win.

404
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,071
I got a plan.

405
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,575
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

406
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,576
Let's make moves.

407
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,014
Fix your face.

408
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,882
I got a plan.

409
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,685
- What was it about him?

410
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,822
I mean, everything in me
told me not to trust him

411
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,925
and there I was falling in love.

412
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,694
He was right though.

413
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:41,165
I had been down so long. I
just wanted to win again.

414
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,367
I wanted to be on top.

415
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,535
- Come on.

416
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,409
Come on. Lead the way.

417
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,949
So you have fun tonight or what?

418
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,285
- I wish I would've known
we were only gonna be there

419
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,286
for five minutes.

420
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,321
I wouldn't have worn this dress

421
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,056
or these damn heels.

422
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,957
- Stop complaining.
Don't complain.

423
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,126
I like it. I love to look
at you in that dress.

424
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,227
- I bet you do.

425
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,630
- You right about that.

426
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,605
- So. What's the history
between you and my husband?

427
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,241
- Me and Chris.
We like brothers.

428
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,476
- Oh yeah?

429
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,911
- Yeah. We both
worked for Heavy,

430
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,347
but it was Chris that
showed me everything I know.

431
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,348
To be honest,

432
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,185
me and Heavy really
ain't see eye to eye

433
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,321
and I figured why work for
somebody else and take orders

434
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,690
if all you really need is you.

435
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,793
So I left his organization.
Ain't nothing.

436
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,263
- And why y'all
don't speak anymore?

437
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,401
- I mean, to be honest, I came
here to spend time with you.

438
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,771
I ain't come here to talk
about Heavy all night.

439
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,139
Where Miles?

440
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,408
- Miles is at his grandparents.

441
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,244
Hm. That boy keeps
his mama going.

442
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,280
- Right. I see it.

443
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,617
- You know, I don't believe in

444
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,587
messing with my
husband's friends.

445
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,822
- I understand that.

446
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,025
But you know what else?

447
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,420
I think you should stop
saying what you won't do.

448
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,631
Cause you told me
you wasn't gonna,

449
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,666
you told me you wasn't
gonna call me, right?

450
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,201
(Lena laughs)

451
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,282
And yet I'm here, sitting
right in your living room.

452
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,240
- Yeah.

453
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,742
But that's not cuz I wanted to.

454
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,210
- Exactly.

455
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,747
That's what I mean, you
did what you had to do.

456
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,650
Don't apologize for doing
what you gotta do to survive

457
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,052
and take care of
your family, right?

458
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,588
Not supposed to be like that.

459
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,691
But look though.
From the looks of it,

460
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,728
I wouldn't guess you
was missing a thing.

461
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,031
So we staying out here all night

462
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,333
or you gonna gimme a tour?

463
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,941
(kissing sounds)

464
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,213
You lead the way.

465
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,915
- You ready for this?

466
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,818
- Of course. I'm ready.

467
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,524
(hip hop music playing)

468
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,894
Hope you got a plan B.

469
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,399
Talkin' about you don't
think I can handle it.

470
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,488
- Good morning.

471
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,755
- Good morning.

472
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,827
(kissing sounds)

473
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,865
- Last night was fun.

474
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,200
- Indeed it was.

475
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,874
- Oh man.

476
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,114
So babe.

477
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,550
- Yeah?

478
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,022
- You was talking about a plan
last night. What's the plan?

479
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,992
- Yeah, Heavy. He's our plan.

480
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,129
- What does Heavy have
to do with our plan?

481
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,365
- I want you to go back to
that club tomorrow night.

482
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,300
I want you to talk to Heavy.

483
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,904
Tell him you need 100K for
Chris while he locked up.

484
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,940
- What? 100k?

485
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,375
- Yeah.

486
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,944
- I'm not doing that shit.

487
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,280
No. Heavy is crazy.

488
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,016
If he finds out, he'll kill me.

489
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,786
- Relax. He ain't
killing nobody.

490
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,821
It's free money.

491
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,524
We gonna take that money
and make more money.

492
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,792
That is what you wanted, right?

493
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,294
- I mean, yeah,

494
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,932
but I don't have a good
feeling about this at all.

495
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,101
And it, Heavy's not
somebody you just roll up on

496
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,736
and have a conversation with.

497
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
- Nah, see.

498
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,641
Heavy will always let an
old friend get near him.

499
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,644
I mean, Chris was Heavy's prize
possession back in the day.

500
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,746
He did the most numbers for him.

501
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,584
When he see you,
he'll feel obligated.

502
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,385
Don't worry about it.

503
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,753
- I, I don't know.

504
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,989
I don't know about that.

505
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,726
- He trust you, but I
need you to trust me.

506
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,194
All right?

507
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,331
(smooches) It's gonna be okay.

508
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,633
In this together.

509
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,908
Ain't nobody got
you like I got you.

510
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,650
(church music playing)

511
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,962
(Terry sobbing)

512
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,963
- You're early.

513
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,869
You know, service
isn't until Sunday.

514
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,911
- This is the only place that
really reminds me of her.

515
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,954
- Yeah. Your grandmother
was a great woman, Terry.

516
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,524
She loved God and this church.

517
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,162
- I'm just trying to
make sense of this all.

518
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,199
- Well, you see that's the thing

519
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,268
because sometimes
God does things

520
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,405
that we don't always understand.

521
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,780
- She was on the
floor for hours.

522
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:03,914
No one knew.

523
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,252
I'd been saying that I was
gonna go by and see her.

524
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:13,224
But I was just so caught up
with what I had going on that.

525
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,328
- Listen Terry.

526
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,533
You've got to
forgive yourself too.

527
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,437
I mean a heart attack
is very unpredictable.

528
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,504
How could you know?

529
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,410
- If it wasn't for
her night nurse

530

Upstate for a little bit,

came back what? About
a year and a half ago?

658
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,697

so. But I ain't counting.

659
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,065

660

my protege. Impressive.

663
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,639

664
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,974
This your day, man.

665
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,042
I'm just glad you home.

- Yeah, me too.

667
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,947
Its nothin like being home
around family and friends.

668
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,151
Terry, uh I don't know
if my wife told you,

669
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,522
but I was in prison
about five years.

670
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,957
Hope that doesn't make
you feel uncomfortable.

671
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,958
- Nah,

672
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,794
actually my ex-boyfriend's
currently locked up

673
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,729
and you know, I used
to work for him,

674
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,633
but he's gonna be away for a
long time. So it's all good.

675
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,168
Yeah.

676
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,137
- So what he's in for?

677
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,670
- Trafficking, robberies,

678
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,441
he did whatever he needed to
do to put food on the table.

679
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,176
- Wait a minute, what?

680
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,111
- [Terry] What?

681
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,312
- Girl you never told me that.

682
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,314
- I mean, it's not something
I'm necessarily proud of,

683
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,451
but a girl's gotta eat
though. You feel me?

684
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,821
- Black, man. You always
had the baddest shorties.

685
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,423
Always. I know ain't
nothing changed.

686
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,657
I know how you get down.

687
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,858
- Oh yeah.

688
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,427
- And they gotta
get their wigs done.

689
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,096
My wife, she's the best
hairstylist in the city.

690
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:26,931
- [Black] The best, though?

691
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,165
- [Chris] The best.

692
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,666
- I'm gonna take
your word for it.

693
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,469
I'ma have to bring my shorty
down to the shop one day.

694
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,639
- Hey. And by the way, if Lena
ain't there, I'm second best.

695
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,108
So I got you. Remember

696
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,677

So yeah, Chris um

00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,829
- [Chris] Yo. Don't come
late next time, man.

706
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,263
- I'll make it up to.

707
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,099
- You know, black
people always late.

708
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,400
Nah, it's all good, bro.

709
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,002
- Today's your day. Enjoy it.

- Good morning.

719
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,706
How you doing?

720
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,707
- Better now.

721
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,777
You know how amazing
it is to see you

722
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,478
make breakfast for
me in the morning?

723
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,247
- Mhm. You know
I'ma put together

724
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,848
a little something
something for you.

725
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,650
- More than a little
something something.

726
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,219
(Lena chuckles)

727
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,521
I wanna thank you for
dinner last night.

728
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,057
Oh man, that food was amazing.

729
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,392
- I try.

730
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,694
- Ah, you do more than try.

731
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,631
It was also good to
catch up with Black.

732
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,766
Man, we haven't
talked for years.

733
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,668
I mean, you know, he put
some money in my books

734
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,638
and sent the occasional
message to me

735
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,139
through some of the
guys in the yard.

736
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,777
But, I think last night we
got back to where we belong.

737
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,057
- Babe uh.

738
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,295
I just want you to know that

739
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,298
life got really
lonely without you.

740
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,734
I mean, it was
just me and Miles.

741
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:55,139
And I felt like my whole
world was caving in.

742
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,543
One moment I have everything.

743
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:05,283
And then the next moment it
just was gone in a flash.

744
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,588
I mean, I'm even back
to renting my shop now.

745
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,461
I don't know. I, I just, I
feel like somewhere in between,

746
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,200
somewhere in between,
I fell outta love.

747
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,417
- Baby, I don't want
you to ever think that

748
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,386
I don't understand what
you've been through.

749
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:48,359
I'm thankful for every
visit, for every call.

750
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,030
I missed you and Miles so much.

751
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,001
But now that I'm back,

752
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,771
I gotta figure out how to
get us back to where we were.

753
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,874
But I'm out the game.

754
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,876
I ain't doing that shit no more.

755
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,245
I'm not going back inside.

756
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,883
I'm not doing anything to
separate me from my family.

757
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,053
- Chris, I.

758
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,925
- Lena. Look, you
gotta trust me.

759
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,662
You gotta let me handle this.

760
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,097
Okay?

761
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,999
Look.

762
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,375
I got something
for you. (laughs)

763
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,879
- What is that?

764
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,714
- See.

765
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,948
- That's beautiful.

766
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,282
- When I was locked
up, I was in the Penn.

767
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,817
- Mhm.

768
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:51,388
- Every Sunday, this preacher
would come to the stop, right?

769
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,289
- Uh-huh.

770
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,624
- He would come.

771
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,229
He would talk to us.

772
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,568
He would always say, "Jesus,
keep me near the cross."

773
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,319
And I was like, "What
the hell does that mean?"

774
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,547
He said, "I can't teach
you how to find God.

775
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:22,553
But in time of trouble and hard
times, God would find you."

776
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,790
So when I was locked up

777
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,224
and I was going through it

778
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,960
and I was missing you and Miles.

779
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,231
That kept me sane.

780
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,299
It kept me alive.

781
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,802
You kept me alive.

782
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,272
I want you to have it.

783
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,941
- Thank you, babe.

784
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,145
(kissing sound)

785
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,813
- Love you.

786
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,282
- I love you more.

787
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,785
- I'm hungry.

788
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,323
- You know what I
was thinking too?

789
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,524
- What?

790
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,293
- Remember last
night at the dinner,

791
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,029
when Terry was talking all that
stuff about her ex-boyfriend

792
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,730
and the robberies?

793
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,767
I was like, what in the hell?

794
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,001
- Yo. That was crazy.

795
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,503
- In all my years.
Nah, seriously.

796
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,605
In all my years I've known
her, I've never heard that.

797
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,440
- Really?

798
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
- No I didn't, I.

799
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,878
Not a peep from her about
anything like that. Crazy, right?

800
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,713
- Man, you could know
somebody for a long time.

801
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:24,648
- A long time.

802
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,016
- Not really know them.

803
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,385
Life is crazy like that.

804
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,954
Cheers to us.

How can I help you?

- Yeah. Tell Lena
I'm here to see her.

823
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,212

824
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,716

I'll be right back, okay?

00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,826
- What's good ma? How you doing?

828
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,462
- What are you doing here?

829
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,798
- Take it down a few notches.

830
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,567
Really I was just here.

831
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,268
Just pass by to see
how you was doing.

832
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,771
I wanted to give you a
little something. How Miles?

833
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,774
- Miles is fine. I'm fine.

834
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,742
And I guess it is
good that you pass by

835
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,244
cuz me and Miles
need some things

836
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,880
cuz Chris is still
getting on his feet.

837
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,014
- Right.

838
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,449
Well a real man
provides for his family

839
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,917
by any means necessary.

840
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,118
- Excuse you?

841
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,287
- Hey, I'm just saying.

842
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,625
- Okay. You know I'm dealing
with a lot right now, okay?

843
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,027
When Chris was away things
were a whole lot easier.

844
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,229
But now that he's
back, I don't know.

845
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,032
I just feel like the worst
person knowing that I was.

846
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,033
- Knowing what?

847
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,170
- Knowing that I'm in
love with the only man

848
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,472
my husband trusts.

849
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,308
And then you had the nerve
to come by the other night.

850
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,243
What the fuck was
that all about?

851
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,513
- Look, you know
what we gotta do.

852
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,748
Things keep moving like this.

853
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,984
You'll be able to get
out this small ass salon

854
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,020
into something more
fit for a queen.

855
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,089
Probably never have to work
again a day in your life.

856
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,524
- It is not that easy, okay?

857
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,393
And you can't keep
showing up to places

858
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,729
you know Chris is gonna be.

859
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,767
- Look, I'm gonna head out.

860
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,838
Try not to spend
it so fast as time.

861
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,209
Don't be scared. Take it.

862
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,745
- You always looking
out for me, huh?

863
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,146
I appreciate you.

864
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,081
- Right.

865
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,348
- Who's outside with you today?

866
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,518
- Oh, just a few of my boys.

867
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,655
You know I'm the biggest
on the South side.

868
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,557
You know I'm the
king. It's my palace.

869
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,460
You could be the queen.
You could run it with me.

870
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:25,461
Yeah.

871
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,933
But look tonight
everything's still in motion

872
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,835
and this drop I'm about to get,

873
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,238
change your life forever.

874
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,142
- Like I, I think that maybe.

875
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,878
- Stop stressing. Calm down.

876
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,247
Take your ass back to work.

877
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,290
(door closes)

878
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:06,602
- Hey baby.

879
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,205
- Baby, what you doing here?

880
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,307
- I got these for you.

881
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,509
- You got me flowers?

882
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,877
- Yeah. I wanna make you smile.

883
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,379
- Look at you.

884
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,015
- I miss you. (smooches)
thought about you all day.

885
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,016
- Thank you.

886
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,886
- Can I talk to
you for a minute?

887
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,722
- Sure.

888
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,457
- All right. Come on.

889
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,026
Well, I've been really thinking

890
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,729
about the conversation we had.

891
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,500
If I can't find a job
doing something else,

892
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,271
I'ma have to do what I gotta do.

893
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,975
- What? When did
you decide this?

894
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:46,844
- Today.

895
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,044
- Today?

896
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,913
- Baby. I can't
lose you and Miles.

897
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,015
And this is what it takes

898
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,986
to make you live the way
you wanna live, so be it.

899
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,155
I gotta take care of my family.

900
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,289
- Chris. I, I just.

901
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,524
- No. So listen baby.

902
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,927
Tonight I'm gonna
meet up with Black.

903
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,230
And I got some other
business to tend to,

904
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:11,435
but I want you to remember
I'm doing this for us.

905
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,504
- And you're meeting
up with Black?

906
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,908
- Yeah

907
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,978
Baby. Don't worry
about it. I got this.

908
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,814
- No. No and no.

909
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,283
I, I just don't have a
good feeling about this.

910
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,552
I don't, I don't have a
good feeling about this.

911
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,387
- You don't trust me?

912
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,623
- I just don't have a
good feeling about this.

913
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,558
- Baby. I got this.
Don't worry about it.

914
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,728
Look, I'm gonna be home late.

915
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,532
Wait up for me.
Wear something sexy.

916
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,801
Real nice. It's
been a long time.

917
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,738
I can't wait to be alone with
you and really enjoy you.

918
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,507
Trust me, okay?

919
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,742
I gotta go.

920
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:59,316
♪ Away from me. Tell me,
tell me what's on your mind ♪

921
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:04,655
♪ Am I really on your mind
when you're away from me? ♪

922
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:09,725
♪ Baby, tell me
what's on your mind ♪

923
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:13,230
(car driving over gravel)

924
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:17,934
- [Man] What up Bo?

925
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,437
- Not much, man. You straight?

926
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,407
- Yeah. No.

927
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:25,775
I mean you know how it is.

928
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,344
I just came home.
Pockets all fucked up.

929
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,881
Gotta take care of my family.
So I gotta do what I gotta do.

930
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,249
- Yeah. I hear you man.

931
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,484
But whatever happened
with you and Heavy man?

932
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,453
We put in a lot of work
with him back in the day.

933
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,355
- Word. I mean we talked.

934
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,858
He's talking about
making me top dog,

935
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,627
maybe running his
operation again.

936
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,729
- And you trust him?

937
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,765
- I mean, he's always
been straight to me.

938
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,133
I mean, it's all love.

939
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,869
- Man. Fuck him.

940
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,804
Let me show you what
I'm working with.

941
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:55,939
- [Chris] Really? Okay.

942
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,815
- Put you onto
something real quick.

943
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,753
Yeah. Take a look at that.

944
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,355
- What?

945
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,857
- Help yourself. Right there.

946
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,266
Real South side shit.

947
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,339
- Damn. This is what
you working with?

948
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,941
- Yeah it's what
I'm working with.

949
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,611
- Hell you was my number
two. Now you doing it big yo.

950
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,848
- You know I was thinking.

951
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,616
It's lonely at the top.

952
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,451
(gun fires)

953
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,452
(body drops)

954
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,721
Ain't no room for both of us.

955
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,690
(spits)

956
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:51,795
(police sirens and somber music)

957
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,603
- All right. You ready?

958
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,974
Come on.

959
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,179
- Mommy. Where's daddy?

960
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,781
- Daddy had to leave
us again, baby.

961
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,482
- Why can't we go home?

962
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,786
- Well, because this is
gonna be our new home.

963
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,622
This is our new home, okay?

964
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,357
- Aw.

965
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,896
- Come on. Right.

966
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,936
(doorbell rings)

967
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,606
- Hey.

968
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,014
Terry, what the fuck
are you doing here?

969
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,149
- (lips smack) You don't
get to ask no questions.

970
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,651
You got my product?

971
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,420
- What is, what is happening?

972
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,992
Miles, baby. Go to the
car for me. Go to the car.

973
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,597
What is happening? Are
you messing with him?

974
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,368
- Look, thank you for doing
what I asked you to do.

975
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,669
You can leave.

976
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,838
- I can leave?

977
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:14,611
(banging on door) Open this
door. Black, open the door.

978
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,583
(banging on door)
Open this. Terry!

979
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:25,522
(Crying. Banging on
door. Somber music)

980
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,794
Open this door! (cries loudly)

981
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,069
I couldn't believe
this was my life.

982
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,238
I mean he used me.

983
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,075
I just betrayed my husband
only to be betrayed

984
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,512
by the person I
thought I could trust.

985
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,419
(knocking on door) Okay.

986
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Hello.

987
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,189
- [Detective Campbell]
Good morning, ma'am.

988
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,591
My name is detective Campbell.

989
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,161
I was wondering if you have
a moment for us to speak.

990
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,063
- Speak with you about what?

991
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,331
- We're currently investigating
a robbery that took place a

992
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,333
couple nights ago.

993
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,236
- Do I have something
to do with that?

994
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,705
- [Detective Campbell]
No, not exactly.

995
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,642
But you were seen with
someone who may be involved.

996
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,643
May I come in?

997
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,514
- Sure.

998
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,990
- You were seen at
the club, Flows.

999
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,393
And there was someone
sitting at the bar with you.

1000
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,661
- Okay?

1001
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,063
- His name is Quentin Rogers,

1002
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,066
but you may know him
as the name Black.

1003
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,269
What exactly were the
two of you discussing?

1004
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,141
- That's your question?
What we were discussing?

1005
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,877
- Mr. Rogers has a um,

1006
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,280
history of finding the
most beautiful women

1007
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,418
and using his charm against
their vulnerability.

1008
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,087
It is not long before
he has these women

1009
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,157
doing anything that he says.

1010
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:14,630
Look. I'm just trying
to figure out if

1011
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,301
maybe he mentioned anything
about something he's tied into.

1012
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,305
Or maybe he tried to
coerce into anything.

1013
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,812
- Cops. Everybody's
guilty, right? Hmm?

1014
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,415
But if you must know, no, he
invited me out for drinks.

1015
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,253
And what he was discussing is
taking me out on another date.

1016
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,721
Yeah.

1017
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,123
- Have you dealt with Mr. Rogers
in any other capacity?

1018
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,959
- [Lena] No, I have not.

1019
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:48,063
- Hi buddy. What's your name?

1020
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,331
- Miles.

1021
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,668
- I love that name.
What are you up to?

1022
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,604
- Come here, baby. Come here.

1023
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,606
I need you to go up to your
room and finish playing with

1024
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:58,908
your toys, okay?

1025
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,469
I'll be up there in
a second. Go ahead.

1026
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,813
- I love kids.

1027
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:05,749
- Yeah.

1028
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,949
- You have a beautiful son.

1029
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,950
- Thank you.

1030
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,388
- Listen. If anything comes up,

1031
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,924
would you just give me a call?

1032
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,828
- You know what?
I'm fine. Actually.

1033
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,831
I'm a big girl and
I can handle myself.

1034
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,835
- I'm not saying that you can't
take care of yourself, Lena.

1035
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:27,970
But I'm trying to warn you

1036
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,906
that this guy is
really dangerous.

1037
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,509
So be careful.

1038
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,490
♪ Welcome to the future

1039
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,727
- I just wanted you to know
that everything we set out to do

1040
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,029
it's already in motion.

1041
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,866
Chris, no longer a problem.

1042
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,603
And I hate it had
to be that way,

1043
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,805
but what was I supposed to do?

1044
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,040
I knew Chris was
gonna come home.

1045
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,143
Jump right back in the
streets with Heavy.

1046
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,180
I knew Chris was gonna take
over Heavy's operation next.

1047
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:15,117
I knew that. I knew it was
only a matter of time before

1048
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,120
Heavy got Chris to
try to take me out.

1049
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,558
I couldn't let that happen.

1050
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,129
Truth be told better
his life than mine.

1051
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,100
Look little bro.

1052
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,101
I love you.

1053
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,439
And I ain't gonna forget
what they did to you.

1054
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,710
I ain't having no
mercy on nobody.

1055
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,981
Now I'm gonna take over
the North and South side.

1056
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,350
Just like we planned to do.

1057
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,985
♪ And it's hard to
connect with people ♪

1058
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,188
♪ 'cause I ain't
a people person ♪

1059
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,024
♪ Gotta do what you gotta do

1060
00:54:55,025 --> 00:55:00,030
♪ You gotta do
stand on your own ♪

1061
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,431
- Shits crazy.

1062
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,365
- What's up Bricks?

1063
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:03,766
- What you saying? What he want?

1064
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,487
- Hey boss, I got
somebody for you to meet.

1065
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,072
- So you just think it's
okay to bring anybody into my

1066
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,607
establishment, man?

1067
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,777
- Nah, this my boy, RJ. He
trying to join the family.

1068
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,980
And he said he got some
information for you.

1069
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,685
- Where you from RJ?

1070
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,386
- From the South side.

1071
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,722
- South side? So
what do you do, man?

1072
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,490
I ain't never heard of you.

1073
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,427
You a hustler?
Dope boy? You rob?

1074
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,796
- Well, I do a little something.

1075
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,532
And I was hoping
you can put me on.

1076
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,100
And I think I got
some information

1077
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,568
that might be valuable to you.

1078
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:43,072
- Man, we don't need new people
in here dropping off gifts.

1079
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,941
- Look guys no disrespect,

1080
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,078
but the streets they talking.

1081
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:53,015
Black, he running stuff on
the South side right now.

1082
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,550
Word on the block,

1083
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,985
Black took his main
man, Chris out.

1084
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,188
And I know Chris from the North.

1085
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,792
- Yeah, I know Chris
very well. Black, too.

1086
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,629
Chris would've been hit me
if something was going down.

1087
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,998
What's your angle, man?

1088
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,734
- Yeah, where you
getting your information?

1089
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,336
- I'm just telling
you what I know.

1090
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,904
- So you expect me
to believe you bring

1091
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,341
your black ass in here
and give free information?

1092
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,610
- I was hoping you
have a spot for me.

1093
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,547
I mean it's the least I
could do to pay my gratitude.

1094
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,851
I'm trying to be down
with y'all. What's up?

1095
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:36,326
- Yes, well. Show him around.

1096
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:38,994
- You got it, boss.

1097
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,706
- Man, keep your eyes
on that dude, man.

1098
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,744
Somethin about him. I just
can't put my finger on it.

1099
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,886
- Go upstairs now and then look.

1100
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,523
- Yes. Mhm. That's right.

1101
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,725
Hey, slow down

1102
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,464
Ma?

1103
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,868
- Yeah baby. Le Le I'm
back here in the kitchen.

1104
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,237
- Hey.

1105
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,237
- Hey.

1106
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,940
Where's my grandson?

1107
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,209
- He went upstairs.

1108
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,281
- Okay. What's wrong with you?

1109
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,783
And why do you have
that look on your face?

1110
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,784
- What? I'm good.

1111
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,621
- Come on Lee Lee. You know
you can't hide from me.

1112
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,622
I had you.

1113
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,192
I was talking to your
sisters this morning

1114
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,061
and they said they
hadn't heard from you.

1115
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,729
- I've been busy.

1116
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,098
- Too busy for your family?

1117
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,533
Come on, Lena.

1118
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,701
Stop making excuses
for yourself.

1119
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,571
- I'm not making
excuses, first of all.

1120
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,374
And I'm, I don't know.

1121
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,912
I just feel like a lot in
life I've disconnected from.

1122
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,614
- Well, it sure
hasn't stopped you

1123
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:09,351
from bringing my grandson
over here every other day.

1124
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,820
And you need to make sure that
that baby is spending time

1125
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,490
with you. He needs his mom.

1126
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:19,127
- Oh so now you give
parenting advice?

1127
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,129
- I beg your pardon?

1128
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,798
- I'm just saying

1129
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,000
I've watched you ma. You
tend to everybody else

1130
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,001
but yourself.

1131
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,605
- That's what a mother does.

1132
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,910
- So the bruises go a
long with it too, huh?

1133
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,013
You know, growing up I
watched you and daddy.

1134
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,481
And you know what I said?

1135
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,017
I would never allow a man to
make me feel the way daddy made

1136
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,453
you feel, weak.

1137
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,822
- So that's what
we're doing today?

1138
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,124
That's what we're doing today?

1139
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,294
So you're miserable and you
think you're gonna come up here

1140
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,730
in my house and make
me miserable too?

1141
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,932
That's not gonna
happen. Listen, baby.

1142
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,735
I had you and your
sisters to think about.

1143
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:04,674
And I know that your father,
God knows he was not the best,

1144
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,310
but I stand behind every
decision that I made back then.

1145
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,145
And now.

1146
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,679
- Yeah.

1147
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,182
Did you ever once think what
you were teaching us though?

1148
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,284
- What I was teaching you?

1149
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,485
- Yes.

1150
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,986
- If anything,

1151
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,521
I taught you and your sisters
how to be strong and how to

1152
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,923
fight for your family.

1153
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,090
- No. No ma.

1154
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,559
- I that's what I taught you.

1155
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,862
- No. What you taught us,
you taught us how to pretend.

1156
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,197
That's what you taught us.

1157
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,138
You know what? Look, I
matter of fact, you right

1158
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,040
I'm not doing this today.

1159
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,575
I'ma get outta here.

1160
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,010
I need you to watch Miles
for me for a couple days.

1161
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,946
- My grandson is always welcome.

1162
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,048
- Good. I need to
go to the shop.

1163
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,584
- Lena, Lena.

1164
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,419
- What?

1165
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,823
- Listen, your father's
not the man he used to be.

1166
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,926
He is not. And I, I
know that he hurt you.

1167
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,929
He hurt a lot of other
members of his family.

1168
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,199
But baby, he is a changed man.

1169
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,335
He really is.

1170
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,671
And before you start looking
at everybody else's mistakes

1171
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,641
and, and judging everybody else.

1172
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,644
Maybe you need to take a
closer look at yourself.

1173
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,946
Why don't you do that?

1174
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,418
- Bye mom.

1175
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,694
♪ Wait, stop it.
It's time to pop. ♪

1176
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:37,700
♪ I'm lit on fire, but
ain't nobody hot like this ♪

1177
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,136
- Ain't nobody messing
with this. Y'all ready?

1178
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,472
I got four deuces.

1179
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,273
Hey man. It's my bread.

1180
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,708
That's what I'm talking about.

1181
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,778
Yeah man, yeah man, there we go.

1182
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,680
All my money.

1183
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:52,981
- [Man] Always winning.

1184
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,218
- Yeah. That's just like
take candy from a baby.

1185
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,287
Listen man. Listen.
Time to listen.

1186
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,423
Don't get mad at me.

1187
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,860
Get mad at the PPP loan people.

1188
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:06,362
All right let's go, man.

1189
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:07,863
I'm about to bet 800.

1190
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,132
I gonna see where your hands
is at man. Let's do this.

1191
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,067
- Make it a right man.

1192
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:12,234
- Oh, you ain't saying nothing.

1193
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,669
You ain't saying nothing.

1194
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,804
- Chief, I need to holler
at you for a minute.

1195
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,473
- What you wanna
holler at me for?

1196
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,276
- Got a little situation
I need to handle.

1197
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,578
Need to take care of ASAP.

1198
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,781
- How that concern me?

1199
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,216
- I'm gonna take out an army.

1200
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,751
I need something to do it with.

1201
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,987
- Yeah, you do.

1202
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,655
- Let me get my
hands on something.

1203
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,090
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1204
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,324
Fellas. Pardon me a second.

1205
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,327
Let me holler at my
man Black real quick.

1206
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,504
So you tell me you supposed
to be a businessman

1207
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,009
and you can't buy
protection for yourself?

1208
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,311
- You're absolutely right.
I'm not saying you're wrong.

1209
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,046
You're right. That's
why I'm here for.

1210
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,247
That's what I'm coming to you.

1211
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:00,849
- Hey Black I just
gave you some last time

1212
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,051
for the last situation you had.

1213
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,486
- Chief come on man.

1214
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,022
You know that was hot.
I had to toss that.

1215
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,490
- So you mean you toss my shit

1216
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,094
and you got the nerve to
come back and ask for more?

1217
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,029
- Don't even worry about.

1218
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,330
You don't even gotta worry
about it. I got money.

1219
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,431
- Oh man. It ain't
about the money.

1220
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,933
It ain't about the money.

1221
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,869
It's how you be moving
around here man.

1222
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,337
- I understand.

1223
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,340
- Listen, man.

1224
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,376
I don't know.

1225
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,113
But since I love
your little brother,

1226
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,081
like he was a brother of me.

1227
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,117
That's the only reason
I'm doing this for you.

1228
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,118
- I respect that.

1229
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,489
- And you got this
detective chick

1230
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,958
running around here asking
questions about you.

1231
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,192
- Nah. You don't even
gotta worry about that.

1232
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,061
- Like don't don't be
bringing him around here

1233
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:46,929
deuces up my shit.

1234
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,929
- Nah. Nah.

1235
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,199
- Alright.

1236
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
Hey Matt.

1237
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,337
Get Black whatever he need.

1238
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,839
- Hey yo Chief, I know
you don't wanna hear it.

1239
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,808
- Yo man.

1240
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,041
- I highly appreciate this.

1241
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,277
Now you going outta
your way for me.

1242
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,146
Thank you for real.

1243
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,907
Wouldn't be possible
without you, all right?

1244
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,384
- Yeah all right.

1245
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,387
Stupid. Dummy.

1246
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,597
(door creaks open)

1247
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:23,499
- [Lena] Terry, you got
some nerve bringing your ass

1248
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:24,499
up in here.

1249
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,035
- I've been calling and
texting you with no response.

1250
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,738
- And you wasn't
going to get one.

1251
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,741
I suggest you pack up
all your little shit

1252
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,044
and take your little
trifling ass out of here.

1253
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,212
- Really?

1254
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,680
- How long you been
sleeping with Black?

1255
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,382
- I'm not sleeping
with Black Lena.

1256
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,449
- Bullshit!

1257
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,819
- Lena, I work for Black.

1258
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,256
Okay? I work for Black, Lena.

1259
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,725
The other night when I
was over by his place,

1260
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:54,496
I was just getting ready for
a high end client. That's it?

1261
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,531
Nothing happened.

1262
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
- Take that too.

1263
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:08,844
- Lena, sit down.

1264
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,779
It's time for you
to know the truth.

1265
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,112
- No, I'm not sitting down.

1266
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,181
What the fuck do
you have to say?

1267
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,182
- All right.

1268
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,655
Remember the other night when
you had us over for dinner

1269
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,591
and I mentioned my
ex-boyfriend to you?

1270
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,825
What I didn't tell you

1271
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,062
is that Black and my ex,
they know each other.

1272
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,332
They used to do
business together.

1273
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,202
And I was part of
that merchandise.

1274
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,176
Lena I've been prostituting
since I was 16.

1275
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,179
- You've been doing what?

1276
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,914
- Yeah.

1277
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,749
And I can't tell you how
many men I've been with

1278
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,951
or what they made me do.

1279
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,557
- So is that why you
keep running outta here

1280
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,825
all early every day?

1281
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,094
- No, that's not all.

1282
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,200
I was accepted into a nursing
school program a while back.

1283
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,870
I'm two semesters
away from finishing.

1284
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,781
- Why you never told
me this till now?

1285
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,252
- I didn't tell you because
for the first time in my life

1286
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,055
I can see the finish
line, you know?

1287
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,925
I just didn't wanna
speak too soon.

1288
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,239
Okay. I get it.

1289
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,442
Lena, Black ain't a good person.

1290
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,244
He uses every woman
to get what he wants

1291
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,515
the same way he used
you to get rid of Chris.

1292
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,586
A few years ago, Black's
little brother Twan was killed

1293
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,056
doing a night drop for Heavy.

1294
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,360
Black blames Heavy for getting
his little brother killed.

1295
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,130
This ain't the life
for me no more.

1296
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,835
I moved here from Mexico
to be here with abuelita.

1297
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:14,971
She's dead.

1298
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,941
There ain't nothing else
here for me no more.

1299
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,313
So I'm transferring schools.

1300
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,196
- Terry. Listen.

1301
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,232
I'm sorry, okay?

1302
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,634
I'm sorry I treated
you like that.

1303
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,437
I'm I'm sorry I
wasn't here for you.

1304
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:04,085
- I know your heart chica,
but take it from me.

1305
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,154
Get out this life.

1306
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,858
It ain't worth it.

1307
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,760
Okay?

1308
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,701
I gotta go.

1309
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,107
- Terry.

1310
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,781
You are always welcome here.

1311
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,149
Always.

1312
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,054
- Thank you.

1313
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,101
(Machine whirring)

1314
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,445
- Black!

1315
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,384
- Just the person
I wanted to see.

1316
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,519
What'd you find out?

1317
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,520
- Man, I found out everything.

1318
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:13,556
- Everything?

1319
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,357
That's what I'm talking about?

1320
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,592
Who the connect?

1321
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,829
- Some white boy. He go
by the name Stevenson.

1322
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,197
Say he outta Orange County.

1323
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:22,998
- Stevenson?

1324
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:23,833
- Yeah.

1325
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:24,833
- Orange county?

1326
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,535
I don't know. That don't
sound too familiar to me.

1327
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,504
You got his info?

1328
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,472
- Yeah.

1329
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,673
- Let me check this out.

1330
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,343
Hm. It look legit.

1331
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,811
- Yeah.

1332
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,279
- So how many dudes Heavy
got running with him?

1333
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,615
- I mean he running with
three, so we should be good.

1334
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,550
- Three?

1335
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,351
- Yeah. I think we're good.

1336
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,351
- That ain't too many.

1337
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,587
All right.

1338
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:47,522
So here's the next part of this

1339
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,723
I need you to get 'em all here.

1340
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:50,459
Cause at this point
they trust you.

1341
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,495
- Get 'em here how?

1342
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:54,929
- Figure it out!

1343
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,234
Cause when you do, I'm gonna
lay 'em all out one by one.

1344
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,169
- Wait, wait.

1345
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,303
So you going to kill them?

1346
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,373
- You asking a lot of questions

1347
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,875
and I don't like that.

1348
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,511
- Black. I just don't remember
that being part of the plan.

1349
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,881
You got the connect.
Ain't that enough?

1350
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,350
- It's never enough. RJ.

1351
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,019
It's bigger than that.

1352
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,222
You look nervous.

1353
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,357
- I'm good.

1354
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:23,691
- Got a reason to be nervous?

1355
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,094
- I'm good man.

1356
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,831
- Look RJ. RJ don't make
me shoot you in your face

1357
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,301
and throw your ass in the
trunk of one of these cars.

1358
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,604
Look you either with
me or you're in my way.

1359
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:37,906
What it's gonna be?

1360
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:38,907
- I'm with you
Black. I'm with you.

1361
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,542
- You with me?

1362
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,544
- Yeah, I got you.

1363
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,380
- Don't be another
person in the way.

1364
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,551
Ain't no bullets
in it. Look at you.

1365
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:52,153
You a little sweaty
man. Fix your shirt.

1366
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,022
Fix your chain. Oh you shining.

1367
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,357
You getting too much money.

1368
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,863
Hey RJ. You doing a good job.

1369
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,935
I catch you later my man.

1370
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,237
He gonna get his ass smoked.

1371
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,238
Hear that OG?

1372
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,175
But yeah, like I was saying.

1373
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,681
(door creaks open)

1374
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:22,317
- We're closed,
come back tomorrow.

1375
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,318
- Lee Lee.

1376
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,557
So this is famous
Lena's hair salon?

1377
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,328
This is nice. This where
all the money coming in?

1378
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,464
Oh man.

1379
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,438
Yeah. I like this.

1380
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,973
- What are you doing here?

1381
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,576
- You know what I'm doing
here. How your mom's doing?

1382
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,280
- No, I don't know
what you're doing here.

1383
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,716
- Well, Chris came home.

1384
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,051
He was supposed to
run all this for me.

1385
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,154
Maybe I get a salon
too and get that money.

1386
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,191
What you do with the money?

1387
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,894
- What, what money?
Chris got all that money.

1388
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:08,429
- That's a lie.

1389
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,566
Word on the street is you
giving money out to Black.

1390
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,102
You're funding his operation.

1391
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,540
- There is no me and Black.
What are you talking about?

1392
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,977
- You know the worst thing
I hate about a person?

1393
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,146
Becoming a liar.

1394
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,686
(cocks gun)

1395
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,422
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1396
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:35,590
- Let me tell you something.

1397
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,425
- Okay. Please don't hurt me.

1398
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,429
- You got 24 hours
for a hundred grand.

1399
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,999
If I don't get my money bitch,

1400
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:48,136
you'll never see your son again.

1401
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,404
(Lena crying)

1402
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,938
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

1403
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,243
- I got it. I will have
your money. I'll have it.

1404
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,462
(door creaks open and closes)

1405
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,232
(sobbing)

1406
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,421
Oh my god.

1407
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,607
- What's good homie?

1408
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,975
- Shit, what you got
left on that thing, man?

1409
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,176
- I got like an
(indistinct) left, really.

1410
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,411
- Okay. Okay.

1411
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:04,979
- I gotta (indistinct)
for the whole thing.

1412
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,181
- Oh, so you need
another 18 for that 36?

1413
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:08,816
- Yeah, soon as I get
straight I got you.

1414
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,487
- Okay. Yo who that right there?

1415
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,727
- All right man.
So what you got?

1416
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,928
What you got on that thing, man?

1417
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,163
I gotta go see Heavy yo.

1418
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,098
- I got five right here.

1419
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,534
- Oh five? Oh, lemme get that.

1420
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,469
Oh let's see what's up with
this dude right here, man.

1421
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,104
Watch out. Watch out. Let me
see what's up with this dude.

1422
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:30,939
- What's good homie?

1423
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,241
(gun fires)

1424
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,145
(tires squeel off)

1425
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,224
- What's going on mama?

1426
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,927
- Hey dad.

1427
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,629
- Hey little man.
You getting big.

1428
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,064
And you shining. Okay.

1429
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,433
I see your work.

1430
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,700
- Go play Marcus.

1431
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,636
- Okay.

1432
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,069
- I'll talk to you in a few.

1433
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,271
- Okay.

1434
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,707
- That's my little
man's growing up fast.

1435
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,210
I got something for you, mama.

1436
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,047
- Now what is this?

1437
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,616
- It's money. I give
you some every week.

1438
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,953
- Yes. Yes you do.

1439
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,255
And I never once questioned you.

1440
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,058
But I should have asked
you a long time ago

1441
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,994
where is this money coming from?

1442
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,665
You look at me, Black.

1443
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,200
The streets are talking

1444
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,870
and I don't like what
I'm hearing about my son.

1445
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,807
The murders. Is
that you doing that?

1446
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,043
- Ma, I told you don't
be listening to that.

1447
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,745
- Tell me the truth,
Quentin. Is it you?

1448
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:45,747
- I told you.

1449
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,449
How long Twan been gone Ma?

1450
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,284
- Mh-mm.

1451
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,118
- How long?

1452
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,519
- Don't you do that.

1453
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,954
Don't you put your
brother's name into this.

1454
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,957
- My brother is the
reason I am the way I am.

1455
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,292
When they took him, he took
a piece of me with him.

1456
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:59,760
I don't give a
fuck how they feel.

1457
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,264
- (slapping sound) Don't
you raise your voice at me.

1458
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,866
- I'm sorry, mama.

1459
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,802
- You're going about
this the wrong way.

1460
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:11,506
Do you really think your brother
would want you doing this?

1461
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,507
Do you?

1462
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,077
I'm warning you Black.

1463
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,279
The knife cuts both ways.

1464
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,116
And if you don't stop, you're
going to get yourself hurt.

1465
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,220
I've already lost one son.

1466
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,092
And what about him?

1467
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,496
He needs you to be his father.

1468
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,634
Quentin, do the right thing.

1469
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,340
- I had been calling
Black over and over

1470
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,443
knowing I needed to get
this money to Heavy.

1471
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,981
I must admit I was shocked
when he actually showed up.

1472
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,118
I just don't know
what to say Black.

1473
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,519
- Oh, you don't?

1474
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,989
You don't gotta say much.

1475
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,795
It's a hundred
grand in that bag.

1476
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,132
It's enough for you to
pay Heavy back and more.

1477
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,571
(unzips bag)

1478
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,609
- What about you?

1479
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,313
- What about me?

1480
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,682
I got a big drop tonight.

1481
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,617
It's too hot down here
for me to even stay.

1482
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,586
Even if I wanted to.

1483
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,020
So I'm gonna go grab my son

1484
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,957
and I'm outta here
by tomorrow morning.

1485
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:36,858
I'm heading Upstate.

1486
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,662
- Your son? You got a son?

1487
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:43,698
- Yeah, my son.

1488
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,041
- Take care of yourself, Black.

1489
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,245
- Definitely.

1490
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,882
- They the new Bonnie
and Clyde, huh?

1491
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,352
- Man it's only been 24 hours.

1492
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,520
She out here moving with this.

1493
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,290
- I'm telling you,
she's in on it.

1494
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,059
I'ma handle this.

1495
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,997
- Nah, I got this one.

1496
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,702
(car pulls up)

1497
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,704
(somber music plays)

1498
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:08,350
(police sirens and
indistinct radio chatter)

1499
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,457
- Oh, I was just texting you.

1500
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,892
- Oh yeah? It's all there?

1501
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,160
- I got your money.

1502
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,461
- Yeah just the way I like it.

1503
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,862
- Yeah. It's all there.

1504
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:22,964
- Yeah. Yeah.

1505
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,901
That's what I'm talking about.

1506
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,502
You know it was never just
about the money, right?

1507
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,004
You know money's important,

1508
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:34,209
but you know the one thing I
never liked that you be doing?

1509
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,412
- Yeah?

1510
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,346
- Showin no damn respect.

1511
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:41,950
(gun fires and Lena screams)

1512
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,695
- In the end we
both paid a price.

1513
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,497
(indistinct radio chatter)

1514
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,334
Black was sentenced to
10 years for trafficking.

1515
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:03,671
But me?

1516
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,275
I paid the ultimate price.

1517
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:17,819
(car horns honking)

1518
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,422
- Hey, welcome back.

1519
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,623
- Hey.

1520
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:23,592
- Are you dining
alone again tonight?

1521
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,126
- Nope. Not tonight.

1522
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,695
- Okay. Look at you. I'll be
back in a few minutes then.

1523
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,964
- All right. Thank you.

1524
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,058
It took you long enough.

1525
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,198
- We did it.

1526
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,167
- (laughing) I know.

1527
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,569
