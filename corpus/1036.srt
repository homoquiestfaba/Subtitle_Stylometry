00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,560
<i># Deep in the
Hundred Acre Wood</i>

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:36,068
<i># Where Christopher Robin plays</i>

3
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,835
<i># You'll find
the enchanted neighborhood</i>

4
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:46,846
<i># Of Christopher's
childhood days #</i>

5
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:51,441
<i>This is one of my
favorite once-upon-a-times,</i>

6
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,318
<i>although I'm not quite sure
which time it was once upon.</i>

7
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,415
<i>But it had been so nice and summery
in the Hundred Acre Wood,</i>

8
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:03,087
<i>and the sunshine
was as warm as a blanket.</i>

9
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,428
<i>And the streams
were gurgling happily.</i>

10
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,866
<i>As happily as a tumbly
full of honey...</i>

11
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,063
<i>... which is very happy.</i>

12
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,972
<i>But all that changed when...</i>

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,772
<i>... the stranger came.</i>

14
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,117
Honey.

15
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,053
Honey.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,234
Oh! Oh!

17
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,568
Oh, bother.

18
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,411
Oh, d-d-dear!

19
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,140
Oh, my!

20
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,979
It's got me!

21
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,717
Ah!

22
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,166
Huh?

23
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,639
Dear Roo. All excited
to go out already?

24
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,774
You're not
even dressed yet.

25
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,182
Mama, did you
hear that sound?

26
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,448
What sort of sound, dear?

27
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,719
I don't know.
It was sort of strange.

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,782
And kind of neat.

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,159
- Oh, the bother...
- Did it sound something like that?

30
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,529
No, Mama.
That's a Pooh Bear.

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,090
Good morning, Pooh.

32
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,036
What? Oh, well, uh,
good morning, Roo.

33
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,767
I wish it was.
A good morning, that is.

34
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,775
- Why? What happened?
- Many things.

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
- Many strange things.
- Oh, dear.

36
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm sorry, Roo.
I must be going.

37
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,778
Where was I? Oh, bother.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,944
- Oh, d-d-d-dear. Oh!
- Good morning, Piglet.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,454
What happened?
Where's everybody going?

40
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,922
To Rabbit's house.
He'll know what to do.

41
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,185
I hope.

42
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,454
Whatever do you
suppose is going on?

43
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,018
I'm gonna go see.

44
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,724
Have fun, dear.
Come home when I call.

45
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,959
Yes, Mama.

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,798
Pooh! Piglet! Wait for me!

47
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,872
Hold tight, Piglet.

48
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,877
Pooh! Piglet! Tigger!

49
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,642
- It's a Hundred Acre "catastrophide"!
- Help!

50
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,683
Open up
in the name of us!

51
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,741
Quick, Rabbit! Help!

52
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,585
All right.
Uh, what?

53
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,682
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- It came at me!

54
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,091
- I heard this neat sound.
- Terrible.

55
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,858
- What's this all about?
- It chilled me to the bone.

56
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,922
- I was asleep.
- Something like...

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,060
...this.
- One at a time!

58
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,571
Thank you.
Now, what is going...

59
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,840
Me! Pick me! Me, me, me!

60
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,370
- Tigger?
- There I was,

61
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,350
sleeping,
dreaming Tiggerish dreams.

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,319
And suddenly
everything starts shaking.

63
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,515
And there's stuff
falling everywhere.

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,115
And then it stops.

65
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,457
And I look around.

66
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:27,591
And there it wasn't, my most
"favoritest" family portrait.

67
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,693
It was clean gone.

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,706
Did it look something
like this, Tigger?

69
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,402
Yeah, it was...

70
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,038
Actually, it had
a little less Pooh in it.

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,741
I see.

72
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,340
And, uh, Pooh Bear,
what about you?

73
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,945
Well, whatever it was,
it ate my honey. Oh...

74
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,217
And... Aw!

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,816
Well, actually, I ate my honey.

76
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,385
- But it made me do it.
- Humph.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,559
I was asleep in bed, and I heard
this neat trumpety sound, and...

78
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,194
Thank you, Roo. Very good.

79
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,569
Now, Piglet, tell us
what happened to you.

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,134
Actually, l-l-I'd like
very much to forget.

81
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,305
Well, what we have here
is a mystery...

82
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,908
- Wow!
...of the most mysterious kind.

83
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,421
Hey, everybody.
Look what I found.

84
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,820
It's a swimming pool.

85
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,554
The sky has finally fallen.

86
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,188
Always knew it would.

87
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,028
Oh, m-m-m-my!

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,795
It looks like a footprint.

89
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,860
That's "impossibibble."

90
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:44,001
A footprint, indeed. Anyone
can see it's only a... a... a...

91
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,245
Rabbit, what sort of creature
do you suppose

92
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,583
would be attached
to a foot that...

93
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,390
...big?

94
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,586
There's only one thing
it could be.

95
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,289
A Heffalump.

96
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,663
Excuse me.
What's a Heffalump?

97
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,864
What's a Heffalump?

98
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,373
<i># Everyone knows
what a Heffalump's like</i>

99
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,205
<i># It's got fiery eyes
and a tail with a spike</i>

100
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,370
<i># Claws on its paws
are sharp as a tack</i>

101
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,006
<i># And wing-a-ma-things
coming out of its back</i>

102
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,744
- Out of its back?
- Of course, Roo. Precisely.

103
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,479
"Exact-tickally."

104
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,817
<i># Its bottom is up
and its top's really down</i>

105
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,380
<i># So its nose is its tail
or the other way 'round</i>

106
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,949
<i># Yeah, and it's wide as a river
and tall as a tree</i>

107
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,861
<i>- # Imagine gigantic
- # And times it by three</i>

108
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,059
<i>- # It clomps here and there
- # It stomps to and fro</i>

109
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,501
<i>- # Got three horns above
- # And eleven below</i>

110
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,630
<i>- # Those are its good points
- # There's much more to know</i>

111
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,800
<i># About the
dreadfully dreaded</i>

112
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,243
<i># Thoroughly three-headed
Horribly hazardous Heffalumps</i>

113
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,371
Wow. Neat.

114
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,417
Neat? It's most
certainly not neat.

115
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,679
<i># Everyone knows
they lurk and they creep</i>

116
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,085
<i># The best time to see one
is when it's asleep</i>

117
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,420
<i># If you sneak up
behind it and get it to jump</i>

118
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,755
<i># You can tell which part's
Heffa-hee-hee</i>

119
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,818
<i># And which part is lump</i>

120
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,093
<i># They'll steal all your
honey and eat your last crust</i>

121
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,691
<i># Stomp on your house
till it's nothing but dust</i>

122
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,759
<i># The worst part of all is</i>

123
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,828
They're different
from us?

124
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,735
<i># They're the
dreadfully dreaded</i>

125
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,507
<i># Thoroughly three-headed
Fiercely ferociously</i>

126
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,071
<i># Mostly atrociously
Horribly hazardous</i>

127
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,621
<i># Heffalumps #</i>

128
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,053
Yeah!

129
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,001
And they live
right over there.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,474
Heffalump Hollow.

131
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,136
Oh, oh, d-d-d-d-dear!

132
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,772
I know. I know.
Let's go get them.

133
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,648
Capture a Heffalump?
Ha-ha. Impossible.

134
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,243
Besides, it's never been done.

135
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,553
Then we'd be
the first to do it.

136
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,594
It'd be fun.
It'd be an adventure.

137
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,288
It'd be...

138
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,831
...an "expotition."

139
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,129
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

140
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes. Well, now that I think
of it, it would be a first.

141
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,703
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yes.

142
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:34,269
The first Heffalump expedition
in history.

143
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,248
Oh, splendid idea.

144
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,011
Glad I thought of it.

145
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:43,317
Of course, capturing a Heffalump
is a perilous affair.

146
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,222
Meticulous planning
is called for.

147
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:50,626
But how does one capture
a Heffalump?

148
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,755
How, you ask?

149
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,993
It's quite simple, really.

150
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,639
Come back with your equipment
and I'll show you how it's done.

151
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,041
Humph.

152
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,511
Woo-hoo!

153
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,258
Ohhh!

154
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,189
All right. Let's see
what everyone's brought.

155
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,255
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

156
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,860
Has anyone brought
anything useful?

157
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,599
I brought some rope.

158
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,905
Rope, yes. My thought exactly.
Thank you, Roo.

159
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,310
You see, a simple piece of rope
if the most effective device

160
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,541
for capturing Heffalumps.

161
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,481
Now, everyone together.

162
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,782
Aim at the barrel
and say in a firm voice,

163
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,119
"In the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,

164
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,455
I capture you."

165
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,054
In the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,

166
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,121
I capture you!

167
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,757
And toss.

168
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,934
Brilliant.

169
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,876
In the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,

170
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,379
I capture you!

171
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,481
Whoa! I did it! I did it!

172
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,282
I'm gonna capture
a whole bunch of Heffalumps.

173
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,222
Come on, everybody.
Let's go get them.

174
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,623
Just a moment, Roo.

175
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,392
A Heffalump expedition
is fraught with danger.

176
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,865
But we gotta go
catch the Heffalump.

177
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,893
Roo, you just can't argue
with a word like "fraught."

178
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,738
- But I really want to go.
- It's too dangerous, Roo.

179
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,210
You're simply too young.
You could get hurt.

180
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,709
But I...

181
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,615
Roo!
Time to come home!

182
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,211
Roo, dear!

183
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,759
You mean I can't go?

184
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,489
- I'm... I'm sorry, Roo.
- Roo!

185
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,992
Coming, Mom.

186
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,002
Oh, don't be sad, Roo.

187
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,971
L-l-I think you're
very, very lucky.

188
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,038
All right, everyone,
we'll meet here tomorrow morning

189
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,081
for the grand expedition.

190
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,330
And Rabbit and Tigger are
quite sure Heffalumps are so awful?

191
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,663
And everybody's
gonna catch one but me.

192
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,566
It isn't fair.

193
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,231
Oh, I'm sorry, Roo,

194
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,469
but there will certainly be
other adventures you can go on.

195
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,343
I'm grown up enough to catch
a Heffalump. Aren't I, Mom?

196
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,905
You're growing up
very fast, indeed, dear.

197
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,951
Faster than you think.

198
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,044
Do you think I could grow up
by tomorrow morning?

199
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,024
So soon? Why?

200
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,356
Then I could go
on the "expotition."

201
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,989
You know, dear, growing up
doesn't happen all at once.

202
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,397
It takes its own time.

203
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,335
But I need to grow up now.

204
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,841
Well, then, how about starting
with a good night's sleep,

205
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,899
little Mister Roo?

206

Do you want your nighty light?

227
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,223
No, thanks.
I don't need it anymore.

228
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:37,299
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mama.

229
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,096
I just know I could catch one.

230
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,741
Ahhh!

231
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,380
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

232
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,460
Ah!

233
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,427
Ah, yes.

234
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,663
A perfect morning
for catching Heffalumps.

235
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,730
It's very brave of you
to join us, Piglet.

236
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:53,608
Especially since it's
so very dangerous.

237
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,671
Well, I thought of hiding
under my bed, Pooh Bear,

238
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,616
but I'd rather be hiding
out here with all of you...

239
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,676
...than under my bed,

240
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,847
with all of me!

241
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,518
Now, now. We've gathered
the best minds to the task.

242
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,859
Namely my own.
We simply can't fail.

243
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,591
Right you are, Rabber-rific.

244
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,065
With Tigger's
Heffalump-tracking skills,

245
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,365
it's a fate-a-complicated.

246
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,496
With courage, cunning,

247
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,631
and superior tactics,

248
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,040
we'll be home by teatime.

249
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,101
Oh, I hope so.

250
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,779
Behold. Heffalump Hollow.

251
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,250
Home of the dreaded Heffalump.

252
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,882
Oh, my. I believe
that what's over there

253
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,327
doesn't look quite as friendly
as what's over here.

254
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:50,391
Fiddlesticks and nonsense.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

255
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,001
Hmm.

256
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,704
There you go. See?

257
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,474
Rabbit didn't
get gobbled up.

258
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,879
Yet.

259
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,277
Hmm!

260
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,520
Okay.

261
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,728
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

262
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,777
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Well, would you look at that.

263
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,746
I didn't get gobbled up either.
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

264
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,782
Yet.

265
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,250
There you are, Piglet.

266
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,755
It seems that both sides
of the fence

267
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,017
are about the same.

268
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,615
So far.

269
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,254
Ha! Now to teach those
Heffalumps a thing or two.

270
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,161
Ready!

271
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,133
Forward, march!

272
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,726
<i># No time to lose
Chin up, tallyho</i>

273
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,272

274
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,207

275

277
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,646
<i># The dreadfully dreaded

278
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,585

279
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,519
<i># Horribly hazardous Heffalumps #</i>

280
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,495
- Thank you, Pooh Bear.
- You're welcome.

281
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,499
Now,
remember, everyone,

282
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,058
the important thing is
that we stick together.

283
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,537
- Oh! Uh, coming.
- Safety in numbers, you know.

284
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,200
You know, if we didn't
stick together,

285
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,836
we would be very lost indeed.

286
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,879
Don't let me hold you up.

287
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,514
Got it.

288
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,418
Who's there?

289
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,568
Ah!

290
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,479
Hello?

291
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,957
Is anyone there?

292
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,705
Who's there?

293
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,144
Ah!

294
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,741
You're it.

295
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,884
Now you gotta catch me.

296
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:43,391
- I really need to go, 'cause...
- Aw. How come?

297
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,895
Because...

298
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,727
- I've got to catch a Heffalump.
- Oh, really?

299
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,793
You can catch me.
I'm a Heffalump.

300
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,136
A Heffalump?

301
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,039
Heffalump. Heffalump.

302
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,046
That's what I am, all right.
A Heffalump.

303
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,815
But you can't be.

304
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,045
Actually, I am.

305
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,315
If you're a Heffalump...

306
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,588
...then where's your horns
and spiky tail?

307
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,922
I don't know.

308
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,362
Wow, a spiky tail.

309
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,229
I wish I had one.

310
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,899
Are you sure you're a Heffalump?

311
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:30,169
My mummy says I am.

312
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,643
Well, if you are a Heffalump,

313
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,944
then in the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,

314
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,677
I capture you.

315
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,946
Okay.

316
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,016
Jump.

317
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,589
I did it.

318
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,761
I did it!

319
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,461
You did it!
You did it!

320
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,831
Yay!

321
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,331
You did it!
You did it!

322
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,041
Wait. I captured you. Whoa!

323
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,412
I capture you!
I capture you!

324
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,144
Whoa!

325
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:17,245
Wait! Whoa!
You're supposed to come with me!

326
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,776
Um...

327
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,016
...Piglet?
- Yes, Pooh?

328
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,389
Why are you setting out
little pink jelly beans?

329
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,523
I've been leaving a trail
so we can find our way back

330
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,623
from the Heffalump "expotition."

331
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,831
Oh, bother.

332
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,566
Oh, no.

333
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,976
We're lost!

334
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,683
Whoa!

335
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,916
- Stop!
- Okay.

336
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,890
What game should
we play now?

337
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,366
Rumblejump? Leaplog?
Or Hogswallow?

338
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,031
We can't play any games.

339
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,666
- Why?
- You've gotta come with me.

340
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,699
Yow!

341
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,812
Why?

342
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,075
Because I captured you.

343
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,741
Why?

344
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,546
Because...

345
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,678
Because I'm a grownup.

346
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,519
Wow. You're a grownup?

347
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,027
- Hey!
- A grownup.

348
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,085
You must have
your own call, then.

349
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,188
My call?

350
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,857
Yeah, like this.

351
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,900
Like that. But only better.

352
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,209
Haven't found mine yet.

353
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,681
My mum said I'll find it
when I grow up.

354
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,221
I can't wait till I grow up.

355
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,129
Well, growing up
takes a long time.

356
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,794
It took me just about forever.

357
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,241
That's it.
That's the sound I heard.

358
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,745
Gotta go now. Bye.

359
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,774
Wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave.

360
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,853
But my mummy's calling.

361
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,754
That's your mom?

362
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,588
Don't you have to go
when your mum calls?

363
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,959
Well, yeah, but...

364
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,429
Don't go yet.

365
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,331
Let's go see my friends first.
Then you can go.

366
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,996
Well, I don't know.

367
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,902
Please?

368
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,834
Mmm...

369
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,012
Okay, I guess.

370
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,845
Thanks.

371
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,353
But soon as we're done,
I've got to go.

372
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,888
Okay.

373
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,955
Forward, bounce!

374
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,866
I know another game.
It's called The Name Game.

375
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,698
Heffalumps have names?

376
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,363
Of course.

377
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,273
My name is Heffridge
Trumpeter Bumpet.

378
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:07,217
Heffridge Trumpler Brompet
Heffalump the Fourth.

379
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,877
Whoa.

380
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,217
How do you remember all that?

381
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,316
I can't, so everybody
calls me Lumpy.

382
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,725
Lumpy.

383
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,391
Lumpy-bumpy-dumpity-bump!

384
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,492
That's The Name Game.

385
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,732

394
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,519
Roo.

401
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,316
Okay,

402
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,684
so why are we hiding again?

403
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,815
We're not hiding.
We're planning an ambush.

404
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,382
So, um...

405
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,485
You see any Heffalumps yet?

406
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,893
I know.

407
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,900
I'll use my famous Heffalump
call to lure one over.

408
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,630
You have an infamous
Heffalump call?

409
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:10,936
Well, of course.
All great Heffalump catchers do.

410
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,971
Scree!

411
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,413
Yooo!

412
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,647
Ah!

413
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,586
M-M-My, what a dreadful sound.

414
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:30,151
Do you suppose
it might b-b-b-b-be a...

415
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,889
Oh, yes, Piglet.

416
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,228
It does sound rather Heffalumpish.

417
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,327
Oh, m-m-my!

418
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,597
Do you see it?

419
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,504
That one was good.

420
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,441
I see a tail.

421
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,671
Are there horns too?

422
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,942
Two of them.

423
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,677
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

424
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,077
Be brave, Piglet.

425
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,953
This is our chance
to save our woods.

426
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,454
And our honey.

427
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,289
Yes, Pooh.

428
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,958
In the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,

429
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,060
I capture you!

430
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,673
I caught a Heffalump, Piglet.
And so did you.

431
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,235
Rabbit would be proud of us.

432
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,506
Pooh, have you noticed
that Heffalumps

433
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,673
look a lot like rabbits?

434
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,685
And why do you think that is,
Piglet?

435
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,745
Oh, d-d-dear.
The Heffalump knows my name.

436
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,220
Well, hello there, Tigger.

437
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,357
Did you happen to see
the Heffalump I just captured?

438
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,161
Hmm.

439
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,862
You got me there.

440
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,805
<i># Kerplunk went the little
green frog last night</i>

441
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:53,503
<i># Kerplunk went

442
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,911

445
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,082
Hey. Come on. Let's go.

446
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:14,695
I think I better go home now.

447
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,097
Why?

448
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,695
'Cause I'm not supposed to go
in that part of the woods.

449
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,606
- Scary things live there.
- Huh?

450
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,378
That's where I live. There
aren't any scary things there.

451
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,913
Are too.

452
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,145
There's a stripy thing
that bounces, and it goes...

453
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,879
Whoo!

454
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,013
Then it pounces.

455
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,750
Whoa!

456
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,951
No, that's Tigger.

457
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,961
You're wrong about him.
He's great.

458
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,964
And there's this
little pig monster

459
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,433
that squeals and shakes
all the time.

460
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,834
And it will get you
if you don't watch out.

461
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,304
Oh, no.

462
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,900
You're wrong about Piglet too.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

463
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,810
And then there's
this loud thing,

464
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,315
and it's got long ears.

465
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,408
And he yells at everybody.

466
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,648
Yeah, you're kind of right
about Rabbit.

467
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,418
But he's okay
once you get to know him.

468
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,324
I don't want to get to know him.

469
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,494
Do I have to?

470
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:25,002
Hey, you really are scared,
aren't you?

471
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,604
- But my friends aren't scary.
- Uh-huh.

472
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,939
Who told you all this stuff?

473
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,844
I don't know.
Everybody knows.

474
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:40,577
Hmm. That's just what Rabbit
and Tigger said about Heffalumps.

475
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,321
There's nothing scary here.

476
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,351
Promise?

477
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,987
Promise.

478
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,368
Hmm.

479
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,636
Whoa!

480
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,482
- Roo.
- Sorry. My fault.

481
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,855
Why, thank you, Tigger.

482
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,800
All right, no more fun and games.

483
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,030
The Heffalump is all
but in our grasp.

484
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,542
- Go away!
- Excuse me.

485
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,546
Are we planning
another ambush?

486
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,640
Of course not. We're hiding.

487
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:50,483
H-H-How will we know
w-when it's s-safe?

488
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,286
Oh, m-m-my.

489
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,063
Well, Piglet?

490
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,960
Do you see it?

491
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,060
It's coming! It's coming!

492
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,799
I suggest a retreat
to another part of the wood.

493
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,273
I'm right behind you.
This way.

494
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,934
No, that way.

495
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,040
Oh, hello, Eeyore.

496
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,551
Ah! Goodbye, Eeyore.

497
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,849
I'm afraid to ask.

498
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,358
Hello?

499
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,196
Pooh Bear?

500
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,703
Hello?

501
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,898
Hello!

502
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,306
Anybody? Rabbit?

503
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,245
I caught the Heffalump.

504
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,009
I mean, uh, Lumpy.

505
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,513
Pooh Bear?

506
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,583
Hmm. It looks
like nobody's home.

507
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,835
Excuse me. Sorry.

508
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,677
Is that you?

509
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:29,152
Yeah. My mum usually
makes me a snack about now.

510
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,848
Do you have any Rumpledoodles?

511
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,892
- What are those?
- They're like biscuits.

512
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,984
They go rather well with honey.

513
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,359
Wait. That's Pooh's honey.

514
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,422
Mmm.

515
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,491
Oh, well. I guess he won't mind.

516
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,674
Um, we better go
before we break something.

517
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,148
Uh-oh.

518
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,387
This is where Rabbit lives.

519
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:18,401
Is he the one
with the pointy ears?

520
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,494
Don't worry.
He won't hurt you.

521
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,004
They must still be out
on the "expotition."

522
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,238
Lumpy?

523
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,444
Mmm.

524
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,358
Ha! Hmm.

525
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,354
Oh, yeah?

526
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,030
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

527
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,440
Whoa.

528
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,569
Huh? Wh...?

529
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,813
Ah!

530
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,364

Whoa!

Gotcha.

00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,495
Oh-oh!

535
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,868
My mum's not going to like this,

00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,966
Yeah. My mom neither...

537

...Lumpster.

538
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,872
We'd better get cleaned up.

539
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,645

- What kind of game?

540
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,581
Cannonball!

We're home.

All in all, a successful
Heffalump expedition.

581
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,288
- Are you sure, Rabbit?
- Well, certainly. Just look around.

582
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,393
You don't see any Heffalumps,
do you?

Oh, bother.

Rabbit, I don't think
it's successful anymore.

Rabbit! Rabbit! Rabbit!

00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,926
The Heffalumps
are among us!

- What'll we do?
- We're surrounded.

588
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,188
- Run for your life!
- Where?

589
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,631
- Look for an exit!
- They got us surrounded!

590
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,465
- Did you hear that?
- We're trapped!

591
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,630
That's it. Traps.

592
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,765
We need traps!

593
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,366
Everywhere!

594
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,739

00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,298
Behold.

It catches Piglets too.

- Wait!

703
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,757

00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,890
Lumpy's my friend.

712
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,553
He's just like us.

713
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,688
- He gets afraid.
- Oh!

714
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,427
- He likes honey.
- Oh!

715
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,935
And he even learned
how to bounce.

716
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,994
Oh, look at that.

717
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,905
So... So you've
got to un-capture him.

718
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,374
But...

719
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,313
- Oh!
- Lumpy!

720
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,248
Lumpy!

721
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,051
Oh!

722
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,528
We're coming, dear!

723
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,469
- Oh, dear. Roo?
- Roo!

724
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,138
- Hold on, Roo!
- Roo!

725
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,370
Mom... Mama?

726
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,649
Tigger.

727
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,917
We'll help you!
Just hang on!

728
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,253
Roo, I've got an idea!

729
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,294
One, two, three...

730
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,461
Hold on, Roo!

731
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,703
Pull!

732
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,219
Lumpy?

733
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,285
There, there, Piglet.

734
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,593
I think he's trying to help.

735
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,684
- Mummy!
- Mummy?

736
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,829
My mummy's coming!

737
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,815
Heffridge Trumpler Brompet
Heffalump the Fourth,

738
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,318
where have you been?

739
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:41,721
Oh, my little darling.
I've been worried sick.

740
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,988
I'm okay, Mummy,
but my friend Roo's in trouble.

741
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,926
Can't you save him?

742
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,998
- Mummy, this way. Hurry.
- Oh, my.

743
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,003
Roo, can you hear me, love?

744
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,410
Now, don't be frightened.
I'm Lumpy's mummy.

745
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,642
Here I am! Right here!

746
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,617
- Don't you worry, love.
- Oh!

747
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,651
Just leave it to me.

748
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,655
- Ohhh!
- Oh!

749
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,364
Now, now, try not to move, love.

750
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,340
Here I come.

751
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,643
Hold very still, love.

752
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,713
Easy does it.

753
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,154
Yeah!

754
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,163
Oh, thank goodness.

755
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:03,831
- Mama! Mama!
- Roo! Oh, Roo.

756
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,238
I was so worried.

757
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,574
Thanks, Mrs. Heffalump.

758
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,506
Mummy!

759
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,511
You did it! You did it!

760
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,022
My little Roo.

761
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,827
Oh, Lumpy.
You've found your call.

762
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,432
Oh, Rabbit.

763
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,438
That's why the Heffalump
was in our wood.

764
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,532
She was looking for her baby.

765
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,070
Young...

766
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:46,638
...Heffalump.

767
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,978
I...

768
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,815
That is to say, we...

769
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,482
Can you ever forgive us?

770
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,889
We've acted very badly.

771
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,019
That's okay, Long Ears.

772
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,962
I like this kid already.

773
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,525
You're right, Rooty-toot. He is
nice, once you get to know him.

774
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,095
Lumpy, darling.
We really should be going.

775
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,876
I have to go home now.

776
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,644
Goodbye, Lumpster.

777
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,551
Goodbye, Rooty-toot.

778
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,991
- Just a bit longer?
- Please?

779
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,289
Well...

780
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,594
I don't see why not.

781
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,567
I suppose a few more minutes
wouldn't hurt.

782
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,799
- Forward, bounce!
- Wow!

783
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,939
Here I come!

784
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,344
Roo, Roo, Rooty-toot-toot.

785
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,708
Woo-hoo!

786
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,212
Yippee!

787
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,460
<i>And so,
things were quite different</i>

788
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,405
<i>in the Hundred
Acre Wood after that.</i>

789
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:23,173
<i>You know, we never really did
capture a Heffalump that day.</i>

790
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,237
<i>It was more like...</i>

791
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:28,147
<i>... like Lumpy
captured all of us.</i>

792
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:40,355
<i># We stand shoulder to shoulder</i>

793
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:44,457
<i># We see eye to eye</i>

794
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,664
<i># We dive deep under water</i>

795
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:54,734
<i># We jump high in the sky</i>

796
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:02,609
<i># High</i>

797
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,858
<i># We stand shoulder to shoulder</i>

798
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,589
<i># We stand side to side</i>

799
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:17,827
<i># When one of us
gets a tiny bit tired</i>

800
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,896
<i># One gives the other a ride</i>

801
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:31,812
<i># Ride</i>

802
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,878
<i># I've never had
a best friend before</i>

803
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,015
<i># So I can't be sure</i>

804
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,583
<i># What it feels like</i>

805
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:51,357
<i># But I think it feels
more like this, I do</i>

806
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:55,234
<i># I think I feel
more like myself</i>

807
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,172
<i># When I'm with you</i>

808
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,648
<i># Finding, finding
Losing and finding</i>

809
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:49,851
<i># Making, making
A bond that is strong</i>

810
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,919
<i># Building, building
A house for a friendship</i>

811
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:59,992
<i># Breathing a breath for our song</i>

812
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:08,267
<i># Song</i>

813
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:16,742
<i># For our song #</i>

814
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,766
<i># In the name

815
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,810

<i># I think once upon a time</i>

826
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,416
<i># The Heffalumps
ruled the forest</i>

827
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,955
<i># They romped and stomped

828
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,615
<i># To their near and dearest</i>

829
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,354
