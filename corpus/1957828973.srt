00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,469
You saw that, right?

355
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,846
Mm-hmm.

356
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,933
Who's there?

357
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,059
(hissing)

358
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,103
Run!

359
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,355
(grunts)

360
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,648
Oh, my knee.

361
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,693
(pained whimpering)

362
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,778
Abby! (panting)

363
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,322
Where'd you go?

364
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,116
Please come back.

365
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,494
ABBY (distorted):
Gretchen, this way!

366
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,497
GRETCHEN:
Abby, how do I get out of here?

367
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,790
(panting)

368
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,125
- (distorted): Keep going, Abby.
- (coughs)

369
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,295
I'm right behind you.
I'm right behind you.

370
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,506
(gasping breaths)

371
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,758
(owl hooting)

372
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,342
GRETCHEN:
I'm right here, Abby.

373
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,594
- Gretchen!
- I'm right here, Abby.

374
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,179
I'm right behind you.

375
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,764
ABBY:
Gretchen, come on!

376
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,224
- Let's go!
- Abby, I don't see you.

377
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,977
Gretchen!

378
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,270
(distorted):
Hurry! This way!

379
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,858
Where are you? I can't see you.

380
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,527
GRETCHEN:
I'm right here, Abby.

381
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,154
ABBY:
The door's down here.

382
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,947
Gretchen!

383
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,283
(gasps, groans)

384
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,576
Abby?

385
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,745
DEMONIC VOICE:
Mine.

386
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,954
(Gretchen screams in distance)

387
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,956
(coughing)

388
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,167
- (owl hooting)
- (gasping breaths)

389
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,378
(coughing)

390
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,923
(panting, whimpering)

391
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,761
MARGARET:
Abby? Gretchen?

392
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,012
Over here!

393
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,306
MARGARET:
Abby, is that you?

394
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,350
(coughing)

395
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,521
There was something in the weird house,

396
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,606
and it was chasing us, and I ran.

397
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,818
Where's Gretchen?

398
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,530
I thought...
I thought she was right behind me.

399
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,406
No, I-I don't know.

400
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,408
She's gone. She's not there.

401
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,536
Um, where's Wallace?

402
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,329
He went home.

403
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,749
Well, we have to go back for her.

404
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,919
Gretchen!

405
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,003
Gretch!

406
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,672
- Gretchen!
- Gretch!

407
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,048
Gretchen!

408
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,469
This way.

409
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,600
MARGARET:
I really don't want to go into that place.

410
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,561
It's messed up and supposed to be haunted.

411
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,479
GLEE:
Are you sure she didn't run away, too?

412
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,314
No. She's in there.

413
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,861
- Come on.
- Mm-mm.

414
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,320
(groans)

415
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,197
- Gretchen.
- Gretchen!

416
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,658
- Gretch!
- Gretchen! -Gretchen!

417
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,871
Ugh. What's that smell?

418
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,417
Gretchen!

419
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,795
We saw something in here.

420
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,381
MARGARET:
You guys were just having a bad trip.

421
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,385
GLEE:
What's that? A scarecrow?

422
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,470
ABBY:
I-I thought it moved.

423
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,601
- (chittering)
- (screaming, panting)

424
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,730
Fucking raccoon.

425
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,691
- GLEE: Gretchen!
- MARGARET: Gretchen!

426
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,735
- GLEE: Gretchen!
- MARGARET: Where is she?

427
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,491
(gasps) Jesus. You scared me.

428
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,162
Where-where were you?

429
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,417
Where were you?

430
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,837
I thought you were right behind me.

431
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,176
(whimpers softly)

432
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,429
(sobbing)

433
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,603
Are you okay?

434
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,480
She's tripping balls.

435
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,734
(softly):
Hey.

436
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,488
It's gonna be okay.

437
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,412
Can we go home now?

438
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,416
SISTER KATHLEEN:
<i>Let's give a warm Aberdale welcome to</i>

439
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,795
"The Lemon Brothers
Have Faith & Fitness Show."

440
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,088
- Yeah!
- (rock music playing)

441
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,382
MARGARET: Aren't these the lame guys
who play the mall?

442
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,427
It's amazing to be here!

443
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,804
(laughing)

444
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,472
Hi. Howdy.

445
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,183
Hey, thanks for having us.

446
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,479
I'm Micah Lemon,
and these are my brothers.

447
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,481
- Jonah!
- (whoops)

448
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,192
And Christian!

449
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,276
- Yeah.
- Ha!

450
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,864
And we're here to lift you up to the Lord!

451
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,616
- (whooping)
- (applause)

452
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,284
- Whoa.
- (chuckles)

453
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,995
GLEE:
Lunch in the quad later?

454
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,496
But I'm not eating anything.

455
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,289
I've gained two pounds since Friday.

456
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,417
I thought drugs were supposed
to make you lose weight.

457
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,044
Yeah, well, those drugs
didn't make us do anything.

458
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,130
Well, most of us.

459
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,259
When you feel the weight of the world
pressing down on you,

460
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,846
you'll hear a voice inside your head.

461
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,639
Hello?

462
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,932
Who's there?

463
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,601
No, it doesn't mean
you're ready for the funny farm,

464
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:55,982
because that voice is God,
and he's saying, "Dude, I got this."

465
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,276
(grunts, yells)

466
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,028
(students cheering)

467
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,320
(both chuckle)

468
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,076
Yeah!

469
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,163
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

470
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,623
- Yeah! Ha!
- Yeah!

471
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,083
Earth to Gretchen.

472
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,418
What's up?

473
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,045
Huh?

474
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,714
- Nothing.
- CHRISTIAN: When I'm sweating blood

475
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,759
and I don't think I'm gonna make
the clean and jerk,

476
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,802
- suddenly I'll feel lighter.
- Come on.

477
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,388
That's when I say, "Thank you, God.

478
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,849
Thank you for taking my load!"

479
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,727
(laughter)

480
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,562
Gretch.

481
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,064
Psst.

482
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,108
What?

483
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,526
Are you okay?

484
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,070
(chuckles softly)

485
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,988
CHRISTIAN:
Well, don't they?

486
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,867
But that's when
we need to trust in God the most.

487
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,205
Whoa!

488
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,834
LEMON BROTHERS:
With the power of the cross,

489
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,795
anything is possible.

490
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,338
(yells)

491
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,798
(cheering)

492
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,883
(rock music continues)

493
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,266
And remember,
sometimes God lets you hit rock bottom...

494
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,019
- GLEE: I'll take a keychain!
- ...but that's just to show you

495
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,980
- that he is the rock at the bottom.
- (laughs)

496
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,026
(Gretchen taking short, trembling breaths)

497
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,822
(raspy breaths)

498
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,406
- Hey. We got shirts.
- (grunts)

499
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,866
Come on, let's go.

500
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,372
MICAH:
Now, who thinks they're strong?

501
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,748
JONAH:
Yeah, you are, Micah. Show 'em!

502
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,959
The Lord is power!

503
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,711
- (whooping) -(cheering)
- (rock music ends)

504
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,214
- MICAH: Yeah!
- JONAH: Yeah!

505
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,507
(birds chirping)

506
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,593
GLEE: You don't look so great, Gretchen.
You may want to eat something.

507
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,434
Maybe you should take
my P, B and J, Gretch.

508
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,019
I'm not hungry.

509
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,147
- MARGARET: Glee-Glee?
- GLEE: Hello.

510
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,648
You know I'm allergic to peanuts.

511
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,316
You're allergic to penis?

512
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,402
- You know, that explains a lot.
- (laughter)

513
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,071
Peanuts, you dipstick.

514
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,197
You know what?

515
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,449
I've got an EpiPen,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

516
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,744
- (yells)
- (laughter)

517
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,038
Good thing my girl's not.

518
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,835
Ugh. Would you guys stop sucking face?

519
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,087
It's nauseating.

520
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,672
We're nauseating?

521
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,924
Have you looked in a mirror today?

522
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,052
- Wally, I-I told you...
- I don't care if she had a bad trip.

523
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,471
She's being a snatch,
and she smells like dried spit.

524
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,348
GRETCHEN:
You're not fooling anyone

525
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,683
with your PDA, Stoney.

526
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,019
We all know you're packing a micro peanut.

527
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,690
What's your malfunction?

528
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,233
He's a poseur.

529
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,527
He only tells you he loves you
so you'll do him,

530
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,446
and he hits on your friends
behind your back.

And she told me she was okay
and that she loved us

1188

you know, on the other side.
