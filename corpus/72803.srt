1
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,476
Hurricane Gabriel...

2
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:32,836
continues to pound
the eastern seaboard.

3
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:36,716
It has now been upgraded
to a category 4 hurricane.

4
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:43,636
Forecasters are predicting...

5
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:46,316
major damage
and severe flooding...

6
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,556
which we are already seeing
in many parts...

7
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:49,756
Later, we go live...

8
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:52,236
to a tense scene
some 300 miles north...

9
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:53,876
where evacuees battle...

10
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,516
to stock up on food and water.

11
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,356
But first, the latest...

12
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:00,316
...for desperately needed
medical aid.

13
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:05,116
-City Of Ghosts-

14
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,156
Here at Gibraltar Point...

15
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:42,516
we have reports
of entire communities...

16
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:44,196
being leveled.

17
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:47,836
Gusts as strong as
150 miles per hour...

18
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,796
strong enough to level homes.

19
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,716
Scores of residents
have heeded the call...

20
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:54,556
and have been
pouring into the shelter...

21
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,796
here at Gibraltar Point
all night.

22
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:58,636
The big concern for them is...

23
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,836
will they have a home
to return to?

24
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,396
I don't know
what to expect to find...

25
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,036
when I get back there...

26
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:08,076
but I'm sure we'll be talking
with the insurance company.

27
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,756
Well, we do have insurance,
thank God.

28
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,556
I expect it'll take time...

29
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,956
but, you know, eventually,
we'll have our house back.

30
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:17,436
We've got insurance, so...

31
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:18,796
The governor
of North Carolina...

32
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,476
has declared a state
of emergency in several...

33
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,116
Jimmy, we've got a real
mess on our hands.

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,556
I've been trying
to contact Mr. Nagel.

35
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,436
Jimmy Cremmins?

36
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,396
Yeah, I am.

37
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:42,636
What's going on here?

38
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,996
I'm Agent Burden
with the F.B.I.

39
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:46,196
This is Agent Philips.
Can we have a word with you?

40
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:47,356
Sure.

41
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:49,916
Who's supposed
to be in charge...

42
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:51,076
of business operations?

43
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,196
Mr. Nagel.

44
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,556
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

45
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,996
He was based overseas.

46
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,156
He called nearly every day.

47
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:00,036
I just never--

48
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,076
I never met him in person.

49
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,476
We'll need you
to come down to the office...

50
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,596
to answer a few more questions.

51
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,956
Let's go over it one more time.

52
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:13,996
I answered an ad...

53
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,596
in "The Tribune."

54
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:19,076
Capable Trust was looking
to fill some positions for...

55
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,756
North American
headquarters, and...

56
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,796
Well, they hired the right guy.

57
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,596
You're a hell
of a salesman, Jimmy.

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,196
Were there any other
offshore accounts...

59
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:30,636
besides the ones in
Zurich and the Caymans?

60
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:31,916
No. Not to my knowledge.

61
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:34,796
So they were the accounts you
would draw from to pay claims.

62
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,276
Right.

63
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,516
It's gonna be tough
to pay those claims, Jimmy.

64
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,036
Those accounts are empty.

65
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,076
It's not your fault,
of course...

66
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,196
but it is a shame.

67
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,916
All those innocent people
lost their homes.

68
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,076
And you have no idea...

69
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,996
where we can find
this Mr. Nagel?

70
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:54,756
Don't you want
to help us, Jimmy?

71
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,836
What do you think?

72
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,956
Of course I do.

73
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,196
Mr. Nagel--
the name keeps coming up.

74
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,836
He wasn't lying.
I ran a check.

75
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,916
There was an ad in "The Tribune"
classified section...

76
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,396
Iast September.
What do you think?

77
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:12,956
It's a sophisticated
Ponzi scheme...

78
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:15,716
Iike that outfit operating
out of Belgium last year...

79
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,036
selling disaster insurance...

80
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,076
with no intention
of paying any claims.

81
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,956
I bet the farm this guy
is connected somehow.

82
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,996
We just got to keep on digging.

83
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,836
Collect call
from United States...

84
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,956
from Jimmy.

85
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:29,476
I accept. Jimmy, it's Kaspar.

86
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,996
Listen.

87
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,196
I need to talk to him now.

88
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,316
He's unreachable.

89
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,156
He's not in Bangkok.
He's not in town.

90
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:38,196
He's not in Ba...

91
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,476
Well, where is he?

92
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:41,356
Cambodia. That's all I know.

93
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,796
But he's supposed to call in.
Perhaps I can help.

94
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:45,996
Cambodia?

95
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,196
Well...

96
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:01,676
we ran a check on you.

97
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,396
You came up clean.

98
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:08,516
We're sorry you had
to go through all this...

99
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:11,036
but a lot of people
got swindled.

100
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:15,596
Even you were misled,
so it seems.

101
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:19,236
This investigation
is just now getting underway.

102
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,356
And we're gonna need
your cooperation down the road.

103
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,556
Listen...

104
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,516
what's gonna happen
to the people...

105
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,036
who lost their homes?

106
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,956
That'll be up to
the State Liquidation Bureau.

107
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,716
There'll be some kind
of compensation, I imagine...

108
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,636
but nothing like
those policies promised.

109
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,116
And what about this Mr. Nagel?

110
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,796
Any luck with him?

111
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,036
I'm afraid
Mr. Nagel never existed.

112
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,236
But when we pinpoint
who it is...

113
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,236
that was fronting
that operation--

114
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,876
and we do believe
it's someone from your office--

115
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,756
we'll get Mr. Nagel.

116
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:50,156
It's just a matter of time.

117
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,636
Well...

118
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,596
we would appreciate it
if you'd stick around town...

119
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:55,876
till this thing's resolved.

120
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,796
Anything I can do to help.

121
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:58,956
Good.

122
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:02,756
One more thing.

123
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:04,516
We'd like it if you'd
turn over your passport...

124
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:05,716
for the time being.

125
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,156
Of course,
you're under no obligation.

126
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,316
My passport?

127
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:11,676
That's right.
Won't be needing it...

128
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,196
unless you're planning
on leaving the country.

129
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,876
No, of course not.

130
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,116
Well, good luck
with the investigation.

131
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,156
Jimmy, welcome.

132
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,596
It's been a long time.

133
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:28,676
Did you get my message?

134
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,756
Yeah. Sure. No trouble at all.

135
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,236
Have you been paid
any money yet?

136
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,636
Neither have I.

137
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,676
I'm gonna level with you.

138
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:41,796
I think Marvin
has got himself...

139
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,756
into a bit of a jam.

140
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,996
With who?

141
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:48,036
With Nevesky and the Russians
back in New York.

142
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,316
You didn't know?

143
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:52,116
They were our partners.

144
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,516
Now they're looking for him.

145
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,436
What's he doing in Cambodia?

146
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:58,356
Casino.
I don't know much about it.

147
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,756
Right.

148
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:01,676
There's someone
I want you to meet.

149
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:02,836
Rocky, come here.

150
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,316
Rocky, this is Jimmy.

151
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,996
Jimmy, this is Rocky.

152
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,076
She's wonderful, isn't she?

153
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,156
Rocky.

154
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,716
We talked about that.

155
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,556
We're engaged to be married.

156
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,836
Congratulations.

157
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,556
She's a bit of a diamond...

158
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,756
in the raw, you know.

159
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,916
I'll make a lady out of her.

160
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,756
You should go up to Chiang Mai.

161
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:37,876
It's fantastic up there:

162
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,676
bucolic scenery,
cheap guesthouses.

163
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,516
I'm not going up to Chiang Mai.

164
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,596
I'm here to see Marvin.

165
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,236
Well, he won't be expecting you.

166
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,876
Good.

167
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,156
It'll be a surprise.

168
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:57,116
He'll be glad to see me.
It's been a while.

169
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,316
Well, there's 2 morning flights.

170
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:02,756
If we don't talk
before you leave...

171
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,476
Iet's meet the day after
tomorrow in Phnom Penh...

172
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,756
at noon, at the Belleville.

173
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:09,716
They can get you
a room there as well.

174
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:25,156
-Hello?
-Teddy, it's me--Jimmy.

175
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,276
What's your plan?

176
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,516
I'm flying out first
thing in the morning.

177
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:29,916
Not so fast.

178
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,596
I had a buddy
check back channels...

179
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,356
with someone in the agency.

180
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,076
The airport
has a security company...

181
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,436
that's plugged
into the embassy...

182
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,996
and your name and passport
are in their system.

183
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,836
-Shit.
-Hey, that's no sweat.

184
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:43,236
I'll get you across the border.

185
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:44,876
I live down that way.

186
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,756
Now, there's
an overnight train...

187
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,156
out of Hualampong.

188
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:51,396
Get you in around 5 a.m.

189
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,756
-Thanks.
-You know where I live?

190
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,236
-Yeah.
-Good.

191
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,556
I'll meet you at the station.

192
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,716
Thanks, Teddy.

193
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:35,556
We had some great times
in Bangkok--

194
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:36,676
Marvin and me...

195
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,156
but that was
a lifetime ago, kid.

196
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,196
As the lady says...

197
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,036
I no longer am
what I once was...

198
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,956
nor ever shall be again.

199
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,876
I don't know what
the hell Marvin's up to.

200
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,036
You just be careful.

201
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,756
Something's changed in him.

202
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,396
You can't keep
stealing from Peter...

203
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,516
to pay Paul.

204
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:01,836
Sooner or later,
Peter gets pissed off.

205
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:10,916
The main road is off-limits.

206
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,436
There was a French cyclist...

207
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,436
murdered there
about a month ago.

208
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,396
You get waylaid...

209
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,316
you won't be writing
any postcards.

210
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,476
Where you go, sir?

211
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,716
I'm looking for the Belleville.

212
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,236
Yeah. Well, I know.

213
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,596
That's the place right here.
You know this place?

214
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:22,756
I know, really.

215
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,516
-ls it far from here?
-Not so far. It's over there.

216
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,596
OK. No, thanks.

217
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,836
I got it.

218
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:35,436
Where you from, sir?

219
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:36,556
The United States.

220
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,116
Yes. I know very good.

221
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,716
My name Sok.

222
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:41,596
Sok, Jimmy.

223
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,716
Is this place far?

224
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,716
Not so far.

225
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:46,636
Don't worry, sir,
I'm a safety driver.

226
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:47,756
Good.

227
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,556
-This is the Belleville?
-Yeah. Belleville.

228
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,396
I see you took the long way.

229
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,356
Not so long way.

230
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,436
What do I owe you?

231
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,396
No problem. You pay after.

232
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:05,876
I wait here for you.

233
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,076
-You sure?
-Yeah, sure.

234
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:26,956
Excuse me.

235
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,076
Yeah?

236
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:30,996
I'm looking for a guy
named Kaspar.

237
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:33,756
I don't know everyone
who comes to this place.

238
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,716
-What is your name?
-Jimmy.

239
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:38,156
Can I get you something?

240
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,516
-A beer.
-Beer.

241
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:41,796
Jimmy.

242
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,356
Laughing Lotus.

243
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,996
-Beer.
-Thanks.

244
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,196
Hey, man.

245
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,436
You remember me?

246
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:02,796
-Am I supposed to?
-You look awfully familiar.

247
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,796
Don't we know each other?

248
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,316
I don't think so.

249
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:09,676
You're Robbie, right?

250
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,956
Nah.

251
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:15,756
My apologies.

252
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,396
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

253
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,996
I was told
that you had rooms available.

254
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:23,036
Yeah.
$5.00 a night with a fan...

255
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,996
and 8.00 with
air conditioning.

256
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,836
OK. I'll take the one
with the air conditioning.

257
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,596
Across the street,
second floor...

258
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,156
bathroom down the hall.

259
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,516
I'd like a beer, Emile.

260
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,156
No. Fuck you, deadbeat.

261
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,756
You still haven't
paid your tab.

262
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,556
-I'm good for it.
-When?!

263
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,996
I got it.

264
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,796
Here, you little shit.

265
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,476
You have a short memory.

266
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,796
Before, you would do
anything I asked.

267
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,876
But lately, you act
as if we have nothing.

268
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,596
It's not an act.
We have nothing.

269
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,396
-You fucking bitch.
-What did you call me?

270
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,076
I call you a fucking bitch...

271
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,236
so fuck off.

272
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:07,916
What is that in your bag?

273
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,836
-This!
-Hey!

274
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,396
What the fuck is that
doing in your bag--the statue?!

275
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:13,636
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:15,596
You stole it from the wat.

277
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:18,276
It was you.
I can't fucking believe it.

278
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,596
Hey! Keep your mouth shut.

279
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,956
Hey, I need your passport.

280
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,076
Yes. It's a new law
of the country.

281
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:30,996
Don't worry. I get you back.

282
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,036
Emile.

283
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,596
Give me the fucking bag.

284
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,076
No way! You stole this!

285
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,276
Leave the fucking bag, OK?

286
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,396
You fucking thief!

287
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,436
Hey!

288
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,436
-Get off me!
-Fucking bitch!

289
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:51,916
Hey!

290
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:07,876
Hey, let me take care
of that piece of shit.

291
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,396
Hey!

292
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,556
You piece of shit.

293
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,356
-You sure you're all right?
-Yeah.

294
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,796
-I can't believe this. Thanks.
-You need some ice?

295
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:46,956
-I'm OK.
-OK?

296
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,516
Yeah.

297
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,316
Thanks for stepping in.
Thanks for your help.

298
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:31,796
What? Hey!

299
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,476
Hey!

300
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:43,516
Hey!

301
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,476
How's the room?

302
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:47,916
What's the matter?
A little hoity-toity for you?

303
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:49,956
Huh?

304
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,356
I got coupons.

305
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:57,036
You know a place called
the Laughing Lotus?

306
00:17:58,876 --> 00:17:59,996
It's a brothel...

307
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,236
on the other side of town.

308
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,316
If you like karaoke
and Vietnamese girls...

309
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,876
that place is for you.

310
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,676
Is everything OK with the room?

311
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:10,796
The room's fine.

312
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,076
I don't remember
requesting a monkey.

313
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:14,196
Monkey?

314
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,316
-Yeah.
-Where?

315
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,436
In my room--on the terrace...

316
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:20,156
there was a monkey.

317
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,836
No. You must be mistaken.

318
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,236
There is no monkey
in my hotel. No.

319
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:26,636
Well, maybe it was a dog...

320
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,636
but it looked an awful
lot like a monkey.

321
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,036
It had hands.

322
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,076
There is no monkey
in my hotel. No.

323
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,316
Everything is OK with the room?

324
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:41,436
The air conditioner
is on the blink.

325
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:42,676
It's laying on the floor.

326
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:45,876
Yes. I'll send you someone
tomorrow morning, you know.

327
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,076
He'll have a look.

328
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:52,516
My passport.

329
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:53,756
-Passport?
-Yeah.

330
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,276
-I gave it to you.
-You did?

331
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:58,476
Don't you remember?
I put it right here on the bar.

332
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,676
I thought you took it back.

333
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:02,556
I got a friend in Bangkok
who lost his passport.

334
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:03,676
They put him on the list.

335
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:05,676
Shut up. You're scaring the man.

336
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,316
No. Wait a minute.

337
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,276
That little cocksucker
you were talking to--

338
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,716
he probably took it.

339
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:14,916
But, no, don't worry.

340
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,636
He comes here very often,
you know.

341
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:17,796
I will get it for you.

342
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,236
You don't want to be
on the list. I'm on the list.

343
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:26,356
Son of a bitch!
Go and don't come back! Go!

344
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:34,876
Street 213. Laughing Lotus.

345
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,116
Yes, I take you.

346
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,396
Why you go there?
Street 213 no good.

347
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,516
I got to meet someone.

348
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,756
You want to meet someone.

349
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,756
Someday, I buy moto-taxi.

350
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,476
How long have you
been doing this?

351
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,076
Long time.

352
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,716
More than 7 year.

353
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:51,876
First, I was in the army
in Kampong Thom.

354
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,756
You want to see
my army picture? Here.

355
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:01,116
How old are you here?

356
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,236
Twenty-eight, 29. Not sure.

357
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,916
-Not sure?
-Yeah.

358
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,516
How come?

359
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:08,556
Because all my documents
were lost...

360
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,276
during the Khmer Rouge.

361
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:11,956
After I finish my education...

362
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,836
I went to join to the army...

363
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,516
to fight the Khmer Rouge.

364
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:18,076
They kill my father...

365
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:20,836
because he was a doctor.

366
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:26,076
I do not want them
to kill people again.

367
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,276
What did you say your name was?

368
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,476
Call me Sok.

369
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:30,596
I'm Jimmy.

370
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:40,636
Stick around, Sok.

371
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:41,956
I won't be long.

372
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,396
Hi.

373
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:46,836
Is this the Laughing Lotus?

374
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:48,836
Yes. You like yum-yum? Come.

375
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:24,676
How are you?
Where you come from?

376
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,116
United States.

377
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,836
You'll do all right
with that one, mate.

378
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:30,716
She'll give you
a run for your money.

379
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:32,636
This one here, she's my girl.

380
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:33,836
She's mine.

381
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,476
I'm taking her away from here.

382
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:39,476
I'm taking her to Battambang,
to beauty school.

383
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,476
In Australia,
I'm putting her in college.

384
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:43,916
-Beauty school.
-Excuse me, sir.

385
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,396
There's a guy
I'm supposed to meet...

386
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,676
named Marvin.

387
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:51,636
You see this papasan
over here? He's going down, man.

388
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:54,556
He's a scumbag.
He's a slave trader.

389
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,756
I'm going to take him out.

390
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:58,036
I'm gonna have to
take the fucker out.

391
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:01,636
Fuck it!
Give me a fucking beer...

392
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:02,916
Papasan!

393
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,396
Hey! Get your hands--
I'm taking her...

394
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,076
I'm taking you
to beauty school.

395
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:45,836
Get the fuck off me,
you motherfucker...

396
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,236
Hello!

397
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:09,716
Hello. She fix you.

398
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,876
Bye-bye.

399
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,116
Hey, Sok.

400
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,676
I should have listened to you.

401
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:21,436
Yeah. That place no good.

402
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,276
Many bad people.

403
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:25,076
Many bad people, all right.

404
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,436
Why did you take me here?

405
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:30,876
My house right over there.

406
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,716
Yeah, it's good place.

407
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:34,636
She's my friend.
She's a doctor.

408
00:25:35,716 --> 00:25:37,796
-How are you feeling?
-I've felt better.

409
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,436
Bye-bye!

410
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,396
Yeah. Yes, they like
to say in English to you.

411
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,196
They think that you like it.

412
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,196
If you want
to stay longer in Cambodia...

413
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:51,636
you should try
to be away from trouble.

414
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,676
I will try to be
away from trouble.

415
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:55,436
-Thank you.
-Yes.

416
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,036
Excuse me.

417
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:10,076
What time did Marvin drop
off that note yesterday?

418
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,516
No, he didn't. It was a Khmer.

419
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,116
He said he worked for Marvin.

420
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,556
Who's looking for Marvin?

421
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,076
A friend of his.

422
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,596
You know where he is?

423
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:23,396
No. But I know
who he hangs out with--

424
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:25,796
an ex-general named Sideth...

425
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,956
and that guy Marvin's
way out of his league.

426
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,076
Who are you?

427
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:31,956
It doesn't matter who I am.

428
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:33,116
Emile.

429
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:39,236
You want a piece
of friendly advice?

430
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,156
Go back to wherever
it is you came from...

431
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:42,636
and leave those people alone.

432
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:46,396
Salud.

433
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:54,556
-Who's Sideth?
-A bad guy.

434
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,436
Anybody else come back
here looking for me?

435
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:58,116
I haven't seen anyone.

436
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,276
You know, things run
on a different clock here.

437
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,516
My clock stopped
when a B-40 rocket...

438
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,756
hit my jeep in Mondolkiri.

439
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,116
Really?

440
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:07,916
I still got shrapnel in my neck.

441
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,316
You can see it.

442
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:13,996
Look.

443
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,716
I don't see anything.

444
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:27,876
Maybe you need
a pair of glasses.

445
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:34,996
He calls himself
"the man of contradictions."

446
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,836
But he's a little bit...

447
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:39,076
This place attract them
like flies.

448
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:43,116
Yes. I have Calvados
from my country.

449
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,996
-Thanks.
-Have a glass.

450
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:53,316
-What's her story?
-Sophie?

451
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:56,636
No offense,
but guys like you and me--

452
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,516
we don't stand a chance.

453
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,876
No offense, but...

454
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,516
speak for yourself.

455
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,076
Excuse me.

456
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,316
-What?
-Those are my glasses.

457
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:20,356
Here. $5.00.
Get yourself a new pair.

458
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:24,596
I'll take these back. Thanks.

459
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:33,196
Hi.

460
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:34,996
Thank you so much for--

461
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:36,476
What happened to your eye?

462
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,276
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

463
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,036
Yeah. You seem like that type.

464
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:44,356
Which type?

465
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:47,116
The wrong place,
wrong time type.

466
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:49,196
I guess that makes two of us.

467
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:50,636
-Please.
-Sophie.

468
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:52,876
Gonna introduce us
to your friend?

469
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:57,036
-Jimmy.
-Hi. Sabrina. Robbie.

470
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,516
So this is for you.

471
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:03,836
So are you free for...

472
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:04,996
tonight for dinner?

473
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,076
You know, I can't.
I've got plans tonight.

474
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:10,756
We should go.
We're gonna be late.

475
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,076
Come on, Robbie.

476
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,836
You weren't on the plane.

477
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,516
Wow. That's a new look for you.

478
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:43,956
You like it?

479
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:45,116
I can fix you up for one.

480
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:50,156
-What happened?
-I got popped.

481
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:52,836
-By who?
-I don't know.

482
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,756
Well, you should be grateful
money's all they wanted.

483
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,476
You're lucky one of your kidneys
isn't lying...

484
00:29:57,516 --> 00:29:59,916
at the bottom
of somebody's ice chest.

485
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:01,676
They didn't take my money.

486
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:09,436
Does Marvin know
where I'm staying?

487
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,716
Well, you can ask him
when you see him.

488
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:30,676
I hate this country.

489
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:46,356
Hey, Jimmy boy.

490
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:57,196
It's good to see you.

491
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,196
So, come on.

492
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:03,476
What do you think of the layout?

493
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,396
You know,

494
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:08,436
this is the old
governor's residence.

495
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:15,676
Do you like it?

496
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,716
It could do with
a fresh coat of paint.

497
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,196
The whole country
needs a paint job.

498
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:22,956
But that's part of its charm.

499
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,436
Yeah.

500
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:26,836
I need to talk to Jimmy alone...

501
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,116
for a second.

502
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:29,716
You want to wait outside?

503
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,236
Yeah. Sure.

504
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:38,476
That was some place
you sent me to yesterday.

505
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,996
-I got your note.
-What note?

506
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:44,836
The one you left
at the Belleville.

507
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,236
I didn't leave you any note.

508
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,716
-What are you doing here?
-I thought you wanted to see me.

509
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,436
-I what?
-I thought you wanted to see me.

510
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:23,876
I'll call you
if I want to see you.

511
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:27,276
-Go.
-Good-bye.

512
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,756
I have them boil everything--
food, water...

513
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,516
even the bed sheets
and the tablecloth.

514
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:34,996
85% of the people
on the planet are infested...

515
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,756
with some kind
of microscopic bug.

516
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:39,076
Now, with stats like that...

517
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,716
you know
you can't be too careful.

518
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:47,716
You were supposed to stay put...

519
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:49,836
until you heard from me.

520
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:53,316
Yeah, well...

521
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,076
The Feds were all over me.

522
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:57,476
I had to get away.

523
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:01,236
Forget it. Spilled milk.

524
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:03,876
And you did an excellent job.

525
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,036
-I'm very proud of you, Jimmy.
-Thanks.

526
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,316
To tell you the truth,

527
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:10,916
I think in some ways
you're better off here.

528
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,756
I mean, this place is wide open.

529
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,436
A fortune to be made.

530
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,276
You are gonna want
to be a part of it.

531
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:20,596
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure,
not after the last one.

532
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:23,316
We really sold
those people a bad deal.

533
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:24,836
If I had to do it
all over again...

534
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,556
if I could change things,
believe me, I would.

535
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:29,476
But Capable Trust
was a big score...

536
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,516
and you're gonna get your cut.

537
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,956
I don't know.
I've got enough bad karma...

538
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,236
to last me 6 lifetimes.

539
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,756
I don't need any more.

540
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:42,156
Look at you. You're fried, man.
You're all burnt out.

541
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:44,556
It's OK 'cause it
happens to everybody.

542
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:47,996
You needed to get away,
and here you are.

543
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,116
Marvin.

544
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,676
My mind's made up.

545
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:01,316
Hey, listen. Why don't you
give this thing to Kaspar?

546
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,236
Kaspar? No.

547
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,836
It's just not the same
as you and me.

548
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,676
Hey. I'm gonna get your money...

549
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:17,116
but you got to wait 2 or 3 days.

550
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,716
That's all right. I got to
figure out this passport thing.

551
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:21,076
I'll look into that.

552
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:23,716
Things got funny ways
of turning up around here.

553
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:24,836
In the meantime...

554
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,716
I want to see
if I could change your mind...

555
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:27,876
make you reconsider.

556
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,236
Stick around.

557
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,356
Having a little
get-together tonight--

558
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:32,316
a few investors
from Hong Kong...

559
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,076
a pig on a spit...

560
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,396
a few girls come by.

561
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,956
Nice.

562
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:55,156
-Must be the general.
-The ex-general.

563
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:57,956
Once a general,
always a general.

564
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,476
He has contacts
with police intelligence.

565
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,836
He'll do anything for a buck...

566
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:01,996
and I like him.

567
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,676
General.

568
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,116
I brought some of my staff.
I hope it's OK.

569
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,236
It's wonderful.

570
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,356
Somnang,
would you get some drinks...

571
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,076
for our guests, please?

572
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:18,596
-You should be cautious.
-Sideth?

573
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,156
General, this is my colleague...

574
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:22,276
and financial advisor
from Hong Kong, Ming Chew.

575
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,716
How do you do?

576
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:24,836
He's going to be
accompanying me...

577
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,716
to the coast for
our presentation.

578
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,236
Good. I have spoken
with our associates in Kep...

579
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:30,716
and everything's
been arranged.

580
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,116
Casino?

581
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:34,076
Isn't that a little premature?

582
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:36,356
These people don't
even have shoes.

583
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:39,276
Josef, why don't you
stay out of this?

584
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:41,196
We won't need shoes
in my casino.

585
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:43,076
You don't need shoes to lose.

586
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,796
You know,
I have a wonderful feeling...

587
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,916
about the old casino...

588
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,996
and its surroundings.

589
00:35:51,036 --> 00:35:53,436
From what I gather,
it could be the next Acapulco.

590
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,636
Kep, Acapulco--

591
00:35:57,676 --> 00:35:59,716
What would it cost
to change that name?

592
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,196
Why don't you call it
Marvinville, Marvin?

593
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,796
Right.

594
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:08,276
Well,
if you'll just walk this way...

595
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,316
I have something very
exciting to show you.

596
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,156
We begin with our flagship--

597
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:22,236
the 30-story, 500-room...

598
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:24,316
Silver Palace Hotel and Casino.

599
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,716
Connecting the hotel
with the casino...

600
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,596
will be
an air-conditioned tunnel...

601
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,716
complete with moving walkways.

602
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:33,156
Our hunting lodge
and firing range...

603
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,076
will provide
a variety of weapons...

604
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:38,276
such as M-16, AK-47...

605
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:40,476
and the B-40 rocket.

606
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,156
Our big game park...

607
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,516
will be featuring
many exotic species...

608
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:45,636
from around the world.

609
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:49,356
In addition will be
24 traditional bungalows...

610
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:50,996
featuring air conditioning...

611
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:52,476
and jacuzzis...

612
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:15,796
Shut up!

613
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:22,876
Good boy.

614
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,436
There have been
some additional complaints...

615
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:51,716
about the monkey.

616
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,476
It's been pissing and
shitting in the bougainvillea.

617
00:39:55,516 --> 00:39:57,676
If I catch him, I promise you...

618
00:39:57,716 --> 00:40:00,756
I will feed him
to Oliver, my python.

619
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:02,236
He loves monkey.

620
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:06,156
Oliver, the monkey.

621
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,556
Monkey.

622
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:12,116
As I discussed with Mr. Chew...

623
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,196
I have prepared
some cash flow projections...

624
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:16,876
showing the cost of material...

625
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,796
the cost of labor.

626
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,556
Good morning, General.
You sleep well?

627
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:23,676
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

628
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,316
Can I speak with you a moment?

629
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,036
Sure.

630
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,276
Excuse me, gentlemen.

631
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:33,596
You might want to
have a look at this.

632
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:39,436
Nevesky.

633
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:05,476
They arrived in Bangkok
yesterday afternoon.

634
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,076
Russians.

635
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:13,636
How did they find me?

636
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:20,916
What?

637
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:22,356
Well, you know I wouldn't talk.

638
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:25,516
No. Of course not.

639
00:41:27,756 --> 00:41:29,956
And Jimmy would
never give me away.

640
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:34,876
At least not deliberately.

641
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:38,396
Where is the kid?

642
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:40,996
He's at the Belleville.

643
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:43,756
I'll go talk to him.

644
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:05,316
Hi, sir.

645
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:15,036
Who is it?

646
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,276
It's me.

647
00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:20,676
I need to talk to you.

648
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:24,396
Marvin's concerned
his whereabouts...

649
00:42:24,436 --> 00:42:26,156
may have been revealed.

650
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:29,556
He has to get out of town
for a couple of days.

651
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:32,356
And he wants you to be
gone when he returns.

652
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,476
Here's a plane ticket
back to Bangkok...

653
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:36,556
$5,000.

654
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,716
You'll get the rest
when everything settles down.

655
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:42,036
You should leave immediately.

656
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:44,556
Not without my passport.

657
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,396
Thanks for the dough.

658
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,036
Did Marvin mention anything...

659
00:42:53,116 --> 00:42:55,036
about the money last night?

660
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,876
It seems wrong.

661
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:03,876
We've been with him so long...

662
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,116
he's been like a father to you.

663
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,476
Now to be treated this way...

664
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:10,076
What way?

665
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:11,636
We made nearly $10 million...

666
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,076
on that insurance job...

667
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:15,676
which he's now rolled over
into this casino.

668
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:16,836
He's up to his eyeballs...

669
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:18,396
with this ex-general
and his guys...

670
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,996
and you and l--
we don't get to see a dime.

671
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:22,716
Look, Kaspar,
I'm not really concerned...

672
00:43:22,796 --> 00:43:25,156
whether I get paid or not.

673
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,356
To tell you the truth...

674
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:27,476
I could care less...

675
00:43:27,556 --> 00:43:29,796
about his partners, his casino.

676
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:31,076
It's all yours.

677
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:35,996
Just remember never to let
your personal feelings...

678
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,316
for somebody...

679
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:40,116
interfere with your business.

680
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:41,556
Marvin doesn't.

681
00:43:44,276 --> 00:43:45,796
No, he doesn't.

682
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,636
This is one of the oldest wats
in Phnom Penh.

683
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:36,236
It sustained very
little damage under the K.R.

684
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:37,836
And obviously,
the murals on the inside...

685
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,316
which I showed you--that's
most of the work that I do.

686
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:43,876
Let's hope they don't install
an escalator...

687
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:45,436
Iike they did in Burma.

688
00:44:47,636 --> 00:44:52,196
-So what's next on your plate?
-Udong.

689
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:53,476
There's this huge
reclining Buddha...

690
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:55,996
that was blown to
smithereens during the war.

691
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:57,156
Sounds like a big project.

692
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,196
Yeah. We're
gonna be away for ages.

693
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:02,716
When do you leave?

694
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:05,916
The day after tomorrow.

695
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,756
How come?
Do you want to come visit us?

696
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:11,996
Do I have to work?

697
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:25,476
Good fortune on your journey.

698
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:28,356
This is an especially
lovely gesture, General.

699
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:31,476
Seemed appropriate
on this auspicious day.

700
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:33,156
I spoke to
the vice governor of Kep.

701
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:35,116
He'll meet you
at the disco at 9:00.

702
00:45:35,156 --> 00:45:36,356
There'll be
a blue moon tonight.

703
00:45:36,396 --> 00:45:38,676
The second full moon
of the month--always lucky.

704
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:40,836
That's wonderful.

705
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:42,116
If you have any trouble...

706
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,556
do not hesitate to call.

707
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:45,316
Everything's been taken care of.

708
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:04,596
Hey. How's everything,
my friend?

709
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:05,796
Good.

710
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,836
Again, I apologize
for the air conditioner.

711
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,356
You know, I'm sorry.

712
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:12,956
My guy was supposed to work
on it, but he was drunk.

713
00:46:14,956 --> 00:46:16,916
Come, have a drink with me.

714
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:19,196
Calvados.
The best.

715
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,316
Any luck with my passport?

716
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,916
No news, but smells good.

717
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:29,916
Hey!

718
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,396
Marvin came to see you earlier.

719
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,036
This should make things
straight with us.

720
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,956
Something's come up,
and I've left town.

721
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:57,116
This time, do not try to find me
under any circumstances.

722
00:46:57,156 --> 00:46:58,436
It isn't safe.

723
00:46:58,476 --> 00:47:00,076
Make a new start for yourself.

724
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:02,236
I'll be in touch. Good luck.

725
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,596
Robbie! You fucking idiot!

726
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:24,876
Robbie.

727
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,556
The vice governor called.

728
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:44,356
He's sorry that you must wait.

729
00:49:44,396 --> 00:49:45,876
There's some problem
on the roads.

730
00:49:45,956 --> 00:49:47,916
He wants you to feel welcome.

731
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:50,516
The beautiful ladies
will keep you companies.

732
00:49:52,996 --> 00:49:54,556
I could use a good massage.

733
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:56,916
I'm not talking
about the happy pull.

734
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:59,236
My back is really killing me.

735
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:01,836
-When does the karaoke start?
-After.

736
00:50:03,076 --> 00:50:04,716
Do you like whiskey?

737
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:06,436
Yeah, I love whiskey.

738
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:22,556
How do you think
you're gonna get customers...

739
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:25,796
to your casino
if the roads aren't safe?

740
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:27,076
I'm really getting fed up...

741
00:50:27,116 --> 00:50:28,676
with your negative attitude.

742
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:41,796
We've been here for 3 hours.

743
00:50:41,836 --> 00:50:43,716
This is outrageous.
Let's get going.

744
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:46,276
Relax, Kaspar.
You're on Cambodian time.

745
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:53,196
If you don't mind, I'd like
to go back to the hotel...

746
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:54,716
with my little friend here...

747
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:56,556
soak in the tub, and go to bed.

748
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,956
Yeah. That's a good idea.

749
00:50:57,996 --> 00:50:59,556
Sure. Go. Go ahead.

750
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:03,436
Take the car and make sure
you send the driver back.

751
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:32,476
Hey! Where you going?

752
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:33,636
Come back!

753
00:51:44,876 --> 00:51:46,276
Hello?

754
00:53:45,476 --> 00:53:46,556
You still haven't told me...

755
00:53:46,636 --> 00:53:48,076
what it is
you're doing here.

756
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:49,476
-Business.
-Business?

757
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:51,676
Well, do you
want to be more specific?

758
00:53:51,716 --> 00:53:53,156
I don't think
you'd be interested.

759
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,276
Fine.

760
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:55,556
Hey, when was this built?

761
00:53:55,596 --> 00:53:57,076
Oh, it's Pre-Angkor.

762
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:58,796
Before there was Buddhism...

763
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,996
there was Brahmanism
and Vishnuism.

764
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:04,196
You're not even
listening to me.

765
00:54:04,236 --> 00:54:05,676
Brahmanism and Vishnuism.

766
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,596
-ls she boring you?
-No.

767
00:54:07,636 --> 00:54:08,996
Robbie's really sick.

768
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:10,756
He's so wasted. He's wet.

769
00:54:10,796 --> 00:54:12,156
He's gonna get pneumonia...

770
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:14,556
or something...

771
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:16,356
Here. Give him this.

772
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:17,516
Make sure he doesn't
throw up on it.

773
00:54:17,556 --> 00:54:21,076
I can't promise you that
'cause he's off in space.

774
00:54:21,116 --> 00:54:22,436
Robbie, put this on.

775
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:32,636
-Snap out of it!
-You're not my fucking mom.

776
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:35,516
Fuck you, you dickhead!

777
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,636
Marvin?

778
00:55:20,036 --> 00:55:21,956
Hey, Robbie!

779
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,436
Where are you going?

780
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:49,916
Mr. Jimmy.

781
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:59,396
Hey. I was looking for you.
Where did you--

782
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:00,956
I just--I realized...

783
00:57:01,036 --> 00:57:03,276
I have to go back to town...

784
00:57:03,316 --> 00:57:05,156
because I have to do something
in the morning.

785
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:06,556
Oh, no. Can't it wait?

786
00:57:06,596 --> 00:57:07,796
No, no. It's my passport.

787
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:08,996
Remember, I told you
it was stolen.

788
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:10,116
Oh, right. Yeah.

789
00:57:10,156 --> 00:57:11,876
Well, how are you
gonna get back?

790
00:57:12,716 --> 00:57:14,116
-Well, take the moto.
-Are you sure?

791
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:15,796
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

792
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,036
Hey, Jimmy. Are you OK?

793
00:57:19,156 --> 00:57:21,836
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

794
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,276
It's great.

795
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,716
Have you seen Robbie?

796
00:57:40,516 --> 00:57:42,436
It's my fault.

797
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:44,996
No. It wasn't your fault.

798
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:46,596
No way.

799
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:48,116
You can't blame yourself.

800
00:57:48,196 --> 00:57:49,956
Everyone knows what he was like.

801
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:51,876
How are we gonna get him down?

802
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:54,436
We roll him.

803
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:29,076
Jimmy.

804
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:31,356
You don't know
what a relief it's...

805
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:33,636
What's this?

806
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:36,436
You don't know this guy?

807
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:40,196
I do not.

808
00:58:43,116 --> 00:58:45,156
Why don't you
have a closer look?

809
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:48,316
I've never seen him in my life.

810
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:50,716
-Hey!
-Stay out of this!

811
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:53,676
You're a fucking liar!

812
00:58:54,516 --> 00:58:56,876
I should cut you right now.

813
00:58:56,976 --> 00:58:58,536
You're making a mistake, Jimmy.

814
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:00,896
Marvin's in trouble.

815
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:03,736
If there's going to be
any blood spilled in my bar...

816
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:05,296
I'll do it!

817
00:59:05,336 --> 00:59:07,016
Don't test me.

818
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:12,296
Put it away, Jimmy.

819
00:59:16,976 --> 00:59:19,096
What do you mean,
Marvin's in trouble?

820
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:21,216
Let me up, and I'll tell you.

821
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:29,976
You nuts?!

822
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:37,056
Shit!

823
00:59:38,856 --> 00:59:40,576
Marvin's disappeared.

824
00:59:41,256 --> 00:59:43,176
What do you mean, disappeared?

825
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:44,656
His bodyguard
and business associate...

826
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:47,136
were murdered in Kep.

827
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:48,896
You know, where
the casino is, Golf Town--

828
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:50,536
400 clicks from here.

829
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:52,496
And what about Marvin?

830
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:53,736
He's been abducted.

831
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:55,176
What do you mean,
he's been abducted?

832
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,696
What makes you so sure?

833
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:00,016
'Cause I was there.

834
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:02,936
I was lucky to get out alive.

835
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:05,136
Yeah, right.
You know what I think?

836
01:00:05,176 --> 01:00:07,496
I think the whole thing stinks.

837
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:09,296
Look, come on.

838
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:11,096
You sent that guy for me
last night...

839
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:12,816
tried to have me killed...

840
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:13,976
and now you're feeding me...

841
01:00:14,016 --> 01:00:15,096
some bullshit story...

842
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:16,576
about how Marvin's disappeared.

843
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:17,736
He's been abducted.

844
01:00:17,776 --> 01:00:19,336
What are you talking about?

845
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:22,016
You know Marvin and l
would do nothing to harm you.

846
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:23,736
You're like a son to him.

847
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:26,136
He asked me to look after you.

848
01:00:26,176 --> 01:00:27,576
What's the matter with you?

849
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:30,376
How could you even think
such a thing of me?
