0
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,492
- Did you see his eyes?
- Ohh!

1
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,709
Look at him. Ohh!

2
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,784
Fuck off!

3
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,724
I appreciate
you guys coming down.

4
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:51,024
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is--

5
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,964
Settle down.

6
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,608
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminar.

7
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,976
Settle down.

8
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,541
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

9
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:11,744
That you, Jimmy?

10
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,016
At least in study hall
I can meditate.

11
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,082
He means masturbate.

12
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:22,421
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

13
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:50,590
It wasn't me, man!

14
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,649
I'm innocent!

15
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:58,631
We've all heard the terms
"date rape", "sexual harassment."

16
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,367
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

17
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,935
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

18
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:12,035
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

19
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:16,743
are here to give us what we hope will be
a fresh perspective on the subject...

20
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,344
and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

21
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,685
Let's give them a warm welcome.

22
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,161
- Thank you, Mr. Lombardo.
- I'm outta here.

23
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,858
- Let's begin with a question--
- This prick can kiss my ass.

24
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,767
As I was saying...

25
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:45,778
why don't we begin
with a question.

26
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,871
What is a sex crime?

27
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,883
Not gettin' any.

28
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:56,885
Blue Bay, fight, fight!

29
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,119
Buccaneers, win tonight!

30
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:17,535
Steady.

31
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,517
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

32
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,085
That's good.

33
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:38,163
Drop the main.

34
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:41,030
All right, guys, let's de-rig.
I'll see you all Monday.

35
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,231
Buccaneers are number one,
and don't you forget it!

36
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,216
Good work, guys.
See you Monday.

37
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,445
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

38
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,511
The Buccaneers are number one...

39
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,784
and don't you forget it!

40
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:14,461
All right! I could definitely
party on one of those.

41
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,572
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

42
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,633
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

43
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,406
That's a real boat.

44
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:33,419
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

45
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:36,422
No way my old man was
gonna spring for the fees.

46
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,586
Hey, you're working for it, and
you're learning your way around a boat.

47
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,925
I put myself through college
working on boats.

48
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:45,124
- Beats flippin' burgers.
- Yeah.

49
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,699
Can I play too,
or is it just for boys?

50
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,975
So, who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

51
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,213
The senior car wash,
remember?

52
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,182
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

53
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,812
Not at all.
Nicole and I will do it as a team.

54
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:11,221
I tell you what.
I'm going out to the Glades Saturday.

55
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:14,557
Come over Sunday
and you can wash all the mud off.

56
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,562
Deal.

57
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,293
I was counting on my mom for a ride,
but she's not here.

58
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,959
Surprise, surprise.

59
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,664
I was wondering
if you could give me one.

60
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:29,834
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

61
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,310
I mean,
something bad might happen.

62
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,682
Jimbo, you need a lift?

63
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,684
Yeah, but I got my bike.

64
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,310
Hey, no problem.

65
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,758
Okay, try it.

66
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:01,067
Suzie, you need a lift?

67
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,838
- We got room for one more.
- Jesus.

68
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,539
Where'd she get those shoes,
Whores For Less?

69
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,417
Try it again.

70
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,024
Nice to see you kids
gettin' along.

71
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,797
Whoa.

72
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,262
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

73
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,775
Is that Sam Lombardo?

74
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,105
Hi, Mom.

75
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:13,237
Sam. Hi.

76
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,805
Hi, Sandra.

77
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:21,318
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

78
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,980
Sorry. I gotta run.

79
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,197
Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

80
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,766
Hi, girls.

81
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:47,636
Look. He forgot.
I knew it.

82
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,176
No, I didn't.
Check out my Jeep.

83
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:52,212
Nice and dirty for you.

84
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,612
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

85
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,618
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

86
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,353
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

87
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:05,688
Sam, I'm leaving.

88
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,624
Where's your hose, Mr. Lombardo?

89
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,722
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

90
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,265
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

91
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,276
It's for a good cause,
Barbara.

92
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,240
Sam the philanthropist.

93
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:32,115
You know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

94
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,778
Okay.

95
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,224
Have fun at the club.

96
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,652
Wow.

97
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,989
Looks brand-new.

98
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,661
Aren't you forgetting something?

99
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,221
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

100
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:55,530
Oh, yeah, that thing.
Can't we just--

101
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,763
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

102
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,130
Okay, let me look for it.

103
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,336
Mr. Lombardo?
We're running kind of late.

104
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:08,848
Nicole could go on to the Mansons.
I'll wait till you've found the ticket.

105
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,345
Just give me a minute.
Okay?

106
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,060
- Go.
- Are you sure?

107
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,561
Mm-hmm.

108
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:37,963
Oh, Frankie! Oh, God!

109
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,596
Oh, God!

110
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,077
Goddamn it!

111
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,748
<i>This is Blue Bay High School.</i>

112
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,250
<i>Your son or daughter</i>
<i>was absent today, Monday--</i>

113
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,082
Jesus H. Christ!

114
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:57,252
- What? Huh?
- Oh, nothing.

115
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,417
Come on.

116
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,724
- Art, this is a hell of a fish.
- It's a barracuda.

117
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,428
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty at the yacht club...

118
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:11,903
you'd have caught one
for yourself.

119
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:14,497
You're not gonna eat this thing.

120
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,008
Why not?

121
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,442
It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

122
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:22,243
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

123
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:24,511
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

124
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,194
- Sandra, what's up?
<i>- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.</i>

125
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,920
Have you heard anything?

126
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:39,590
Not a word.

127
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:43,134
Never mind.

128
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:45,364
I found her.

129
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,170
Pull!

130
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,369
Listen, Sam...

131
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,278
it was really good seeing you
the other day.

132
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,816
Sandra, I'm real busy
right now, so--

133
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,521
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

134
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,825
<i>- Yeah, well--</i>
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

135
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,485
<i>So what?</i>

136
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,326
So, maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

137
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:15,424
<i>Oh, poor Sam.</i>

138
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,903
You really think you're gonna get one
of these Blue Bay women to marry you?

139
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,408
- Are you finished, Sandra?
<i>- Grab a clue, honey.</i>

140
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,775
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

141
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:28,178
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

142
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:30,239
Good-bye, Sandra.

143
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,650
Pull!

144
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,516
You seem to find guns
therapeutic.

145
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,561
Maybe I oughta try it.

146
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,265
So, let me guess.

147
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,268
Some boy didn't call
and screwed up your whole weekend.

148
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,533
So you're taking the day off.
Right?

149
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,440
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

150
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,446
Whichever one I want.

151
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,442
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

152
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,917
What is it?

153
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,418
I miss Dad.

154
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,755
Jesus.

155
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,231
I miss him too, sometimes.

156
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,702
No, you don't.

157
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:27,569
He didn't have to
kill himself, Kelly.

158
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,987
I don't know
why he did it.

159
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,759
I really don't.

160
00:19:56,837 --> 00:20:01,501
Can I get you anything?
Do you want a Valium?

161
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,613
I was raped.

162
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,511
What, honey?
I couldn't hear you.

163
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,712
I said, I was raped.

164
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,220
What?

165
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,626
I was raped...

166
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:24,656
by Sam Lombardo.

167
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,532
Sam Lombardo?

168
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,369
<i>My daughter...</i>

169
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,599
does not get raped
in Blue Bay!

170
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,437
You're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

171
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,946
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

172
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:44,042
We understand your feelings,
Mrs. Van Ryan...

173
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,211
but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

174
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,551
We'd like to take
her statement alone.

175
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,321
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

176
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:57,829
Okay.

177
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:11,535
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

178
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,545
I just wanna
get it over with.

179
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:17,409
We'd like to videotape
this statement.

180
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,976
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

181
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:25,684
and we need to know everything that
happened between you and Mr. Lombardo.

182
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,693
Are you ready?

183
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,435
He started rubbing my shoulders.

184
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:44,668
<i>I let him.</i>

185
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:46,678
<i>I mean, he's a nice guy.</i>

186
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,206
<i>The next thing...</i>

187
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,946
<i>his hand was in my shorts.</i>

188
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:58,049
<i>You know, from behind.</i>

189
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:03,220
<i>His fingers...</i>

190
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,367
<i>Take your time.</i>

191
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:14,066
<i>They were in me.</i>

192
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,108
<i>Both places, you know?</i>

193
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:20,708
<i>Did he put himself inside you?</i>

194
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,114
<i>Yes.</i>

195
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,211
<i>I said, "Stop."</i>
<i>I screamed.</i>

196
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:29,221
<i>I mean, that's how</i>
<i>it sounded in my head.</i>

197
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,891
<i>He hurt me.</i>

198
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,561
<i>Did you fight him?</i>

199
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:41,056
<i>He had my wrists</i>
<i>pinned behind me.</i>

200
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:42,658
<i>Then what?</i>

201
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,001
<i>He kept saying,</i>
<i>"Let it happen.</i>

202
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:48,006
<i>Let it happen."</i>

203
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,310
<i>And then he just stopped.</i>

204
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,813
<i>You mean, he withdrew?</i>

205
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:58,180
<i>I don't know. It's really hard</i>
<i>to remember, exactly.</i>

206
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,580
<i>Try, Kelly.</i>

207
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,986
<i>I know one thing he said.</i>

208
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:13,156
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Don't worry. I didn't come."</i>

209
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,167
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

210
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,806
<i>He said, "No little girl</i>
<i>can ever make me come."</i>

211
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:28,644
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

212
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:31,650
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

213
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,312
What?

214
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,824
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

215
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,992
You want my gut?
I think she's acting.

216
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:47,522
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he could come on to her.

217
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,898
She's upset 'cause he didn't.

218
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,370
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

219
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:55,374
The guy should've never had her
out there in the first place.

220
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,900
The line I have on this guy,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

221
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,277
That doesn't make him a rapist.

222
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:03,282
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

223
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,944
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

224
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,452
This is Blue Bay.

225
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,355
Ask a Van Ryan to take a polygraph
and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

226
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:15,189
You afraid of Tom Baxter?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

227
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,661
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

228
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:22,330
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

229
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:27,066
- You know what that means for Lombardo.
- And you heard Kelly's statement.

230
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,598
The guy's dirty.
Bring me a case.

231
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,793
All right.
Good work, Jimbo.

232
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,799
- I'll see you Monday.
- All right.

233
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,876
He's what's left
of my sailing class.

234
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:42,948
Talk to me, Artie.

235
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,985
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

236
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,518
Jimmy told me.

237
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,956
Apparently I'm the last one
to know about it.

238
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:54,459
Sam, l--

239
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,320
Sandra Van Ryan
has been on the horn all day...

240
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:00,332
with every member
of the school board.

241
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,265
She's pushing for suspension.

242
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:06,271
And the board's just gonna roll over for
Sandra Van Ryan without hearing my side?

243
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,432
This is insane.

244
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,203
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

245
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,937
You gotta believe that.

246
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:14,275
All I can tell you is
hang in there.

247
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,440
They clear you,
you get reinstated--

248
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:19,280
You never get clear
of something like this.

249
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,379
It stays with you.

250
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:26,016
It follows you around forever.

251
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,994
You're gonna need some help.

252
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,088
You're gonna need an attorney.

253
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:35,601
And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

254
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:38,831
is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

255
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,351
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

256
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,689
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yeah.

257
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:03,592
Sam Lombardo.

258
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,858
Okay, then.

259
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,560
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

260
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,694
Will you show him in, please?

261
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:15,672
What brings you
to this part of town?

262
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:18,706
Well, I was,
until yesterday...

263
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:21,713
a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

264
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,840
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

265
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:28,786
Male or female?

266
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:31,685
The student is Kelly Van Ryan.

267
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:33,589
As in Sandra Van Ryan?

268
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,628
As in I'm fucked.

269
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:39,860
Tell me about it.

270
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,096
Where do I begin?

271
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,101
Start with...

272
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:48,271
your relationship
with the girl, Kelly.

273
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,276
She's a student.
I was her guidance counselor.

274
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:53,744
Beyond that,
there was no relationship.

275
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:56,372
Then don't worry.

276
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,644
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

277
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,418
I don't have to wear it
all the time.

278
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:12,330
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

279
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,394
All right,
let me tell you how I charge.

280
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:27,572
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

281
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:30,411
I'm afraid I can't
park your car today.

282
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:34,078
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

283
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,522
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

284
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,529
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

285
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:47,925
You're finished here,
Lombardo.

286
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,593
Take a hike.

287
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,800
Barbara, let's go.

288
00:28:58,011 --> 00:28:59,342
Talk to me.

289
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:04,446
Maybe you didn't hear me,
Lombardo.

290
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,644
You're finished in Blue Bay.

291
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:12,419
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

292
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,888
Get the fuck outta here.

293
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,395
Mr. Lombardo, please.

294
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,669
That's all right, George.

295
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,522
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

296
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:54,361
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

297
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,954
Are you all right?
Huh?

298
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:30,587
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

299
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:32,153
That's too bad, motherfucker.

300
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,303
Sam?

301
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:53,951
Lombardo?

302
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:16,700
Whoa, man!

303
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:18,209
It's me.

304
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,346
Sorry, man. Things have been
gettin' weird around here.

305
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,350
I can see that.

306
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,787
Come on in.

307
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:35,527
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy who did this to you?

308
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,354
It was him, all right.

309
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,991
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

310
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:44,559
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

311
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:46,832
Forget it.

312
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,931
The lady has deep pockets.

313
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,169
I know how deep
her pockets are.

314
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:55,874
I thought I might be able to
save my house. Some sort of equity loan.

315
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:58,109
Guess who's on the bank's
board of directors?

316
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,984
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

317
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:06,218
You think making some sort
of statement is gonna stop her?

318
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:09,352
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

319
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,160
A year ago...

320
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:15,098
when her old man
blew his brains out...

321
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,397
Kelly lost it, ran away.

322
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,600
They found her in some fleabag motel
coked out of her gourd.

323
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:24,469
Meanwhile...

324
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,980
you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

325
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,309
or some crap.

326
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,146
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

327
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,277
they're gonna look stupid.

328
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:35,843
They know it.

329
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,447
Why haven't they taken
your statement yet?

330
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,259
'Cause they're busy
looking for dirt...

331
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:43,158
they're not gonna find.

332
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,493
Right?

333
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,431
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

334
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:31,276
He's just showing off
for you now.

335
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:35,813
Hey there, Ruby.

336
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,213
I see you still got Walter.

337
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,980
I was hopin' something
had eaten him by now.

338
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:44,613
Can I help you?

339
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,955
Suzie called us.
Where would we find her?

340
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,696
You know the way.

341
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,231
You won't shoot her, will ya?

342
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,840
I don't believe she's armed.

343
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,278
Yeah?

344
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:49,921
It took you guys long enough.

345
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,423
What if someone
was trying to strangle me...

346
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,755
or fuck me in the ass, even?

347
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,963
You guys do sex crimes,
right?

348
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,799
My partner
Detective Perez.

349
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,074
It's Celine.
He's okay.

350
00:36:10,142 --> 00:36:13,441
He had a pretty good line
on what cheap fucks people are.

351
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,377
You called us.
Remember?

352
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,913
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

353
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:32,827
- Will they?
- I don't know.

354
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,230
That bothers you?

355
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:40,605
I want to go outside.

356
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,877
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

357
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,077
About a year ago.

358
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:56,417
When you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

359
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,854
No.

360
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,016
- So you were alone.
- Yeah.

361
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,027
Did he come in with you?

362
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,528
I guess.

363
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,828
You guess.
Well, did he or didn't he?

364
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,892
Okay.
Yeah, he did.

365
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,906
And then what? Did he touch you?
Did you, maybe, flirt with him?

366
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:20,869
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.
Just tell us the truth.

367
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,779
I didn't say a thing to him.

368
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,553
He put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

369
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,886
I could be really pretty,
he said.

370
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,323
Did you ask him to stop?

371
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:35,985
Shit.

372
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,498
What difference does it make?
No one's gonna believe me anyway.

373
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:43,660
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

374
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:46,136
He pushed me to the floor
and did it.

375
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,169
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

376
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:52,835
Almost.

377
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,808
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

378
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,510
No.
He stopped by himself.

379
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,255
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

380
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,017
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy.

381
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,129
He stopped.

382
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:14,826
And that was it?
He just left?

383
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,492
Yeah.

384
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:20,568
He did say one thing first.

385
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,266
What was that?

386
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:26,805
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

387
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,541
Open the gate.

388
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:40,391
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

389
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:46,931
It's really
a bad news-good news situation.

390
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,293
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

391
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,305
instead of a public defender.

392
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,341
I'm telling you, Ken,
I'm innocent.

393
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,645
You are preachin'
to the choir.

394
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,305
You're not alone.

395
00:39:09,355 --> 00:39:11,915
So you're the new
chicken licker.

396
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,934
Sandra, can we get
your comment?

397
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:25,232
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

398
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:27,738
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

399
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,769
Will you tell us anything?

400
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,777
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very.

401
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:36,679
<i>The Lombardo rape case has galvanized</i>
<i>the upscale town of Blue Bay...</i>

402
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,841
with its tabloid appeal.

403
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,976
Just arriving,
Sandra Van Ryan...

404
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:44,682
jet set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

405
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,691
And the girl from the wrong side
of the tracks.

406
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,820
In the end, the jury must choose between
the words of these 18-year-old girls...

407
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,488
and that of Sam Lombardo.

408
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,498
Reporting live
from the courthouse steps...

409
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,126
I'm Nancy Duerr,

410

<i>The State of Florida</i>
<i>vs. Sam Lombardo.</i>

411
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:43,409
The Honorable Sylvia B. Wexman
presiding. All rise.

412
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,416
We gotta stand up.

413
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:50,822
Please be seated.

414
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,481
Now sit down.

415
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,439
Would you like more time,
Kelly?

416
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:17,174
I know that this is hard,
Kelly...

417
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,351
but I have one more question.

418
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:22,546
Even though it's something
we've been over...

419
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:26,681
I want us all
to be very clear about it.

420
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,284
When you saw...

421
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,295
that Mr. Lombardo...

422
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:35,265
intended to have sex with you...

423
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,393
what were your exact words?

424
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,403
What did you say?

425
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:43,007
I told him "No."

426
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,304
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

427
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:53,111
I screamed for him to stop.

428
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:55,380
You screamed for him...

429
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:57,688
to stop.

430
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:00,219
And did he?

431
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,056
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

432
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:17,267
Thank you.

433
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,517
It's day two
of the Lombardo rape case...

434
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,520
and the second alleged young victim
of the former guidance counselor...

435
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,146
<i>has taken the stand.</i>

436

Eyewitness News.

441
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:07,456
Good morning, everybody.

442
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,127
Miss Toller.

443
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:14,726
When you were...

444
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,668
picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

445
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:21,467
and you were allowed
to make one call...

446
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,973
you called Mr. Lombardo.

447
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,975
Isn't that correct?

448
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:27,742
Miss Toller?

449
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,372
Yes.

450
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:33,543
When you were expelled from Blue Bay
for destruction of school property--

451
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,884
I broke a fucking window.
It wasn't even my fault.

452
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:41,650
Miss Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

453
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:44,821
and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

454
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:53,001
Mr. Lombardo appeared with you
in lieu of a parent conference.

455
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:54,766
Is that right?

456
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,102
Yes.

457
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,702
It seems to me...

458
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:03,043
that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

459
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:04,707
He was.

460
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:08,552
But all that changed when...

461
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:12,256
according to your testimony...

462
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:15,856
Mr. Lombardo...

463
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,190
raped you...

464
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:22,930
on April 23 of last year,
right?

465
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:25,860
- Yes.
- But then in May...

466
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:30,034
when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

467
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,702
and again allowed a phone call...

468
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,805
you called Mr. Lombardo.

469
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:42,045
So what?

470
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,553
" So what?"

471
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,988
Oops, Suzie.

472
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,729
So, one month after you say
this man raped you...

473
00:44:57,803 --> 00:44:59,737
you go to him for help?

474
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:05,072
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a pretty good friend.

475
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:07,805
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

476
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:10,313
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

477
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:12,009
It was summer,
he was gone...

478
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,111
and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

479
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:19,349
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

480
00:45:19,424 --> 00:45:21,187
that Sam was gone?

481
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,353
That he wasn't there?
Hmm?

482
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:29,533
Is that the reason you're saying these
things about Mr. Lombardo, your friend?

483
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,466
I said them
because they happened.

484
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:33,970
Are you gonna sit there,
under oath...

485
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,439
and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

486
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:37,770
I said he did.

487
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:41,638
Let me ask you a question.

488
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:45,274
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

489
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,615
'Cause I can promise you
if you are lying about Sam Lombardo...

490
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,621
and I believe you are...

491
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:53,055
you'll be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

492
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,126
Which is why I'll ask again...

493
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:58,458
under oath...

494
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,963
Suzie...

495
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,494
did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

496
00:46:08,206 --> 00:46:11,664
Miss Toller, you will
have to answer the question.

497
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:17,742
- Miss Toller.
- Goddamn it!

498
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,579
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

499
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,420
Miss Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

500
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,983
Court would like to hear
what Miss Toller has to say.

501
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:31,324
Miss Toller?

502
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:37,433
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

503
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,604
He didn't rape Kelly either.

504
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,934
He didn't do anything.

505
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,841
This is ridiculous. The witness has been
directly threatened by defense counsel!

506
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:49,506
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Miss Toller's story.

507
00:46:51,316 --> 00:46:53,443
Miss Toller.

508
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,181
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

509
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,083
He was my friend, at first.

510
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,356
Then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

511
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,920
and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

512
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:09,933
It's like you're his favorite,
then "Who cares?"

513
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:11,593
Make her stop.

514
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,764
When Kelly said we should do this,
I thought, "Cool."

515
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:19,206
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop Duquette.

516
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,869
Now they're screwed.

517
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:24,143
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I have to object.

518
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,151
Your Honor, please,
may I be heard?

519
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,985
Mr. Baxter,
you are not trying this case.

520
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,455
Sit down.

521
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:40,161
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

522
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,226
She's in love with him.

523
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:46,236
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

524
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:49,296
Then she found out Mr. Lombardo
was doing her mom, and that was it.

525
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:50,773
What? Kelly!

526
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:53,106
You skanky bitch!

527
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:59,516
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

528
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,490
Just get the hell
away from me.

529
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,120
Jesus, man! Let loose!

530
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,492
I'm just thinking about
where I'm gonna stay.

531
00:48:16,568 --> 00:48:19,036
I lost my house.

532
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,038
Wakin' up from
a goddamn nightmare.

533
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,767
You'll get over it.

534
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:26,106
We have got a knock-down,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

535
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:27,509
against Sandra Van Ryan.

536
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:30,681
Just like that?

537
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:34,819
These people
ruined your life, bro.

538
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:36,877
I told you
they'd go too far.

539
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,480
They went overboard!
They did!

540
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:41,492
They'll settle.
Believe me.

541
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,494
They'll be begging to settle.

542
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:48,130
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Wait up! Come on, girl.

543
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,499
<i>In a startling turn of events,</i>
<i>Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...</i>

544
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:55,233
<i>following a reversal of testimony</i>
<i>by one of his alleged victims.</i>

545
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,332
Excuse me. Over here.

546
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,343
Excuse me.
Can anybody read?

547
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:02,346
Hey! Sandra!

548
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,342
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

549
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:09,353
That might've been
a possibility...

550
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,981
if Miss Not-So Bright
hadn't started throwing things.

551
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:13,649
Fuck off.

552
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:18,025
I cannot believe you're gonna
let them get away with this shit...

553
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:21,031
all on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

554
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:24,091
I don't think
you get it, Sandy.

555
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,103
Your princess here
committed perjury.

556
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:30,039
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fuckin' little ass out of jail.

557
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,843
What are we going to do?

558
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:42,519
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

559
00:49:57,135 --> 00:49:58,727
Ken.

560
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,147
Sorry I'm late.

561
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,810
Hold my calls, Lenore.

562
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,047
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

563
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:41,478
Thank you, Sandra.

564
00:50:47,118 --> 00:50:49,177
I'll be seeing you.

565
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,484
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

566
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,826
Nice to see you, Tom.

567
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:01,832
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

568
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,204
See you at the club.

569
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,675
See you at the club.

570
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,383
See you at the club, Tommy!

571
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,477
Hey, Tom.
What'd you shoot today, pal?

572
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,488
Hey, my man!

573
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:28,625
This is for you.

574
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:32,489
- You did good, Ken.
- Thanks.

575
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:37,497
I know there's a part of you
that wishes none of this had happened...

576
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,505
but it did, so take the money
and enjoy yourself.

577
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:44,701
All right?
Find a happy place.

578
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,711
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

579
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:50,339
- Good-bye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

580
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:11,201
Take care of my lizards, huh?

581
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,644
Hello, Kelly.

582
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:22,907
Drop dead.

583
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:27,179
You know how my mom's paying you off?
She's breaking my trust.

584
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:31,746
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

585
00:52:31,823 --> 00:52:33,222
I'm sorry, Kelly.

586
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:36,454
Why don't you start fucking her again!
You can spend it together!

587
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,224
I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

588
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:41,697
I fucking hate you!

589
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:57,748
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

590
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,554
Goddamn maid.

591
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,221
So you got my mom's money.

592
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,488
How much?

593
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:20,929
How much?

594
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,098
You know how much.

595
00:54:24,169 --> 00:54:26,103
Your turn to pay.

596
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:30,401
It worked!

597
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,409
We screwed the bitch!

598
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:35,945
It worked
just like you said.

599
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:38,944
What's wrong?

600
00:54:39,017 --> 00:54:41,315
You scared the shit out of me.

601
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:43,820
Your coming here.
That's what's wrong.

602
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:45,822
Are you fuckin' crazy?

603
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,754
Yeah, I'm crazy.

604
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,260
Ask my mom.

605
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:57,263
So, how much is eight-and-a-half
million divided by three?

606
00:54:58,403 --> 00:55:00,496
Oh, great.

607
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:02,767
Everyone thinks
this is really funny.

608
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,639
Do you think
this is fuckin' over?

609
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,771
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fuckin' way from over.

610
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,783
I'm serious.

611
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:19,312
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

612
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,652
After tonight?

613
00:55:24,729 --> 00:55:28,460
Yeah, well,
we're here, aren't we?

614
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:34,397
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

615
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:37,207
if we're in agreement...

616
00:55:38,142 --> 00:55:40,076
that from here on out...

617
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,914
you do exactly as I say.

618
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:30,719
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

619
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:45,942
Now I want you two to kiss.

620
00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:49,605
Come on now.

621
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,616
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

622
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:13,095
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

623
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:15,598
You're right.

624
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,464
They did make us look stupid.

625
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,629
What you're wrong about is why.

626
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,764
Hear me out.

627
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,173
Lombardo was havin' an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan.

628
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:27,871
Why not tell us about it?

629
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:31,142
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

630
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:34,378
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

631
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:37,888
I thought about that, then said:
You're Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

632
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:40,981
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless--

633
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,788
Unless what?

634
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:48,194
Unless you're setting
Sandra Van Ryan up for the big payday.

635
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:51,724
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

636
00:58:51,803 --> 00:58:55,762
tryin' to keep up with a pricey
piece of trim like Barbara Baxter.

637
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,536
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

638
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:02,545
The kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

639
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:04,740
I'm tellin' you, this guy...

640
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:07,148
wanted to marry money.

641
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:09,816
<i>When that didn't happen...</i>

642
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:13,721
<i>he went to work on these two girls,</i>
<i>using them to set up Sandra Van Ryan.</i>

643
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,385
<i>I'm fellin' you,</i>
<i>they chumped us, partner.</i>

644
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,895
<i>They chumped us</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

645
00:59:38,216 --> 00:59:41,811
<i>I had my chance</i>
<i>and I let it go</i>

646
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,821
<i>I had my chance</i>
<i>and I let it go</i>

647
00:59:47,892 --> 00:59:52,659
<i>Well, if I ever have myself</i>
<i>another chance like that</i>

648
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,826
<i>I'm gonna grab it</i>
<i>and I won't look back</i>

649
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:15,685
Nice stroke.

650
01:00:17,288 --> 01:00:20,587
- Is there some reason why you're here?
- Curiosity, I guess.

651
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,923
About what?
How to improve your breast stroke?

652
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:30,090
I was curious about how you see things
workin' out for you and Sam and Suzie.

653
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,269
Excuse me?

654
01:00:33,337 --> 01:00:37,239
You three are gonna go to the Caribbean
together and live happily ever after?

655
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:40,744
The thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

656
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:42,244
You're out of your mind.

657
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:45,612
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

658
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,617
Especially when
two of 'em are in love.

659
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,316
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

660
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,220
Am I right?

661
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:59,525
Sam sell you on the idea right up front
of whackin' Suzie?

662
01:01:01,332 --> 01:01:03,197
That's murder, kid.

663
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:05,929
Police.
God, get a life.

664
01:01:07,772 --> 01:01:09,205
You're good.

665
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:14,936
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

666
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:37,966
Hello.

667
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:41,905
You better watch it
with that shit.

668
01:01:41,973 --> 01:01:44,806
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

669
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,139
Yeah, or wind up dead.

670
01:01:54,518 --> 01:01:55,951
You know...

671
01:01:57,288 --> 01:02:01,520
I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

672
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,526
What was his name?

673
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:10,355
Help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

674
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:14,938
- Davy.
- Yeah.

675
01:02:15,006 --> 01:02:17,566
That's right. Davy.

676
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:20,076
I was really sorry about
the way that worked out.

677
01:02:20,144 --> 01:02:23,170
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that?

678
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:25,738
I don't have to listen to this,
and you can't shove me around.

679
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:26,783
I have friends now.

680
01:02:28,419 --> 01:02:31,320
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

681
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:34,290
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

682
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,923
Take a look at this.

683
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:44,729
Go ahead.
It's not gonna bite you.

684
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,099
Take it!

685
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:52,638
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

686
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:58,306
He transferred the funds to
an offshore account. A numbered account.

687
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:01,545
Cops don't even know whose name's on it.
Think one of them's yours?

688
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:06,488
He put a down payment on island property
and a lease-to-buy on a sailboat.

689
01:03:06,557 --> 01:03:08,491
You're into sailing, aren't you?

690
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,824
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

691
01:03:11,896 --> 01:03:15,093
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's goin' on.

692
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:19,298
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

693
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,531
Come on, now.

694
01:03:21,605 --> 01:03:25,166
You don't think Kelly and Sam are gonna
share that money with you, do you?

695
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,444
Leave me alone.

696
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:42,322
You know, I'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...

697
01:03:43,227 --> 01:03:47,254
so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

698
01:03:48,532 --> 01:03:50,864
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

699
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:53,733
like Davy.

700
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:07,445
Shit.

701
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:17,859
<i>You've reached Sam Lombardo.</i>
<i>Wait for the beep and leave a message.</i>

702
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:36,338
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

703
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,848
I'm scared
there's no one to trust.

704
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,713
You can trust me.

705
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,889
Hello?

706
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,985
<i>Kelly, is Suzie there?</i>

707
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:54,758
- Yeah.
<i>- I was afraid of that.</i>

708
01:04:54,832 --> 01:04:57,062
She left this insane message.

709
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,534
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

710
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:02,037
and this fucking cop, Duquette,
she's gonna blow it.

711
01:05:03,174 --> 01:05:05,108
<i>Calm the bitch down.</i>

712
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:07,838
Why can't you come? Please?

713
01:05:08,913 --> 01:05:12,440
Sam, I miss you so much.

714
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,949
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.

715
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:21,116
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

716
01:05:22,193 --> 01:05:24,184
<i>If she can't get</i>
<i>a fuckin' grip--</i>

717
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:26,855
- Then what?
<i>- You know what.</i>

718
01:05:27,932 --> 01:05:29,695
<i>I'll handle it.</i>

719
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:33,225
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.

720
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:36,631
- Okay.
<i>- Good.</i>

721
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:39,699
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know?

722
01:05:40,845 --> 01:05:44,372
<i>Now put Suzie on the line.</i>
<i>I want you both to hear this.</i>

723
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:51,484
<i>Now, look.</i>

724
01:05:51,555 --> 01:05:54,388
<i>We gotta stay calm,</i>
<i>all of us.</i>

725
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,757
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...

726
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,286
so I'm out there spendin' money,
doin' what rich guys do.

727
01:06:01,365 --> 01:06:05,529
<i>This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try</i>
<i>and fuck with you. Don't let him.</i>

728
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:09,733
- That's easy for you to say.
<i>- Suzie, don't fall apart.</i>

729
01:06:09,807 --> 01:06:12,674
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

730
01:06:20,251 --> 01:06:23,743
You-- You are gonna
fuck me over, aren't you?

731
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:25,948
Oh, for chrissake.

732
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,786
You are!

733
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:32,158
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffin' fumes out in the swamp?

734
01:06:32,229 --> 01:06:35,198
That's what I am to you--
swamp trash...

735
01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:37,791
just like my mom.

736
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:38,835
Don't!

737
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:45,775
You stupid cunt!

738
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:20,239
You are scared, aren't you?

739
01:07:58,482 --> 01:08:00,780
Jesus Christ!

740
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:03,183
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?

741
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:06,552
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

742
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,058
The conversation on that tape
is unintelligible.

743
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,686
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

744
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:14,856
- shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.

745
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:17,924
A month ago these two were
throwing things at each other in court.

746
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:20,835
They were acting!
They were all acting!

747
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:22,872
We bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

748
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,875
Now they're gettin' away with
$8 million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.

749
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:29,276
Which she might have saved if she hadn't
set out to destroy the man's life.

750
01:08:29,346 --> 01:08:32,110
You wouldn't go after a guy
that you thought raped your daughter?

751
01:08:32,182 --> 01:08:34,616
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

752
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:38,644
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

753
01:08:38,722 --> 01:08:42,317
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep muckin' around like this...

754
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:44,987
and she's gonna be suing us
for invasion of privacy.

755
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:47,758
So get out of
these people's lives!

756
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:52,468
- Am I gettin' through?
- You think this is just about money?

757
01:08:52,536 --> 01:08:54,766
About us lookin' stupid?
Question him.

758
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:59,503
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

759
01:08:59,576 --> 01:09:01,635
Give this idiot
somethin' to do.

760
01:09:01,712 --> 01:09:04,476
- Let him look into the Kennedy murder.
- I understand.

761
01:09:04,548 --> 01:09:07,176
Next time this
fucking piece of shit...

762
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:09,276
drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.

763
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,913
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue you last time.

764
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:14,253
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?

765
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,258
- Yes.
- Thank you.

766
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:21,698
- Cocksucker.
- What was that?

767
01:09:21,765 --> 01:09:25,496
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- You wanna say that to my face?

768
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:31,199
What are you lookin' at?

769
01:10:14,852 --> 01:10:17,946
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.

770
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:27,095
Have you ever seen something coming,
and didn't do what you could to stop it?

771
01:10:28,832 --> 01:10:30,265
We all have.

772
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:33,792
I mean somethin' bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

773
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:38,103
and you didn't do anything and--

774
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:44,080
I did that once.

775
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,850
I don't wanna do it again.

776
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:09,201
I thought we were
goin' to a movie.

777
01:11:11,508 --> 01:11:13,999
I think we just
need to get wasted.

778
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,132
Come on.

779
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,032
I wanna live
at the beach someday.

780
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:47,940
Oh, shit.

781
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:50,775
I left the keys.

782
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,782
I'll get them.

783
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:13,602
Kelly?

784
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:15,399
Suzie.

785
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:19,639
It's me.

786
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:27,679
I was worried about you,
and I decided...

787
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:31,414
that the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

788
01:12:32,422 --> 01:12:34,356
Are you mad at me?

789
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,151
I probably should've
told you a bit more about...

790
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,594
the part I intended to play.

791
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:42,598
But we'll go through it
again tonight.

792
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,338
This is a celebration,
not a suicide pact.

793
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:55,072
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

794
01:12:55,145 --> 01:12:57,613
have a little champagne...

795
01:12:57,681 --> 01:12:59,615
watch the stars.

796
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:04,849
Have you got a blanket
in the back of your mom's Rover?

797
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:08,983
Why don't you be an angel,
and run over and get it for us?

798
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:12,953
Good girl.

799
01:13:14,898 --> 01:13:17,389
Let me tell you about
this boat I got picked out for us.

800
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,256
You okay?

801
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:27,130
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

802
01:15:03,974 --> 01:15:06,465
You say she didn't
come home last night.

803
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:11,071
She's been talkin' about goin' to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

804
01:15:11,148 --> 01:15:14,276
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

805
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,814
Found some teeth
in an old trailer down the road.

806
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,654
He says they'll fit.

807
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,685
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

808
01:15:26,763 --> 01:15:30,597
Oh, now they're sayin'
that she can't graduate.

809
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:33,864
Kelly Van Ryan got her into
this whole mess, and you know it.

810
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:37,205
We'll look into it for you, Ruby.

811
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:39,208
We find somethin',
you'll be the first to know.

812
01:15:41,778 --> 01:15:43,370
Come on.

813
01:16:01,498 --> 01:16:04,490
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

814
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:07,230
We don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

815
01:16:07,304 --> 01:16:09,898
I'll drop you off at the office.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

816
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:13,636
You got someplace you wanna be?
You got a date?

817
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:15,803
Just check the car out for me.

818
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:27,819
It's over here
by that old boat.

819
01:16:28,925 --> 01:16:31,826
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

820
01:16:31,895 --> 01:16:33,829
Yeah, sometimes.

821
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:36,331
A lot of the kids hang out here.

822
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,096
You really think
somethin' bad happened to Suzie?

823
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:43,605
Lombardo ever come out here?

824
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:47,543
I say somethin' funny?

825
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:51,877
No, but I mean,
just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would--

826
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:55,577
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

827
01:16:55,652 --> 01:16:57,415
You and him were pals, right?

828
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,615
Yeah, but he got me
on the sailing team.

829
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:00,724
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

830
01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:03,784
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

831
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,921
Lombardo went to the University of Miami
on an athletic scholarship.

832
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:11,525
Boats didn't have
a damn thing to do with it.

833
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:04,644
I'm gonna be here a while, kid.

834
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,656
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

835
01:18:13,363 --> 01:18:15,263
Hey, Jimmy.

836
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,637
People aren't always what
they appear to be. Don't forget that.

837
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:41,422
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?

838
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:43,789
The swamp, most likely.
The guy's a swamp rat.

839
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,260
He knows it'll never be found,
but he made one mistake.

840
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:48,320
The grandmother said she'd been
threatening to run away...

841
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,423
and I found the car
at the bus terminal.

842
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,162
- You don't think Sam put it there?
- Hold on a second.

843
01:18:53,236 --> 01:18:55,602
Gloria, then have the car
dusted for prints.

844
01:18:55,672 --> 01:18:58,573
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

845
01:18:58,642 --> 01:19:01,543
Little sociopath's the one
who started this in the first place.

846
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,739
- How long before we get somethin'?
- We can get blood type right away.

847
01:19:04,814 --> 01:19:08,409
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

848
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:12,253
Poor dumb Suzie.
Never had a chance.

849
01:19:12,322 --> 01:19:14,916
- We don't know that.
- I'm tellin' you, Kelly's next.

850
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:19,018
I'm tellin' you,
you get out of this... right now.

851
01:19:19,095 --> 01:19:23,429
Don't even fuckin' let me
hear about you bothering Lombardo.

852
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:30,399
David, you get an I.D.,
you call me!

853
01:19:33,376 --> 01:19:37,210
- Will you do me one favor?
- Ray, you heard him.

854
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,340
He told me to stay away from Lombardo.
He didn't say anything about you.

855
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:43,011
What if I'm right
and Hunter's wrong?

856
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:45,611
Please, you gotta
help me out.

857
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:49,250
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

858
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:54,222
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

859
01:20:37,907 --> 01:20:40,671
- Hello?
<i>- I've been calling you.</i>

860
01:20:40,744 --> 01:20:42,678
- I wanna see you.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

861
01:20:42,746 --> 01:20:45,579
- Stupid guest house.
<i>- Good. Stay there.</i>

862
01:20:45,648 --> 01:20:47,445
I'm really nervous.

863
01:20:47,517 --> 01:20:49,451
Kelly, relax.

864
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:53,078
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

865
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:56,853
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

866
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:59,417
But what if they find out?

867
01:20:59,496 --> 01:21:02,226
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

868
01:21:02,298 --> 01:21:03,788
<i>Look, Kelly...</i>

869
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:06,859
stay in the guest house tonight,
skip the graduation parties.

870
01:21:06,936 --> 01:21:09,598
I love you so much.

871
01:21:09,672 --> 01:21:13,836
<i>I love you too, Kelly.</i>
<i>Be a good girl and stay where you are.</i>

872
01:21:36,966 --> 01:21:41,630
Peeping in people's windows.
Isn't that against the law?

873
01:21:43,306 --> 01:21:45,240
Suzie Toller's missing.

874
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,972
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.

875
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:52,310
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

876
01:21:52,382 --> 01:21:54,680
Ray thinks she was murdered.

877
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:57,015
I don't know what to tell you.

878
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:01,886
You could tell me
where you were last night.

879
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:05,325
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now do I?

880
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:09,660
Come here.

881
01:22:10,934 --> 01:22:12,868
I wanna show you something.

882
01:22:24,347 --> 01:22:27,009
Looks like good-bye.

883
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:29,916
Kelly's file.
Read it.

884
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:33,046
You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

885
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:35,556
who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

886
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,183
What two people?

887
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,694
One of them was her mother.

888
01:22:39,762 --> 01:22:41,696
The other one was a...

889
01:22:43,099 --> 01:22:44,691
a female classmate...

890
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:48,830
she may have been
sexually involved with.

891
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,598
Suzie?

892
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:55,643
Now you got the file.

893
01:22:55,712 --> 01:22:57,839
Read it.

894
01:22:57,914 --> 01:23:00,849
I think it'll give you
a new perspective on things.

895
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:05,651
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

896
01:23:07,657 --> 01:23:10,524
Because then I had principles...

897
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:12,857
that meant a lot to me.

898
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:16,089
Now...

899
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,334
I don't care.

900
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:35,680
I should probably go now.

901
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:40,414
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

902
01:24:08,751 --> 01:24:11,948
- Duquette. What's happening?
<i>- I'm fired. I'm goin' home.</i>

903
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:13,716
- Where's Lombardo?
<i>- Gone.</i>

904
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,816
Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

905
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:19,157
Let me tell you somethin', Ray.

906
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:21,287
There's more to this story
than you know.

907
01:24:21,364 --> 01:24:22,991
<i>If Suzie is dead...</i>

908
01:24:23,066 --> 01:24:25,626
Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

909
01:24:30,473 --> 01:24:32,407
Shit, Ray.

910
01:24:42,218 --> 01:24:45,517
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's Detective Duquette.

911
01:24:45,588 --> 01:24:47,522
Open the gate now.

912
01:25:18,755 --> 01:25:20,950
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doin' here?

913
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:41,142
Where's-- Kelly!

914
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:54,280
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

915
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:57,383
And just like that-- bingo--

916
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,894
she put a knee in my groin.

917
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:02,624
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

918
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,361
just enough.

919
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:08,165
I couldn't get to her.

920
01:26:08,237 --> 01:26:10,330
She turned on me with the gun.

921
01:26:12,442 --> 01:26:14,603
Fired one shot.

922
01:26:15,678 --> 01:26:17,270
I took the hit in the shoulder.

923
01:26:20,616 --> 01:26:22,550
I had no choice.

924
01:26:26,189 --> 01:26:27,781
I had to return fire.

925
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:33,186
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.

926
01:26:36,265 --> 01:26:38,790
I went there to protect her.

927
01:26:41,938 --> 01:26:44,532
I went there to protect her.

928
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:44,640
Detective Duquette...

929
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,699
Detective Duquette...

930
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:50,143
I spent some time in military
intelligence, and we had a saying there:

931
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:53,649
Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

932
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:55,843
Three times is enemy action.

933
01:26:55,918 --> 01:26:58,148
This is twice for you,
Duquette...

934
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,952
and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

935
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:05,892
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

936
01:27:05,962 --> 01:27:08,829
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

937
01:27:08,898 --> 01:27:12,390
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

938
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:16,700
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

939
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,434
Chief Goodsall...

940
01:27:18,508 --> 01:27:22,740
Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

941
01:27:22,812 --> 01:27:25,474
near the area
known as Stoner Beach.

942
01:27:25,548 --> 01:27:28,881
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

943
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:31,920
This has led
this office to conclude...

944
01:27:31,988 --> 01:27:35,719
that Susan Marie Toller
was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

945
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:39,228
Oh, she didn't.
She didn't.

946
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:43,323
Mr. Duquette.

947
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:49,360
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

948
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:17,455
Thank you.

949
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:13,650
Howdy, partner.

950
01:29:15,591 --> 01:29:19,027
Jesus, man. I wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.

951
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:25,666
Hey, nice girlfriend
you got there.

952
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,760
Kelly was only
supposed to be framed.

953
01:29:27,837 --> 01:29:29,805
The bitch shot me.

954
01:29:29,872 --> 01:29:33,467
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

955
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:36,238
You know, shoot them
in the leg or somethin'?

956
01:29:36,312 --> 01:29:39,907
Did you become squeamish about
this stuff before or after...

957
01:29:39,982 --> 01:29:43,042
you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

958
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:46,680
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.

959
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:51,455
Man, it couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.

960
01:29:51,527 --> 01:29:53,358
I couldn't talk them out of it.

961
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,556
What I'm telling you is,
I don't like surprises.

962
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:59,795
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

963
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:01,860
Now there's no loose ends.

964
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:05,465
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

965
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:07,975
Oh, listen, about tomorrow.

966
01:30:08,044 --> 01:30:12,140
I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

967
01:30:12,214 --> 01:30:16,241
to make the--
make the transfer, so--

968
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:17,980
Bullshit.

969
01:30:18,054 --> 01:30:20,215
Call them yourself.

970
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:24,453
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

971
01:30:24,527 --> 01:30:28,987
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.

972
01:30:29,065 --> 01:30:30,999
I could use a deck hand.

973
01:30:36,405 --> 01:30:38,669
Here's to large bank accounts.

974
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:44,575
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

975
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,484
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

976
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:53,988
And no loose ends.

977
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:15,305
Hey, Ray,
see that winch?

978
01:31:16,812 --> 01:31:19,076
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

979
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:25,486
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah.

980
01:31:25,554 --> 01:31:29,957
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.

981
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:34,258
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

982
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:36,264
Why don't you get
a nice powerboat?

983
01:31:36,332 --> 01:31:39,597
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor outta you yet.

984
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:42,503
Or get me drowned.

985
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:57,781
It's stuck.

986
01:31:57,853 --> 01:32:01,118
What do you mean?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

987
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,995
It's stuck, I'm tellin' you.

988
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:11,163
The jenny sheet
must be caught on something.

989
01:32:11,233 --> 01:32:14,600
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

990
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:18,265
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.

991
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,366
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

992
01:32:21,444 --> 01:32:24,174
and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

993
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:26,676
You're killin' me.

994
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,224
This thing?

995
01:32:37,293 --> 01:32:41,457
That's it. That one right there.
You see anything?

996
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:48,968
Look a little lower.
That's it.

997
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,510
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray.

998
01:33:02,318 --> 01:33:04,752
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

999
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,084
First rule of sailing.

1000
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:36,674
- Ray, what happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

1001
01:33:45,928 --> 01:33:47,190
You!

1002
01:33:48,197 --> 01:33:51,030
- You're dead!
- No, I'm not.

1003
01:33:55,938 --> 01:33:57,269
For chrissake!

1004
01:33:57,339 --> 01:34:01,571
Sorry, partner.
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1005
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:05,241
You shouldn't have killed
that kid out in the Glades, either.

1006
01:34:05,314 --> 01:34:06,906
What was his name?

1007
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:08,782
Davy.

1008
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:23,798
That's my son Walter.

1009
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,266
He's been doin' this a long time,
so don't you be afraid.

1010
01:34:26,335 --> 01:34:28,997
Please, come on in.

1011
01:34:29,071 --> 01:34:31,801
Thank you so much for
comin' down to the Glades.

1012
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:50,518
Did you come out here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1013
01:34:50,593 --> 01:34:52,754
No. Actually,
it's my day off.

1014
01:34:54,697 --> 01:34:56,289
I thought you looked different.

1015
01:34:56,365 --> 01:34:59,027
I came over here because
I was hoping you would talk to me.

1016
01:35:00,402 --> 01:35:01,869
About Suzie?

1017
01:35:01,937 --> 01:35:05,805
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1018
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,473
He used to come around here.

1019
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:18,117
He had a thing goin'
with one of the girls--

1020
01:35:18,187 --> 01:35:21,714
" girls"-- over at the Glades.

1021
01:35:22,691 --> 01:35:25,592
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

1022
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:29,964
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.

1023
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:33,597
All I know is,
the next mornin'...

1024
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:36,695
she was gone
and a boy was dead.

1025
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:40,799
Seminole kid named Davy.

1026
01:35:40,876 --> 01:35:43,071
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1027
01:35:46,582 --> 01:35:50,018
Caught Ray slappin' her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1028
01:35:51,854 --> 01:35:54,186
So Ray killed him.

1029
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:57,982
Suzie saw it.

1030
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:01,962
So he busted her
and sent her up.

1031
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:05,728
You know,
just to prove that he could.

1032
01:36:07,269 --> 01:36:10,432
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1033
01:36:21,717 --> 01:36:23,981
To Ray.

1034
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:27,045
We won.
Sam, it's over.

1035
01:36:36,098 --> 01:36:39,659
Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1036
01:36:39,735 --> 01:36:43,227
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.

1037
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,784
Okay, Toller.

1038
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:59,719
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1039
01:37:00,723 --> 01:37:02,748
Fuck the winch.
I wanna drive.

1040
01:37:02,825 --> 01:37:06,158
It doesn't work that way.
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1041
01:37:07,896 --> 01:37:09,830
Now get on that winch.

1042
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,600
I just wanna cruise for a while.

1043
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:18,501
That's funny.

1044
01:37:18,574 --> 01:37:22,476
That's one of the first things
I noticed about you, Sam.

1045
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:24,478
You like to cruise.

1046
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:28,141
Suzie--

1047
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:31,118
Take college, for instance.

1048
01:37:31,186 --> 01:37:35,145
I bet the classes you took were the ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1049
01:37:36,859 --> 01:37:39,657
And you never bought the book.
You'd always find some girl...

1050
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:44,290
to loan you hers, and then you'd
have to fuck her after that, right?

1051
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:45,958
Is that how it went?

1052
01:37:49,171 --> 01:37:50,433
Yeah.

1053
01:37:52,908 --> 01:37:55,809
Well, I've got
a good pop quiz for you.

1054
01:37:55,878 --> 01:37:57,869
Multiple choice, of course.

1055
01:37:59,481 --> 01:38:03,611
Before sailing away on the <i>Helios,</i> Medea
killed King Creon and the princess...

1056
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:06,654
with what?

1057
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,723
A rock...

1058
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,384
a spear gun, or...

1059
01:38:13,562 --> 01:38:14,995
a little poison?

1060
01:38:16,031 --> 01:38:17,623
Poison!

1061
01:38:21,236 --> 01:38:22,965
Good guess.

1062
01:38:55,537 --> 01:38:57,232
Nice truck.

1063
01:39:04,947 --> 01:39:06,380
Sellin' your boat?

1064
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:14,985
This was Suzie's boat.

1065
01:39:15,057 --> 01:39:17,150
Guess she won't be
needin' it now.

1066
01:39:19,194 --> 01:39:20,286
Funny.

1067
01:39:20,362 --> 01:39:23,092
I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1068
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:28,131
Old lady had her tested once.

1069
01:39:28,203 --> 01:39:30,171
They said her I.Q.
was way up there...

1070
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:34,141
around 200 or some such shit.

1071
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:37,474
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1072
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:49,711
You know...

1073
01:40:49,785 --> 01:40:53,186
that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.

1074
01:40:57,693 --> 01:41:01,356
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1075
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:05,465
Was I naive.

1076
01:41:09,871 --> 01:41:12,305
I can't decide
what came out better:

1077
01:41:12,374 --> 01:41:16,367
that little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dog collar around your neck.

1078
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,714
What do you think,
Mr. Lombardo?

1079
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:37,997
Seems to like
the same places you do.

1080
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:41,194
Funny you never met.

1081
01:41:41,269 --> 01:41:43,396
Yeah, real funny.

1082
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:47,704
You know, you're wrong about this.
And I could get busted on the spot.

1083
01:41:48,777 --> 01:41:51,041
The guy's dirty.
He'll love it.

1084
01:41:51,113 --> 01:41:53,741
Especially the part
about killing me.

1085
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:57,012
Now get outta here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1086
01:42:09,431 --> 01:42:11,365
What are you drinkin'?

1087
01:42:24,312 --> 01:42:27,839
You've got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the fucking evidence.

1088
01:42:33,055 --> 01:42:34,989
Oh, for chrissake.

1089
01:42:50,405 --> 01:42:52,930
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doin' here?

1090
01:43:40,021 --> 01:43:41,955
May I ask you a question,
Miss Toller?

1091
01:43:44,392 --> 01:43:47,657
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1092
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,631
I hope I never make you mad.

1093
01:43:56,304 --> 01:43:59,296
Cash is just
walkin'-around money.

1094
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:01,808
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1095
01:44:01,877 --> 01:44:06,143
minus the million we set aside for
Ruby and Walter, less my usual fee.

1096
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:09,712
Case closed.

1097
01:44:22,063 --> 01:44:23,655
Suzie...

1098
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:28,197
be good.
