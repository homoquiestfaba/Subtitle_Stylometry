11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:00,300
Camp Hope

12
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Holy Mother, the soul of my father
rest gives Romeo Garbollato.

13
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,000
May the tortures of purgatory
spared him ...

14
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,700
and must be received in the bosom
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

15
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
Amen.
- Amen.

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,772
Praise the Lord.

17
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Are your things packed up, boy?
- I have your asthma medication.

18
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,106
Yes, I'm almost done.
- Is grandpa in heaven now?

19
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,451
I hope so, sweetheart.
But, every day ...

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
we should count our blessings
and say our prayers ...

21
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,500
so he can leave purgatory
and can go to Heaven.

22
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,800
What is purgatory?
- Tell your sister what purgatory is.

23
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Purgatory is a place where those suffering
that sinful dead.

24
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,900
Or who have not atoned for their actions.

25
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,876
I do not understand what he just said.

26
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
Thank you, dear.

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,700
Neither do I.
Purgatory is like prison.

28
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,850
A place where you go
to cleanse his soul ...

29
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,400
so we are ready to meet God.

30
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,700
I also have to purgatory?
- Everyone goes there.

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,700
No, honey, you're a good girl.
You are God's girl.

32
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,300
In the world outside people want
take away from you.

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,006
Your right to go to heaven.
Therefore, every day kneel ...

34
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,985
Tommy goes to hell.
- Rose, that's not nice.

35
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,400
It's true. If he needs me to fit
if you were to meet ...

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
I asked him to bed so
He can talk with his girlfriend.

37
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,300
And the community says it's a sin
to have a girlfriend.

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,600
He does, I swear.
- Shut up, Rose.

39
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Do not say 'shut up' to your sister.

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,449
And no cursing, young lady.

41
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:49,627
It's no sin to a friend
to have.

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,100
Your brother is just too young.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,551
When can I go to camp?
- If you're older, but now to bed.

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
I have yet to pack.

45
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,700
I hate you.

46
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,200
Hello, Father Phineas McAllister,
I come to see Daniel Jacobs.

47
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,800
Yes, Father.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,100
Father McAllister is here,
for his appointment with Daniel Jacobs.

49
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,100
<i> Department of Psychiatry
Unit 3 </ i>

50
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,362
Hello, Daniel.

51
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,700
How did it go this week?

52
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,900
Have you eaten?

53
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,900
Daniel?

54
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,800
You can not hide forever for me.

55
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
It is now more than six months.

56
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,000
Daniel?

57
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Can you hear me, son?

58
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
The next two weeks I am gone.

59
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
I go to camp with the kids
of the community.

60
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
Daniel? May I see?

61
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,300
May I see your book?

62
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Please?

63
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,800
Daniel, listen to me.

64
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,700
There is hope.

65
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
I told you several times
offered.

66
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,800
Take help of which you are.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm doomed, Father.

68
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,000
And you, my priest, have failed.

69
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,300
As you have always failed.

70
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,200
No.
- Yes, you have failed.

71
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
You have failed.

72
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
You leave no impressions on the world,
only scars.

73
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,245
You have failed yourself and your sister betrayed
because you do not trust in God.

74
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,445
Are you happy with your life, Father?

75
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Are you proud of your achievements?

76
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,220
I am a servant of the Lord.

77
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,400
Nothing happens on earth without
God's permission?

78
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,446
Nothing.

79
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,399
I hate God.

80
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,238
That you should also.

81
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,360
I read the Old Testament,
the book of Tobias.

82
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,900
The devil, Asmodeus, seven killed
men's intervention before God ...

83
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,900
archangel Rafael and sends Asmodues
stop.

84
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,916
Seven men.

85
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
That is the will of God.

86
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,200
There is no hope.

87
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
There is only the will of God.

88
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Daniel, please.

89
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,700
Your time is over.

90
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,400
And you will see me, after today,
no more.

91
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
That is the will of God.

92
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,000
It is God's will.

93
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Goodbye, Father.

94
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,100
Daniel?

95
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,600
Did you this, folks?

96
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
These extremist, Islamic
fascists ...

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,900
Using children as a distraction ...

98
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,600
to pass military checkpoints
light, and then their car bombs.

99
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,700
These are the kind of animals we
face.

100
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,200
And it gets worse every day.

101
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Do not ask me, just look ...

102
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,573
Thank you.

103
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,329
Go to hell.
God is a loser.

104
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Welcome
Camp Hope

105
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Okay, we're there.
Come here, I will pray for you.

106
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
Jesus, You are our hope.

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,900
Please find your way to the heart
my son.

108
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,600
Make a man of him,
a fighter for your Kingdom.

109
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Keep the Devil and all his demons
far away from him ...

110
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
and protect it for sin
of meat.

111
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,993
We ask all this in Your name.
- And, please, Dad, watch over him.

112
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,300
I'll give it to the nurse.

113
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
You do not go to jail.
What's going on?

114
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,410
It goes well.
- Just try to have fun.

115
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
It is simply camp.

116
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,400
Concentration camp.

117
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,700
They still have the camp party, right?

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,955
Maybe one can dance with Melissa.

119
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
I love you.

120
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Hello Brother Jack.
John.

121
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
Hey, brother, how are you?

122
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
It goes well.

123
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,400
How are you, John?
- I've lost all my clients ...

124
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,300
tell your friends about us.
- I'm sorry for you.

125
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,100
Thank you, Dad.

126
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
Behave you.
-Be good, boys.

127
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,060
We love you, sweetheart.

128
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll sit back saddled
Jimmy.

129
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,018
Is that a problem, brother?

130
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,700
It looks as though we
bunk areas, Tommy.

131
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,300
There would appear so.

132
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,700
Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah.

133
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
Welcome again to serve one year
and learning at Camp Hope.

134
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm Christian Bonderman,
I am your pastoral service.

135
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
Some of you know me already,
as a youth leader from home.

136
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,800
Everyone here has high school
completed.

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Everyone has done volunteer work
for young adults.

138
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,900
We all know the rules that
we should stick ...

139
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
but just to be sure.

140
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Signs or symbols of youth culture
are not allowed.

141
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,300
Rock music is not allowed,
nothing that looks like.

142
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,200
No magazines that are related
with youth culture.

143
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,400
Your cell phones, better known
hell if phones are strictly prohibited.

144
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,200
When I hear such a popular ring-tone,
I turn your neck.

145
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,800
There are no special boy-girl
relationships allowed.

146
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
No one-on-one time with someone
the female sex, ever.

147
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,900
And you wear a pair of trousers, at any time.
Except during ...

148
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
swimming, then neat swimwear
allowed.

149
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,200
The girls do not worry, be
to do the same.

150
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
They should wear dresses at all times.

151
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,100
And finally, leave the camp
is strictly prohibited.

152
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,900
Violation of these rules leads to
expansion of this camp.

153
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Is that clear?

154
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Yes, no food, no fun, no girls.
I get it.

155
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm here to help.
And if you live according to those rules ...

156
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,200
in the time you're here, bring your
closer to the Lord Jesus.

157
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,300
Say Amen.
- Jack ...

158
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
To begin with I,
Check all your stuff ...

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,500
to ensure that we all
same thing.

160
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
Unity, brothers.

161
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Open your bags
and keep them ready for inspection.

162
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,700
James, we start with you.
What do you have on you?

163
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Just off this road.

164
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,564
What have we here?
Let's see.

165
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
Why do you need it?
You do not even shave.

166
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
It's ...

167
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,100
Wait a minute ...
What is this?

168
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,700
The Haribo factory.
That's nice.

169
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
This is not a good start.
- I sometimes get hungry.

170
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Jesus got hungry in the desert,
for 40 days and 40 nights.

171
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm disappointed. - Sorry.
- I am also sorry for you.

172
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,200
Tommy, what about here?

173
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,015
You read this? From yourself?
- Yes.

174
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,640
That's great. Very good, Tommy.
You would also have to read Dante.

175
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Jack, how about you?

176
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,987
What is this?
- No Spawn nine. Very good.

177
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Look at this.
- It's Angela. Very tasty.

178
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
I can not let this hold.

179
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
This is a sinful place.

180
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
I take this space.
- No, you can not make.

181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,200
You know what else I can do?
This.

182
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,383
What are you doing?

183
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,879
Are you going to test me?

184
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Pick it up and pray for God's grace.

185
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,000
Pick it up.

186
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,200
Christian, my things are here,
if you want to take a look.

187
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,700
Sit down, my brothers and sisters.

188
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,600
This is the day.

189
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,300
Which we are at war,
brothers and sisters.

190
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,200
At war with the world.

191
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,500
At war with the body.

192
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,300
And at war with the Devil,
Satan and his dominion.

193
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,900
From all indications show that
the end of the day is near.

194
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,300
And make no mistake, the Devil is real.

195
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,900
And what is worse, he knows he
lost.

196
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,600
So if a cornered,
wounded animal ...

197
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,600
will increase and possible strike
of you grabbing ...

198
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,000
before descending into the pit of fire,
forever.

199
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
The beast moves.

200
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,900
And what do we know about Satan
and his demons?

201
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,100
He rules the world with all its
much better than we know.

202
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,900
So he'll imagination against you.
And he'll like that against you.

203
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,800
He will proudly use
to trick you and your sharing.

204
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,200
And why are we so blessed,
brothers and sisters ...

205
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,500
to be here in this camp,
at this time, this moment.

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,100
The Kingdom of Heaven is yours,
if you seize the opportunity.

207
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,200
Do you think not, you are incredible
torture your destiny, for all eternity.

208
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Jesus gives us no choice.

209
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,300
So, rise up brothers and sisters.

210
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,500
Arise children of God
and take what He offers you.

211
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,900
Help me, Jesus, protect me.

212
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Protect me.

213
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Jesus, protect me.

214
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,400
Protect yourself ...

215
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,100
Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil, Amen.

216
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,800
Breakfast, morning at seven o'clock, exactly.
Brothers and sisters, go in peace.

217
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,900
You okay?
- Yes.

218
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,700
Has Tommy back candy
from the liquor cabinet?

219
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,300
You said that time had been.

220
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you okay?
- Yes, why?

221
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,400
I do not know, it looked fierce
from net. I was worried about you.

222
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes, it was strange.

223
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,600
It's good now.
- You are fortunately not injured.

224
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
We need to clean chairs,
not socializing with the sisters.

225
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
Jimmy, it's good.
- He has an attack.

226
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Jimmy, is this a joke?

227
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,344
Open his mouth.
- Somebody get Christian.

228
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,500
From what the guys tell me ...

229
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,000
it was probably a slight
clonic seizure.

230
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
What is that?

231
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,497
An attack, caused by sudden
light and a startle response.

232
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,700
Apparently they wanted a joke with him
prosecuting.

233
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,600
We contact with his parents to
to see if he already had ...

234
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,900
and we take him to the hospital,
Just to be sure.

235
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm sorry Jimmy,
that I had never imagined.

236
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm sorry. It was very stupid of me,
I just wanted to scare him.

237
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,500
You should know better, Tim.

238
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Remember next time to ensure
for your brother.

239
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,483
Yes, of course.

240
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
Father?
- Yes, Thomas, what can I do for you?

241
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
I was hoping we could talk, I have ...

242
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,900
We have time, I seek you on.

243
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,300
Yes, sir. Thanks.

244
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,800
Brothers,
I have our schedule for today.

245
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,400
Immediately after the morning prayer, we divide
us into groups.

246
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,800
The distribution is done based
of you sleeping.

247
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And after lunch we have recreation time.

248
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,000
The game today 'Stratego Alive'.

249
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,893
Thus, group A
Timothy, Jack, Thomas and Jimmy.

250
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,800
We gather as a group,
at the baseball field.

251
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,400
And because Jack thought a sarcasm
good way ...

252
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,300
the kitchen crew to thank for
breakfast this morning ...

253
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
do you have maid service
this evening.

254
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,700
The sin of one affects many.
- The sin of one.

255
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
Does anyone have anything that he wants to share?

256
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,300
What about your vows,
this summer?

257
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,800
What? Do you have enough time to make them
all to discuss?

258
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,900
I have a confession,
I've broken a vow.

259
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,800
I found a CD, a rock album.

260
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,100
I do not know why, but I
Listened to 100 times.

261
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,590
Did you still have it?
- No, I'm wasted.

262
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,400
I noticed the effect on my mind.
- Good.

263
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,200
It is good that you recognize that
rock music you can influence.

264
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
I mean, before I found the Lord
and came to this community ...

265
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,200
rock music is me
along dangerous roads.

266
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,000
It started with going to concerts ...

267
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,800
those concerts were drugs and alcohol.

268
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,000
And people who had sex,
without being married.

269
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,900
He wanted that fixed too.
- What did you say?

270
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,200
Nothing.
- I have a question for you.

271
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,600
I understand why your comic
I torn?

272
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Frankly no, but you
established a very good explanation.

273
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,900
Is it not clear to you that this comic
a part of youth culture?

274
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,100
And it contributes nothing to with
to get closer to the Lord.

275
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
No, but even if it is ...

276
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,400
gives you no right to my
personal belongings destroyed.

277
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,900
Jack, if you give in to the temptations
of this world ...

278
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,600
makes it easier for Satan
to find a weakness, a vice ...

279
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,160
and then he crushed you.

280
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,000
Why has so much power?

281
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,242
Who gave him that power? God?
- Of course not.

282
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Why does God allow Satan to exist?

283
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
Why does He allow us to risk?
Why, if he loves us?

284
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,693
It is because of us. Our sin.
The sin of Adam and Eve.

285
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,354
We have given power to Satan.
It is because of us.

286
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,876
My deceased grandfather last month.
- I know. I'm sorry.

287
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,200
It does not matter.
I just want to know where he is now.

288
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,100
Is he in hell?
He dies?

289
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
We suffer in purgatory so
we are cleansed of our sins.

290
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,900
Before he died, he told me
way to go here ...

291
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,900
away from the community,
as fast as I could.

292
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,342
He loved me.

293
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,200
Perhaps we should call
with your parents there, after this camp.

294
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,000
What he, Christian.
What do you do in this forest?

295
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,800
My name is not a Christian,
I am of the camp.

296
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes? The Christian camp?

297
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,700
What's going on?

298
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,900
Take care, Christian.
And remember to whom this forest.

299
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Inbreeding acorns.
- Jack, your language, please.

300
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Tommy, let's hang the flag back.

301
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,000
Well you have one.

302
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,100
Even Judas was popular for a while.

303
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,300
I have joy in my heart.

304
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,600
Where?
- In my heart, in my heart.

305
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,406
Good work. Really.
- How you doing, guys?

306
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,500
Christian, how likely is that we
allowed to park in that city?

307
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,300
Zero point zero.

308
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
I like corn on the cob good.

309
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,000
It's been years since I went to
an amusement park have been.

310
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,454
You hear that, Christian?
Tommy has not been there for years.

311
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,480
The last time was with my grandfather.
- His dead grandfather, Christian.

312
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,600
It's pretty funny because he always said
tell my parents we went to mass.

313
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,422
But then we went to Coney Island.
And they still do not know.

314
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,800
Is this the same grandma that you said here
far as possible to stay away?

315
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,600
I understand now what impact
He had on your life.

316
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,833
Stop, it goes too far.
- Should it be encouraged? Shame?

317
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,600
I did not say it, it is
his grandfather, have a little compassion.

318
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,545
Why are you so
negative, Jack?

319
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:53,900
Maybe
I know what your father's bitter new psyche.

320
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
It's not just my father.
All the leaders agreed.

321
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,900
And not just here.

322
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,400
Communities around the world
adapt to the new rule.

323
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,075
That is best for the community.
-But misery for us.

324
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,216
Jack, it's ...
- Look over there.

325
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,056
The statue was moved.
The first was to the right.

326
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,500
Scary things are happening here.

327
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Let's go.

328
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,600
The last wish of an important figure
is difficult to overcome.

329
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,800
We need guys like Thomas.
We can not let him go.

330
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,300
Protect your.

331
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,400
This happened when my grandmother was with us.

332
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
My father's mother.

333
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
She was dying.
She had Alzheimer's.

334
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,700
My father spent every night at
her rosaries and prayed.

335
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,400
She then became worse,
They spat and cursed.

336
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Such things.

337
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,300
One night he took holy water
to sprinkle on her.

338
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,328
Just when he wanted to do ...

339
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,525
the phone rang.

340
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,000
He recorded and heard a
voice he did not recognize.

341
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,964
It was the voice of a child.
High-pitched, excited.

342
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,900
As if marbles
were in his mouth.

343
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,762
And the voice said:

344
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,627
Leave her alone!

345
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,600
My father asked who
I spoke.

346
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,151
There was only one
grudgingly sound.

347
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,200
And the voice became
even more excited.

348
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,300
She said: "We warn you.
Leave her alone. "

349
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,617
My father hung up the phone.

350
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,814
He blessed the room with holy water.

351
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,400
He sat down and began
a Rosary.

352
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,194
And when he did this the phone rang.

353
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,700
I let it ring.
It rang and rang ...

354
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,100
until I became frustrated and
threw the phone against the wall.

355
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,324
And then it was paused.

356
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,970
And he sat down.

357
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,500
And once he made the sign of a cross ...

358
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,891
the phone rang.

359
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,100
I was in my life has never been so scared.

360
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,814
It happened every night.

361
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,431
My father disconnected all phones
Before entering her room.

362
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,200
And once he made the sign of the cross ...

363
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,900
the phones were ringing.
All of them.

364
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,200
This went on until she died.

365
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,406
I have felt them earlier.

366
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,325
What?

367
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,400
Brothers, time to get up
and serve the Lord.

368
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Let's do it, guys.

369
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,500
The Lord must be served.
I'm excited.

370
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,300
Come, Holy Spirit

371
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,500
Blessed Creator

372
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,000
and in our hearts ...

373
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,300
Take all of your retirement

374
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:23,400
Come with your grace
Heavenly and air ...

375
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,600
our hearts heal
that you have made

376
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,700
our hearts heal
that you have made

377
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,200
Brethren, I can not do enough
stress.

378
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,000
If your sexuality is not subject
the will of God ...

379
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,000
can and will be your downfall.

380
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,200
It starts with your imagination ...

381
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,500
fantasies that ultimately
lead to masturbation.

382
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,100
For you to completely dominate
resulting in sexual perversity.

383
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,400
These are serious,
reprehensible sins.

384
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
You're not welcome
In the Kingdom of Heaven ...

385
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,474
if you masturbate, even if only
once, without to confess.

386
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,500
Or if you intimate caresses with a sister ...

387
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,900
or a brother.

388
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
If you're an orgasm is the same
as sex before marriage.

389
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Stay on your guard.
Stay chaste.

390
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Your very souls are at stake.

391
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,412
Hi, how are you?

392
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Let us thank God for
this delicious meal ...

393
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,047
prepared with love.
Give each other hand.

394
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,200
Dear God, thank You for
this meal is here.

395
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,700
Thank you for the person who
prepared for us.

396
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bless them for
selfless sacrifice they make.

397
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,100
And bless this congregation,
this community ...

398
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,000
Now as we celebrate your goodness.
Amen.

399
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,900
Amen.

400
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,000
Father, I ...
- You wanted to see me.

401
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,800
Yes, I wanted to talk ...

402
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Come to the chapel after dinner.

403
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,800
Thomas ...

404
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,683
Come inside.

405
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,900
This is the cup of my blood.

406
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,700
This cup was a gift.

407
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,900
The thirteenth birthday
of my initiation.

408
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,936
Come on, hold it.

409
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,588
Stick with it.

410
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,865
It is the divinity.

411
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,300
In your hands hold up
the holder of the divine.

412
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,000
The blood of our Lord.

413
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,189
And the altar, God is here
manifested.

414
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,100
His flesh, His blood.

415
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,900
Through me, His priest.

416
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,955
It's pretty intense.
- It's a well-chosen word. Intense.

417
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,530
A good word.

418
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,200
How does it feel?

419
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,100
In order to consecrate the Eucharist?

420
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,500
It feels like when
shared a secret with you.

421
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
A glimpse of the sublime.

422
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,300
Something that we do not fully understand ...

423
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,500
but we know that it's bigger than us.

424
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Humbled to be part
this piece of magic ...

425
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,991
this mystery.

426
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,783
Every day when I do my part
in the consecration of the Eucharist ...

427
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:35,137
is new.

428
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,036
Like the first kiss of a couple.

429
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,400
This is the miracle of the priesthood.

430
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,083
It's a wonderful life, Thomas.

431
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,500
Have you ever thought?
- I?

432
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,900
No, I do not think
me that she would be admitted.

433
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,100
What is it, Thomas?

434
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,637
You'll think I'm crazy.
- I think not.

435
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,659
I have these dreams ...

436
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,990
actually nightmares.

437
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,800
It's like I'm being ...

438
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,500
a demon.

439
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,399
This is in your dreams, you say?

440
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:52,300
But when I wake
it's still just me.

441
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,700
It's like my
sense loss, Father.

442
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,000
I know of cases of
demonic possession.

443
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,400
It's rare but it happens,
and it can be frightening.

444
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,600
If this happens again,
you come to me immediately.

445
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,200
No matter what time it is,
you understand?

446
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,800
Yes, Father.

447
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
Bend your head.

448
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,700
Come on, let those two beat.

449
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,277
Do more.

450
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,400
Come, walk like you mean it.

451
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,700
And then, what then?

452
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,600
That's it, come on.

453
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,870
Here.

454
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,473
Come on.

455
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Everything okay?
- Your turn.

456
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,800
It hurts.
I go to the infirmary.

457
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,729
Do you want me to go with you?
- No, I got it.

458
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,590
I go for it, Jimmy.

459
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,300
You can get a little rest.

460
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,700
Here you can be a little sleepy.

461
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,537
But the dance is tonight.

462
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,900
You will be there.
Rest now first.

463
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,300
Lord Jesus, bless this child.

464
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,300
Heal him, Lord.

465
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,086
Welcome to the dance.

466
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,500
Brothers and sisters, tonight will
you are so happy because ...

467
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,400
Tonight we
The folk dance.

468
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,065
Shortest to longest. We put David's here,
and Goliath's there.

469
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,700
Jack, put your shirt into your pants.

470
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,200
Jack, come on.

471
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,800
This will be great.

472
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,941
Where's Tommy?

473
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,849
He came to the ward.

474
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,300
Folk dance evening.
Smile.

475
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,600
Do you like the Folk?
I know you love.

476
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,250
Tommy ...

477
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,100
Give everything!

478
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,900
Where were you?

479
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,961
I had another asthma attack
and I fell asleep.

480
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,100
Is it going?
I missed you.

481
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,600
It looks like you have a good time.

482
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,400
I would do anything for me
you have fun.

483
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,500
Lets make a deal.
Tonight.

484
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,806
How?

485
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,700
Come to me.
Jack lets your alibi.

486
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,300
Are you crazy? You know what
happens when we are caught?

487
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,400
I know.
I do not care.

488
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,367
I want to see.
Come to me.

489
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,200
Okay, at half past eleven.
See you at the stables.

490
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,300
What are you doing here in the dark?

491
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,400
We were talking.
He was sick and ...

492
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,000
Just go back to your cabin.
You're acting like a tramp.

493
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,942
Excuse me?
- A whore.

494
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You're acting like a whore here in the
pitch dark, with a young man.

495
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,700
People will think you
're a whore.

496
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,800
Good night, Melissa.

497
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,700
I am extremely disappointed
in you, Thomas.

498
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,500
I thought I would not make it.

499
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
A few judges were
on the balcony and blocked the road.

500
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,900
I thought the horses
would betray me.

501
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,700
Where's Tommy?

502
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,000
I think the nurse.
Have asthma, you know.

503
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,100
FYI, Jesus is your
savior, not your friend.

504
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Funny. How would
the Inquisition you, Christian?

505
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,200
My father told your parents about
thought of leaving this place.

506
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,300
Is it true?

507
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,700
How do these rumors as soon as the round?

508
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,600
Oddly, this community, with all
her dedication, gossips more ...

509
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,800
than people in a supermarket.

510
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,500
So it is true?

511
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,400
Yes, I mean,
they just think about it.

512
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,900
Let's sit down.

513
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,984
But why?

514
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,400
Nobody knows this but,
My father is in the AA.

515
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,200
Really?

516
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Before his conversion
He was a real alcoholic.

517
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,200
My parents were so
almost divorced.

518
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,100
I did not, sorry.

519
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,500
With this new rule they've
ordered not to go ...

520
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,269
and my mom would not.

521
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,675
But if you leave ...
- I know how it is when someone leaves.

522
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
How they are treated.

523
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,800
It means that my parents
lost in this world.

524
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,200
The flesh and the devil.

525
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,433
And how will their slutty daughter perish?

526
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,800
I can not believe
he called you so.

527
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,803
Neither do I.

528
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,309
Why did you say anything then?

529
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
By Father Phineas?
Are you crazy?

530
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,400
No, not if you believe
that he was wrong.

531
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,000
It was so wrong to me
so to speak.

532
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,600
I know, I had something to say.
Sorry, Mel.

533
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Remember how much fun it was?
When we were kids?

534
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,200
There were prayer meetings, followed by
picnics that lasted and lasted.

535
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,900
We had so much fun.
It was fantastic.

536
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,000
I met you for the first time
in such a picnic.

537
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,000
You were eight or nine years.
Something?

538
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,800
Yes, I think eight.

539
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,400
You were so cute.

540
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,100
You always had such an effect on me.

541
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,700
Oh God, Mel.

542
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Oh God, Mel.

543
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,400
Tommy ...
Stay with me.

544
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Stay with me.

545
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,400
Father miserable ...

546
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,500
You failed.
As you've always failed.

547
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Time's up.

548
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,142
God is with me.

549
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,800
I can not believe this
happened.

550
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,729
Neither do I.
Are you ...

551
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,777
What?

552
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,073
Sticky.

553
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,519
We have this summer
barely touched each other.

554
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,341
It was intense.

555
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,000
Did you hear that?
- Yes.

556
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,700
We can not
caught in this way.

557
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,800
Stay here, stay.

558
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,300
I can not believe we just did.

559
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
Say this to anyone.

560
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Tommy, I have no regrets.

561
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,400
Please, do not
it feels bad.

562
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,200
I give a lot to you.

563
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,500
I will not tell anyone.

564
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,200
I can not even imagine
I would say to them.

565
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,100
I'll wait here a few minutes
and then I follow you.

566
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,500
I do not want them coming home to see us together.

567
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,300
That is a bad girl.

568
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,640
That is a bad girl.

569
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:01,586
That is a bad girl.

570
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,700
Why are not you
with your campers?

571
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Because someone is missing.
Who?

572
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,311
Thomas Leary.
- Come on.

573
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,500
This is the path.

574
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,400
This is the path.

575
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,200
Sister, what happens?

576
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,300
I get nothing but tatters.

577
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,881
They have the same nightmare.
- Father, what happened?

578
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:11,700
Sisters, keep the peace.
Be calm, nothing will happen.

579
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,800
Father, protect these Sisters.

580
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,900
Take all the bad thoughts away.

581
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,400
All fear of the enemy.

582
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,600
Melissa, why are you
still dressed?

583
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Tommy?

584
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,400
Tommy?

585
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,200
Tommy, stop.
- Stay here.

586
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,147
My God.

587
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,600
Okay?

588
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,500
The inhaler.
- Where is he?

589
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,700
In the infirmary.
- I'll get him.

590
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,400
Carol, is he okay?

591
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,900
He is better. He was afraid.
Asthma can be very frightening.

592
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,600
Yes, it is.
I must see him.

593
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,800
Sure, but he is very weak
and can not speak.

594
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,000
The drugs must do their job.
Can not this wait until tomorrow?

595
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,118
I do not see why not.

596
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,700
Thanks for your help tonight.
God bless you.

597
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,000
I will stay here with him
and go pray for him.

598
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,881
Then I'm gone.
Good night.

599
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,520
Good night, Father.

600
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,433
Do not speak, Thomas.

601
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,100
If you're better tomorrow
we should talk.

602
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,500
I know you're not responsible
are for the desecration of the chapel ...

603
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,300
but there are certain
things happened tonight.

604
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
You know what I speak.

605
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,400
You will tell me.

606
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,292
Got it?

607
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,300
This is my body
that you will be sacrificed.

608
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,500
He took the cup, saying 'Thank You'.

609
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,200
He handed the cup to his disciples
and said ...

610
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,180
This is the cup of my blood.

611
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,236
The blood of the New and
everlasting covenant.

612
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,741
Do this in memory of me.

613
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,392
This is Melissa. I received it via
one of the girls from her cabin.

614
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,821
Gotta go, the mass begins.
Are you okay? What happened?

615
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,937
Everything is fine.
I'm going to shower.

616
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,387
We'll talk later on.

617
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Yes, I'll tell it later.

618
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,524
Can I read?
- No.

619
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,876
Goodbye.

620
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,100
Tommy, if you're ready ...

621
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
and if you can, come back to me.

622
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,278
What were you doing outside your cabin tonight?
- I was sick, I had asthma.

623
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,703
I know but there was a girl
not in her cabin last night.

624
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,785
Were you with her?

625
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,384
Who?
- Do not play games with me.

626
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,800
I do not know what you have it, Father.

627
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,900
All right.

628
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,941
What were you doing in the chapel tonight?

629
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,534
I saw it, Father.
- What did you see?

630
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,774
The demon.

631
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,034
When did you first felt?

632
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:43,500
I do not know, it started
after my grandfather died.

633
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,900
Is this the grandfather you
brought to amusement parks ...

634
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,678
instead of going to church?

635
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,958
Yes.

636
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,305
Were you good friends?
- Very good friends.

637
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,243
My condolences at the loss.

638
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,127
Am I crazy, Father?

639
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,669
I've seen this before.

640
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,700
And what happened to him?
Where is he?

641
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,300
He stays in a mental institution.

642
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,613
He tried to commit suicide
and his sister to murder.

643
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,737
Why would God allow this?

644
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,993
God can not be questioned
our weak minds.

645
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,343
And this is God's will?

646
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,000
Nothing on this earth is done without
God's permission.

647
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,500
He tests us
within our own borders.

648
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,500
He gives us the resources, sacraments
and the grace to fight enemies.

649
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,600
Because the enemy is cruel.

650
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,900
But you choose whether you accept
what he offers.

651
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,200
I can help, but then
You listen and do what I say.

652
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,315
I do what is necessary.

653
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,091
Here, sit down.
- Yes.

654
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,000
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

655
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,300
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

656
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,000
When was the last confession?

657
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,767
A few months back.
- Go on.

658
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,200
After my last confession, I lied.

659
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,993
I've lied to my parents.
- And the sins of the flesh?

660
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,117
Yes, Father.

661
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,885
I have impure thoughts.
- You masturbate?

662
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,262
Yes, Father.
- How often?

663
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,300
So every day.
I do not know.

664
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,229
You invite the Devil in your imagination.
Every time you masturbate you open a door.

665
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:34,326
Do you understand?
- Yes.

666
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,783
And Melissa?

667
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,709
Were you with her?

668
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,800
You can not honestly confess if you
suppresses a sin that you know ...

669
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,043
thus reach forgiveness.

670
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,537
So, were you with her?

671
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,800
Yes.
- This is a serious offense.

672
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,569
Got her a sin?

673
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,600
A kiss, that's all.
She is a good person.

674
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,039
Are you sure, others not?
Sin remains if you do not confess.

675
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,934
I know.

676
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,005
Good. If you take more punishment
not participate in the camp.

677
01:07:40,105 --> 01:07:44,900
The remaining time you spend here
to pray and serve ...

678
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,900
and I have to tell your parents
what you did.

679
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,700
But as you said in this
a confession ...

680
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,722
I must ask your permission.

681
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,605
Can I tell them?
- Rather not.

682
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,600
Thomas, none of this will
easy, nothing.

683
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,221
You're disgusting.

684
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,600
Do you have any idea about the shame
You've caused me ...

685
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,297
in my name, your mother? Well?

686
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,600
I'm sorry.
- That means nothing. Just empty words.

687
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,400
You sorry means nothing,
these are empty words.

688
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,656
Empty words.
Listen now to the Father.

689
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
You must change, otherwise ...
Stand up for God.

690
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,205
Your mother wants to talk to you.

691
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,822
I'm here.
- What did you do?

692
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,200
Mom?
- Yes?

693
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,600
Mom, please ...

694
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,941
Tommy ...
- Enough.

695
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,200
Try not to get sympathy.
That you will not find here.

696
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,140
None.
You did this.

697
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,800
Listen to the Father.

698
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,451
Be a man or you will not come home.

699
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,100
No Hope For You

700
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,561
I'm so sorry.

701
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,100
I've got my glove needed.
- What is happening, friend?

702
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,184
Nothing.

703
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,451
Maybe I'll sneak into the park
During the stage tonight.

704
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,500
I love the cream waffles
and they have a crazy rollercoaster.

705
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,824
Go you, "Padawan?
- I'm grounded.

706
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,800
Really? What?

707
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,073
I am caught.
- By Melissa?

708
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,500
Was Father Falic evil?

709
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,378
Yes, you could say.
- Damn.

710
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,400
It's not fair.
- What?

711
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,604
Only if it is against the rules.
- Calm down.

712
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,643
Are you okay?

713
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,301
Pray for me, Jack.

714
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,700
Can I help you, officer?

715
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,200
Is this one of your campers?
- Yes, what happened?

716
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,700
He came into contact with a pair of
our local young people at the park.

717
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,500
A few elements of our poorer.

718
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,100
They've beaten him properly of
what I understand.

719
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,651
He was lucky.
A good Samaritan intervened.

720
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,600
He caught some of those guys,
and she quite frightened.

721
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,400
One of them known vandalism.

722
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,700
Agents are looking for the stolen
stuff.

723
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,645
That's good news.

724
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:41,369
We made our concerns. One child
his age, outside unattended.

725
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,000
We called his parents and
who told him to bring back here.

726
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,946
Thank you so much.
Help me with the latter.

727
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,428
I'll let you go for tonight.
It'll be fine.

728
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,459
She put me and marked me with this clip.
- What happened?

729
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,100
Inbreeding which figures you encountered
in the forest.

730
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,300
Who jumped me in the park
and beat me up.

731
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,600
Now you know why we have rules
that we use.

732
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,600
Those idiots had earlier problems
experienced one of the brothers ...

733
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,314
In a restaurant one year ago.

734
01:13:13,414 --> 01:13:14,700
They wait for us until we came back ...

735
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,900
because their parents said they
would go to hell.

736
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,900
There will be nothing much to do here.
- You should be happy ...

737
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,400
the fact that you could sacrifice yourself
for your brothers and sisters.

738
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,986
Are you kidding?
I do not care about them.

739
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,600
How can you say that?
After all we have done for you.

740
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,978
What have you done for me?

741
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:34,327
You turned my back on family and made
my father a sort of medicine?

742
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,649
For years, demanded the leaders of these
community, his father, my father ...

743
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,067
That's not fair.
- Fewer people outside the community helped.

744
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,900
So he had more time for
the brothers and sisters.

745
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,200
But when you decided to go brainwash.

746
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,300
What are we now?
What should my family now?

747
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,200
Jack, you're going too far.
- Shut up, Christian!

748
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,100
Should I listen to you?
Are you my example?

749
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,800
A 23-year-old follower who does everything
what he said.

750
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,800
You have no fucking idea
of yourself.

751
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,700
Look at yourself, look at your nails.
Come on, show them.

752
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,800
You bite it like a little girl.
You allow yourself as influenced by their use ...

753
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,978
Chris, stop it.

754
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,100
Jack, stop.

755
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,102
What are you doing?
Okay?

756
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,984
Get out of here.

757
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,349
Go away.

758
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,696
You belong here.
- Since you're absolutely right.

759
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,900
What time is it?
- No idea, about two hours.

760
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm outta here.

761
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,800
What? How?

762
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,800
My father is here, my parents ...

763
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,400
I think we are tired of this camp.

764
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,778
Really?

765
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,500
Shut up there.
You come through here.

766
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,879
Is it right?
- Yeah, right.

767
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,400
They can beat me down but I come
just back stronger than before.

768
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,351
Take care of yourself.

769
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,057
See you on the other side.

770
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,762
Yes.

771
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,700
The world is us, use our pride,
our greed ...

772
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,400
secular humanism is his church.

773
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,200
And the flesh is weak for us ...

774
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,900
lustful temptations.

775
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:29,400
But the Devil uses both
our brains to attack.

776
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,800
The devil knows our psyche,
and how it works, better than we do.

777
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,500
He uses the weakness of our brains,
for us to drive to anger ...

778
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,800
to fear, to despair.

779
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,200
John of the Cross ...

780
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,500
was often oppressed by the Devil.

781
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:56,700
And in his dark night, he discusses
the tortures of the devil.

782
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,400
This is what he says ...

783
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:03,100
If the spiritual communication is not
fully provided to the mind ...

784
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,200
but also on the senses ...

785
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,600
then the easier the Devil mind
disrupt and irritate ...

786
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,200
Terrors by the senses.

787
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,900
The pain and anguish it causes
are enormous.

788
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,700
And sometimes impossible.

789
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,200
Since direct transfer takes place
between mind and spirit ...

790
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:28,300
The evil spirit causes a horror
in the right spirit ...

791
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,300
sometimes for the good spirit
intolerable.

792
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,400
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray
for us sinners ...

793
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,000
now and in the hour of death.
Amen.

794
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,400
Father?

795
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,200
Thomas ...

796
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,800
I came here looking for you.

797
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,200
Are you free from sin?

798
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,700
Yes, Father.

799
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,100
No more masturbated?

800
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,800
No.

801
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,700
Wonderful, you are a sincere
and faithful servant.

802
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,700
I'm proud of what you have achieved.

803
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,200
Thank you, sir.

804
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,000
Go back to the prayer,
See you later.

805
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,900
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..

806
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,858
You are blessed among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

807
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,100
Hail Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners ...

808
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,400
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

809
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,600
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..

810
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,100
blessed is the fruit of thy womb ...

811
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,800
I'll get it.
- Wait for me, Rose.

812
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,800
And Dr. Jack. John there.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

813
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,900
Hi, John.
- Patricia.

814
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,900
Jack, what happened to your face?

815
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,200
Why are not you at camp?

816
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,200
My son has something
that you need to hear.

817
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,300
When Tommy first told that
I thought he was crazy.

818
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,500
I do not always agree with
community ...

819
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,400
but I still believe in God
and the Devil.

820
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,500
What do you mean, Jack?

821
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,700
Jack, wait for me in the car,
Please.

822
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
Tommy is my best friend and
I'm really worried about him.

823
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,600
You must first listen to me, Michael.
I've seen this before.

824
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,000
Phineas is a good father and husband
done a lot for the community, but ...

825
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,800
I fear that he is here to participate
faces.

826
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,472
I know you have problems with
the leaders at this point ...

827
01:20:23,572 --> 01:20:25,600
Michael ...
- But it suggests ...

828
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Please let him speak.

829
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:32,100
There was a boy, Daniel,
an altar boy for Father Phineas.

830
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,800
He looked a lot like Tommy.

831
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,300
But the boy had problems,
serious problems.

832
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
Phineas father sent him to me ...

833
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,500
because the boy claimed he
chased by a devil.

834
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,100
Our brains can be amazing
things.

835
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,300
But what I saw was this guy ...

836
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,000
it was something I never want to see.

837
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,200
Then I knew that the torment of Daniel ...

838
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,800
far more psychological than anything,
it had to be spiritual.

839
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:10,200
So when working with Father Phineas
the spiritual part and I helped him greatly.

840
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,500
The way he took care of Daniel,
how he focused on debt ...

841
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,900
sin, but only gave the demon
more power.

842
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,100
More control.
- What happened to the boy, Daniel?

843
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:26,500
Your Tommy is a good boy
and he has both of you.

844
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,100
What happened to Daniel ...
- Just tell us.

845
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:35,900
One night, he shut himself
and his little sister ...

846
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,300
that was not older than Rose,
in the bathroom of their home.

847
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,100
He cut her wrists and then ...

848
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,800
their own.

849
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,200
And only by some miracle,
They were found on time.

850
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,200
That never forgive myself.

851
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,902
And the church?

852
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,600
The church could do nothing?
No ghost exorcism?

853
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,956
She did not.

854
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,100
Daniel was suppressed.
He was not possessed.

855
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,100
The church has very specific definitions
for possession.

856
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,000
Certain criteria for Eviction
to take place.

857
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,000
Daniel did not meet these criteria ...

858
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,500
So he was left to the care
Father of Phineas and me.

859
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,300
And we failed.

860
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,600
What does this have to do with my son,
John?

861
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:37,800
I fear that the same demon success
wishes to obtain, such as Daniel ...

862
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,700
the same strategy to
for Tommy.

863
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Father Phineas and he
found an unwitting accomplice.

864
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,400
Open the door.
Rose.

865
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,800
Rose.

866
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,400
Honey.

867
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,000
What is it, honey?

868
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,900
It is good ...

869
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,700
It's OK ...

870
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:24,000
Brethren, I know that the last day,
in this camp have been difficult.

871
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:29,000
It is now clear that the Evil
his work is doing in our lives.

872
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,100
Tonight we will fight against him.

873
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,600
Tonight we will expel him.

874
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,100
Let us pray for one another.

875
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,000
Choose a brother and ask him
to pray for you.

876
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,300
Lord, banish Satan
the name of Jesus.

877
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,600
Dispel Satan in the name of Jesus.

878
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
Pray for me, Tommy.

879
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,300
Pray that I will be strong ...

880
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,500
let me holy.

881
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,800
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

882
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,500
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

883
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,600
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

884
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,344
No, stop.

885
01:24:17,444 --> 01:24:20,000
Tim, what is it?
- Make it stop. No, stop.

886
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,900
Timothy, what is it?
- God, what is that smell?

887
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,500
I saw the Devil, a demon ...
I do not know what I saw.

888
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,100
It was so real.

889
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
A prediction of the Lord.

890
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,600
Fear not my children,
for I am with you.

891
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,800
I make sure nothing happens to you.

892
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,700
I love you.

893
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,700
But evil has no ...

894
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,000
What happens?

895
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,700
Stop.
- I hate ...

896
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,200
you.

897
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,100
What was that?

898
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,684
What happened?

899
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,500
What happened?
- I do not know ...

900
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,100
Go to my room.

901
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,800
Now.

902
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,500
Calm down. I'll protect you.

903
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,300
Why did you not tell me?

904
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,000
Father, I lied.

905
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,500
You gave us all at risk.

906
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,700
You go with your sin,
without taking account of the Devil.

907
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:04,200
But he keeps in mind.
He does.

908
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,500
I wanted to hurt anyone.

909
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,200
I blame myself.
- Confession.

910
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,200
What happened to you
and Melissa in the woods?

911
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,400
You did not tell me the truth.
What happened?

912
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,900
Have you had sex with her?
- No, Father.

913
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,800
Tell me.

914
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,300
We gave each other an orgasm
with our clothes on. That's all.

915
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,600
That's it?

916
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,900
You accept a sin in your life.

917
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,900
You ...

918
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,700
devils spawn.

919
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
James teeth are broken.

920
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,100
Timothy is in his own feces.

921
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,100
Daniel is in a lunatic asylum.

922
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,500
And all those roads lead back to you.

923
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,600
Tell me now, when ...

924
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,500
If you had to sin
in your life?

925
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,700
Was it your grandfather?
- No.

926
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,300
He put the door?
- No, he was a good man.

927
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,300
He gave you to the devil.
- He loved me.

928
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,300
I love you.

929
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,000
Tommy, stop.
Calm down.

930
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,600
Where is Father?

931
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,300
Where ...

932
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,649
It must be so.

933
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,500
You promised to protect me.

934
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,600
Protect me.

935
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,100
Be my servant.

936
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,800
Tommy ...

937
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,800
Help me.

938
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,700
A sinner.

939
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,500
I do not want.

940
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,000
Enough.

941
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,600
Can you hear me?

942
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,400
Tommy?

943
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,300
You hear me, Tommy?

944
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,900
There you are.

945
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,400
Where?

946
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,700
Do not talk.

947
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,300
You're in the hospital.

948
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,300
You had a severe asthma attack ...

949
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,500
We were almost lost.

950
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,900
Where is Father Phineas?
- He is also here.

951
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,200
He had a stroke, he ...

952
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,400
How are you?

953
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,700
You got me scared.

954
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,000
You look good.

955
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,300
Father is here, I found it on
in the hall, he makes his rounds.

956
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,800
Would you thank him the blessing?
- Of course.

957
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,600
The body of Christ.

958
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,800
Tommy?

959
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,100
Tommy, get it, son.
- No.

960
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,200
Maybe I should ...
- No, Father.

961
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,400
Please.

962
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:21,200
Your son has been through a lot tonight.

963
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,400
Maybe it's better him alone
order.

964
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,300
It's okay.

965
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,300
I want to anymore, Mom.

966
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
If it is really the body of Christ ...

967
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,100
it is too much to suggest.

968
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
And if not,
it's all a big lie.

969
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,800
I can not believe Mom.

970
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,200
I can not and will not.

971
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,700
I can go to your school,
and I can follow your rules, but ...

972
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,800
You can not make me believe.

973
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,800
It's too terrible.

974
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,200
I need them redeemed.

975
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,300
My God ...

976
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,100
Enough.

977
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,000
Sweetheart ...

978
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,632
Enough.

979
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:08,000
We can not pull the plug.
God can heal him.

980
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,729
See you soon.

981
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,900
Based on a true story.
