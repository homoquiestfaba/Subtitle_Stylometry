00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,243
RECALL THE DOOR TO THE DEMON

3
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,166
There are two kinds of people on earth ...

4
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:41,586
those who believe in the spirit world ...

5
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:46,173
and those who do not.

6
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:52,678
The devil likes of both types.

7
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,517
SÃO MIGUEL

8
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,871
BLESSED DEATH

9
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:26,671
I've got something for you

10
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:29,131
tada!

11
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,592
I can't beleive we're doing this again

12
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:33,719
Come on, Sara, they're just cards, they're not going to bite you.

13
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:35,762
Come On.

14
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,430
OK. Good

15
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,809
OK. So the first card represents the past.

16
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:45,103
The tower

17
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:48,230
It looks like you had some stormy times recently.

18
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,857
You could say that.

19
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:52,067
Moving on to the present.

20
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,405
The Fool. Perfect.

21
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,072
That's the way I feel now.

22
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,616
No, this is a great card.

23
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,951
It represents new beginnings and exciting opportunities.

24
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,412
- I like that. - Alright.

25
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,455
But what about the future?

26
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,751
THE DEVIL

27
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,086
- My God- No no no no.

28
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:19,130
It is not "The Devil" is the god Dionysus.

29
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:22,508
He is the god of pleasure and abandon

30
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,552
It looks like we'll have a wild night ahead of us.

31
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,304
I've put all that behind me

32
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:31,056
Sara, the cards do not lie.

33
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,809
Your chariot awaits Ladies

34
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,311
Hey

35
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,189
Come On.

36
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,902
Nice wheels!

37
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,155
This'll put hair  on your tits

38
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,199
Joey, you know I do not drink anymore.

39
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,201
Some party this is going to be

40
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:57,619
Leave her alone.

41
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,371
What a nice car, Marcus.

42
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,956
I'm using the old hearse as a camera truck

43
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,457
It is one of the perks of the job

44
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,834
Do you really need all this equipment?

45
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,794
You want me to make you look beautiful, don't you?

46
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:09,795
You'd better

47
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,088
I will

48
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,260
We got together

49
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,012
Now and forever

50
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,473
You can not separate us If you try

51
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,308
The past behind us

52
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,060
Will remember

53
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,478
Why we fight to death

54
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:32,063
Until dead

55
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,983
To kick and knock down any wall

56
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,528
And we will be who will stand

57
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,739
We are one for all and all for one

58
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:47,325
And we will be who will stand

59
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:49,619
We are standing

60
00:06:00,958 --> 00:05:59,835
This is not my place

61
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:03,211
MORGUE - We thought it would be cool to film...

62
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:04,753
somewhere a little more edgy

63
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,548
- A morgue? - It's where I work.

64
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,674
It gives a nice tone for the film.

65
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,176
And it makes it a lot harder for you to fake anything.

66
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,178
Fine.

67
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,054
There should be plenty of spirits around here

68
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:19,723
And for the record, I never faked anything in my life.

69
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,900
Well you never had to with me

70
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:22,601
That's what you think.

71
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:57,753
Hold that. Thanks.

72
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,262
Hey, you want to help?

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,806
It's fine ...

74
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,266
Stop that.

75
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,981
You have a lot of security, for a bunch of corpses.

76
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,774
Keeps them fom escaping

77
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:27,108
What's the code?

78
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,277
Try 6-6-6.

79
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,486
You're kidding, right?

80
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,238
Mortician humour. Punch it in.

81
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,829
Welcome to the House of Death.

82
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,722
Where is everyone?

83
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:06,806
Dead.

84
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,850
- How funny. - Here was a hospital.

85
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,435
But the municipality constructed a new building at the end of the road ...

86
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:14,104
then just left over the morgue and funeral center.

87
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,898
- You're kidding, right? - I swear to God.

88
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,483
Why do not they close the place?

89
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,692
You know how much to die today?

90
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,110
It's a tremendous fortune.

91
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,987
We call this place the dump

92
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,572
We get al the unclaimed bodies...

93
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,324
junkies, homeless people, poor people; whoever.

94
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,826
This is where Marcus likes to do the creepy student movies

95
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,370
Staff's gone on weekends.

96
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,455
I can work and no one ever bothers me.

97
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,957
- Stop it, Marcus. - What it was?

98
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,625
Are you trying to look like a serial killer ...

99
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,001
but it is not working.

100
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,627
I'm just trying to get in the mood.

101
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:45,712
And he does not know why has no girlfriend.

102
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:47,797
Ok, Alright

103
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:50,800
Here we have the main entrance hall and the family waiting area

104
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,926
Come on, guys, get back on your mark

105
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:55,260
I put them for a reason. Come On!

106
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,762
- "Marks"? - Here no light.

107
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:57,888
I need you there, okay?

108
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,180
- That's right. - Yikes.

109
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,598
Here is good?

110
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:01,891
Right. They are ready?

111
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,268
How you feel? Because you' look fantastic. Ready?

112
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:06,353
Thank You.

113
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,980
We are here today with Eva Delgado ...

114
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,564
self-proclaimed Santeria priestess.

115
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,692
I never called myself a priestess.

116
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,485
What can you tell us about Santeria?

117
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,278
It is true that you practice animal sacrifice?

118
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,905
Marcus, give me the camera.

119
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,031
What, I'm the director. This equipment is my ...

120
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,283
- This camera is mine. - Have a camera does not make you director.

121
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:25,451
Kiss my ass

122
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,953
She can't Bro. She is a Christian crazy now.

123
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:31,540
She'll have to marry you first if there's
going to be any ass kissing

124
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,124
You're an A-hole.

125
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,335
A-hole? You can say that? This is not sin?

126
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,794
Not when it's true.

127
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,421
ooh! Vicious

128
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,339
Spicy Christian. Sure, zooms here. Come on, here.

129
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,590
Joey, do not tell me what to do.

130
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,135
Look, I'm giving you an opportunity to ...

131
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,010
a great documentary, okay?

132
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,097
You're giving me an opportunity to witness
more of your bullshit

133
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,515
Can you you get serious, porfavor?

134
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,892
I'm filming, say something smart, just once.

135
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,394
Okay.

136
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:01,772
We are here today because our friend, Eva ...

137
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,190
thinks she talks to ghosts.

138
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,818
I said "smart" Joey. "Smart"
Inteligente.

139
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,111
We are here today because our friend, Joey ...

140
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,613
afraid of things he does not understand.

141
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:12,990
Very scared.

142
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,033
Marcus is making his thesis documentary about me.

143
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,536
It's not about you. It's about our bet.

144
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,038
To prove that I am a real medium.

145
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,582
So our friend Joey here ...

146
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,208
will stop hassling me, once and for all

147
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,003
And what if you can't prove that you are for real?

148
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:34,591
As I promised, I dance on stage at all his shows next year.

149
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,052
In a bikini. - I never agreed to a bikini.

150
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,636
I'm just thinking of the fans.

151
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,556
This has just come into my head.

152
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:44,974
It was a sudden idea.

153
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:48,685
But if you're right, you do not have to worry about, right?

154
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,103
Right. Okay.

155
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:52,605
- Okay. - I agree with that ...

156
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,231
as long as you agree ...

157
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,941
that if I win, you'll quit your band ...

158
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,777
and join the church choir for one year.

159
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,904
I'd pay to see that.

160
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:14,242
Deal

161
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,874
This will be the best student film of all time

162
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:23,041
Come on let's go

163
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:38,429
Here we have the casket room where grieving families come ...

164
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,348
to select urns and caskets for their love ones

165
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:46,977
This is nice

166
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,771
Nice? This is a scam

167
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,481
You know how much they charge for a box like that?

168
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:52,982
$ 2,000.

169
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:56,193
On the low end, if you want mahogany, they are 15,000.

170
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,196
$ 15,000 for a box?

171
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,489
It's hard to say goodbye to family, Joey.

172
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:04,241
The burial ritual can be an important part of it.

173
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:07,035
They are not saying "goodbye" are saying "I'm sorry".

174
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,829
Are 15,000 ways to say "I'm sorry, Mom.

175
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,373
I'm sorry I left you in that shitty nursing home
to die alone

176
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,041
You always look on the bright side of things, Joey.

177
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,417
That's why we love you.

178
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,126
- Thanks. - You are welcome.

179
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,170
I think the caskets are beautiful.

180
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,254
Be damned coffins. Where are the bodies?

181
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,340
Downstairs, in the embalming room.

182
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,384
Embalming room? Now we're talking

183
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,717
Are we allowed down ther?

184
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,886
He is a security guard. We can go anywhere, right?

185
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:31,180
Sure. Let's go

186
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:33,765
Come On.

187
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,974
Or or or.

188
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:38,018
Do you ever see any ghosts up here?

189
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:40,020
No, but the basement is haunted.

190
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,522
Perfect. Eva will have many people to talk to.

191
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,112
Got it.

192
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,330
There's a weird energy here.

193
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,997
We're in a morgue.

194
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,290
Not serious.

195
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,334
They have bodies that have been here for years.

196
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,001
How old?

197
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,547
I do not know. They are stacked up like side of beef in a freezer.

198
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,214
Um freezer?

199
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,967
Yeah. Want to check it out?

200
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,343
Let's go.

201
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,394
After you.

202
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,781
I've never seen a dead body before

203
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,452
Why this plastic on his face?

204
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,202
Dry skin so fast that they need ...

205
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,247
fill Ios moisturizer and wrap with plastic.

206
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,999
He looks fake. Like he's made of wax or something.

207
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,501
When you're gone you're gone. Nothing left but the carcase

208
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,295
Do not touch the clients

209
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:08,963
You almost scared me to death, Marcus.

210
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,590
Sorry, but we have rules here.

211
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,799
These things are covered in bacteria.

212
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:14,885
Thank You.

213
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,686
Okay, here we are.

214
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:30,856
Welcome to the embalming room, where they drain your blood ...

215
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,815
and pump you full of preservatives.

216
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:35,026
- It's cold here. - Yeah

217
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,444
Joey, do not do that.

218
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,491
My God.

219
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:52,746
Nice tits

220
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,499
I do not believe you dated him.

221
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,419
- It was the first year. - My God.

222
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,045
We all make mistakes

223
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,131
It's my animal magnetism. She could not help.

224
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,383
Of course, Joey, you were impossible to resist.

225
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,094
She still wants me.

226
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,511
I'll talk to her about it.

227
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,097
Dude, what's that, a sword?

228
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,018
It's a trocar, do not touch it.

229
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:22,895
They use to pierce the organs and drain fluids from the body.

230
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:24,855
That's disgusting.

231
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,316
So, boys, where are we doing the seance?

232
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:30,108
How about if we set up in the casket room?

233
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay for you?

234
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:32,986
The lighting is better.

235
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,071
For me, no matter.

236
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,989
At least not have bodies up there.

237
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,332
FORMOL

238
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,145
These caskets really are beautiful

239
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,274
I understand why people pay so much to make their
loved ones look good

240
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,818
Me. When I'm gone I'm going to get burned

241
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,695
Nobody looks good dead

242
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,488
I just want a simple service

243
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,739
Simple but elegant, classic.

244
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,782
Not me

245
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,784
I want a giant pyramid, for my fans go idolize me.

246
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:38,745
They can send me messages and I can answer your prayers and such.

247
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:39,913
Of course you are

248
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:41,497
And will your music be on a loop?

249
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:42,832
For all eternity.

250
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:45,126
- I hope I'm dead by then. - Hey, that's harsh, right?

251
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:48,420
What's the one good song that Joey sings.

252
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,380
Oh, That's right, they all suck!

253
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,008
You are so out of my fan club.

254
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,677
Marcus, where's the bathroom?

255
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,679
The only one that is open, it is down stairs...

256
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,888
third door on the left, near the freezer.

257
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,599
- But take the camera. -  So you post me going to the bathroom?

258
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,017
- I don't think so. - You can turn ...

259
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,102
when in the bathroom, but we have to ...

260
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,728
document everything we do, right?

261
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:13,647
Ok

262
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:18,943
You need to work on your game, Marcus.

263
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,112
I liked it.

264
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,656
Smooth. Very smooth.

265
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:31,954
I'm Sarah and I'm going to the bathroom.

266
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,747
For some reason, Marcus think this is essential viewing.

267
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:36,499
What is this?

268
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,545
Gross!

269
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,856
- Babies. BABIES IN BOTTOM SHELF

270
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,399
My God!

271
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,235
Oh no.

272
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:18,947
Open the door!

273
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,283
Let me out of here!

274
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,285
Let me out! This is not funny!

275
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:25,703
Let me out!

276
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,873
Please.

277
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,749
Please, let me out of here!

278
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,252
There's something here!

279
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,838
There's something here with me! Please let me out!

280
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,340
It's not funny!

281
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,551
My God!

282
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,094
You should see your face!

283
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:50,681
- What? - This goes straight to my website.

284
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,767
- Was you? - It was perfect.

285
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:08,194
Wow, you know what? Good for you, I saw it coming ...

286
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:09,946
but I did not believe it.

287
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:16,868
You forgive me?

288
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,911
Go to hell

289
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,370
That's not very Christian.

290
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,330
I am old school. I don't turn the other cheek

291
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,706
You are an old-school psycho.

292
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,166
Hey! Stop that! Sara, stop it!

293
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,417
No. No!

294
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:27,877
She attacked me!

295
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,712
You know, you have no sense of humor.

296
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,130
- He locked me in the freezer. - What?

297
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,466
- It was a joke! - That's not funny!

298
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,966
You're an asshole, Joey.

299
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,010
You peel back a Christian, you always get a little crazy.

300
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,136
No. You need to apologize now, Joey.

301
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,889
I'm sorry

302
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:46,599
I'm sorry you lost your sense of humor.

303
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,559
What is your problem?

304
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,396
You, Eva.

305
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:56,774
- Me? - You and your mystical bullshit.

306
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,818
Sara and her crazy Christian cult

307
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,695
You are my problems.

308
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:04,154
Look, there is no God

309
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,156
There is no afterlife

310
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,074
There are no benevolent guiding spirits.

311
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,243
This is the drug that bosses feed the masses ...

312
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,787
to keep us confused and ignorant!

313
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:15,914
To distract us from the fact that 1% of the population ...

314
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,958
It is controlling 95% of the world's resources.

315
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,375
Here we go again.

316
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:25,504
Religion is the drug that ruined the world, no matter what.

317
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,089
Christianity.

318
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:30,341
Do you really think Jesus Christ is the only way to get to heaven?

319
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:33,511
And the poor kid in the Amazon that's never
heard of Jesus Christ?

320
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:37,347
Is he going to spend all  eternity burning in a firey pit of hell?

321
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,141
Does that sound like justice to you?

322
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:41,392
I don't  think so, and if ...

323
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:44,562
if that's what God thinks justice is, then God's an asshole.

324
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:47,271
That's enough, Joey.

325
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,648
What about the Muslims, then?

326
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:54,026
You blow yourself up. Kill a bunch of innocent men,
women and kids

327
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,236
And then, guess what.

328
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,865
He gets to spend all eternity with 72 horny virgins.

329
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:02,033
Does that make sense to anybody, except a psycho?

330
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,243
-You finished? - No, I'm not finished

331
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:08,037
This is the only life we've got. It;s right here, right now.

332
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,956
There is no heaven and no hell.

333
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:13,917
People are asleep at the wheel, and I'm going
to wake them the fuck up

334
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,378
It's a great speech, Joey, but you're wrong.

335
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:20,088
There are spirits trapped in this world.

336
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:22,591
Even you can not be arrogant enough to believe that ...

337
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,301
humans are the center of the universe.

338
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:27,178
No no no. Not humans, Me.

339
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,597
I am the center of my universe.

340
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,973
And I will prove to you ...

341
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:36,476
That you and all your religious mumbo-jumbo is full of shit

342
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,895
- We will see. - Yeah, we will

343
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:44,106
You know what? I do not want to talk about it.

344
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:53,238
Hey, it's okay, it is over.

345
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,783
Joey knows exactly how to piss me off

346
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,118
I feel like an idiot.

347
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,037
Joey can be an asshole. You know it.

348
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,205
Come on, ignore it. That's what I do.

349
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,918
To be honest, this whole seance thing is really freaking me out

350
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,002
It's no big deal

351
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:13,547
It's like picking up the phone and calling grandma

352
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:16,925
The only difference is ... she's passed on.

353
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,887
The Bible warns us not to commune with the spirits.

354
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:26,014
It also warns you not to eat shellfish

355
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:28,934
Come On.

356
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,935
I will not let anything bad happen to you.

357
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,561
I promise.

358
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,606
Let's get this over with.

359
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:51,910
Sara, Joey would like to tell you something.

360
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,285
Isn't that right, Joey?

361
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:01,124
Sara, I'm sorry about the freezer.

362
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:02,584
I did not mean to scare you.

363
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:07,713
OK, I did mean to scare you, but I didn't mean to freak you out.

364
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:09,839
Don't worry about it

365
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:13,718
Would it help if I gave you free tickets to my next show?

366
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,806
- Not really- Hey guys, my mikes are a little...

367
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:21,307
"prosumer-ingus", so keep your voices up, alright?

368
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,767
English, Marcus, we speak English here.

369
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,894
Don't touch the rum.

370
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,478
It is for the spirits.

371
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:31,232
When are you going to put on your sexy voodoo robe?

372
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,442
Santeria is not voodoo, retard.

373
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,236
Whatever. Are you going to get naked?

374
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:37,820
This is serious, Joey.

375
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,280
I'm all business, baby

376
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,199
What do we do next

377
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,536
Okay, before we get started, I need to lay out
some ground rules.

378
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,954
You do not need to believe in spirits ...

379
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,206
but I need you to be open to the possibility.

380
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,249
You have to set aside your prejudices.

381
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:56,001
Even you, Joey, otherwise we will not see anything.

382
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,795
Oh, your getting your excuses out early. I like that.

383
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:01,046
Are you finished?

384
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:04,841
OK, I promise. I promise that I will take seriously.

385
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,051
Good.

386
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,137
Iastly: Once we open the door to the spirit world ...

387
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:13,432
we can not break the circle until the door is closed.

388
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:14,724
OK?

389
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:22,980
Marcus, I think we're ready.

390
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:48,833
Guardians of the East, I call upon you to watch over our rights.

391
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,335
Powers of knowledge and wisdom, guided by air ...

392
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,963
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

393
00:24:55,423 --> 00:25:00,342
Guardians of the South, I call upon you to watch
over our rights.

394
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,888
Powers of energy and will guided by fire ...

395
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,849
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

396
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:15,438
Guardians of the West, I call upon you to watch over our rights.

397
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:19,107
Powers of passion and emotion, guided by water ...

398
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:22,776
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

399
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:29,616
Guardians of the North, I call upon you to
watch over our rights.

400
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:33,868
Powers of endurance and strength, guided by earth ...

401
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:37,705
we ask that you keep watch over us tonight within this circle.

402
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,541
Let all those who enter the circle ...

403
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,586
do so in perfect love ... and perfect trust.

404
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,893
Close your eyes and bow your heads

405
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,647
Beloved Grandmother Maria ...

406
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,857
we bring you gifts from life into death.

407
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,818
Commune with us, Grandma, and move among us.

408
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:25,660
Beloved Grandmother Maria ...

409
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:28,411
we bring you gifts from life into death.

410
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,497
Commune with us, Grandma, and move among us.

411
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,876
There's something wrong.

412
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:41,337
What?

413
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,381
I can't do this.

414
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:47,217
You can not make the fucking magic happen in a morgue?
Come on

415
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,510
There's has a power here, a darkness.

416
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,636
How do you spell bullshit?

417
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:51,929
You're just trying to get out of our bet.

418
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,138
That's not it.

419
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:55,473
We are surrounded by bodies, the whole building ...

420
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:56,724
and you can not make your magic happen.

421
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:59,309
- Just admit thatyour full of shit. - Joey!

422
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,687
I usually get images in my head before my grandmother
comes to me

423
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,022
Faces or names. This is just dark.
All I see is darkness

424
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,440
That's fine

425
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,484
Just admit that you can't see through the dark mist ...

426
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:10,652
and let's go.

427
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:11,985
What?

428
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:14,905
- Nothing. - What did you say?

429
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:17,532
- Nothing. - I never said "dark mist".

430
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:19,617
Oh my God. You can see it too.

431
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:21,536
Stop it!  - That's why you're so afraid.

432
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:23,120
Of course, I should have known.

433
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:24,955
It's so obvious.

434
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:26,748
You are a chaneller

435
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:30,000
You see spirits, right? Hear Voices?

436
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,627
- Fuck you! - No - Don't, don't

437
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:32,752
Don't break the circle, Joey.

438
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:36,922
I think the darkness is drawn to your negative energy.

439
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,173
All your anger is acting as a beacon.

440
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,426
- We ned to close the door. - Whatever.

441
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,760
If you can't call up the dead, I win the bet.

442
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,595
I'm headlining the club this weekend.

443
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:46,847
Don't forget to to bring  your bikini.

444
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:48,265
No!

445
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,393
My God!

446
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,854
- Shit! Eva.
- Eva!

447
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,230
Eva! Can you hear me?

448
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,399
Eva.... Eva

449
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:10,824
Up, up.

450
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:15,035
I told you not break the circle.

451
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,495
You're bleeding.

452
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:20,372
Are you OK?

453
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:22,999
I think so.

454
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,169
You're the one I'm worried about.

455
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:27,795
What you mean?

456
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,589
Joey, can't hide from the truth.

457
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:32,924
We need to talk about what happened.

458
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,427
I'll tell you what happened.

459
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,804
You fell down and you passed out. I do it every weekend.

460
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:42,182
This does not change anything!

461
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,604
Are you OK?

462
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:02,739
Joey.

463
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,033
Joey!

464
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,327
What the fuck... Joey!

465
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:28,550
What the fuck

466
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,637
Joey!

467
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,013
Joey.

468
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,059
Dude, do you see dead people?

469
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:40,352
Joey.

470
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,567
Dude, that is some nasty shit

471
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,112
I did the joints in embalming fluid.

472
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:57,572
- Maybe that has something to do with it. - You did what?

473
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:00,617
You say the gang kids do it all the time.

474
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,826
I told you it causes brain damage, you moron.

475
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,244
What the fuck are you doing?

476
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:05,245
Nothing.

477
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:07,664
- Jesus you've got blood running  down... - I said it's nothing.

478
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,376
Jesus man, I knew you'd cut up when we were kids, but ...

479
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:13,794
Shut up!

480
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,046
I do not want to talk about it.

481
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,590
When did you start cutting again, man?

482
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:25,387
This is the first time since my parents ...

483
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:27,846
What? When they sent you to rehab?

484
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,309
It wasn't a rehab clinic, Marcus.

485
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,103
What do you mean?

486
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:37,437
It was...

487
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:39,438
They sent me to a nut-house.

488
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:41,065
What?

489
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:43,651
It was a fucking loony bin.

490
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,903
Look, the doctors, they ...

491
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:50,781
They filled me with all this antipsychotic medicine...

492
00:30:52,783 --> 00:30:54,493
until I couldn't hear them any more.

493
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,116
Hear who?

494
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:01,578
The voices that are in my head.

495
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:05,999
- Why didn't you tell me this? - Because I didn't want you to think ...

496
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,958
- I'm a freak. - I wouldn't think you're a freak, man.

497
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,668
I am cured okay? I am cured.

498
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,545
It was a miracle of modern medicine.

499
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:14,005
Sure, the drugs... they worked. Okay?

500
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,133
I haven't seen or heard shit since.

501
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,763
I told myself that I imagined the whole thing, you know?

502
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:29,141
I thought I was cured.

503
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,156
Are you OK?

504
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,491
I felt it

505
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,410
Like something cold was trying to crawl inside me

506
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,412
It's over now.

507
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:56,913
We should go.

508
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,040
No. You don't understand.

509
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,501
Joey left the door open.

510
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:06,421
He is a natural channel, but he has no control, no training.

511
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,714
We have to close the door.

512
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:16,178
I've never judged what you do, Eve, but this is scaring me.

513
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,429
Maybe it's wrong.

514
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:28,647
What?

515
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:31,983
Are you going to put down that joint so we can
talk about what happened?

516
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,319
-I don't think so. - Joey, you need to talk to me ...

517
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,570
about your gift.

518
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:40,571
It is ready to go again?

519
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:43,032
Or are you going to admit to everybody that you're a fake
so we can get out of here?

520
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,701
I'm not faking it, Joey.

521
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,076
You know the gift is real.

522
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:48,620
You know it, because you've got the gift too

523
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,289
I'm not a freak, alright?

524
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:51,914
"A freak"? Is that what you think I?

525
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:53,416
Do not put words in my mouth, Eva.

526
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,584
- It is OK to be scared. - I'm not fucking scared!

527
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,211
Yes you are. You are terrified. But that's OK

528
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,547
- I can help you. - I do not want your help.

529
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,673
You can't just run away from this Joey

530
00:33:03,673 --> 00:33:05,216
You need to talk to me.

531
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,302
You know what your problem is, Eve?

532
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,927
You do not know when shut your Goddamn mouth.

533
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:10,929
- Joey. - Do you know why they burn witches?

534
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,014
It was the only way to make them shut up.

535
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:16,267
They drowned them too. That's how my grandmother died.

536
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:19,561
Killed by a bunch of ignorant ass-holes, just like you.

537
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,896
I should have known it ran in the family. Do you know what?

538
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:25,982
There's only one letter between witch and bitch.
And you're both, girl

539
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:27,692
- Joey, stop it! - It's fine.

540
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,068
I've got this.

541
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,487
- Okay. - Want a personal experience?

542
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:34,239
You want real proof?

543
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,034
- I'll give you proof. - Wait, you think that's a good idea?

544
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,579
I'll be fine, as long as no one breaks the connection.

545
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,622
Joey, you do not have to do this, man.

546
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:47,832
Bring it!

547
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,625
- Joey, this is not a good idea. - Sit down!

548
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,294
Let's go, Right now! I'm going to win your award, Marcus.

549
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:54,713
Fuck it. We're rolling

550
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:08,223
Close your eyes and bow your heads.

551
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:14,353
Spirit, we bring you gifts of life into death.

552
00:34:14,437 --> 00:34:16,981
Commune with us and move among us.

553
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:21,609
Hello.

554
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:24,861

556
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:31,909
- What is happening? - Do not break the circle.

557
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,368
That does not prove anything!

558
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:34,911
What's your name?

559
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,540

Lord, protect us. Lord, protect us.

568
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,195

My God!

574
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,289
What do you want to do , Joey?

575
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,959
I want to hear it speak

576
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:18,878
- Eva, make it stop! - Joey, call it off!

577
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,506
Joey, let me know when you've seen enough.

578
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,633
- Joey!
- Stop it, Joey!

579
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:25,633
Joey!

580
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,515
Joey?

[speaks foreign language]

582
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,169
Joey, what the fuck, man?

583
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:38,546
[speaks foreign language]

584
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:47,632
Stop!       Joey!

585
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,178
Joey, get off me!

586
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,210
Where were we?

587
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:44,967
Come on. Go, Go, Go

588
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:50,012
- What was that? - We gotta get out of here!

589
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:00,019
- Is not working! - Do it again!

590
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,231
It is broken!

591
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:05,315
Come On. Come On!

592
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:16,574
No no. Do Not!

593
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:19,369
It is not working.

594
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,871
It is not working.

595
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:26,623
My phone's dead. Shit!

596
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,375
Sara.

597
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,877
- Wer'e trapped! - Sara.

598
00:38:32,211 --> 00:38:33,796
Sara, stop it!

599
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,674
You said it was safe, Eva. That no one would get hurt!

600
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:39,217
I know. But when Joey touched the eye ...

601
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,677
Marcus is dead!

602
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:42,219
He's dead and he's never coming back.

603
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,721
No! Fuck!

604
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,140
What happened to Joey?

605
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,932
I do not know.

606
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,768
But, somehow, we ihave summoned a malicious spirit.

607
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,352
A malicious spirit.

608
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,981
You mean a demon.

609
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:02,736
Look, whatever it is, it's powerful.

610
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:05,821
It's possessed Joey and trapped us in the building.

611
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,364
We have to find out what it wants.

612
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:10,741
You want to talk to it?

613
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:13,160
We have to help Io to pass to the next dimension.

614
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,828
You're crazy, you know? You lost your mind!

615
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,164
It is the only way to save Joey.

616
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:20,124
Joey 's gone, Eva.

617
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,293
That thing, that monster down there killed Marcus ...

618
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:25,170
and you want to go back there and talk to it?

619
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,671
I'm sorry, but I will not. I can not.

620
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:29,465
We have no choice.

621
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:31,215
When I knocked Joey unconscious ...

622
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,217
I trapped the spirit inside his body.

623
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:38,554
He's going to come around/ and when he does
it is not going to be prety

624
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,931
Please, Sara.

625
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:42,891
I need your help.

626
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:09,755
Fuck!

627
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:13,800
Hey!

628
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:18,095
Marcus!

629
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,268
Marcus, get me out of here!

630
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,858
What the fuck, Guys?

631
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:37,943
Why am I on the ground, Eva?

632
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:40,904
Joey, is that you?

633
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:42,865
No, it's the Easter Bunny!

634
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,415
Help me up.

635
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,960
- Are you going to untie me or what? - We can't.

636
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:49,210
Not yet.

637
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:52,589
- What do you mean you can't? - We have to make sure ...

638
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:53,965
that you're not going to attack us again.

639
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:54,965
What?

640
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:56,300
Where's Marcus?

641
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,886
- You don't remember? - Remember what?

642
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:02,180
Marcus get in here, I'm going to kick your ass!

643
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:06,265
- It sounds like Joey. - Of course it sounds like Joey!

644
00:43:06,265 --> 00:43:07,808
I'm sitting here on the floor aren't I?

645
00:43:07,808 --> 00:43:10,060
It's me. Joey Polito

646
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,187
The spirit can still be hiding inside.

647
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:13,563
Spirit?

648
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,523
Okay, let's go back

649
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:17,775
Does somebody want to tell me what's going on?

650
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:28,783
What's the Iast thing you remember, Joey?

651
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,246
I do not know. Look, my head's killing me right now, alright?

652
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,290
Answer the damn question, Joey.

653
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:45,587
We were using the spiritual board ...

654
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:50,132
and Eve did some trick with the eye.

655
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,302
I do not know, it all goes blurry, I don't know

656
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:56,471
You do not remember because you were possessed, Joey.

657
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,140
What the hell are you talking about?

658
00:43:59,557 --> 00:44:02,226
You were possessed by an evil spirit.

659
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,519
A demon.

660
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,020
A demon?

661
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:13,527
Do you guys have any idea how crazy you sound?

662
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,904
I need to talk to the spirit inside your head, Joey.

663
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:19,864
You have to let me hypnotise you

664
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:22,075
So I can bark like a dog every single time you whistle?

665
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:23,325
I don't think so

666
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:24,785
You have to let her do it.

667
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,078
Where's Marcus?

668
00:44:26,078 --> 00:44:28,871
Hypnosis does not work unless you give permission.

669
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:31,999
Pleae, Joey. We do not know what else to do.

670
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,708
You have to let Eva hynotise you.

671
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,794
Fuck! Where's Marcus?

672
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,421
He is dead.

673
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:43,174
What?

674
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:48,345
Okay, okay, this is a joke, right?

675
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,054
That's joke. You guys are all in on a joke, right

676
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,013
You got me.

677
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:54,267
I get it. You're all going to teach me a lesson for all the bullshit that...
Okay, fine

678
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:55,600
I've learned my lesson. Okay?

679
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,185
Untie me now. Enough is enough.

680
00:44:57,185 --> 00:44:58,937
This isn't a joke, Joey.

681
00:44:59,937 --> 00:45:00,980
Bullshit!

682
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:02,981
Where's Marcus?

683
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,190
Marcus?

684
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:06,400
Marcus?

685
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:09,861
Where is he, dammit?

686
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:28,710
What the hell is going on, Sara?

687
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,804
Sara, come on

688
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,389
Come on. Untie me, please.

689
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:46,974
Please.

690
00:45:47,974 --> 00:45:49,434
Stay away from me.

691
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:54,896
What is that?

692
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:00,900
Marcus?

693
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:04,612
My God, Marcus. What is this? What happened?

694
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,156
- You attacked us. - Bullshit!

695
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:09,616
Marcus tried to stop you and you broke his neck.

696
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:14,369
Do Not! Marcus is my best friend! I would never do that!

697
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:15,746
We saw you, Joey.

698
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:18,539
We saw you break Marcus's neck

699
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,918
We have no reason to lie to you.

700
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,588
My God, You're serious

701
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,464
You are serious?

702
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:29,715
Joey...

703
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:34,385
Look, I know you would never do anything to hurt us.

704
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:35,887
But when you touched the eye of Isis ...

705
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:38,014
you allowed the spirit to enter your body.

706
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,057
So you're saying that this spirit or whatever ...

707
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:44,727
It's inside of me?

708
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:47,771
Yes

709
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,912
Well then get it the fuck out of me

710
00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:53,289
Ok then you have to let me hypnotise you

711
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:55,833
Yeah, whatever. Let's get it done.

712
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,835
Okay ... good.

713
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:01,921
But can't do it here. It's not safe.

714
00:47:05,508 --> 00:47:06,592
Come On.

715
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:21,937
What are you doing?

716
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:24,939
It is a bonding spell that my grandmother taught me.

717
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,484
Is this really necessary?

718
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,569
It's for our protection.

719
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:33,613
And yours.

720
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:36,698
Okay.

721
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:42,786
Are you ready?

722
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,413
I want you to stare ...

723
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:48,999
to this spot on my forehead, right here.

724
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:52,710
The more you focus on this spot ...

725
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:55,630
the more you feel your body relaxing.

726
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,549
You will notice that the sound of my voice ...

727
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:01,592
becomes more relaxing.

728
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:09,766
Now as you relax

729
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:12,726
you are going to go even twice as deep.

730
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:17,438
And you' are going to hear every word I say.

731
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,941
Five, four ...

732
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:25,570
three ... even deeper ...

733
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,906
two ... and one.

734
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,204
Now, you are completely asleep.

735
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:40,998
Can you hear me, Joey?

736
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:45,877
Tell me your name.

737
00:48:49,547 --> 00:48:51,423
Joseph James Polito.

738
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:53,425
Good.

739
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:59,095
Your soul is your spirit and your body is your vessel.

740
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,182
Is there anyone else inside your body?

741
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:07,768
Yes

742
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:11,438
Do you know his name?

743
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:15,024
No, he won't tell me.

744
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:17,318
Is he your friend?

745
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:20,778
No

746
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:23,114
Do you want hime to leave your body?

747
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,576
- Yes - Okay.

748
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:28,994
It's okay.

749
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:34,123
I'm talking now to the spirit entity inside Joey's body.

750
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:35,957
You too are subject to my hypnosis ...

751
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:38,168
so you must answer my questions.

752
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,465
Can I talk to the spirit entity inside Joey's body?

753
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,093
You can not hypnotize me, little girl.

754
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,723
What's your name?

755
00:49:57,933 --> 00:50:02,145
Names have power, Eva Delgado ...

756
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:06,732
you should know that.

757
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,816
My God!

758
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:13,403
And God will not help you, Sara.

759
00:50:14,362 --> 00:50:15,988
Not after what you did.

760
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:18,865
What did you say?

761
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:24,203
You were not always a good little girl.

762
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:26,038
Were you Sara?

763
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,832
We know your little secret.

764
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:30,249
Do not listen to him, Sara.

765
00:50:30,249 --> 00:50:31,709
He's just messing with you.

766
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,211
What do you want with Joey?

767
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:35,920
I want his body.

768
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:37,880
You are not welcome here.

769
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,216
You must leave him.

770
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,510
I think not.

771
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:48,138
I've been looking for a suitable vessel ... ...

772
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:50,015
for over two hundred years.

773
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:54,644
This body is so strong and so young.

774
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,814
I think I'll stay until he's all used up

775
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:02,024
I will not allow that.

776
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,443
You won't allow it?

777
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,240
Who do you think You Are?

778
00:51:14,325 --> 00:51:15,868
How is my friend, Marcus?

779
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,329
He is with Jesus, asshole.

780
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:21,748
He's not with...Jesus.

781
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:23,999
He is with us.

782
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,127
I do not believe you.

783
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:31,588
If Marcus is in hell, you should know everything about him
, right?

784
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,132
Of course.

785
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:36,175
What's his brother's name?

786
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:48,518
Run! Get out of here now!

787
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:54,106
Joey?

788
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,573
He's still alive.

789
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:10,201
Outside.

790
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:15,163
Eve, where are you going?

791
00:52:15,873 --> 00:52:16,874
Eva?

792
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,209
Joey tried to save us. You can't jst walk away.

793
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:21,752
I am not trained for this.

794
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:23,296
You better figure it out.

795
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:25,839
I have no idea what I'm doing.

796
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,216
I've never dealt with someone who was possessed.

797
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,175
We need a priest.

798
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,468
A priest?

799
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:34,847
We can not leave the building, how do we find a priest?

800
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:37,097
It's on you, Eva.

801
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:40,058
You summoned that demon into Joey and
you've got to drive it out

802
00:52:41,268 --> 00:52:42,518
I can not.

803
00:52:42,518 --> 00:52:44,770
- I might make it worse. - How? How could it be worse?

804
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,147
I might kill him!

805
00:52:46,522 --> 00:52:48,565
Joey is dying, Eva.

806
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:50,108
He's dying.

807
00:52:50,108 --> 00:52:51,401
You have to try something.

808
00:52:54,236 --> 00:52:55,237
Please.

809
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,905
Okay. Okay.

810
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:03,869
There are specific prayers... incantations

811
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:07,664
If I had a prayer book, I could try.

812
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:10,041
Come On.

813
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:26,218
What are we looking for?

814
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,264
We need the King James Bible.

815
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,182
Sara, I'm not Christian.

816
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:34,893
When are you going to get it, Eva?

817
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:37,394
This is not some damn poltergeist we're dealing with ...

818
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:38,562
This is a demon.

819
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:40,481
Okay, you summoned a demon.

820
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,732
This is God versus the devil.

821
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:47,277
Good versus evil. You cant mess around

822
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:52,031
If you want Joey to survive this, you need the Bible.

823
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,409
Okay.

824
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:10,045
From what I remember ...

825
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,255
we need to make the demon so uncomfortable ...

826
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:15,256
that he choose to leave the physical flesh ...

827
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:17,384
rather than stay and endure the pain.

828
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,302
How do we do that?

829
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,806
Prayers, a cross and holy water.

830
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,265
Demons hate all three.

831
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,183
Okay

832
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:30,977
We have rosaries, we have prayer books.

833
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,278
We've got holy water.

834
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:46,323
We just need something to hold it.

835
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:51,619
Ive got just the thing. Here.

836
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,169
Okay ...

837
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:05,170
that's everythingl.

838
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,714
Are you ready?

839
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:11,175
Yeah. You?

840
00:55:13,803 --> 00:55:15,470
What if we are not strong enough?

841
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,974
Then we pray for help.

842
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:24,812
Look at this:

843
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:31,942
"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
the power of his might

844
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,404
Put on the whole armor of God ...

845
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,948
that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. "

846
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:43,075
The armor of God.

847
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:49,163
This is not a prayer, Eva, this is a call to battle.

848
00:55:50,331 --> 00:55:51,916
This is going to be a fight

849
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,585
But it's a fight we can win

850
00:55:55,127 --> 00:55:57,629
if you put all your faith in God.

851
00:55:59,796 --> 00:56:04,383
Sara, my grandmother was killed by the Catholic Church.

852
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:07,636
I'm doing my best here.

853
00:56:09,305 --> 00:56:11,347
I have something for you downstairs.

854
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,142
Come on.

855
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:34,991
There it is.

856
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,459
Sara, that was your mother's.

857
00:56:47,959 --> 00:56:49,877
She would have wanted you to have it

858
00:57:00,802 --> 00:57:02,012
Thank You.

859
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,435
That's weird.

860
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:26,238
What is it?

861
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,199
Holy water was right there.

862
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,461
What 's wrong?

863
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,839
Nothing.

864
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,943
My God! My hand!

865
00:58:15,276 --> 00:58:16,568
My God!

866
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,780
Let me look at it! Let me look at it! - No no!

867
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,198
Eva, I'll have to pull it out.

868
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,408
- No, please! - These scalpels are infected.

869
00:58:24,408 --> 00:58:26,119
We have to pull it out.

870
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,702
- Okay. - On three.

871
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,915
One two three.

872
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:40,880
We have to stop the bleeding!

873
00:58:44,882 --> 00:58:46,092
Help me!

874
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:49,511
There's no disinfectant! - My God!

875
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:52,556
My God!

876
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:56,892
My God, help me! Please!

877
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:58,644
We ... We've got bleach.

878
00:58:58,769 --> 00:58:59,894
That will have to do

879
00:59:01,312 --> 00:59:02,272
Here.

880
00:59:18,742 --> 00:59:21,120
My God! The scalpel was disgusting.

881
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:23,997
I can't even count how many infections I have.

882
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,707
The bleach will take care of most of it.

883
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,292
At least the bleeding stopped.

884
00:59:30,042 --> 00:59:31,210
Yeah

885
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,837
How do you feel?

886
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:35,505
Angry.

887
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,549
Good.

888
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:47,348
I think this verse has got your name all over it.

889
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:58,628
Yea,  though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...

890
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,548
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me ...

891
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:05,259
Thy staff and Thy rod they comfort me.

892
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:07,677
My favorite psalm.

893
01:00:07,677 --> 01:00:11,346
Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies ...

894
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:15,308
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

895
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,686
Your cup is empty, Eva.

896
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:21,604
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me ...

897
01:00:21,604 --> 01:00:22,896
every days of my life ...

898
01:00:22,896 --> 01:00:26,108
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

899
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:29,569
You have to believe for the words to have power, Eva.

900
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:30,570
Burn it.

901
01:00:41,494 --> 01:00:45,289
Lord, stretch out your hand and look down on Joey.

902
01:00:45,289 --> 01:00:46,665
Silence, witch.

903
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:49,126
God will not listen to your words.

904
01:00:49,126 --> 01:00:50,710
You're not welcome here, demon!

905
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,087
It's time for you to move on!

906
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:56,589
Do not presume to tell me what to do, child!

907
01:00:56,589 --> 01:01:00,634
I exorcise thee in the name of God, the Father Almighty ...

908
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:04,137
and in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord and judge.

909
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:06,930
And in the power of the Holy Spirit ...

910
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,932
that thou depart from this creature of God ...

911
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,559
- Joseph Polito. - Amen!

912
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,561
God will not forgive you for what you've done, Sara.

913
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:15,855
You know I'm telling you the truth.

914
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,188
Keep going

915
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:22,110
We make this plea, devil, for your expulsion.

916
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,945
We make this plea, devil, for your destruction

917
01:01:27,947 --> 01:01:31,533
You have no idea what you're doing, do you?

918
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:35,870
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

919
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,829
Amen.

920
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:39,956
Your words have no power over me, Eva.

921
01:01:40,373 --> 01:01:43,043
I used to fuck your grandmother in hell.

922
01:01:45,753 --> 01:01:50,465
St. Michael the Archangel, we ask you to defend us
in this battle ...

923
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:52,258
against this world of evil.

924
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,636
The Holy Church venerates you as her true guardian
and protector.

925
01:01:57,636 --> 01:02:00,848
The Holy Church burns witches like you, Eva.

926
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:02,807
Exodus 22:18..

927
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:06,227
Thou shall not suffer a witch to live!

928
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:09,897
Come back to us, Eve. You belong with us.

929
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,190
I'll make you a queen.

930
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:15,818
I used to rule for a thousand years before the Christian God.

931
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:20,280
And with you by my side, Eva, we will rule again.

932
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,865
Come back to me.

933
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,994
I'd rather die.

934
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,913
Your might get your wish

935
01:02:34,207 --> 01:02:35,958
Eva, come on, this is not working.

936
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:38,169
Don't leave, Eva.

937
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:40,337
Don't leave, Eva.

938
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,214
Come on, Eva.

939
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:46,633
We have to try something else.

940
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:48,885
Like what?

941
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:52,054
Like the power of Christ.

942
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:54,556
My God.

943
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:55,682
Whats happening?

944
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,016
It's the demon!

945
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,728
Oh no! Eva, get the door!

946
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:01,728
Okay.

947
01:03:06,607 --> 01:03:09,109
My God! Sara! Sara!

948
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:32,877
My God!

949
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:34,670
My God, Sara!

950
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:36,421
Okay ...

951
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:38,173
You have to straighten the bone

952
01:03:38,173 --> 01:03:39,258
What?

953
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:42,677
Take my foot, twist and pull it straight.

954
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,346
Sara, I don't know ... - Once it's straight ...

955
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:48,056
wrap it tight, use the gauze.

956
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:50,558
And find something to make a splint.

957
01:03:51,267 --> 01:03:52,643
Hurry

958
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:54,144
Okay.

959
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,860
- It will work. - Okay

960
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:07,029
Okay

961
01:04:07,821 --> 01:04:08,863
Now what?

962
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:14,243
Okay

963
01:04:14,535 --> 01:04:18,705
If I pass out you have to keep going until you
get the splint on, okay?

964
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:20,664
Promise me?

965
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,874
I promise.

966
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,292
Okay.

967
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,044
Put your left hand under my heel.

968
01:04:27,503 --> 01:04:30,171
Take your foot with your right hand.

969
01:04:30,714 --> 01:04:33,174
You need to pull and twist, okay?

970
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:34,175
Okay

971
01:04:34,925 --> 01:04:36,885
- Okay. - Are you ready?

972
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:38,053
Do it!

973
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:50,521
It's not working. - Use your hands. Use your hands!

974
01:04:50,938 --> 01:04:51,896
Okay

975
01:05:00,404 --> 01:05:01,572
- I can't do this!

976
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,698
I'm sorry!

977
01:05:03,906 --> 01:05:04,991
Use your belt.

978
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:08,827
Wrap it around the bone and pull it tight.

979
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:11,371
Okay. Okay.

980
01:05:12,413 --> 01:05:13,622
alright

981
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:15,374
Okay

982
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:43,604
Sara.

983
01:05:45,147 --> 01:05:46,731
Hey, welcome back.

984
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:49,734
How are you doing?

985
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,281
I've been better.

986
01:05:56,614 --> 01:05:57,615
Slowly.

987
01:06:08,956 --> 01:06:10,333
Nice splint

988
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,293
I found you a walking stick

989
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:15,754
Thanks.

990
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:32,099
We're going to die, aren't we?

991
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:35,727
No

992
01:06:37,646 --> 01:06:39,314
No, we're not

993
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:44,193
Not if you accept the power of Christ to fight this thing.

994
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:46,152
How do I do that?

995
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,448
Just open your heart and ask for forgiveness.

996
01:06:52,533 --> 01:06:54,076
God will do the rest.

997
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,203
Sara...

998
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,747
I rejected the Christian God my whole life.

999
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:04,542
That does not matter.

1000
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:08,419
He has already forgiven you.

1001
01:07:09,712 --> 01:07:11,381
All you have to do is ask.

1002
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:16,051
Okay

1003
01:07:20,053 --> 01:07:21,346
Get the prayer book.

1004
01:07:52,495 --> 01:07:53,997
Pray with me.

1005
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:55,164
Yeah

1006
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,334
I believe in God the Father ...

1007
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:03,838
Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.

1008
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:07,425
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord ...

1009
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:10,218
which it was conceived by the Holy Spirit ...

1010
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:12,178
born of the Virgin Mary ...

1011
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:14,305
suffered under Pontius Pilate.

1012
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,724
He was crucified, dead and buried ...

1013
01:08:18,558 --> 01:08:20,100
He descended to the dead.

1014
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,353
He rose again the third day ...

1015
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:24,979
He ascended into heaven ...

1016
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:28,316
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.

1017
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:31,401
Whence shall come to judge the living and the dead.

1018
01:08:32,152 --> 01:08:35,946
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church ...

1019
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:39,825
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins ...

1020
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,786
the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.

1021
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:49,249
Amen.

1022
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:51,876
Amen.

1023
01:09:12,057 --> 01:09:13,725
How is the foot, Sara?

1024
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:17,728
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1025
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,190
Open the prayer book.

1026
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:25,650
Oh, you're going to ignore me now, is that it?

1027
01:09:26,526 --> 01:09:30,447
In the name of Jesus Christ, we confidently undertake...

1028
01:09:30,447 --> 01:09:33,741
to repuls the attacks and deceits of the devil.

1029
01:09:37,075 --> 01:09:38,243
You're boring me.

1030
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:41,830
May your mercy. Lord,  descend down upon us.

1031
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:44,582
We five you from us ...

1032
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:46,250
all unclean spirits ...

1033
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:48,877
all satanic powers, all infernal invaders ...

1034
01:09:48,877 --> 01:09:50,504
all wicked legions.

1035
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,631
Jesus will not answer your prayers, Sara, you know that.

1036
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:57,051
Not after you have committed a mortal sin.

1037
01:09:58,468 --> 01:09:59,719
What did you say?

1038
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:02,055
- Sara, keep reading. - Tell her, Sara.

1039
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:05,224
Tell her about little Jude.

1040
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:09,810
How do you know his name?

1041
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,063
- Who is Jude? - Sar's bloody little bundle.

1042
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:15,689
What?

1043
01:10:17,608 --> 01:10:19,151
Leave me alone!

1044
01:10:19,151 --> 01:10:20,902
Sara, who is Jude?

1045
01:10:23,321 --> 01:10:24,697
It's my baby!

1046
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:27,157
That wasn't your fault.

1047
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,659
You had a miscarriage.

1048
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,452
Yeah, with a little help fom a coat hanger

1049
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:36,289
Sarah was six months pregnant, he was still alive when ...

1050
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:38,791
she squeezed him out, wasn't he?

1051
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:42,085
They took him from me. They wouldn't tell me if he
was alive or dead!

1052
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:44,128
You never told Joey, did you?

1053
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:47,339
Joey never knew that he was a  Daddy.

1054
01:10:48,715 --> 01:10:50,676
Oh yes. That's right, Joey.

1055
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:53,593
Joey was the father

1056
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,011
Sara?

1057
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:58,431
Joey was the father?

1058
01:10:58,931 --> 01:11:00,641
It was after you broke up.

1059
01:11:00,641 --> 01:11:03,227
It was a one-night stand. We were both wasted.

1060
01:11:03,894 --> 01:11:06,604
I tried to tell him, but he did not want to be a father.

1061
01:11:06,604 --> 01:11:08,940
How did you know, if you did not ask?

1062
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,818
Where's Jude?

1063
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:14,944
Didn't baby Jesus tell you?

1064
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:19,114
Is he alive? Please, tell me.

1065
01:11:20,824 --> 01:11:23,242
Why don't you ask baby Jesus?

1066
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:25,744
That's right, I forgot.

1067
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:28,663
He does not answer the prayers of the damned.

1068
01:11:28,955 --> 01:11:31,165
No, He forgave me. I know he did.

1069
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:35,335
I don't think so, because there's some things
you can't be forgiven for ...

1070
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:38,129
and killing your baby is one of them.

1071
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:40,381
No! I didn't know!

1072
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,173
Baby Killer!

1073
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,679
I told you it was just going to be you and me, Eva.

1074
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:53,224
Oh, Eva!

1075
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:55,183
Come back Eva!

1076
01:12:18,697 --> 01:12:19,698
Sara.

1077
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:21,995
Sara, why didn't you tell me?

1078
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:23,413
You could have tallked to me.

1079
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:30,711
I was so ashamed after what I did with Joey.

1080
01:12:31,462 --> 01:12:32,670
After all ...

1081
01:12:33,546 --> 01:12:35,173
I'm a bad person.

1082
01:12:36,007 --> 01:12:37,383
I'm damned.

1083
01:12:37,924 --> 01:12:39,301
I'm going to hell.

1084
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:40,927
No you are not.

1085
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,687
Jude?

1086
01:13:08,616 --> 01:13:09,617
Sara.

1087
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:50,942
Jude?

1088
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,785
Is that you, baby?

1089
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:08,745
Mommy's got you.

1090
01:14:09,246 --> 01:14:10,580
Mommy's got you now.

1091
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:12,206
It's you?

1092
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:13,916
baby Killer!

1093
01:14:27,426 --> 01:14:28,844
I'm tired of this shit!

1094
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,346
What? Where are you taking me?

1095
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:34,640
Jesus forced that legion of demons into a herd of pigs, right?

1096
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,599
That's right.

1097
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:38,185
And then he drove the pigs off a cliff and drowned them

1098
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:39,602
Yes. So what?

1099
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:47,442
We're going to send this mother-fucker back to hell.

1100
01:15:03,413 --> 01:15:07,291
In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this body.

1101
01:15:12,586 --> 01:15:14,672
He has not suffered enough. yet

1102
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:16,673
Burn him.

1103
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:26,556
You have no power over me, mortal.

1104
01:15:26,806 --> 01:15:27,848
Again.

1105
01:15:31,184 --> 01:15:32,811
It is he who commands you.

1106
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:35,313
He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven ...

1107
01:15:35,313 --> 01:15:36,814
to the depths of hell.

1108
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,565
It is he who commands you.

1109
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:42,402
He who once stilled the sea, and the wind and the storm.

1110
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,527
Again!

1111
01:15:46,112 --> 01:15:47,780
- We need more holy water. - Keep praying!

1112
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:52,826
Tremble in fear, you enemy of the faith, 
you foe of the human race ...

1113
01:15:52,826 --> 01:15:55,369
you begtter of death, you robber of life.

1114
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:58,998
Corrupter of justice, you root of all evil and vice.

1115
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:01,624
Seducer of men, betrayer of nations ...

1116
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:04,044
instigator of envy, font of avarice ...

1117
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:07,379
formentor of discord, author of pain and sorrow.

1118
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:11,299
Do not despise my command because you know 
me to be a great sinner.

1119
01:16:11,507 --> 01:16:13,968
It is God himself who commands you.

1120
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:17,220
I adjure you, ancient serpent ...

1121
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:20,389
By the judge of the living and the dead ...

1122
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:23,600
by your Creator, by the Creator of the whole universe ...

1123
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,561
by he who has the power to consign you to the depths of hell ...

1124
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:30,064
Be gone from this temple of the Lord!

1125
01:16:31,564 --> 01:16:32,899
Are you kidding?

1126
01:16:33,107 --> 01:16:35,066
This is the best seat in the house.

1127
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,235
I'm not going anywhere.

1128
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,446
Liar.

1129
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,530
You are trapped.

1130
01:16:42,406 --> 01:16:44,200
I bound you with my prayer.

1131
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,285
I'm not trapped

1132
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:50,204
I can leave anytime I want.

1133
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,956
But where's the fun in that?

1134
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:57,501
You see, if I don't give you any hope, you are not 
going to struggle so much

1135
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,796
And I do love to see you struggle

1136
01:17:02,004 --> 01:17:03,255
Prove it

1137
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:17,517
You couldn't stay away, could you?

1138
01:17:18,059 --> 01:17:20,144
I command you in the name of ...

1139
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:22,187
Are you ready to die, little christian?

1140
01:17:23,312 --> 01:17:24,438
Go to Hell

1141
01:17:26,982 --> 01:17:29,359
If Jesus can turn water into wine ...

1142
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:31,444
imagine what I can do.

1143
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:56,505
You have no power over me, demon.

1144
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:58,465
Jesus protects those who love Him.

1145
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:03,761
Sara.

1146
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:07,471
Let's finish this.

1147
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,599
The power of Christ ...

1148
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:22,359
Help me!

1149
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:46,460
God.

1150
01:18:47,795 --> 01:18:48,879
My God ...

1151
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:54,801
I'm dying, Eva.

1152
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:58,095
No! Please.

1153
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:00,180
You have to let me go.

1154
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:03,265
I'm going to see my baby.

1155
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,934
You're not going anywhere.

1156
01:19:06,143 --> 01:19:07,143
Please.

1157
01:19:07,268 --> 01:19:08,352
Stay with me.

1158
01:19:08,686 --> 01:19:11,981
We will survive this, we'll be together.

1159
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:14,024
Promise me one thing.

1160
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:17,776
Anything.

1161
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:20,487
Save him for me.

1162
01:19:29,368 --> 01:19:30,619
Sara.

1163
01:19:45,715 --> 01:19:46,840
Eva.

1164
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:50,052
You know ...

1165
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:54,263
I hate to be the kind of guy who says "I told you so."

1166
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,016
But I did warn you that it would just come down
 to you and me

1167
01:20:33,753 --> 01:20:36,338
Ready or not, Eva ...

1168
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:40,049
here I come.

1169
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:45,678
Please, Jesus, protect me.

1170
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:47,971
Protect me in my hour of need.

1171
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:49,097
Please.

1172
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,768
He can't hear you!

1173
01:20:57,687 --> 01:20:59,147
But I can.

1174
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:07,195
Shall we say mass?

1175
01:21:08,904 --> 01:21:09,905
Back off!

1176
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:14,325
What do you think I am, a vampire?

1177
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:17,828
I will kill you.

1178
01:21:17,828 --> 01:21:20,497
Not before I shove that cross up your ass.

1179
01:21:31,798 --> 01:21:32,799
Please.

1180
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:35,633
Please do not kill me.

1181
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:37,635
I'll do anything.

1182
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:41,429
Anything?

1183
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:46,600
It's been so long since I've had a willing mortal.

1184
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,270
What?

1185
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,857
Let's start with a little kiss.

1186
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:56,984
A kiss?

1187
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:01,988
Don't worry, I won't melt your pretty little face, I promise.

1188
01:22:05,657 --> 01:22:06,700
Okay

1189
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:56,447
You stupid fucking whore!

1190
01:23:13,917 --> 01:23:15,544
I could make you a queen.

1191
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:18,714
I could have given the world!

1192
01:23:20,131 --> 01:23:22,050
Now I'm going to rip off your head!

1193
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,185
It is he who commands you.

1194
01:23:35,185 --> 01:23:37,478
He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven ...

1195
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:38,771
to the depths of hell.

1196
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,314
The power of Christ compels you!

1197
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:43,816
Leave this body and go to the rat!

1198
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,173
Joey.

1199
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,718
I'm sorry

1200
01:24:50,909 --> 01:24:52,410
Go to hell.
