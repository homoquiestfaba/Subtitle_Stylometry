00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,784
(funky music)

00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,561
(funky music)

00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:44,277
(funky music)

00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,165
There's a certain beauty,
peacefulness that exists at this
time of the morning.

00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:13,306
City still sleeps, for most
part... It's the dawn of a new
day! Anything can happen.

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,575
A new day.

00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,511
Clean slate.

00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,051
For me however, the silence, the
chill in the air, is a big slap
in the face.

00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,455
It's the world telling
me I screwed up.

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,326
You see, I'm not a morning
person. I live in the afternoon
and late a night.

00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,565
If I witness a dawn of a new
day, something went wrong.

00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,039
There's an incredible history
in this little neighborhood.

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,176
Home of the Beat Generation,
site of shore leave for the army
services,

00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,178
you got Little Italy on one
side, China town on the other.

00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,617
Some of the charms seem
to be lost, though.

00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,489
More homeless, desperation...
that's one side.

00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,225
On the other side there's
Yappies everywhere, Starter
Porsche Boxster Types.

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,762
That's what my
girlfriend calls them.

00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:17,504
Even The Condo, The Mackoff
Strip Club, The Homo's Carol
Dota, the pioneer of American
stripping shut down.

00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,342
They converted it
into a sports bar.

00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,646
Satellite dish, microbrews...
the whole thing.

00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,216
So now, in the spot where two
people having sex on the rising
hydraulic piano were crushed

00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,352
to death against the roof
seats a big screen TV.

00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,158
-Is my tie straight?
-Yeah. -Cool.

00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,097
There goes Steve. We've been
roommates for a year. That's not
our apartment though.

00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,802
The place I came out of, that's
not our place either. We live
somewhere else.

00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:55,375
Not far, just half the street.
I'll probably go there, later.

00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,379
I need coffee.

00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,990
-Hey, good morning sunshine!
What are you doing up so early?

00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,793
-I'm on my way to bed.

00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,763
-Coffee gonna be a nightcap?

00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,067
-It's fucking early!

00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,071
-I don't think I've ever seen
you up this early. -Have you
gone to school. -Yeah.

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,441
-What are you doin' up at
this hour? -I'm goin' to bed.

00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,279
-So, you took off with
that freaker last night.

00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,249
(laugh)

00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,085
-Michelle. -Yeah.
Was she a freaker!

00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,323
-She's not a freaker she's a
stripper. -She's a child. -She's
19-years-old.

00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,762
-She's a 19-years-old stripper
on a vacation from New Orleans.

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,732
-Sounds like a freaker.

00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,137
-Hello gentlemen.
-Hey. -Bongiorno.

00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,274
-Hello Tyler. -Hello Sean.

00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,677
-Can I have some piping hot ?
Dude you were sneaking out at
the youth hostel last night.

00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,314
-You're talking to me? -No I'm
talking to professor. Of course
I'm talking to you.

00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,683
-That was fifteen minutes
ago! -How was she?

00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:15,488
-How do you know this?

00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,192
-That's what Steve said. -How
the fuck did he know? -He saw
you this morning! -Oh, we barely
spoke!

00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,128
-Oh, wow! So, you and Paige
broke up? -No, we didn't break
up!

00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,564
-You're fucked! (laughs)

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,101
-Is it all right with you if I
asked you out? -I just said we
didn't wake up!

00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,004
-I'm going to get the paper!

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,747
-I'm gonna ask 'er out. -Jesus,
didn't you hear the man Joe?
They're still a couple.

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,487
-She's gonna be here at ten.
When she gets here I'm gonna ask
her if she knows. And if she
knows, I'm gonna ask 'er out.

00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,125
-How come I don't get to ask her
out? -Dude, that's Tyler's
girlfriend! -Fuck! Every time...

00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,027
-Fuck you guys! (laugh)

00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,033
Tyler! Oh, Tyler!

00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,205
Oh please, you must join us! We
are having mimosis. -Have you
not been asleep yet?

00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:11,244
We've been having mimosis! -All
night... -No, no, that would be
gauche.

00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,248
Peeeewwwzh! (strange sound)

00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:22,122
Oh, and a... Paige is with us. I
don't think she knows about
Michelle.

00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,025
-How do you know? How does
everybody know about Michelle?
-It's North Beach, baby!

00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,198
-Good morning posers!
-You're late.

00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,135
-For the love of God!
Cut this man off!

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,206
-Hey. -Hey.

00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,078
-Have a drink! What
are you having?

00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,480
-It's seven. -Right!

00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,319
-Hey, Fiss, mimosis all around!
It would be seven all at all!

00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,028
So, I was... I was a t the bar
and I don't think you saw me.

00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,267
-Yes I did. -Yes
you did. So, am...

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,607
What did you do last night? -I
should be asking you the same
question.

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,112
-What exactly do you now?
-Don't worry about it.

00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,683
-What does that mean? -It means,
don't worry about it. -That
makes me worry about it.

00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,756
-Drink up! And for
you beautiful.

00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,757
-Thank you.

00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,361
-So...

00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:42,035
-What did you do last night?
-Jesus Tyler, fucking drop it!
-What!?

00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,139
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
For you darling the world.

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,378
-Wow! You guys seem to be
getting along pretty well!

00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,382
-You know... just
breaking up and all.

00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:02,222
-You know Robbie... sometimes
I just fuckin' hate you.

00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,466
-Where's my coffee?

00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,203
-I thought you skipped out on
the bill. -How many times have I
skipped out on the bill?

00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,241
-How would I know. I
quit counting years ago.

00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,413
-There was never malice
involved. -Yeah...

00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,554
-Just ran into Paige. -How did
that go? -I think she knows.

00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,560
-Knows what? That you had some
peeler from New Orleans buns up
kneeling all night?

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,198
-It was not all night. -Yeah,
well the duration won't be the
part that bothers her Tyler.

00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,237
-Whatever, you guys were going
out for too long anyway. Did she
tell you what she was doing last
night?

00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,343
-I'm goin' to bed.

00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,683
-Thanks for the coffee, Ty!

00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,226
(rock music)

00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:22,469
(rock music)

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,404
-Pete!

00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,377
-PETE!

00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,383
-Tyler my man! I'm
so glad you made it!

00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,717
-What are you doing here? -I
needed a place to crash buddy.

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,589
What's wrong with your place?
-Wendy needed to sleep, and I
needed to play guitar.

00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,561
-I thought you needed to crash.
-I took to my speed, so I'm
having just a, just a little
trouble sleeping.

00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,500
-What's that noise? -More of a
place to hang my hat, I guess
that's the correct terminology,
but...

00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,171
...fucking dildo wears hats
these days, so I'm not gonna say
it....

00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,574
-Who's in the shower?

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,511
(singing)

00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,985
-No Pete, I don't wanna see your
muupa! I told you to stay... oh
it's you. I'll be out in a
minute.

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,723
(guitar sound)

00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,163
-Take that! Fuck man! It fucking
works, shit! I didn't write
that!

00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,102
-It's fucking great! Dude, we're
gonna have to fucking have,
like, roadies to keep the chicks
from raping us

00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,804
the second we play that note!

00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,738
-This is huge!

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,213
-Paige, can we talk
for a minute? -No.

00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,551
-What do you mean "no"? -I have
to get to work! -You don't work
till ten!

00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,388
-Yeah? -It's like, seven.

00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,460
-Fuck! Get that shit
off man, she rocks.

00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,096
I hope I can fuckin'
remember that!

00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,635
-Yes. It's good. -Right, you
should be writing this... where
are... you should be writing
this down!

00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,340
-Give me a beer. Give
me a beer man. Tyler?

00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,036
-We should go lay down man.

00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,706
-Yeah we should.

00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,613
-Now would be really good
time to go lay down.

00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,782
-No, man, I gotta go
to bed right now.

00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,754
-Fuck that man, we gotta do this
now while fresh! Tyler if I sit
on this it is gone!

00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,859
-See, if I go to sleep, forget
it man, I'm up for at least
three fuckin' days. Now we gotta
lay this right fuckin' now!

00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,460
-Pete!

00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,531
-I've had a really
fucked up few hours!

00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,437
-If I don't go to bed right now,
if I don't try and write off
this day, it's gonna begin to
spiral!

00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:17,277
-It's gonna gather speed. And it
will plummet into a hellishness
so fast I won't be able to
recover.

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,084
-And Pete I don't want that. I
don't need that. There are
things out there waiting to fuck
up my life!

00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,421
-Hi. -Hi. Sorry, I was in a
hurry so, I didn't think you'd
mind.

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,125
-Mind what? -Me
taking a shower here.

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,496
-Couldn't make it all the way
home. -Oh right, yeah, yeah,
that's no problem.

00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,769
-Tyler and I are gonna lay down
a few tracks. -Maybe. -That's my
man! Yeah!

00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,608
-Could we? Could we talk
for a minute? -Nope.

00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,516
-Stop saying that! Just give me
two minutes! -No, I've got
errands to run and then I've
gotta go to work, so no!

00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,251
-It's just that... I, I wanna
talk to you before... -Let's go!

00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,756
-See! You don't have time
either. -OK. What time do you
get off?

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,459
-Five. -Five, OK, um...

00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,397
-We'll talk then? -Super.

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,271
-So long Paige! Let's
go chum. -Nice. -What?

00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,612
-It was really just a thing man.
It just took hold of me, it just
grabbed me and said 'this is
this'!

00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,183
-That's not something
else man, this is this.

00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,220
-Back um, back um, back
um... (mouth music)

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,457
-We're just gonna go see Ernie
man, he's got that machine, all
those guitars.

00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,458
-I bet it's gonna work! Were
gonna sit there all fuckin' day
just creating man.

00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,062
-Doing our shit! -Yeah.

00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:45,398
I feel it today man, it is
coursing through my veins! -It's
the speed.

00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,538
-It is the speed.

00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:55,041
-But the speed's unlocked the
door man. It was like the
combinational lock that was
holding 13 amazing songs.

00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,010
-It has made me... it has
transformed me into the prolific
songstress that I am.

00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,545
(knocking sound)

00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,614
-Did you just say 'songstress'?

00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,021
-Tyler knocked!

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,492
-What do you want?
-Is this a bad time?

00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,064
-Ahh...yeah! It's a bad time!
-Dude, we need to use your
foretrack today.

00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,067
-Come back at noon. -What?
You don't work today?

00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,638
-What did I just say? -Something
about coming back at noon. -Very
good!

00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,012
-Fuck! God dammit! (knocking)
What are you doing?

00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,117
-Last night's condom's
still on your dick.

00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,791
(snap)

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,700
-Noon. And not a minute before!

00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,643
-That was fucking foul.

00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,747
-That's like, that's like three
hours from now. -Yup.

00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,185
-I'm not sure I can hang on
that long. -Got any more speed?

00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,923
-I'm not sure, but I thing more
speed now would kill me. -PETE!

00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,693
-Oh God! -Jesus! -Wendy!
My little love!

00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,067
-Hey, did you come home last
night? -No, I crashed at Steve
and Tyler's.

00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,305
-Partying on their smooth again,
ha? (laugh) -Wendy! Always good
for a laugh.

00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,476
-Um, yeah, I guess there
was an extra bed, hmm?

00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,547
-Well this is
getting ridiculous.

00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,450
-Don't you people have anything
better to do than gossiping
about my personal life? Get a
hobby.

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,619
-That is my hobby. -Heh. -It's
all over town you know. -Yeah,
apparently.

00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,721
-Paige was pretty
upset about it.

00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,227
-What did she say? -She said she
was pretty upset about it. -Fuck
sake! She does know!

00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,329
-Of course she knows, how could
she not know? -Because it's 9
am-ish!

00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,335
-Why are boys so stupid?
-Because we love you so much.
-Oh, baby!

00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,105
-'We' doesn't include me. -I'll
see you at the cafe at noon!

00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,375
-All right?

00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,510
-I wanna piece of
this right now!

00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:25,692
(loud music)

00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,738
(loud music)

00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,178
(people having sex sound
in the background)

00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,117
-Joe! -Did you just say your
name? -OK, get off me, get off
me...

00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,593
-Tyler! Thank God you're here!
-Hey! Thank God you're here,
too.

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,434
-Hey Ty! -Veronica, looking
quite flush this morning.

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,038
-I just fucked Joe in the
bathroom. -Yeah, so I've heard.

00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,309
-So, what did you do last
night? -You don't know?

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,045
-I didn't see you,
why would I know?

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,549
-I went home early,
I read a book.

00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,287
-Yeah, it was a nice
change of pace.

00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,692
-Where's Paige? -That's a good
question. Where is your darling
Paige?

00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,661
-I hope she's not to devastated
to come to work this morning
Tyler.

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,399
-Devastated? Why would she be
devastated? -She, she's gonna
be...

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,736
-Why would she be devastated?
-She, she... -Why would she be
devastated?

00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,505
-Because that book he was
reading last night was about a
19-year-old stripper from the
Big Easy.

00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:51,478
-That was you? -Oh, I guess
she's read that book. -You are
very bad.

00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,983
-Like you should talk? -Yeah,
but Paige is so sweet.

00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,652
-Well Ted is also very sweet,
but that didn't stop you from
getting a 'burrito no cheese'
from his friend in the man's

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,223
-The bathroom is unisex.

00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:12,532
-Tyler, remember what we were
talking about yesterday?

00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,001
-I was giving it some thought, I
think that might actually work.
-Oh, yeah, the one over at
Bryant and Sixth?

00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,570
-That's the one.

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,507
-Look, I went and checked it
out. It's got two exits, and
it's only a block away from the
freeway.

00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,911
-That's two blocks away
from Hall of Justice.

00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:29,783
-Exactly, that's the beauty of
it. We're gonna be robbing a
bank two blocks from the Hall of
Justice.

00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,018
-Police headquarters right
there, this is gonna be like
invading Canada, nobody's ever
gonna see this incoming.

00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,788
-No, no, oh...

00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:39,793
-But instead of cutting out to
the freeway, we get a second
getaway car. We park it at the
Hall.

00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,530
-After we suck the life out of
that bank, we can go straight to
the lines there. -Then we switch
the rides.

00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,632
-Not, ready yet.

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,937
-We go into the Hall, we spend
a day watching the trial.

00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:55,408
-Oh that's perfect. Like, some
civil shit divorce trial. We
might even recognize the people
we know there.

00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,211
-You know, we could check out
the bank robbery trial, see what
those guys fucked up, do a
little research.

00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,579
-That's good thinking.

00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,016
-Huh, shit! This
could totally work.

00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,417
-OK, you guys have been hashing
the same dumb fucking plan for
weeks now.

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,956
-Veronica, robbing banks isn't
this sort of thing you wanna
just stroll lightly into.

00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,193
-Tyler, you take one step from
the bank doors, and take a dump.

00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,232
-That'd be a hell of a
diversion. -Oh, please!

00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,671
-You're late. -Yeah,
you're really slam, too.

00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,676
-Really, I have time to sit down
and have a smoke. Hey, girl.
-Hi.

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,620
-You smell. -I haven't
showered yet. -You should.

00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,090
-Yeah.

00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,728
-So what did you do last night?
-I crawled up with a good book.

00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,630
-Funny,

00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,000
that's exactly what
Tyler did last night.

00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,469
-You guys are so cute.

00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,107
-I gotta get to work.

00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:11,484
-Well, everything seems to be in
order here, so, if nobody needs
me I'm gonna go do something
important.

00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:16,056
-Ciao! -See you.

00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:31,838
-I know that I have to explain,
I know that. I don't expect...
-What can I get you?

00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,041
-I'm not interrupting, am I?

00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,478
Well, you kind of are. -No, no.
Shone, what do you want? -What
time is it? -Ten till ten.

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,649
-Too early for a beer, can I
have a cup of coffee? -Sure.

00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,987
Look, I feel like a... -Can I
have a sesame beagle, too?

00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:03,770
-I... I feel like I should say
something but... but I don't
exactly know what to say.

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,139
-So don't say anything. -Come
on! It can't happen like this!
-That's funny because it is.

00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,209
-Hey, you want tomato
with that? -Good God yes!

00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:15,648
-It's just that I worry it's
gonna sound, um... trite, or
something.

00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,987
-And I don't want it
to sound that way.

00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,157
-I wish to God that we were
alone right now, because I have
a few things I'd like to say to
you. But we're not, so leave.

00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,291
-Oh Paige come on. (phone rings)

00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,495
-I have to work until five, OK?

00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,231
-That's seven straight hours of
all of our friends coming in and
giving me their sympathetic
bullshit.

00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,667
-That's what I
have to deal with!

00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:37,003
-What I don't have to deal with
is you following me all morning
like a retarded puppy while I'm
trying to work!

00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,206
-So leave, please! Go! Bathe!

00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,708
(phone rings)

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,716
-That bathing thing... I'm with
her in all of it. (laugh) -Shut
up!

00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,093
-Oh good Lord!

00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:05,365
-Hey, crimestoppers! -Gosh!

00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:09,469
-Son of a bitch! -What's up?
Come on, I switched to coffee,
let's go!

00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,604
-Fucking up, chill out man. -Oh,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:19,479
-Where are we going? -We're
going swimming! -I'm not going
swimming. I'm going out there to
take a shower

00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,514
and then I'm going in there to
go the bed. -No, no, swim and
shower, it's the same thing,
come on!

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,653
-I really gotta go to bed. -No,
you really gotta go. You will be
missing something very big!

00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,324
-You think so? -Very big!

00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,227
(funky music)

00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,432
-Joe! -Hello ladies!
-What's up spankie!

00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,104
-Hey! You bastards
better have ice!

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,312
-And you wanted to stay home!

00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,649
-I still wish I was
home. -Check this.

00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,288
-Hello beautiful
citizens of North Beach!

00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,759
-Hey Veronica! Hey
Ty! -Hey dork!

00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,230
-To whom can I make sweet,
sweet love? -You made it!

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,733
-You better be a woman,
please, be the woman!

00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:18,938
-Oh, Michelle! Oh, good God!

00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,107
-Of course I made it! It's not
officially social until I show
up!

00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:26,413
-Hey this is Veronica, and
this is Tyler. Tyler...

00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,251
-I think you know Michelle.
Michelle? You know Tyler?

00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,353
-I thought I did.

00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:39,426
-OK, all my work's done.
Veronica, let's go find the
blender! -Yes sir!

00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,629
-Bye.

00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,401
-How you doing? -Can't
complain. -How's Paige?

00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,175
-So you know about Paige. -Not
until I got here and said 'We
should call Tyler'.

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,015
-And someone said you were
probably busy explaining to
Paige where you were last night.

00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,351
-That's when I said 'Who is
Paige?' That's pretty much how I
found out about her.

00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,288
-Sorry about that. -Mhm.

00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,992
-Well OK then, I'm going
to go get a drink and...

00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,795
-Go get one, then come join us.

00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,330
-Aaaa! (scream)

00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,937
-Hey bitch! -Hey! Hey, you
owe me five bucks man!

00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:27,007
-Hey Tyler! -Hey, how you doing?

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,216
-You want salt? -No, I'm good.

00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,489
-Have a nice reunion with your
lost love? -About that, dick
head! Why didn't you tell me she
was gonna be here?

00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,493
-Cause you'd have done something
stupid, like stay home!

00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,764
-He was just doing what's best
for you. -Yeah. You need to
confront your demons.

00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,175
-She is one spectacular demon.

00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,377
-Cheers.

00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,746
-Cheers! -Cling-cling baby!

00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:18,091
-God damn it's hot! -No
shit! Let's hit the surf!

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,002
-Maybe we should've invite Paige
to stop by after she gets off
work.

00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:35,208
-There are a lot of people who
can give me shit, but after this
morning,

00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:38,912
you are not one of them.

00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,181
-What happened this morning?

00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,117
-Sparky! Think mine
are double! -Hey!

00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:56,796
-Hey, don't leave me hanging
man. What happened this morning?

00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:03,737
-Nothing. -OK. Fuck you then.

00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,074
-How's the water girls?

00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:16,549
-What happened? Library closed?
-Yeah! At least I go to class.

00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,588
-What did you mose do
all morning? -Not much.

00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,989
-That's what I figured.

00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,426
-I'm gonna go change. -OK.

00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:32,165
-Ted, you're probably the only
guy I know who carries his
swimsuit in his backpack on the
off chance of an impromptu a

00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:38,304
-That's right Tyler, it's a pool
party. Lose the leg warmers.

00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,611
-Oh yeah, that's
really funny book boy.

00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,315
-Couple of hoes is what we are.

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,088
(pop music)

00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:14,407
(pop music)

00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:25,318
-What the fuck is 'sticky
pumice' for? -The perfect
compliment to apply that the
mongolian beef would be a sexy

00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,687
-Well, what goes with redheads?

00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:31,691
-Compound chicken? Ouch!

00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:42,736
(pop music)

00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,742
-I have to go home.

00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:52,245
-What he hell do you have to do?

00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:56,049
-I dunno, something.

00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,619
-I gotta talk to
Paige. -Haha, yeah!

00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:05,258
-You fucked her over good. -I
still don't know what she was up
to last night.

00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:10,130
-This is your thing, Paige
didn't do anything last night.
You're the one who fucked up.

00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,982
-What did you do last week?

00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,118
-What night? -Any night. Any
night last week, what did you
do?

00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,421
-Like...

00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:39,025
Thursday? -Yes, like
Thursday, Thursday is fine.

00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,233
-I don't fuckin' know, I don't
know what I did an hour ago.

00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:54,140
-I know what you did. -Do you?

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,746
-The same thing you're gonna do
tonight. And the same thing you
did last week. -Why are you
getting in my shit?

00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,882
-No, I'm trying to make a point.
-You know, if you're having some
crisis that you're going
through, that's fine,

00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:03,616
but don't put your shit on me!
-I am just trying to say...

00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:06,419
-Ahh, fuck it!

00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,064
-No, go ahead.

00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,735
-I think I'm lucid again.

00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:31,011
-I am just saying that we do the
same shit every night, over and
over again. Same shit, with the
same people

00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,014
every night it's the same thing.

00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,420
-We could go to Berkeley
tonight. -It's the same thing.

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,288
-It's not the same thing, it's
fucking Berkeley. -So yeah, OK,
fine, we go to Berkeley.

00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:50,897
-And we take the same crowd
because we can't possibly do
anything without each other. So
we all go to the same

00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,334
bar, we sit in some corner and
bag on all the people we don't
know. We drink the same drinks
we drink in the city

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,940
and at some point, we will all l
decide that the East Bay sucks.

00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,412
-We jump on the bridge, and then
go back to North Beach, and then
there we are,

00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,181
doing the same thing
we do every night.

00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,717
-But...

00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,255
it'll be a few hours later.

00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:19,259
-So we get a later start
on the same thing.

00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,595
(splash)

00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,566
Woooohooo! (laughs)

00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,374
-Looks like I need another dink.

00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:41,614
(latino music)

00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:45,552
-We're all creatures
of habit my friend.

00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:50,690
-We need routine. Routine
makes us feel safe.

00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:56,696
-Routine is the friend you see
every day, it's the girlfriend
you wake up with!

00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:02,635
-Or that you're supposed to wake
up with. -Yeah, but our life...
-I'm not done talking yet!

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,472
-Here, taste it.

00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,413
-More tequila. -Aahh!
Thank you! See!

00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,282
-You want more tequila!

00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,353
-Because you are used to a
certain amount, you don't wanna
change!

00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:30,497
-Routine should count for, I
dunno, 25-30% of our total
being.

00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:39,305
-Is that an actual figure...
-It's a public fact! Look it up!

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,575
-It's there to keep us in check.

00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,446
(sigh)

00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,286
-Perfect.

00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:01,428
-But, the thing about routine is
that even when you're deep into
it

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,400
there's always a chance that
something will jump up and pull
you out.

00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,471
-So you're never really safe.

00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,783
-Every day I stroll
down at the cafe. -Mhm.

00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,754
-I get three cups of coffee,

00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,724
and I go get the paper,

00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,727
and I come back and
have two more.

00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,399
-Joe and I sit there
commenting on the news and

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,168
planning bank robberies.

00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:48,441
-Paige comes in around ten, I
hang out, talk to her for a
while, then I go home.

00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:57,250
-I have no plans for anything
beyond what I'm gonna do that
night.

00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,623
-I am...

00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:09,029
totally and completely

00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,598
nowhere.

00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:25,211
(rock music)

00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:41,394
-Wake up! -Where am I?

00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:46,366
-Oh, I know you guys. -Get
up, go sleep on my couch!

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,703
-Can you carry me? -Go!

00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,758
-Shit! Do you know whose car
this is? -Robbie's? -Robbie
doesn't have a fuckin' car.

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,629
-Hey Robbie! Whose car is this?

00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,535
-It's my sister's! She's
in Boston for a week!

00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,407
-Okay, let's park it.

00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:36,049
-Could there be something
down? -I don't see anything.

00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:40,520
-Don't look where I'm looking,
look over on the other side, I
got this side.

00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,594
-Anything, anything, anything?
-To the right, to the right.
-I'm not going that way, are you
nuts?

00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,532
-Aahh! -Nothing. Nothing.

00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,538
-I'm very proud of
you. -Why's that?

00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:03,276
-The 19-year-old. You didn't lay
a hand on her. -Ohh!

00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,414
-I thought about it.
-Thought about it.

00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,420
-Well, the old Tyler would've
done a lot more than think.
-What? So now I'm the a... new
improved Tyler now?

00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:17,590
-No. Now you're in love.

00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,859
(braking sound)

00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,262
-That right there? -Hardly.

00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,568
-Woo! Nice car Tyler! -Hey!

00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,274
-You are, you know. -What?

00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,776
-In love.

00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:42,816
-And you think you need to
tell me what I am or am not?

00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,384
-Aaa! Aaaa! -What!?

00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:49,322
-You just missed one.
-Where? -Back there.

00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:53,660
-Oh, it's a fuckin' fire
hydrant! -Oops! My bad.

00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:00,066
-All right, fuck this!

00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,110
-People have been asking me
whole day: "What were you
thinking?" -Yeah? What did you
tell them?

00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:14,080
I don't know, nothing.
Smile, walk away...

00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,518
-I don't know, I don't know what
I was thinking. -You weren't
thinking. You were just being
you.

00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:25,158
-Thanks. -What? You weren't
aware you had a weakness for the
ladies?

00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:31,998
-Oh, come on, it's the same
thing I do. It's the same thing
we all do.

00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:34,367
-It's all about the game. You
can't fart on our beach without
every single one of our friends
smelling it!

00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,439
-Jesus! Come on now, you're a
girl, you can't go around
talking about farts. -Shut up!

00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:46,179
-Look, we all know each other
inside and out. And I mean that
literally.

00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:49,082
-Since we pretty much all slept
together. So, the only thing to
do is play the game.

00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,754
-And since we all play it,
normally its not a problem. Just
Paige wasn't playing.

00:35:57,457 --> 00:36:01,261
-And you my friend told her you
are out, so now you gotta pay.
Or you could just shake it off.

00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,697
-That's what you usually do.

00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:09,602
-Yeah, I wish could.
-I'm glad you can't.

00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,643
-So, you wanna go back
to my lace and fuck?

00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:22,182
-Let's just go to the cafe. -OK.

00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:27,554
-You think Paige's still
working? -Is it still Tuesday?
-I don't know.

00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:33,126
-What the hell, like, I'm still
going there. -Maybe i should
hang back a little.

00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,328
-Why? -Well, you
are a known slut.

00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:41,768
-Takes one to know one. -Ahh.
You sure the car's OK there?
-It'll be fine.

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,505
-I put the hazards on.

00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,412
-Bitches! What's up!!?

00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:58,485
-Hi. -You look a little cleaner.
-Yeah, I went swimming.

00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,256
-Pit's been here since noon
looking for you. -Oh, fuck! I
forgot about that! -Yeah, I
figured but

00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:09,295
he said "Naah, he'll be here, my
boy won't let me down." -Well
I'm here. -Yeah.

00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,630
-And I'm sure if Pit wasn't in
the middle of a meth crash, he'd
tell you glad he is.

00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,435
-Oh, and he'd also tell you that
you are playing tonight at the
"Lost and Found". -What?

00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:18,972
-That's what the man said.
-Pete! Pete! -What? Ouch!

00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:25,545
-Oh, Tyler, thank God you're
here man, I'm so glad to see
you. We're playing tonight at
"Lost and Found"!

00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,448
-Told ya. -Sound check is
at four. What time is it?

00:37:29,182 --> 00:37:32,252
-3:55. Shit!

00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:38,224
-Aren't you gonna
go? -In a minute.

00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:42,328
-Will you come tonight?
-Hmm... I don't think I can.

00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:46,132
-How come? -I kinda have a date.

00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:50,303
-With who? -Just some guy I
met. -Some guy you met? -Yeah.

00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,974
-Are we breaking up here or
what? 'Cause this is actually
what I wanna talk about. -Do you
wanna break up?

00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:57,344
-No, no, I wanna talk.

00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:01,514
-We can do that! -You are going
on some date? -Yeah.

00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,119
-So, you're breaking up with me.

00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:13,326
-I know where you were last
night, and you know I know.

00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:16,262
-And I'm sure you're expecting
me to freak out, and cry, and
ask you: "Oh how could you do
that to me?"

00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:22,268
-I am sorry, I am not going to
break up with you over it. But,
because of it, I will be going
on a date.

00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,338
-And I will act very
impressed with his money

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,110
and I'll compliment hi tie,
and I'll drink, a lot.

00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,384
-So now, it's up to you. You can
continue going out with a girl
who goes out on Yappie dates

00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,586
or you can break up with me, and
it won't matter to you who I go
out with.

00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:47,927
-Keep your dignity dude, dump
her! -He's right man! You'll
look like an ass if you stay

00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,663
with her. -What are you talking
about, he cheated on her. It's
his fucking fault!

00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,770
-I do love you. -Pussy!
-Would you shut up?

00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:01,041
-Tyler for fuck sake!

00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,344
-You're late for sound check.

00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:12,052
-You fucker!

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:21,227
(hard rock music)

00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,608
(hard rock music)

00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,259
-Gimme a fuckun' A. That's
an A. -That's an A.

00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,533
-Glad you could make it pretty
boy. You wanna get to work some
time today?

00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:06,539
-I'm just catching my breath
here. -That cigarette will help.

00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:11,478
-Why are you using the PA,
I'm right fucking here?

00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:15,348
-Trying to make you hacks
feel like the big time.

00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,724
-OK, let's do this!

00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:29,295
-Testing, testing one,
test... it sounds great!

00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:34,167
-Hey, where are you going?
-Tyler, get your ass back on the
stage!

00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,571
-We're supposed to
practice dickwad!

00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:53,319
(hard rock music)

00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:03,430
(hard rock music)

00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:10,236
-She's gone man, I
let her go early.

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,575
-Pathetic! (laughs)

00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:24,150
(hard rock music)

00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,024
-Hey, Tyler!

00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,526
(puking sound)

00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:36,629
-Jesus dude! You ate the fish?

00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:41,134
-Ran from cafe.

00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:43,536
-Too much smoking.

00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:47,440
-Well you wanna go back to the
cafe? That's where I'm heading,
but I'm walking.

00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:53,046
(breathing heavily)
-No! I... I would...

00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,616
-I'm just gonna go to the side
for a while. -All right, OK.

00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:01,087
-Hey, I'll see you tonight, I
hear you're playing. -Yeah.
-Right, I'll see you tonight.

00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:08,261
-Hey! Paige's in there? -No! I
haven't seen her since this
morning.

00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:09,696
-See you at seven!

00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:35,989
-Aaaa! (scream)

00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,657
-What's the matter with you?
-We're playing n two and a half
hours!

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,096
-Four blocks away, what's the
hurry? -You haven't even looked
at the new lyrics, I know
because I still have them!

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,699
-We're not doing the new stuff.

00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:48,735
-We have to! -Why do we have to?

00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:52,806
-Hey! -What's up?
-Because we do!

00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,411
-Tyler, don't disappoint fellas.
-You're ruining my day. -You're
ruining his day.

00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:01,247
-Cross the path man.

00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,285
-How long has this
been in your fridge?

00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:11,391
-It won't take long. No, I
just need to talk to you.

00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:17,430
No, it has absolutely nothing to
do... it is not a direct result
of anything!

00:43:19,232 --> 00:43:21,067
-Come on man, chop, chop!
-Hey, hey, hey! What?

00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:24,504
-Um, yeah, oh it's the band...

00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:30,243
-Thanks. So be late!

00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:35,215
-Listen, please just don't go.

00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:43,690
-What's up dude? She gave
you the highest one?

00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:48,795
-Yeah. She don't wanna be late.

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,065
-It's cold man, sorry.

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,238
-Anyway, new lyrics. -It's
better than shit you used to
write.

00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:03,977
-Why are you here? -It's
personal favor to me man.

00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:09,115
-Because I know all your songs
by heart! Since you've been
playing the same six songs
forever!

00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:14,788
-Now you got this new shit!
Which means, I gotta learn how
to mix it, I gotta shop for my
whole lighting package.

00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:17,190
-Lighting package!?

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,492
-You got like a coffee can and
some light bulbs! -You wanna
play in the dark?!

00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:25,331
-Listen, I ain't got all day! So
let's get the fucking show on
the road there pretty boy!

00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:32,172
-Ty, I'm thinking to start with
this little... -It's gonna...

00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:38,645
-Start with me getting out the
door! -Come on man, we gotta do
this shit! Fuck!

00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:42,782
-Great, great Steve! Go back
there! -You are really fucking
with the energy in here Ernie!

00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:44,784
-Hope you sleep well! Go, come
on, Joe, it's time for
practice...

00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:48,288
-I'm not messing with
anybody's energy.

00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:05,105
-Where is she? -Tyler!

00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:09,609
-What a pleasant surprise. I
thought you'd be off bonking
some stripper.

00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,411
-Where is she going?

00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,317
-You're running all over town
looking for her? -That's what
I'm about to.

00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,486
-Good dog!

00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:25,025
-Come on, just help me out.
Where would she go? -Sorry Ty,
but I'm sworn to secrecy.

00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:29,329
-I enjoy watching you bag.

00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:33,600
-I've been chasing around
all damn day and if I

00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:36,636
don't find her and explain
things to her then...

00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:42,075
-I'm going to follow you around
all night long, bugging the piss
out of you unless you tell me
where she is!

00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,645
-Knock yourself out.

00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:50,350
-I'll scream raunch.

00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,319
-Eeek!

00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:59,125
-She's meeting him here. -Oh
God, thank you, thank you.

00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:05,598
-Why don't you keep him company?
He is sitting right over there
in the corner.

00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:13,306
-The dark candlelit
corner? -Yeah.

00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:20,447
-Did you sit them there?
-No. He sat himself.

00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:31,991
-Hi. -Hello.

00:46:33,493 --> 00:46:35,362
-Oh, um... are you my server?

00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:39,232
-My what?

00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:42,569
-Server, waiter... -Your server,
ha, no, no, funny but no, I'm
not your server.

00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,242
-Sweet suit.

00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:55,782
-Do I know you? -Do you know me?
Like did we go to high school
together, or were we like
childhood friends?

00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,185
-Because no we didn't,
and no we weren't.

00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,990
-Okay, is there something I can
do for you? -Unbelievable.
Tyler!

00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:09,295
-Hey, how you doing? God, you
look great! -Am I in the middle
of something?

00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:10,597
-No, no! -Yeah, actually.

00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:17,270
-I just wanna talk to you.
-You have no right to do this.

00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:21,508
-I know, I'm sorry.

00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:24,678
-Then get the fuck out of here.

00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:30,250
-Sorry I'm late, I wanted to
change out of my work clothes. I
am so glad that we are finally
doing this...

00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,288
-I'm really sorry about
that. -No, no, he's right.

00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:40,060
-You do look great. -Oh!
Thank you. -You're welcome.

00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,096
-Too-to-loo!

00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:52,706
(soft music)

00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:05,385
(soft music)

00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,663
-Shit!

00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:19,733
-Ladies and gentleman, the rage
of the Yucatan peninsula...
BINGE!!

00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:24,471
(applause) (crowd cheering)

00:48:38,551 --> 00:48:42,489
-I'm here, I'm here!
-Super. -I'm here.

00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,294
-Thanks for showing
up. -No problem.

00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:52,532
-Hey, how you
doin'? We're Binge.

00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,538
-One, two, three,
four (rock music)

00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:03,677
(rock music)

00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:14,654
-I don't know this song!

00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:17,290
-What?!

00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:24,597
-Shut up!

00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,670
-It's the new shit! -I said we
weren't doing the new shit.

00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,441
-I said we were. -Freebird. -I
got your freebird right there!

00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:43,249
-We are the world!

00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:51,057
-Little technical difficulty
here, nothing to worry about.
-Shit...

00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:57,263
-You see, Pit here...

00:49:57,263 --> 00:50:00,066
-He wrote a whole bunch of new
songs... -Thirteen!

00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,574
-And, I've had a
relatively bad day.

00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:14,080
-Actually it all kinda started
last night. -I heard you had an
awesome night!

00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:21,087
-Yeah, that's right, I forgot
that everyone here knows
everything.

00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:25,191
-Well the thing is...

00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:29,696
I messed up last night. (slow
music starts in the background)

00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:35,068
-There's not much I
can do about that.

00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:42,375
-I said there's not too
much I can do about that.

00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:48,715
-'Cause last night I did
something very stupid

00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:52,385
and I can blame
it on being drunk

00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:55,355
I can blame it on

00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,126
what? My purine retrograde?

00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:06,099
-The thing is though... the
fact that would matter is...

00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:10,170
-I fucked up.

00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:19,479
-I fucked up.

00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,127
-Today, I tried to fight
a battle and I lost.

00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:38,732
-My chest is tight... up
and down, it's crazy beat.

00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:46,740
-In dark kind of grooves in a...
in a band with Pit! (crowd
scream)

00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:55,048
-I spent all day today, all day,
trying to fix what's broken,

00:51:56,716 --> 00:52:01,087
trying to make amends, trying
to pull back what I spoke

00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:02,655
all day...

00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:07,060
spent trying to fix yesterday

00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,229
today...

00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,197
trying to fix

00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:12,732
yesterday...

00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,106
-Lost day...

00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:28,682
-And all this muddle, all this
crazy shit clears up that I had
been into the brothel...

00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:31,618
-Something was born...

00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,356
-Something was born...

00:52:46,232 --> 00:52:48,501
-Something, kinda big
mothafucking attitude!

00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,538
-And something

00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,909
slapped across the head,

00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,444
something sad...

00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,315
(music)

00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,355
-Wake up!

00:53:12,425 --> 00:53:16,396
(music)

00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:19,332
-Wake up! (cheering crowd)

00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:22,769
(cheering crowd)

00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:29,609
(cheering crowd)

00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:37,450
-Good morning people, I'm
up! -You rock Tyler!

00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:43,823
-And right now, I feel quite
alive, and all of you helped me
feel that way so...

00:53:43,823 --> 00:53:46,059
-So why don't you sign on up to
the bar there and grab
yourselves a drink and...

00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,595
you know, hang out.
We'll see what happens.

00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,167
-I would like to
dedicate this next song,

00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:58,104
Pete's new song,

00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:02,642
to Paige. She's not here right
now, but she's the reason I am.

00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:07,347
-So, I'd like to sing her
this little song called

00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,619
'ASS FACE'

00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:18,625
Hit it!

00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:25,098
-Tyler, come one! Principessa!
Tyler, Jesus man!

00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,499
-Come on! That was awesome,
you're a fuckin' rock star!
Where are you going?

00:54:28,835 --> 00:54:31,771
-I'm, I'm going to get her back.
-Hey, cool man! Then let's go
celebrate man! We'll have a
beer!

00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:36,743
-There's nothing to celebrate
yet! -Oh there will be man, I
have faith. You'll get Paige
back.

00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:38,745
-Come on, let's go, take
the edge off! Get crazy!

00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:47,087
-Go get her champ!

00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:52,125
-No! God!

00:54:58,832 --> 00:55:03,603
(faster latino music)

00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:11,678
-What are you doing? -Jesus!
Don't creep up on people! -What
the hell are you doing?

00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:15,448
-I am... -You think they are
banging in the bathroom or
something? -No, no I... (slap)

00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:19,085
-That is for cheating on the
sweetest girl in the world!

00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,720
(slap)

00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,491
-And that is for fucking up
her date. -You're right.

00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:28,395
-It's my bad. I deserve that.

00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:33,500
-I'm not doing well with this
whole thing. -Whatever Tyler!

00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,206
-Coffee?

00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:44,077
-That would be nice.

00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:52,519
-It's not like there isn't
precedent for carnal bathroom...
whatever...

00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:59,793
-Like Joe and Veronica. -How
did you know about that?

00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:04,164
-I don't know, somebody told me.

00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:11,304
-Paige said they were
just gonna go for a walk.

00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:13,306
-Go home.

00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:18,411
-That's too much
inactivity right now.

00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:22,649
-I thought you are a big fan of
inactivity. -That's the old me.

00:56:24,517 --> 00:56:26,753
-I'm the new improved 'taker the
world by the balls' type now.

00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,254
-Good for you.

00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,594
-Keep your own balls in your own
pants and it will be just
fine.-Thanks.

00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:39,332
-I appreciate the help.

00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,776
-Tyler! Tyler! What's up man?

00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:54,981
-Hey, what's up? -Hey.
Have you seen Veronica?

00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:57,517
-No. -After we all went
swimming, you didn't see her?

00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,088
-You know what I was doing all
damn day, why are you asking me
all these fucking questions?

00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:03,023
-She's gonna break up
with me, isn't she?

00:57:06,726 --> 00:57:09,562
-Why are you asking
me? -Just tell me.

00:57:10,897 --> 00:57:13,233
Why?!! (crying)

00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,301
(sobbing)

00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:19,172
-How could this had
happened? Oh, Jesus!

00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:24,844
-Tyler, you gotta get
her back for me!

00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:29,282
-You gotta get her back for me!
You could do it! You could do
it! She's my life man.

00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:37,757
-I need her to live. Without her
I can't breathe, I mean, you
gotta get her back!

00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:41,594
-Didn't you tell me last week
you needed to break up with her?

00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:46,266
-Yeah, but, I thought I needed
my space. I thought she was
smothering me, but...

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,769
but, that is not the case!

00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:54,741
-I mean, I feel, I feel
like I'm drowning!

00:57:56,576 --> 00:57:58,645
-I never knew you had a
flare for the dramatic.

00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:03,483
-I feel very, deeply...

00:58:12,058 --> 00:58:15,061
-And what are you going to do
about that whole Cameron thing?
-Who's Cameron?

00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,033
-It's that guy, that
Paige is dating.

00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:24,170
-Cameron? His name is Cameron?

00:58:25,405 --> 00:58:28,408
-Yeah. Yeah, nice
guy all in all too.

00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:37,150
-He's a nice guy. -What?!
-Fucker makes pang too.

00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,124
-How do you know this guy?
He is a suit! We hate suits.

00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:48,695
-I dunno, from around. He's at a
cafe in the mornings. -What does
she do?

00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:54,401
-She works at the cafe. -I know
where she fucking works! What
does she do when he's after her?

00:58:56,836 --> 00:59:00,006
-She talks to him. -She talks to
him. -Yeah. It's like 'Hey, how
you doing' or

00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:04,044
'Oh Gee, I'm flattered
but I have a boyfriend.'

00:59:05,845 --> 00:59:07,380
-Shit like that.

00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,019
-I gotta go. -Hey!

00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,724
-I'm gong to find her!
-Thanks for the beer!

00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:27,167
(cool music)

00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:44,517
(cool music)

00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:59,566
(cool music)

01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:13,279
(cool music)

01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:29,229
(cool music)

01:00:37,937 --> 01:00:43,209
(cool music)

01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,555
-Tyler! We've seen a lot of
you today! -Can I get a beer?

01:00:57,123 --> 01:01:00,326
-You always see a lot of me.

01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,401
-Hey Ty, what's up?
-Steve, what's happening?

01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,670
-I just got off work shift!
-That's a long day. -No shit!

01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:16,242
-Hey Joe, two PBRs! -I already
got one. -Oh, it's not for you.

01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,378
-Okay then.

01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:24,317
-So, I heard your gig went
really well tonight. -Yeah, we
did alright today.

01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,454
-I also heard that Paige
had a date with some suit.

01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:36,396
-Thanks Joe, put it on my tap.
-Yeah right Steve, you gotta
job. Let's see some cash on the
bar.

01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,668
-Love you too sweetheart. -I
wouldn't put it that way. -It's
just what I heard.

01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:48,608
-I think you heard wrong since
it's a little more convoluted
than that.

01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:52,212
-Well, then, that's probably
why your gig went so well.

01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,517
-You haven't seen
her, have you? -No.

01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,257
-I decided to spend the rest of
the night... the rest of my life
searching for her.

01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:10,096
-Was that Alison's place you
came out of this morning? -Yup.
-What's going on there?

01:02:11,598 --> 01:02:15,402
-I don't know, sometimes
something. Sometimes something.

01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:18,672
-Yeah, I hear that!

01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:24,778
-So, where are you gonna look
for her? -I don't know, I've
already been everywhere.

01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:28,548
-Wandering around aimlessly
searching for her.

01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:32,385
-Till I run into somebody I
know, then I sit down, have beer
with them, pick the brain...

01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:39,793
-Are you ready to resume your
quest? -As soon as I finish my
beer. -All right, you let me
know.

01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:44,497
- And I'll let you know that she
just walked in with the suit and
sitting by the window.

01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:49,235
(giggle)

01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:59,446
-Go get them tiger! -That's what
I say to him.... -Really?
(laugh)

01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:05,385
-Hi. Might if I sit a spell?
-Tyler... -Cameron right? Tyler.

01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:07,620
-Nice to see you again Tyler.

01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:12,992
-You guys don't actually know
each other, do you? -No.

01:03:12,992 --> 01:03:16,096
-Oh, sure. We met at the
'Dillon' restaurant up the
street, the one with all the
candles... very cozy.

01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,668
-How was your waitress? -She has
a big mouth. -You wanna get out
of here? -No, no absolutely not.

01:03:23,169 --> 01:03:28,241
-Go away! -Will you be
coming home tonight?

01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:31,111
-Wait a minute, you guys live
together? -No, no! -Well we
alternate. Sometimes it's my
place, sometimes it's her place.

01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,515
-She lives on Russian Hill, so
usually it's my place. -Tyler!
-Well, you do!

01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:41,087
-You even have a toothbrush at
my house. I don' have one at her
house, though. Whenever I'm
there we share.

01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,761
-You know what? Maybe I should
go. You guys obviously have a
lot to talk about. Paige, we can
talk later.

01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:52,565
-There won't be a later pall.
-That's it, get up! You stay
right there! -I won't move.

01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:54,701
-I promise. -Really? Thank
you. I'll be right back.

01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:05,745
-Crazy kids. You know the have
been crazy about each other ever
since the peace corps.

01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:08,148
-A Peace Corps? -Yup.
Two years in Zimbabwe.

01:04:09,883 --> 01:04:12,352
-That's the couple bonding in
equivalent of serving in them.

01:04:14,754 --> 01:04:18,958
-I just wanted to talk to you!
All day long, I just wanted to
talk to you. -I've been around
all day.

01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:24,864
-I know but, you know, Pete, he
waned to rehears, and we had a
show tonight and

01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:29,169
Robby, he dragged me at lame
pool party, and Lou wasn't much
help.

01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:32,772
-Jesus! You gotta be the busiest
fucking slacker on God's green
earth.

01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:37,677
-But the second I am on a date,
the second I'm busy, you've got
nothing but time.

01:04:37,677 --> 01:04:42,482
-We could've talk last night
Tyler, where were you then?
-Last night, we didn't need to
talk last night.

01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:46,820
-Last night is what we need to
talk about. -No. We've needed to
talk for a long time, but we're
not doing it now.

01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:50,957
-Cause I am going inside and
I am talking to my date.

01:04:50,957 --> 01:04:56,696
-Speaking of this date, what do
you see in this guy? What is it?
Is it the suit? Cause it's nice
fucking suit and all but

01:04:56,696 --> 01:05:01,534
it's just a suit. Clothes
do not make the man.

01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:06,773
-You know what, he's nice and I
am having a nice time. -Nice,
he's nice. -Yeah.

01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:11,578
-And considerate, and
interesting and he listens. -Ha?
What? -Oh fuck...

01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:13,980
-No, no, wait, come on!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:20,653
-I used to do all that
considerate shit when we first
started going out.

01:05:20,653 --> 01:05:22,522
-You better leave now because
you are being a real asshole.

01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:28,695
-I'm sorry.

01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:33,833
-Naked as the day they were
born... -Steve! -Paige!

01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:37,170
-I was just killing time with
your buddy here. No hard
feelings, right? -Yeah.

01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,073
-Bye Steve!

01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:46,780
-I am so sorry about that. He is
like totally crazy and I don't
know what to do about it.

01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:52,318
-Do you think that they went to
the Crow bar? -Where else!?
-Right. Nice to meet you pall.

01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:13,206
-Hey sailor? Can I
by you a drink?

01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:18,244
-Come on, try not to get in
trouble tonight. -It's Tuesday,
what can happen?

01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:28,121
(pop music)

01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:43,703
I told you right? I fuckin'
said, this is some kinda new,
weird kinda day man, did I not?

01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:46,473
-All the doors have been opened
man, tonight we hit the new
level.

01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:51,011
-Yeah, we did OK
tonight. -Yes we did.

01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:58,051
-Yes we did!

01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:10,397
-Well, well... what with all the
big talk about breaking routine
and changing your life and all
that?

01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:12,532
-This is the last place
I expected to see you.

01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:20,540
-Rome wasn't built in a day
Robbie. -I do believe it
collapsed in a day, though.

01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:25,311
-You wanna shoot
some pool? -Yeah.

01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:33,720
-I've come to a new revelation.
-Since earlier today? -I just
kind of expanded on that one.

01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:39,726
-It has like fifty names up
here! -There's five people in
the bar.

01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:44,030
-Start calling me Dave.

01:07:45,632 --> 01:07:50,303
-Who's next Dave? -I
believe we are Pablo!

01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:54,374
-Oh my! We're playing
doubles. -All right girls...

01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,779
-It came to me when
I was on stage.

01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:05,352
-Al least that's where I first
start noticing it. -Noticing
what? -That feeling.

01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:11,725
-Oh, right, on stage.
-Right. -Excuse me ladies.

01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:19,699
-We're solids. -Pardon? -Solids!

01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:24,070
-Oh, it woild be
good to know that.

01:08:28,475 --> 01:08:34,180
-So was it a good feeling? -It
was just a feeling. It's the one
I hadn't felt in a long time.

01:08:36,683 --> 01:08:40,286
-Kinda the way Paige makes me
feel. She makes me feel like
doing something.

01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:46,359
-Yeah. Well stick with the music
thing because you were so good
tonight. -My voice wasn't so
hot.

01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,096
-Ever hear of Lou Reed?
Man's a tone deaf genius!

01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:56,903
-Yo, speakin of Lou, she accused
me of being chronically
inactive.

01:08:56,903 --> 01:09:03,343
-Which one is Lou. -Paige's
friend, she works over at
Louise's. -Oh, yes, I know her.

01:09:05,712 --> 01:09:09,015
-She's unspeakably hot. -Yeah.

01:09:10,784 --> 01:09:15,121
-I should fuck her.
-Yeah, you do that.

01:09:18,124 --> 01:09:20,460
-Just feel like I can do
anything right now. With all the
shit that happened today I gotta
do something.

01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:26,132
-Stop doing nothing. -Hey
look at that, your shot.

01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:40,180
-Very nice, very nice. A four
rail scratch, that is
unprecedented.

01:09:41,815 --> 01:09:43,616
-I had no shot.

01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:50,623
-It's just that I can go to the
same places every day. I can
talk to the same people every
day.

01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:58,298
-It's not these edifices that
are the problem. -Is that the
right word? -Edifices? -Yeah.

01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:01,301
-I don't know.

01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:07,307
-The thing is that I can put
myself into a routine, and I can
take myself out of the routine.

01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,677
-It's up to me.

01:10:11,978 --> 01:10:15,448
-I find that empowering. -Super.

01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:25,025
-But can I tell you something?
You need to think long and hard
about the routines you take
yourself out of.

01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,195
-Paige is a good routine.

01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:33,533
-Don't be a fucking idiot.

01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:36,403
-Eight ball, corner pocket.

01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:42,742
-We just lost! -Sorry.

01:10:45,512 --> 01:10:51,117
-Well, well, well, very nice
ladies. Loser buys. -Oh, you
guys are very cute...

01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:59,726
Hey! Paige!

01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:19,045
-Oh my God! -That's awful,
what is that? (coughing)

01:11:19,646 --> 01:11:22,482
-Hi. -Hi.

01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,485
-Wendi. -Tyler.

01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:32,258
-Where's Camper? -Cameron.

01:11:33,393 --> 01:11:35,628
-Right.

01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:40,066
-He had to go home. He has
a job. -Good for him.

01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:44,137
-Aren't you gonna buy me a beer?

01:11:47,273 --> 01:11:50,176
-Hey Joe, can I get
to beers? -Yeah.

01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:01,588
-I'm glad you're here.

01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:07,994
-Paige! Darling, you've
arrived! Clink-clink!

01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:11,231
-Barkeep, whatever this
beautiful woman wants! -No, baby
I'm good. -Splendid!

01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:19,773
-You going out with him again?
-I dunno. He's not really my
type. -Yeah, I agree.

01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:24,778
-I kissed him for a while
though. -For a while?

01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:33,219
-Yeah, you know. -No, I don't
think I wanna... Why did you
kiss him for a while? -You
know...

01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:37,190
-I was up at his place having a
nightcap. That's the kind of
drink people with jobs have
before calling it a night.

01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:44,531
-He kept telling me how
beautiful I am, and really
wanted me to spend the night.

01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:48,234
-So it just made sense that
I kiss him for a while.

01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:51,371
-Up at his place. -God it's
huge, compared to yours.

01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:57,744
-Anything else happened?
-Other than kissing?

01:12:57,744 --> 01:13:00,680
-I'm not gonna tell you.

01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:04,751
-What do you mean you're not
gonna tell me? -Not gonna tell
you.

01:13:07,754 --> 01:13:10,623
-I may have had boot slamming
sex with him. -What, with that
guy? Come on! -I may have only
let him feel me up.

01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,529
-Or maybe I was thinking about
you so much, that I made up the
part about making up with him
just to make you

01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:22,168
jealous when, in truth, I went
home to my fluffy pink bedroom
to write in my deary about how
dreamy you are.

01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:30,310
-Or maybe I went down on him,
wrapping my soft lips around his
rock hard... -OK, OK!!

01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:34,147
-And the truth is, you'll
never know the truth.

01:13:34,147 --> 01:13:38,518
-And any time you doubt me
remember this, I can do whatever
you can do

01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:44,224
only unlike you and your
loudmouth friends, I can be
discrete.

01:13:49,963 --> 01:13:53,633
-So you, you are no mad anymore?
-I never was mad. That's what I
found so upsetting?

01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:59,773
-Strangely enough, I
think I understand.

01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,579
-So what now? -I don't know.

01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:13,119
-All I know is that you are
pretty much all I've been
thinking about all day.

01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:16,756
-That's a really good answer.

01:14:17,857 --> 01:14:24,631
"If you really love me

01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:31,604
you'll find me..."

01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,682
-I think you should take me home
now. -Really? -Yeah, I really
do.

01:14:44,984 --> 01:14:47,687
-I think you should take me
home, drop me off, go to your
own home.

01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:54,427
-Get a good night's rest. And
tomorrow we'll both wake up with
clear heads and meet for
breakfast.

01:14:54,427 --> 01:14:57,364
-Does this mean you'll give me
another chance. -If you wanna
call it that.

01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:03,069
-Yeah! I do wanna call it that.

01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:09,309
-Fuck my liver!

01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:15,749
-Robbie, I owe you a beer. -Are
you and Paige back on? -We're
gonna figure it out.

01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:23,156
-Paige! Same time, 7 am!
-Can't, I got a date!

01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,695
-So, I guess this means that
you and I ain't gonna happen.

01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:34,668
-I'm single now, you know? -I
know! And it pains me that I'm
not!

01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,071
-Bye!

01:15:38,638 --> 01:15:40,440
-Fucker!

01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:54,788
(romantic music)

01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:15,275
(romantic music)

01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:38,231
The theory is that nothing
ever changes here.

01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:42,702
Beginning to think that's not
true. Sometimes I barely
recognize the place.

01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:50,043
It's the people that
are always the same.

01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:55,715
It's a pretty fucking
sophisticated way to describe a
bunch of dropouts from the
slacker generation.

01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,253
But today, something knocked
me out of my little rut.

01:17:02,188 --> 01:17:07,293
Maybe it was fate, maybe
it was bad timing,

01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:10,530
so whatever reason, I fought
something I can't fight.

01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:16,870
The Earth rotates once a day,
evolves around the Sun once a
year.

01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,272
Spring is always spring and
there is absolutely nothing you
can do about the holidays.

01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:25,879
Maybe Robbie is right. Maybe
we are destined for routine,

01:17:25,879 --> 01:17:30,550
that's why we think we are able
to see the future. I don't know.

01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,752
Beginning to think that
doesn't apply to me anymore.

01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:38,358
The only thing I know is that
for now and at least till half
of tomorrow

01:17:39,192 --> 01:17:41,528
I'm with Paige.

01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:45,165
Whatever happens after
that, it's up to me.

01:17:46,099 --> 01:17:48,668
Fuck fate! It's overrated.

01:18:00,747 --> 01:18:05,085
-You know what, I need some
coffee or something... What are
you doing?

01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:14,627
-That looks like my sister's
car. -Weird. Why do you think
she parked it there?

01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:22,235
-I don't know. -Oh, well...

01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,171
-She went to Boston for a week.
