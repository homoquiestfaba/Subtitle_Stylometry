1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,669
(Light dramatic music)

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,179
(Ominous music)

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,101
(Light eerie music)

4
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:32,716
(Maggie groaning)

5
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,102
(Maggie whimpering)

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,232
- Ah, you're awake.

7
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,858
That's good.

8
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,504
It's better when they're awake.

9
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:57,199
(Maggie crying)

10
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,948
Look at me, Maggie.

11
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:17,261
Look at me.
(Maggie whimpering)

12
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,638
Look at me, Maggie.

13
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:22,933
Look at me!

14
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,203
(Phone ringing)

15
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,981
(Cordell groaning)

16
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:36,155
What?

17
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:37,564
I'm working.

18
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,825
This is my private time.

19
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,327
Is it so difficult for you
to give me a moment alone?

20
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:46,573
No, we've talked about this.

21
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,168
(Light dramatic music)

22
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,127
Babies cry.

23
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,007
Oh, no, no, we've
been through this.

24
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:55,841
No.

25
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,510
Listen to me!

26
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:01,162
If you're that worried
about it call a doctor,

27
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,331
but don't bother
me again tonight.

28
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,184
I'm working on a
special project.

29
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,020
(Maggie grunting)
(Hammer thudding)

30
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,441
(Cordell groaning)
(Maggie panting)

31
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,177
- Help!
(Suspenseful music)

32
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,530
(Maggie gasping)

33
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,941
- [Cordell] Shut up!

34
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,868
(Cordell screaming)

35
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,369
(Suspenseful music)

36
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,871
(Maggie grunting)
(Foot thudding)

37
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,873
(Maggie panting)

38
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,665
- Help!

39
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:31,668
Help!

40
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,367
When I was 15 years old I
barely escaped with my life

41
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,887
from serial killer,
Cordell ray Colton.

42
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:45,373
Otherwise known as
the east bay butcher.

43
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,617
He brutally murdered 16 women

44
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,470
and is suspected of
killing five more.

45
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,457
He abducted them, tortured them,

46
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,568
and ultimately
strangled them to death.

47
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,404
He was called the butcher
because he hogtied his victims;

48
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:00,981
he tied their hands
and ankles behind them,

49
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:04,634
and then stabbed them repeatedly
postmortem, like a butcher.

50
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:05,410
I was lucky.

51
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,412
Lights please.

52
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,641
That night changed my life.

53
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,234
I went to school and
I got a doctorate

54
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,380
in clinical forensic
psychology and I wrote a book.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,741
And that's what brings me here.

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,668
This semester, we will
delve into the mind

57
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,762
of the serial killer.

58
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,490
Through the study of
their actions and psyches,

59
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,492
we hope to see the
signs and predict

60
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,270
this type of behavior
before it happens.

61
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,189
So, that's my spiel.

62
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:36,275
Any questions?

63
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:38,944
About the syllabus?

64
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:44,783
Okay, we have 10 minutes.

65
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,192
Ask away.

66
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,413
(Light dramatic music)

67
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,126
- It, it was a mistake.

68
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,377
- A mistake?

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,798
That's bold because he left
me, he left our daughter-

70
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,541
- [Richard] I
didn't leave Jenny.

71
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,043
- [Maggie] For a girl that
was just a few years older.

72
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,453
- That's unfair.
- Tell me about it.

73
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,049
- Maggie, Richard is
trying to tell his truth.

74
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:14,037
- He slept with a student at
the school where we both teach.

75
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,889
Okay, so his truth is
he should be fired.

76
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,707
- Look, if that's what you want-

77
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,209
- but I keep my mouth shut
in order to protect him

78
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,636
and to protect our
jobs and to protect

79
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,322
our daughter's future.

80
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,489
I still haven't told Jenny.

81
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,143
- Thank you for that.

82
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:30,662
- Yeah, so she
doesn't understand why

83
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,331
I suddenly kicked her
father out of the house.

84
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,558
She thinks I'm the bad guy.

85
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,150
I'm the bad guy while
he's running around-

86
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,727
- I never meant to
hurt you, I just-

87
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:40,413
- no, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

88
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,507
We're separated and
nothing is gonna change.

89
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:47,571
(Maggie crying)

90
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,930
Just tell me why.

91
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,350
I mean, why did you do it?

92
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:56,188
I thought we were good.

93
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,597
Weren't we good?

94
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,025
- Yeah, Maggie, we were good.

95
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,362
(Somber music)

96
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,495
- Jenny?

97
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,872
Hello?

98
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,438
(Phone ringing)
(Maggie sighs)

99
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,939
Hey.

100
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,624
- So, how was it?

101
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,775
- [Maggie] Predictively awful.

102
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,612
- Oh, tell me you didn't cave.

103
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,538
- Oh, no, no,
nothing has changed.

104
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,782
He's still staying at the hotel.

105
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,727
We're staying separated
and I'm staying miserable.

106
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,787
- Okay, that's the
wrong attitude.

107
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:40,290
We're going out tonight, get
you in the right head space.

108
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,958
- Oh, I, I can't.

109
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,127
I really need to
spend time with Jenny.

110
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,296
- [Alyssa] Hey, you need
to give yourself a break.

111
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,390
Listen to some music, have
a couple of margaritas.

112
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,467
- Oh, hold on.

113
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:52,226
Hello, yo?

114
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,970
- What?
- You wanna grab a pizza?

115
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:54,804
- Oh, no, I can't.

116
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,063
I'm crashing at Renee's tonight.

117
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,641
Sorry.

118
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:58,491
- [Alyssa] Well,
well, sounds like your

119
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,377
social calendar just opened up.

120
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,212
- Yep.

121
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:04,923
So what time?

122
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,667
(Upbeat music)

123
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,594
(Alyssa laughing)

124
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,580
- See, isn't this better
than sweatpants and ice cream

125
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,157
and feeling sorry for yourself?

126
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:17,494
- Hm, no, nothing's better
than ice cream and sweatpants.

127
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,663
- Girl, if you truly believe
that, you really need a man.

128
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,940
- That is the one
thing I do not need.

129
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,258
- Oh, a man for the moment.

130
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,168
A fling.

131
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,611
- No thanks.
(Alyssa sighs)

132
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:30,598
- Maggie, you're an amazing,
beautiful, brilliant woman.

133
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,692
You deserve a man that
treats you that way.

134
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,768
Let's find you one.

135
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,453
Come on.

136
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:38,748
Hm, okay, let's see
who's here tonight.

137
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,201
Too old.

138
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:42,610
Mm mm.
- Oh, my god.

139
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:45,881
We're not doing this.
(Alyssa laughing)

140
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,617
♪ And that's magic ♪

141
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,969
- Too married.

142
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,262
Um, mm mm.

143
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:56,433
Mm, oh my god, don't look.

144
00:07:58,537 --> 00:07:59,978
I went out with
that guy last week.

145
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:02,539
Don't look!
- Which?

146
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:03,707
I was just trying
to see which one.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,317
- Mustache.

148
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,109
- Okay.

149
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,712
Oh, he saw you.

150
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,638
- Oh my god, he's a creep.

151
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,732
I swiped right, we
went out for a drink,

152
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:15,142
he asked to come back to my
place 'cause he's got roommates.

153
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,236
He's 40!

154
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,737
Who has roommates at 40?

155
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,480
- Oh, he's coming over.

156
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:21,583
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, you.

157
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:26,746
- It's um, it's Alice, right?
- Oh my.

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,399
- Close, Alyssa.
- Oh.

159
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,084
- Uh huh, well, it's
actually a girls' night.

160
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,736
- Mm, for my birthday.

161
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,180
- Ooh, birthday girl!
- Uh huh.

162
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:36,573
- [Man] That means I
get to buy you a drink.

163
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,241
- Yeah it does.
- Let's get some shots.

164
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,184
- Ah, shots!

165
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,190
(Kyle clears throat)

166
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,484
- Oh, hi.

167
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,863
- This is gonna sound like
a line, but have we met?

168
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,115
- Yeah, that definitely
sounds like a line.

169
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,202
- Especially because I was
trying to think of a line

170
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,612
when I realized that
I think I know you.

171
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,123
I'm Kyle.
- Maggie.

172
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,668
- Buy you a drink, Maggie?

173
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,604
- How old are you?

174
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:09,530
- Isn't that considered
a rude question?

175
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,291
- Uh, not if I'm asking because

176
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,960
you seem entirely
too young for me.

177
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,613
- I'm old enough
to buy you a drink.

178
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:17,964
I haven't really considered
where our relationship

179
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:20,559
will go from there, but I’m
happy that you're thinking

180
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,726
long term about this thing.

181
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:24,563
I'm 25.
- Hm.

182
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,548
- We're drinking
margaritas, right?

183
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,216
- Yes.

184
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,569
- Be right back.

185
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,573
(Rock music)

186
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,316
So, tell me about you, mags.

187
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,392
- Oh, (giggling), please
don't call me that.

188
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,871
I actually hate that.
- Oh, strike one.

189
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,249
Sorry.

190
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,083
- It's okay.

191
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,402
I teach at Rose
state university.

192
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,313
- Smart and beautiful.

193
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:51,256
What do you teach?

194
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,165
Art history?

195
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,817
Philosophy?

196
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,001
Home economics?

197
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,986
- Criminal psychology.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,597
- Delving into the
minds of criminals?

199
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,849
- Not exactly.

200
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,185
I specialize in serial killer-
- serial killers.

201
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,013
- Yeah.

202
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,665
How did you know that?

203
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:12,944
- Maggie, Dr. Margaret Borgan?

204
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,021
- Mm hm.
- I knew it!

205
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,931
I knew I recognized you.

206
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,117
Your picture's on
the book jacket.

207
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,786
You wrote "intent to
murder," a huge best seller.

208
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:23,955
- Yep, that was me.

209
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,791
- Told you it wasn't a line.

210
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,442
- Fair enough.

211
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:31,129
- Wow, what you went through.

212
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:35,133
I mean, you were the only
one to escape from...

213
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,135
What was his name?
- Cordell ray Colton.

214
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,956
- Well, isn't this
just the cutest thing?

215
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,200
What's going on over
here with you two?

216
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,811
- Well, I've been
crushing on Maggie here,

217
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,222
but I'm not sure
I'm doing so well.

218
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,148
- You're doing fine.

219
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,150
- I'll take fine.

220
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:53,652
Fine is good.

221
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,321
- Alyssa, this is Kyle.

222
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:57,563
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hi.

223
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,492
- I'm gonna steal her from
you for just a minute.

224
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:01,901
- Okay.
- Two more margaritas.

225
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,828
- Mm mm, I'll take those.

226
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:05,997
- Excuse me.

227
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:09,817
(Pool balls clacking)

228
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,487
- Chemistry, intense chemistry.

229
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,415
- I'm married.
- Separated.

230
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,825
From a man who happens
to be a deceitful,

231
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,736
duplicitous philanderer.
- Okay.

232
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,421
- Look, you two wanna
work it out, that's fine,

233
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,907
but you're allowed to
explore your options.

234
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,000
You got a hall pass, girl.

235
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,928
At least for tonight
and that kid is yummy.

236
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,763
I'm just sayin'.
- He's a kid.

237
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,840
- Yeah, but he's hot (giggling).

238
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,100
Mm hm.

239
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,010
- Yeah and he seems polite
and he seems smart and-

240
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,271
- mm hm.
- Yeah, I like the way

241
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,847
he looks at me, no, no.

242
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,533
No, no, no, I, I, I haven't,

243
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,868
I haven't done this in while-
- girl, it's just like

244
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,853
riding a bike, only better.

245
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:46,946
Besides, when's the last time

246
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,781
Richard looked at you like that?

247
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:49,933
- Oh.

248
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,876
- Hm, look, I’m
leaving with mustache.

249
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,545
- Do we even know his name?

250
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,363
- Yeah, of course, it's
Ron, John, I don't know.

251
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,032
Girl, the point is Jenny's at

252
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,459
a friend's house for the night.

253
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,276
You're a free agent.

254
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,219
Go have fun.

255
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,947
After everything that you've
been through this year

256
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:04,872
you deserve it.

257
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,891
Even if it's just for one night.

258
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:08,560
Come here.

259
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,380
You're gonna be okay, right?

260
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,308
- Yes, I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.

261
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
- All right, you have fun.
- I will.

262
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,478
- No, you're right I know
you're gonna have fun.

263
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,798
(Alyssa giggling)

264
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:24,659
(Light rock music)

265
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,704
Sorry.
- No worries.

266
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,231
- Thanks for waiting.
- Of course.

267
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,492
- But I should call it a night.

268
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,401
- That's a terrible idea.

269
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,311
We're just getting
to know each other.

270
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,255
- Yeah, it's just I need to um-

271
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:39,090
- what?

272
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,844
(Ominous music)

273
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,264
Do you know that girl?
- I have to go.

274
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:55,940
(Door creaking)

275
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,432
(Maggie panting)

276
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,201
Come on.

277
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:11,605
- Maggie, you left
them at the table.

278
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:15,034
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

279
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:16,702
Who was that girl back there?

280
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:17,629
- She's um...

281
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,285
She's the girl that my
husband left me for.

282
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,428
Yeah, she ugh.

283
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,865
She follows me around, you know?

284
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,218
She um, she sometimes
calls my cell phone.

285
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,460
It's a little weird.

286
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
- Hey, I'm so sorry.

287
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,483
Do you want me to
go talk to her?

288
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,820
- I want you to kiss me.

(Both chuckling)

307
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,961
- Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

308
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:45,032
- Yes.
(Kyle laughing)

309
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,050
- I like this.

310
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:47,552
You and me.

311
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:55,468
- So, what's with the hotel?

312
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,286
- It's temporary.

313
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,713
I'm trying to find
a place to buy here.

314
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,398
- [Maggie] Hm.

315
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,886
- What was he like?

316
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,647
- Who?

317
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,391
- The east bay butcher.

318
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,726
Cordell ray Colton.
- I don't...

319
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,579
I don't wanna talk
about that right now.

320
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:17,156
- Why not?

321
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:18,917
You wrote a book about it.

322
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,754
And I always felt you
left stuff out of it.

323
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,340
- Um...

324
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:32,764
- And at one point in here you,
you say he got a phone call,

325
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,849
but you don't say from whom.

326
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:36,434
Could you tell?

327
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,845
What were they talking about?

328
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,422
- Hey, what's all this about?

329
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,258
- Come on, it's
interesting to me.

330
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,851
This psycho is about
to end your life,

331
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,113
but somehow you find the
strength to get away?

332
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,115
I mean, how did you do that?

333
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,201
He didn't make any mistakes
with all the others.

334
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,014
- It wasn't an
accident meeting you

335
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,699
at the bar tonight was it?

336
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,108
- What do you mean?

337
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,044
Of course it was.
- Oh, you're lying.

338
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,872
- What, Maggie, calm down.

339
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,191
- Oh, I'm calm.

340
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,784
You're lying and I'm leaving.

341
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,804
- Hold on, where are you going?

342
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,639
- What are you, like a
tabloid reporter trying

343
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,033
to get information
to make a quick buck?

344
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,868
Or are you like some
whacked out groupie

345
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,220
who's just fascinated
with serial killers?

346
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:22,388
- You're talking crazy.

347
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,299
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

348
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:26,392
- Yeah, he was gonna murder me.

349
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,152
Well, you read the book.

350
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,305
I would have been his 17th
victim and you thought

351
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,991
that would make for
good pillow talk?

352
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,902
- You didn't seem upset when
you talked about it in class.

353
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,573
(Light dramatic music)

354
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,416
- What did you say?

355
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,335
(Kyle sighs)

356
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,912
- You're right, it
wasn't an accident

357
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,006
meeting you at the bar.

358
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,070
- Who are you?

359
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:56,180
- I'm in your criminal
psychology class.

360
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,924
(Maggie sighs)

361
00:16:59,019 --> 00:16:59,851
- You're a student?

362
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,520
You told me you were 25.

363
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,190
- That's true, I traveled for
a while after high school.

364
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:09,510
- I never would have been here
if I knew you were a student.

365
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,029
- That's why I
didn't mention it.

366
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,033
Maggie, wait.

367
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,444
- Get outta my way.

368
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:19,762
- Look, Maggie, I'm sorry.

369
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,522
I, I just wanted to
get to know you without

370
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,874
the whole school
thing in the way.

371
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,267
- Let me out of
your place please.

372
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,168
Now.

373
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,712
- I'm really sorry.

374
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:32,175
(Light eerie music)

375
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:50,068
- Morning.
- Oh my gosh, you scared me.

376
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,978
I thought you were at Renee's?

377
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,573
- I was, but we got into
a fight and I came home.

378
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,318
What about you, big night?

379
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,579
- No, why?

380
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:05,249
I just um, I was, I
stayed at Alyssa's.

381
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:07,752
- Right.

382
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,259
So, I guess you doing the
walk of shame means that you

383
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,428
and dad really aren't
getting back together, huh?

384
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,748
- I stayed in
Alyssa's guest room.

385
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,726
- Mom, I'm not a child.

386
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,394
You can tell me.

387
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,665
- No, I don't think your father

388
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,851
and I are getting back together.

389
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,112
(Jenny scoffs)

390
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,526
(Bugs chirping)

391
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,287
(Phone ringing)

392
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,624
(Maggie sighs)

393
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:47,458
Hello?

394
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,128
Hello?

395
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,950
(Phone ringing)

396
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,362
Hello, listen, Sarah,
I know this is you.

397
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,046
You can have my husband, okay?

398
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,789
Good luck with that, now
just stop calling me please

399
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,142
or I'm calling the police.

400
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:10,106
(Light eerie music)

401
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,209
(Maggie sighs)

402
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,468
(Door thudding)
(Maggie gasps)

403
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,321
(Suspenseful music)

404
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,251
(Soda can cracking)

405
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,070
- Oh, dammit.

406
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:42,755
Gave me a heart attack.

407
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,331
- What are you doing here?

408
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,832
- I didn't mean to wake you.

409
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,576
I just had to get something
out of the garage.

410
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,428
- So you just break
into my house?

411
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,247
- I have a key.

412
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:54,099
I live here.
- Lived, past tense.

413
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,693
- I'm miserable
without you, Maggie.

414
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,364
This whole thing has made me
realize how much I love you.

415
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,995
Can we give it one more try?

416
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,374
- She's still following me.

417
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:13,044
Your fling.

418
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:15,046
I saw her again last night.

419
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,791
- You know, maybe it's
just a coincidence?

420
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,884
- No, it's not.

421
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,703
And you promised me you
were gonna deal with her.

422
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:25,056
- I did and I'm handling it.

423
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:29,393
As for us, I can't give up.

424
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:31,562
I'm not going to, okay?

425
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,068
I'm gonna show you that
I can be a better man.

426
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,314
(Ominous music)

427
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,201
(Birds chirping)

428
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,047
- Well, hello there.

429
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,835
(Suspenseful music)

430
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:07,723
(Dramatic music)
(Maggie gasping)

431
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,231
- Jenny, cereal.

432
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,112
- You know, I could
live in a freshman dorm.

433
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,505
Hang out with my peers,
we can party at nine,

434
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,189
then roll outta
bed and go to class

435
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,616
in our pajamas in the morning.

436
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:30,937
But no, I live here with
my overly cheery mother,

437
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,773
the college professor.

438
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,126
It's really not the college
experience I was asking for.

439
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,354
- Well, this overly
cheery college professor

440
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,356
just happens to
pay your tuition.

441
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,616
- Well, I mean, you
and dad teach here,

442
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,801
so that's why it's free.

443
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,694
I'm not really sure what
it is you're paying for.

444
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,471
- Uh, I paid for that cereal.

445
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,807
Do you want it or not?

446
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,294
It's your favorite.

447
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,481
- Lucky me.
(Maggie laughing)

448
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,135
(Light dramatic music)

449
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,638
Oh my god, it reeks in here.

450
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,640
What is that smell?

451
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,400
(Suspenseful music)

452
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,570
(Jenny screaming)

453
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,664
(Dramatic music)

454
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,392
- A dead animal in
our car, Richard.

455
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,576
- What are you talking about?

456
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,486
Are you okay?

457
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,246
- Your girlfriend, you know
the one who keeps calling me

458
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,731
then hanging up, then just
showing up wherever I am?

459
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,841
- [Richard] Showing up?

460
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,492
Showing up where?
- She put a dead possum

461
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,086
in my car.
- What?

462
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,421
Maggie, she would never
do anything like that.

463
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,997
- You know what, if she
doesn't leave our family alone,

464
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,184
I am telling you I am
going to the police.

465
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,427
I will talk to the university
administration if I have to.

466
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,688
I don't care.
- No!

467
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,249
Please do not do that.
(Sarah giggling)

468
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,675
- You know what?
- All right.

469
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,085
I'll see you guys
back at the house.

470
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,253
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm done waiting for you

471
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:45,754
to step up and deal with her.

472
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:47,031
I'm gonna handle this myself.

473
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,424
- What does that mean?
(Ominous music)

474
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,442
Maggie, Maggie, don't do any-

475
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,037
(dramatic music)

476
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:59,618
- Excuse me.
- Professor Borgan.

477
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,604
What a nice surprise.

478
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:03,105
You seem upset about something.

479
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:04,607
- I want you to leave
me and my family alone.

480
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,609
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

481
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:10,779
- Stop calling me.
- Wow, really?

482
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:13,282
I have much better things to do.

483
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,725
And anyway, when I saw
you out the other night

484
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,394
it was obvious that
you had moved on.

485
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:19,455
Back on the dating scene.

486
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,790
- What I do and who I see
is none of your business,

487
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,294
but putting a dead animal
in my car, that's sick.

488
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:26,645
And it's criminal.

489
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,480
- Dead animal?

490
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,223
That's ridiculous.

491
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,967
- I'm not playing games.

492
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,744
Stay the hell away
from my family.

493
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,913
- Does the rest of your
family feel the same way?

494
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,232
And by the way, I’m
pretty sure threatening

495
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,085
a student is grounds
for dismissal.

496
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,589
- It takes more than an entitled
little girl to scare me.

497
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:51,762
- Richard and I are in love!

498
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,267
- Ted Bundy was a
master manipulator.

499
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,102
He would often feign
an injury in order

500
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:01,163
to lure his victims into
a false sense of security.

501
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,899
But his best weapon
wasn't a fake cast.

502
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,002
Bundy was an accomplished hunter

503
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:09,596
because of his natural gifts.

504
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,452
He was charming, good looking,
no one feared him because why

505
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,955
would he need to hurt anyone
in order to get what he wanted?

506
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:23,961
The answer is he didn't
need to, he wanted to.

507
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,280
He wanted to kidnap these women.

508
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,467
He wanted to torture them.

509
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:32,470
He wanted to kill them.

510
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:35,973
Thank you.

511
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,644
(Dramatic music)

512
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,556
All right, that's all for today.

513
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,817
Please finish the readings
on Dahmer for Wednesday.

514
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,712
Thank you.

515
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,824
(Students talking
over each other)

516
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,053
- I knew there was something
you weren't telling me!

517
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,722
- I don't wanna talk
about it ever again.

518
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,814
I just wanna pretend that
night never happened.

519
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,558
- This could ruin your career.

520
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:03,984
- You told me to go with it.

521
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,837
- I didn't know he was a
college student in your class.

522
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,581
I mean, that's a
crucial bit of Intel.

523
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:11,008
This looks bad, Maggie.

524
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:14,086
I mean, first Richard, now you?

525
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:14,845
- I know.

526
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:17,740
I, I, I'm gonna
talk to Kyle, okay?

527
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,683
I just, I've never done
anything like this before.

528
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:22,928
- Hey, you didn't
do anything wrong.

529
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,005
He lied to you, but
you're gonna be the one

530
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,266
who has to prove it if he talks.

531
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:27,858
- I know.

532
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,753
You're right, you know what?

533
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,196
I'll see you later.
- Okay.

534
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,379
(Suspenseful music)

535
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,863
- Hi, mags.

536
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:52,775
- I told you not
to call me that.

537
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:55,535
- Right, sorry, I've
never been too good

538
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,279
at following directions.

539
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,722
- What are you
doing in my office?

540
00:25:58,874 --> 00:25:59,873
- Door was open.

541
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:00,558
I figured it'd be okay.

542
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,135
I'm sorry.

543
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,620
Did I scare you?

544
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,064
- No, no, no, no, you didn't.

545
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,792
- You really are
something, you know that?

546
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,735
- Actually, I'm glad
you're here because um,

547
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:15,739
we need to talk.
(Kyle scoffs)

548
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,057
- Why is this all
so complicated now?

549
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,967
- It's not complicated.

550
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:19,535
You lied.

551
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:24,582
- You're right, I did lie.

552
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:25,416
And I'm sorry.

553
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:29,494
You didn't ask too
many questions did you?

554
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:31,088
- What's that supposed to mean?

555
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,739
- We both got caught
up in the moment.

556
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,741
- And the moment is over.

557
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,760
You need to understand that.

558
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,821
- You can't deny the
connection we have.

559
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,764
It's special and it's unique.

560
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,491
- It's nonexistent.

561
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,767
- Agree to disagree I guess.

562
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:48,772
- Look (sighs), what
you did was wrong,

563
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,852
but I accept that you
didn't mean to hurt me.

564
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,446
- Why would I hurt you, Maggie?

565
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:56,855
We're consenting adults.

566
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,450
- You should be seeing
girls your own age, Kyle.

567
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,861
You know, going to parties,
having fun, being a college kid.

568
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:04,788
- That's a little
condescending don't you think?

569
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:07,583
- What happened between
us was a mistake.

570
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:15,799
But I need your word
that it stays between us.

571
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:16,800
- Oh, I see.

572
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,453
So that's what you're afraid of.

573
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:21,764
That I'm like Sarah Ellet?

574
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,290
- What?

575
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,885
- Oh, I mean, Sarah tells
anyone who will listen about

576
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,814
her affair with your husband,
but you knew that right?

577
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,485
That's why you cornered
her on campus today.

578
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:35,802
Heard about that too.

579
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,988
Those sorority girls talk a lot.

580
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,473
Maggie, I would
never do that to you.

581
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,641
- Okay, you know what?

582
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,310
You need to withdraw
from my class today.

583
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,812
And our paths can
never cross again.

584
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,497
Do you understand?

585
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:47,981
- Whoa, what did I do?

586
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,333
- Today.

587
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:51,669
Do you understand?
- Yeah, I get it.

588
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,912
I don't love the tone,

589
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,465
but you're under a lotta
pressure right now.

590
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,072
I know this might sound silly,

591
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:05,307
but I'm a fan of yours, Maggie.

592
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:07,926
I just wanna be your friend.

593
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,686
- Please leave.

594
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,190
(Light eerie music)

595
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,605
(Maggie sighs)

596
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:21,773
- [Jenny] Okay, so you
know professor Wetterling?

597
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:23,425
- Mm hm.
- Okay, so I totally

598
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:24,851
failed my last quiz, but
I went to go talk to him

599
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,611
and he gave me a B!

600
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,113
- Yeah, it's 'cause Wetterling
thinks you're pretty.

601
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:31,950
(Jenny laughing)
Hey, mom's home.

602
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:34,770
- Yay, let the fighting begin.

603
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,196
- Who's fighting?

604
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,381
Nobody's fighting.

605
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,443
- Can I talk to you in private?

606
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:42,869
- She is.

607
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:45,297
Sounds like it's gonna be epic.

608
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:46,056
Good luck.

609
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,876
(Jenny sighs)

610
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,396
Oh, mom, by the way,

611
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:54,973
you got another fan
letter from your psycho.

612
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,233
I put it on the counter.

613
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:04,908
- He's still writing you?

614
00:29:07,654 --> 00:29:08,579
- What are you doing here?

615
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,143
(Richard clears throat)

616
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,755
- So, I talked to Sarah
about the dead opossum.

617
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,649
She didn't do that, Maggie.

618
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,318
- Wow, still
defending her honor.

619
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,577
It's noble.

620
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,913
- And she also told me
about your little talk.

621
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,081
Threatening a student?

622
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,600
What are you thinking?

623
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,994
- Someone needs to
protect this family.

624
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,512
- I guess you do
wanna fight, huh?

625
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:34,846
- She's talking to people.

626
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:36,256
- What?
- Yeah.

627
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,274
She's telling everyone at school

628
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,109
about the affair that
she had with you.

629
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,447
- No way.
- Mm hm.

630
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,191
- A student confronted
me about it.

631
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,785
- What student?

632
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:49,119
- I knew this was a mistake.

633
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:53,290
I shoulda taken Jenny and left
the moment that I found out.

634
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,108
How do you think your
little father-daughter time

635
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,276
is gonna go when she finds out

636
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,128
that you had an affair
with a sophomore?

637
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,113
- Look, I know this
hasn't been easy

638
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,524
for you not telling Jenny.

639
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,450
- I don't want her to hate you.

640
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,378
I want her to be happy.

641
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,787
And none of that is gonna matter

642
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:11,049
if she hears what
you did on campus.

643
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:15,604
So, please, tell that
little bitch to back off.

644
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,810
(Upbeat music)

645
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,555
(People talking over each other)

646
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:35,724
(Phone dinging)

647
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:39,077
- Hey, this round's on me.
- Yes, let's make a toast.

648
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:40,896
- [Haley] Sarah,
we're taking shots.

649
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:43,006
- To kappa girls,
who's better than us?

650
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:44,157
- Nobody!
- Nobody!

651
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:45,158
- That's right.
- Yes!

652
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,586
- Sarah, get your
butt over here.

653
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,345
- Coming.

654
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,073
- Ladies, ladies.

655
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,075
Think positive, test negative.

656
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:53,925
- Cheers to the pyramid.
- That's right.

657
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,854
(Girls cheering)

658
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,416
- Woo, oh my.
- Oh, that one hurt.

659
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,251
- Another one, let's go.
- Woo!

660
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,987
- Let's go!
- Talk to a guy.

661
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:06,864
- Oh my god.
- And one time he goes,

662
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,015
"a bunch of people cut up."

663
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:12,110
- What (shrieks)?
- Oh my gosh.

664
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:14,187
- Have fun tonight.
- I hope so.

665
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,039
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

666
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,213
(Light dramatic music)

667
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:33,390
(Suspenseful music)
(Sarah screaming)

668
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,059
(Birds chirping)

669
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:40,188
(Eerie music)

670
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:46,719
(Dramatic music)
(Young Maggie gasps)

671
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:50,556
(Young Maggie groaning)

672
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,983
(Cordell chuckling)

673
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,912
- [Cordell] This
one's a fighter.

674
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:58,156
(Suspenseful music)
(Van doors slamming)

675
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,751
(Dramatic music)

676
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,667
- [Man on CD] Flowing with joy.

677
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:11,169
(Becky sighs)
I am relaxed.

678
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:11,929
I am calm.

679
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,098
I am overflowing with joy.

680
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:17,768
I am relaxed.

681
00:32:19,997 --> 00:32:21,104
I am calm.

682
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:24,332
(Light dramatic music)

683
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,092
- [Police dispatch]
On west 81st street.

684
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:28,336
Okay, I've got a 31 clear.

685
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,740
- [Woman] 13a and I
know of the suspects.

686
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,535
(Becky sighing)

687
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,128
- I am relaxed.

688
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:49,299
I am calm.

689
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:57,474
I am overflowing with joy.

690
00:32:58,702 --> 00:32:59,384
- What?

691
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:00,811
You're overflowing with what?

692
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:03,814
- I wasn't talking to you.

693
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,798
- [Officer Bueller] They don't
teach that in boy scouts.

694
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,316
- The handcuff knot?

695
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:07,150
No, they don't.

696
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:10,970
Officer Bueller, wrap up
the scene with the coroner.

697
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,114
- Sure, where are you going?

698
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,883
- We have an ID on the victim.

699
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:16,159
I have to inform the parents,

700
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,786
and then I'm headed
to the university.

701
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,623
(Light eerie music)

702
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,962
- Oh!
- What the hell?

703
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,731
- Are you all right?

704
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:31,733
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

705
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:32,509
- I noticed.

706
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,680
- I'm, I'm new here
and totally lost.

707
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,757
Do you know, is this
the bard building?

708
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:39,665
- Bard's just two over there.

709
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,833
It's by the library.

710
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,078
- Probably walked right past it.

711
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,430
Well, thanks and sorry again.

712
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,082
- I can show you.

713
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,508
- That'd be great.

714
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,193
I'm Kyle.
- I'm Jenny.

715
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,847
(Ominous music)

716
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,516
- Detective, I don't
know what to tell you.

717
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,777
I've been trying to get in
contact with her all day.

718
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,521
I've called her like 50 times
and her phone's been off.

719
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,706
That's really weird.

720
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,857
- Yeah, Sarah can't
live without her phone.

721
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:05,858
- Is there anyone
you can think of

722
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,711
who might wanna hurt Sarah?

723
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:08,879
Anyone she was seeing?

724
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,047
An ex-boyfriend?

725
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:12,674
- There was...

726
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,221
- Ladies, I'm gonna
tell you something

727
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:19,890
and I need you to
brace yourselves.

728
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,061
We found Sarah's
body this morning.

729
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:26,063
She was murdered.

730
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,292
- What?
- Oh my god.

731
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,476
- Whatever you know
you need to tell me

732
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,311
so we can find out who did this.

733
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:37,390
- I mean, she was seeing
someone, here on campus.

734
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:38,891
- It wasn't just someone.

735
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,152
It's a professor who works here.

736
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:41,745
Richard Borgan.

737
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,084
(Light dramatic music)

738
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,256
(Student crying)

739
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:56,000
- Maggie.

740
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,168
- What's going on?

741
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,337
- Someone murdered Sarah Ellet.

742
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,097
- What?

743
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:08,254
- I just, I can't believe it.

744
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,998
- You knew her well?

745
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:11,833
- She was, she was a student.

746
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:13,593
- I'm gonna stop
you right there.

747
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:16,020
It would best if
you were honest.

748
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:17,614
Take a moment, I
will ask you again.

749
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,117
How well did you know Sarah?

750
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:26,514
- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

751
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:29,200
- Detective Gerardy,
this is my wife.

752
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:30,460
- We won't be long, Mrs. Borgan.

753
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,187
Just a few questions.

754
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:32,754
- Okay.

755
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,466
I will meet you at home.

756
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:38,193
- Actually, would you
mind waiting outside?

757
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,695
I'd like to talk to you as well.

758
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:41,429
- Wait, why?

759
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,308
- Because I want to.

760
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:48,311
Is that all right
with you, Mrs. Borgan?

761
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:49,146
- Of course.

762
00:35:58,139 --> 00:35:59,823
- So, when did the affair begin?

763
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,221
(Ominous music)

764
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:07,555
- [Male professor] Don't go yet.

765
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:08,498
Don't go, don't
leave, don't leave.

766
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:11,001
- Rough day?
- What are you doing here?

767
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,395
I told you to-
- I know, but I just wanted

768
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:15,988
to say I'm here for you
if you need to talk.

769
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,490
I heard what happened and I know

770
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,491
the police suspect your husband.

771
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,010
- What do you mean?

772
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,328
- Mags, come on.

773
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:24,514
He's the obvious suspect.

774
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,408
She was talking, not
keeping their secret.

775
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:27,409
He kills her to keep her quiet.

776
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:29,744
- No, he would never do that.

777
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:31,354
- Would it be the
worst thing if he had?

778
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,857
- What?

779
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:36,751
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

780
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,153
But I can't help how I feel.

781
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:47,370
Thanks for your
help, Dr. Borgan.

782
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:48,872
- Mm hm.
- I'm gonna get on

783
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:49,998
that paper right away.

784
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:58,030
- Who was that?

785
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,716
- I, uh, a student.

786
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,384
- Whenever you're
ready, Mrs. Borgan.

787
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:03,220
- Yeah.

788
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,952
- [Male professor]
Okay, week two.

789
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:13,396
- Strangled, numerous
injuries postmortem.

790
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:15,899
- Postmortem?

791
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:20,403
- Stabbed over 25
times after she died.

792
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:21,646
- Crime of passion.

793
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:23,240
- That's what the textbook says.

794
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,559
Your husband home
Wednesday night?

795
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,653
- I don't know, we're separated.

796
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,412
- For how long?

797
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,733
- A few months,
three, three months.

798
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,810
- Since you found out about
his affair with the victim?

799
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,879
- Since he told
me about her, yes.

800
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,406
- Does your husband
have a temper?

801
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,259
- He didn't have
anything to do with this.

802
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,596
(Maggie sighs)

803
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:49,007
- Text message from Richard
borgan to Sarah Ellet,

804
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,895
11:03 P.M., "we need
to talk now," all caps.

805
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:59,501
Response from Sarah Ellet,
"want me to come over?"

806
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,761
A few hours later
her body's found.

807
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:03,613
- You pulled his phone records?

808
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:06,098
- We do that when
someone's murdered.

809
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,450
We pulled yours
too, Mrs. Borgan.

810
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:10,620
The betrayed wife,
that's pretty textbook.

811
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:16,017
- Well, it's Dr.
borgan, detective,

812
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,461
and I helped write the textbook.

813
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:22,465
- Thank you for your
cooperation Mrs., Dr. Borgan.

814
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,876
If you decide to tell me all
the things you aren't saying,

815
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,636
give me a call anytime.

816
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:28,638
- Thanks.

817
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:38,723
Why are you here?

818
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:39,482
- I didn't go inside.

819
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:43,820
Maggie, I'm a suspect
in a murder case.

820
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,115
Want a drink?

821
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:50,643
- No.

822
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,570
- That detective,
she thinks I did it.

823
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:53,330
- Did you?

824
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,790
- Are you serious?

825
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,669
- Who stands to benefit
the most from her death?

826
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:01,504
- This isn't one of
your classes, Maggie.

827
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,673
I'm not some criminal
for you to profile.

828
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,675
- You texted her the
night she disappeared.

829
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:08,160
- Because you told
me to deal with her!

830
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:09,512
- I didn't mean kill her!

831
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,184
- Maggie, it's me.

832
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:16,686
How could you believe that-
- I couldn't believe

833
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:18,188
that you would
cheat on me either.

834
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,191
So, if this year has
taught me anything,

835
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,919
it's that I have no idea
what you are capable of.

836
00:39:24,938 --> 00:39:26,363
So why don't you just
tell me the truth.

837
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,530
Did you do it?

838
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:28,531
Did you do it?

839
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,327
(Somber music)

840
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,003
- I've really lost
you, haven't I?

841
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,792
- Jenny, I-
- dad, wait, dad!

842
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,219
- Jenny...
- Dad!

843
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:51,295
Dad!

844
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:52,538
Dad, wait!

845
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,348
Dad!

846
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:57,560
(Ominous music)

847
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,566
(Car engine rumbling)

848
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,726
(Door slamming)

849
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,304
- Jenny, stop.
- What's wrong with you?

850
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:17,747
Why do you keep
driving him away?

851
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,824
He wants to come back.

852
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:21,418
He told me that he does,
you're just too bitter.

853
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:22,234
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

854
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:24,087
- Okay, then tell me.

855
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:25,738
What's going on?

856
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:26,481
Why did you kick him out?

857
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:27,982
What's really happening?

858
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,743
- I don't wanna
pull you into it.

859
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,153
- Okay, well this is my life

860
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,505
and the two of you
are ruining it!

861
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:35,098
- Jenny.

862
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:38,768
Your father had an affair.

863
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,087
- You're lying.

864
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,440
He wouldn't do that.
- He did.

865
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:47,777
And it went on for months.

866
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,615
I didn't kick him out,
he left me for her.

867
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:55,618
- Why didn't you tell me?

868
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,123
- There's more.

869
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,625
It was Sarah Ellet.

870
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,629
- The girl that was murdered?
- Yes.

871
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,133
- And you think that he did it?

872
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,284
(Maggie sighs)

873
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,120
- No, but the police do.

874
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,973
- I don't care about the police.

875
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,477
Dad would never hurt anyone,
let alone kill anyone.

876
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,055
(Maggie sighs)

877
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,649
(Somber music)

878
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:40,830
Hey, it's me.

879
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,575
Listen, something really
terrible has happened

880
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:45,627
and I need to talk to you.

881
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:49,506
Just call me when you can.

882
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:51,466
I miss you.

883
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,011
(Rock music)

884
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,342
- I'll take a beer and whatever
my friend here is drinking.

885
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,362
- No, I’m, I'm good.

886
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,531
- Get him one.

887
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,158
You look like you
could use another.

888
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:18,701
- Thanks.

889
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,664
- I guess you're upset
about Sarah, huh?

890
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:26,834
It was a shock to everyone.

891
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:30,713
I mean who would kill such
a sweet girl like her?

892
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:34,551
- Wait, I've uh,
I've seen you before.

893
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,387
Yesterday.

894
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,708
Yesterday in the hall with my-
- your wife.

895
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:43,851
Mags and I are really close.

896
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:47,355
I was there for her after
you ran off with Sarah.

897
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,215
- What did you just say?

898
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,642
- I mean, why would you do that?

899
00:42:51,795 --> 00:42:55,813
You have this amazing woman
and you leave her for Sarah?

900
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:56,739
Sarah's a child.

901
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,726
Well, she was a child.

902
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,154
(Suspenseful music)

903
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,488
- [Richard] Who are you?

904
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,399
- I'm the man who's gonna
take your wife from you.

905
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:11,979
(Fist thudding)
(Richard grunting)

906
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,906
- Hey, come on,
get him off of him.

907
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,167
(Richard groaning)

908
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,429
(Dramatic music)

909
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,988
- You aren't a victim.

910
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:22,323
- You wanna press charges?
- Yes.

911
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,659
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

912
00:43:24,677 --> 00:43:25,393
- Okay.

913
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:30,998
Hey, this guy's
gonna press charges.

914
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:32,333
- Hands behind your back.
- Wait, what? Hey!

915
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:33,943
- Hands behind your back.
- Hey!

916
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:35,594
- [Officer] You have the
right to remain silent.

917
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,946
Anything you say can and will-
- hey come on he provoked me.

918
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:39,841
- [Officer] Be used against
you in the court of law, sir.

919
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:44,621
(Handcuffs clicking)
(Ominous music)

920
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,182
(Door creaking)

921
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:49,533
- Wanna tell me what happened?

922
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:50,460
- Not especially.

923
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,036
- Hm, you get into a bar fight?

924
00:43:52,188 --> 00:43:54,297
Seriously, I think you
owe me an explanation.

925
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:55,965
- That's funny, I
feel the same way.

926
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:57,925
Who's Kyle McCarnick?

927
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,862
- He's in my class.

928
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,547
- He's more than that
though, isn't he?

929
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,867
- What's that supposed to mean?

930
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:06,625
- I beat the hell out
of him last night,

931
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,793
and he's pressing charges.

932
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:08,978
- You assaulted a student?

933
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:11,648
- Did you have sex with him?

934
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,800
(Somber music)

935
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,443
Tell me!

936
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,715
- Once, it was a mistake.

937
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:22,049
- After all the
grief you gave me

938
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:22,975
for sleeping with my student.

939
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,235
- I didn't know, okay?

940
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,403
He lied to me.

941
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:26,888
And we were separated!

942
00:44:26,906 --> 00:44:27,980
- Oh, no you-
- no, no, no,

943
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:29,148
you don't get to do this!

944
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:31,559
You don't get to
demand answers from me.

945
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:32,910
You left me!
- What was it, huh?

946
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:34,078
Revenge sex?
(Hand slapping)

947
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,414
(Richard groaning)
(Light dramatic music)

948
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,508
- Oh my god, I, I'm sorry.

949
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,680
- Yeah, no, I’m, I'm sorry.

950
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,518
For what I did, I don't have
the right to question you.

951
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:51,762
I've ruined everything and
now I've ruined my career.

952
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:52,671
- You know what,
you don't know that.

953
00:44:52,765 --> 00:44:54,098
- Are you kidding me?

954
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,599
The cops already think I had
something to do with Sarah's

955
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,085
death and now I'm arrested
for assaulting a student?

956
00:44:58,104 --> 00:44:59,862
There's no coming back
from that, Maggie.

957
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:04,367
I'm ruined.
(Maggie sighs)

958
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:15,712
(Fist knocking)

959
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,868
- Oh, Kyle.

960
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:23,886
- Looks worse than it is.

961
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:26,389
Come in.

962
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,563
- [Maggie] We need to talk.

963
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,231
- Ever since your
husband beat me up?

964
00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:39,235
You want me to drop the charges?

965
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:41,053
- Yes.

966
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,405
- He really doesn't deserve you.

967
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:45,390
- Did you instigate
what happened?

968
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:47,151
Did you tell him about us?

969
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,746
- And that's what I believe
they call victim blaming.

970
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:52,749
- Okay, I'm just
gonna start over.

971
00:45:55,661 --> 00:45:57,587
What Richard did
was wrong, okay?

972
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:00,982
I just think that
he's in shock over-

973
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,244
- his girlfriend's murder?
(Maggie sighs)

974
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:08,723
Why would you even defend him
after what happened to Sarah?

975
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:12,101
You know everyone thinks-
- no, no.

976
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,512
He didn't have anything
to do with that.

977
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:15,271
- If you say so.

978
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,777
So, drop the charges?

979
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:21,569
- Yes.

980
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:28,451
Look, if you don't he's
gonna lose his job.

981
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:29,452
- I would assume.

982
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:33,030
- Come on, Kyle,
please don't do this.

983
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:33,915
- What do I get?

984
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,518
- I'm sorry?

985
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:39,796
- I'm giving you
something you want.

986
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:40,963
What do I get in return?

987
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,424
- What do you want?

988
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,953
- I want you to tell
me about the butcher.

989
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:48,863
(Eerie music)
- What?

990
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,932
- And I wanna know everything.

991
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,293
Things you didn't
put in the book.

992
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,312
I know it, there has to be more.

993
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,940
Tell me about your escape.

994
00:47:00,376 --> 00:47:02,059
Tell me how you got away
from Cordell ray Colton.

995
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:03,711
- What, what are you...

996
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:04,445
This again?

997
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:08,491
- Yes, this again!

998
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:09,900
How did you get away?

999
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,145
How did you beat him?
- Okay, just calm down please.

1000
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,980
- I'm sick of this.

1001
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,240
You use me, ignore me,

1002
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:19,168
then show up at my door
when you need something.

1003
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,728
That doesn't feel
very good, Maggie.

1004
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:22,580
It certainly doesn't feel fair.

1005
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:26,008
- Look, you're in my class,
you've heard my lectures,

1006
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,069
you've read the book,
you know the story.

1007
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,737
- I want to know how it felt.

1008
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:32,089
Did he cry out when you
struck him with the hammer?

1009
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,015
Did he bleed?

1010
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,092
Did he lose consciousness?
- What?

1011
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:37,002
- One of the most
prolific serial killers

1012
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:38,170
in American history and you are

1013
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,981
the only woman who ever escaped.

1014
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:42,692
Why do you think that is?

1015
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,362
Tell me and I'll drop the
charges against your husband.

1016
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:49,699
- He made a mistake.

1017
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:52,351
He got distracted.

1018
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:54,278
I saw my chance, I took it.

1019
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,329
It's that simple.

1020
00:47:56,766 --> 00:47:58,541
- Because you knew he
was going to kill you?

1021
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:02,786
- Everybody had heard
about those girls.

1022
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:06,107
So, yes, I knew if I didn't
fight, if I didn't run,

1023
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,884
that I would end
up just like them.

1024
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:10,887
- Pretty brave.

1025
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:14,131
I think it's why
I'm so drawn to you.

1026
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:15,892
- No, just stop, please
just drop (panting).

1027
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,853
Drop the charges.

1028
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,691
- One more thing.
- I just did what you asked.

1029
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:26,977
- It's a small thing.
(Maggie sighs)

1030
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:27,737
A kiss.

1031
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,532
One last kiss.
- That is not gonna happen.

1032
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,818
- What could it hurt?

1033
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,078
We've done way more than that.

1034
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:41,400
(Light eerie music)

1035
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,568
You walk away now and tomorrow
I file a lawsuit against

1036
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,737
the university for
Richard's right hook.

1037
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,982
And unfortunately for you,

1038
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,984
our night together
will probably come up.

1039
00:48:50,002 --> 00:48:51,410
- Are you blackmailing me?

1040
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,487
- Call it what you want.

1041
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:54,263
I think I deserve something for

1042
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:55,932
the mistreatment I've endured.

1043
00:49:01,164 --> 00:49:01,896
One kiss.

1044
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,187
No!

1045
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,522
Not like that!

1046
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,281
Like you mean it.

1047
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:16,118
- No.

1048
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,122
- Fine, forget it.

1049
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:25,086
- Wait.
(Light dramatic music)

1050
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:31,950
What the hell?

1051
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:32,969
- A little memento.

1052
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:37,956
- I cannot believe I thought
you were a good person.

1053
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,291
- I can be very charming.

1054
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,311
- Just do what you promised
and drop the charges.

1055
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:48,609
- Thanks for stopping by, mags.

1056
00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:52,989
(Ominous music)

1057
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:05,668
- [Man] 911, what's
your emergency?

1058
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,747
- Yes, I'm calling about
the Sarah Ellet killing.

1059
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:10,840
I know who did it.

1060
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,594
- [Becky] Professor
borgan, may I have a word?

1061
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,246
- Oh, come on.

1062
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:28,024
Look, I'm late for class and
this is harassment, detective.

1063
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:29,859
- This is a search
warrant, professor.

1064
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,178
Would you open your car?

1065
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,032
(Light eerie music)

1066
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:54,050
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

1067
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,220
(Dramatic music)

1068
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:01,115
- Officer, take professor
borgan into custody.

1069
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,466
- Ma'am, back up, please.
- What?

1070
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:04,060
- Back up, please.
- Wait, wait, why, why?

1071
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:05,394
- Please, back up, ma'am.
- Professor borgan,

1072
00:51:05,546 --> 00:51:07,121
you're under arrest for
the murder of Sarah Ellet.

1073
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:08,564
- No, no, Maggie!
- Hands behind your back.

1074
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:09,881
Hands behind your back.
- Maggie, I did not do this.

1075
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,292
- All right, all right.
- Stop resisting.

1076
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:12,459
- [Becky] You need
to calm down, sir.

1077
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:13,143
- Get off!
- This is how people get hurt.

1078
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:14,403
- Maggie, it's not true!

1079
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:16,906
I don't know how that
got there, you hear me?

1080
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:17,740
Get off!

1081
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,244
(Ominous music)

1082
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:36,741
- Richard did not
kill Sarah Ellet.

1083
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,836
- I wish I could agree with you.

1084
00:51:38,988 --> 00:51:40,930
- I have a doctorate
in forensic psychology.

1085
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,248
Could we at least discuss
the case on its merits?

1086
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,934
As professionals.

1087
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:47,328
- Well, technically,
I'm a professional

1088
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:51,107
and you're an academic, but
sure let's look at my case.

1089
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:53,500
I just pulled what appears
to be the murder weapon,

1090
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:55,502
matching tape and matching rope

1091
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:58,505
from the trunk of my
prime suspect's car.

1092
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,341
That's what we
call hard evidence.

1093
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,193
Then there's the way
we found our victim.

1094
00:52:03,346 --> 00:52:06,104
Similar to a case your
husband knows quite well.

1095
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,272
- What do you mean?

1096
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,867
- The victim was
hogtied, wrist to ankles.

1097
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,276
- A handcuff knot?

1098
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,536
- That's right.

1099
00:52:12,688 --> 00:52:14,130
Just like the east bay butcher.

1100
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:17,875
- Why did you search
my husband's car today?

1101
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,301
- Anonymous tip.

1102
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:23,455
- Okay, there's a
student, Kyle McCarnick.

1103
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,382
I think he's involved.

1104
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:28,051
- The young man your
husband assaulted at a bar?

1105
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,294
That's convenient.

1106
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,479
- Well, you know what
else is convenient?

1107
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:32,964
An anonymous witness
who saw the killer toss

1108
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,316
the murder weapon
into his trunk.

1109
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,303
And some additional
inconvenient facts.

1110
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,446
Kyle is stalking me.

1111
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:44,051
And he's obsessed
with the serial killer
Cordell ray Colton.

1112
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,995
So, maybe he's a more
likely murder suspect than

1113
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:49,665
a middle-aged English professor
with no history of violence.

1114
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:52,293
But I'm just an
academic, what do I know?

1115
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:54,728
Oh and you know what?

1116
00:52:54,747 --> 00:52:57,673
My husband, he couldn't
tie a handcuff knot

1117
00:52:57,824 --> 00:52:59,341
if his life depended on it.

1118
00:52:59,493 --> 00:53:00,342
Ask anyone.

1119
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:06,907
The judge is gonna
set bail next week,

1120
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:09,092
and we'll get him out then.

1121
00:53:09,245 --> 00:53:10,911
- How are you so calm right now?

1122
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:12,671
- Hey, I know you're upset-
- upset?

1123
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:14,356
Dad's in jail for murder.

1124
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:16,433
I'm a lot more than upset
and you don't even care!

1125
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:17,026
- Jenny!

1126
00:53:18,437 --> 00:53:19,486
- Congratulations, mom.

1127
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,423
You got what you wanted.

1128
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:24,516
Dad's gone and he's
probably never coming back.

1129
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,701
- This isn't what I want.

1130
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:28,445
I'm just trying to deal
with the situation.

1131
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,038
- The survivor?

1132
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:32,041
Control freak until the end.

1133
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,770
(Maggie sighs)

1134
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:39,289
- Hey, where are you going?

1135
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,216
- Away from you!

1136
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,060
(Door slamming)
(Light dramatic music)

1137
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:57,382
- [Man on CD] I have
an infinite capacity

1138
00:53:57,476 --> 00:53:58,859
to receive and respect.

1139
00:54:00,629 --> 00:54:04,240
I have an infinite capacity
to receive and respect.

1140
00:54:05,801 --> 00:54:07,368
I have...

1141
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,917
(Light dramatic music)

1142
00:54:17,496 --> 00:54:19,922
(Fist knocking)

1143
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,983
- Kyle McCarnick?

1144
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:24,093
- That's me.

1145
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:26,578
- My name's Gerardy,
detective Gerardy.

1146
00:54:26,672 --> 00:54:28,264
May I come in?
- Sure.

1147
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,267
What can I do for
you, detective?

1148
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:34,344
- [Becky] I saw you
the other day talking

1149
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:35,271
with Margaret borgan.

1150
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:40,834
- [Kyle] I have a
class with Dr. Borgan.

1151
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:43,003
- Looked like a
tense discussion.

1152
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:44,521
- I was trying to
negotiate myself

1153
00:54:44,673 --> 00:54:46,173
into a higher grade on a paper.

1154
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:47,524
- How'd that work out for ya?

1155
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,176
- Not sure yet.

1156
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:50,577
She's a hard woman to nail down.

1157
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:55,124
- Pretty fancy place
for a college student.

1158
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:57,960
- Well, it's good to
have a family with means.

1159
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,203
- I'm investigating the
murder of Sarah Ellet.

1160
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,130
Know her?

1161
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,041
- No, but I saw it on the news.

1162
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,360
Just terrible.

1163
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:08,137
- Where were you
Wednesday night?

1164
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:10,121
- I thought you had
arrested someone?

1165
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,307
- Indeed we did, Kyle.

1166
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,217
Our murder suspect is
the man who assaulted you

1167
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:15,702
the other night.

1168
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:16,628
But I'm sure you know that.

1169
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,314
You watch the news.

1170
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:22,543
- Seems like you got a
dangerous man off the streets.

1171
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:23,819
- Thanks to an anonymous tip.

1172
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:30,141
Mind if I use your
restroom, Kyle?

1173
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:31,994
- Sure, right over there.

1174
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:40,336
(Light dramatic music)

1175
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,590
- My god.
(Suspenseful music)

1176
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:12,442
(Taser zapping)
(Becky groaning)

1177
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,870
(Ominous music)

1178
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,377
(Becky groaning)

1179
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:31,387
- The more you struggle,
the tighter the rope pulls.

1180
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,556
That's the genius of the design.

1181
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,542
You can't get out.

1182
00:56:37,636 --> 00:56:38,560
- Please don't do this.

1183
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,472
- But I want to.
(Becky panting)

1184
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,475
(Becky screaming)

1185
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:46,460
- [Reporter] An arrest
has been made tonight

1186
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:47,628
in connection with the death of

1187
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:49,813
Rose state university
student, Sarah Ellet.

1188
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:52,799
News seven has learned
that Richard borgan,

1189
00:56:52,818 --> 00:56:55,244
a tenured professor at
Rose state has been taken

1190
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:58,080
into police custody on
suspicion of murder.

1191
00:56:58,307 --> 00:56:59,415
It's alleged that borgan
(Door thudding)

1192
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:02,643
Was engaged in an
extramarital affair with Ellet

1193
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:07,256
prior to her tragic death.
(Light dramatic music)

1194
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:22,771
(Jenny gasps)
(Dramatic music)

1195
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,445
(Phone buzzing)

1196
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,524
- I'm not finding him locally.

1197
00:57:34,677 --> 00:57:36,118
- Try Boston.

1198
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:37,453
He said he was from Boston.

1199
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:44,585
- Mom, where are you?

1200
00:57:45,871 --> 00:57:47,463
I think someone's (gasps).

1201
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:50,466
(Light dramatic music)

1202
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:03,220
(Jenny gasps)
(Suspenseful music)

1203
00:58:03,372 --> 00:58:05,814
- Okay, I've got something here.

1204
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:07,966
This victim was tied
with rope, strangled,

1205
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,711
stabbed repeatedly postmortem.

1206
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:12,654
An apparent copycat of
the east bay butcher.

1207
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,719
(Jenny sighs)
(Light eerie music)

1208
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:19,828
- I didn't mean to scare you.

1209
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,167
- My dad's in jail.

1210
00:58:28,063 --> 00:58:29,730
Why haven't you returned
any of my phone calls?

1211
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:32,824
- I'm sorry, but I came
as soon as I heard.

1212
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:33,509
It's gonna be okay.

1213
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:35,511
Trust me.

1214
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,308
(Lips smacking)

1215
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,509
- Okay, I've got some
workplaces on him.

1216
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:54,530
- This victim was female,
a Sherry roundtree.

1217
00:58:54,681 --> 00:58:57,032
A wealthy and prominent club
owner in the Boston area,

1218
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:59,326
and this murder happened
just over a year ago.

1219
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,112
- How about club nine?

1220
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,113
Was that hers?

1221
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:05,115
He managed it around that time.

1222
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,434
- Um, there's a few clubs here.

1223
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:11,338
After hours, black
cat, club nine.

1224
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:14,365
Kyle knew her from club nine.

1225
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:15,108
- What are you doing?

1226
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:16,610
- Well, this is proof.

1227
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:17,869
This is the same
mo as Sarah Ellet.

1228
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:18,887
I'm calling the detective.

1229
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:21,014
Wait, hold on.

1230
00:59:23,635 --> 00:59:25,209
- [Jenny] Mom, where are you?

1231
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,211
I think someone's (gasps).
- Oh my god.

1232
00:59:27,306 --> 00:59:28,397
(Dramatic music)
- What?

1233
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:38,865
- Jenny!

1234
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:42,744
- I'm up here.
- Oh god.

1235
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:50,811
Oh my god, come here.

1236
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:53,255
I got your message and-
- sorry, I got spooked.

1237
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:56,074
- My fault I'm afraid.

1238
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,759
- What the?
(Ominous music)

1239
00:59:57,986 --> 01:00:00,262
- [Kyle] I accidentally
gave her a fright.

1240
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:02,413
- This is my friend
Kyle from school.

1241
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,157
- [Kyle] Yeah, I’m
in your mom's class.

1242
01:00:04,176 --> 01:00:06,009
It's nice to see
you, Dr. Borgan.

1243
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,769
- Get out.

1244
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:08,937
- Mom!

1245
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:10,272
- Get outta my house.

1246
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,065
Now!

1247
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,450
(Maggie gasping)

1248
01:00:21,677 --> 01:00:24,694
(Jenny sighs)

1249
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:25,695
- Kyle, wait.

1250
01:00:25,848 --> 01:00:26,288
Don't go.

1251
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,943
Wait, wait, Kyle, wait, hold on.

1252
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:34,278
- Jenny, get back inside.

1253
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:35,780
- What is wrong with you?

1254
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:36,798
- Jenny, it's okay.

1255
01:00:39,044 --> 01:00:40,694
(Lips smacking)

1256
01:00:40,712 --> 01:00:41,803
I'll call you later.
- Okay.

1257
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:51,054
- What do you
think you're doing?

1258
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,223
- You told me I should see
someone closer to my own age.

1259
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,967
- You stay the hell
away from my daughter.

1260
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,802
- But she's so pretty, mags.

1261
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:58,612
She looks like you.

1262
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:03,383
Tastes like you.
(Suspenseful music)

1263
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:04,826
- You leave us alone!
- No!

1264
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:11,500
- I saw you when my husband
was getting arrested.

1265
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:13,502
- So?

1266
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:14,911
- You wanted me to see you.

1267
01:01:15,063 --> 01:01:17,839
You wanted credit for
what you had done, right?

1268
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,825
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I know who you are now

1269
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,160
and I'm gonna go to the police

1270
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,011
and I'm gonna tell
them everything.

1271
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,016
- But you already did talk
to the police didn't you?

1272
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,851
A very nice detective
came to see me.

1273
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,688
You sent her to me.

1274
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:36,599
So that makes whatever
happened to her your fault.

1275
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,342
- What did you do?

1276
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,511
- What you made me do.

1277
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:43,198
Same thing that's gonna happen
to anyone you tell about me.

1278
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,609
Why do you think I’m
here tonight, mags?

1279
01:01:46,762 --> 01:01:49,763
Why would I wait with your
daughter for you to come home?

1280
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:51,039
- To show me that you could.

1281
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:56,953
- Wow, your insight into serial
killers is truly amazing.

1282
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,789
(Maggie panting)

1283
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,699
- Serial killer?

1284
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,552
- As in more than three.

1285
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:04,553
I qualify now.

1286
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:08,056
Thanks to that woman detective.

1287
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,892
She put me over the top.
(Maggie gasps)

1288
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:13,019
- You're just so proud
of yourself aren't you?

1289
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:16,398
- I want you to think about that

1290
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,191
in the precarious
position you're in.

1291
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:23,387
I can touch every
part of your life;

1292
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,389
I can send your
husband to prison,

1293
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:30,203
I can seduce your daughter,
I can possess you totally.

1294
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:33,156
- What is it that you want?

1295
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,751
- Just to show that I'm as
good as the east bay butcher.

1296
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:37,586
Better!
- Ah.

1297
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:41,164
So this is all about Colton?

1298
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,257
- It's about me!

1299
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:45,835
You'll do what I tell you
to do because you know

1300
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:49,080
there is nothing you care
about that I cannot destroy.

1301
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,892
I own you in a way
he never could.

1302
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:54,436
Which means I win.
- What?

1303
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,272
What do you win?

1304
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:03,353
- Don't forget, Maggie, you
talk about me to the cops again

1305
01:03:03,505 --> 01:03:05,672
or to your husband or
even pretty little Jenny-

1306
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:08,174
- oh. - I'm gonna
have to hurt them too.

1307
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:09,284
- No, you stay away from her.

1308
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:14,864
- You're really not in a
position to be making demands.

1309
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:18,442
Just follow the rules and
everyone will be okay.

1310
01:03:18,537 --> 01:03:20,921
- This isn't a game, Kyle!

1311
01:03:22,707 --> 01:03:23,256
- Are you sure?

1312
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:25,926
It feels like one to me.

1313
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:30,931
(Maggie gasping)

1314
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,148
- I cannot believe you just
embarrassed me like that.

1315
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:43,985
- You can never see him again.

1316
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:44,820
- Why?

1317
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,381
What were you and
Kyle talking about?

1318
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,658
- Look, I'm not getting
into this with you,

1319
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:51,051
just know that
what I'm working on

1320
01:03:51,144 --> 01:03:52,285
is going to help your father.

1321
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,163
- Oh, big secrets
with the renowned

1322
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:56,623
criminal psychologist, huh?

1323
01:03:58,910 --> 01:03:59,668
Just tell me.

1324
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:02,671
What were you and
Kyle talking about?

1325
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:04,840
- No, honey I need you to...

1326
01:04:06,251 --> 01:04:07,658
You gotta trust me, okay?

1327
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,344
Please.
- Trust you?

1328
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:12,848
Yeah, you can forget that.

1329
01:04:13,075 --> 01:04:14,407
I'm old enough to
make my own decisions,

1330
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,426
and you cannot
tell me what to do.

1331
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,185
- Come on, Jenny.

1332
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:20,188
You don't understand.

1333
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:23,099
- No, I agreed to
go to school here.

1334
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:26,603
I agreed to live here even
though you drove dad away.

1335
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:27,696
You can't control me.

1336
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,698
Stay outta my life.

1337
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,042
(Ominous music)

1338
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:49,009
(Letter rustling)

1339
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,068
(Light eerie music)

1340
01:05:12,467 --> 01:05:13,724
- [Guard] I'll give
you 10 minutes.

1341
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:15,035
Just stay clear of the bars.

1342
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,758
- Well, well, I thought
I'd never see you again.

1343
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,835
I liked your book.

1344
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:35,746
Though I came off as
a bit two dimensional.

1345
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,098
- I received your letter.

1346
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:42,604
- I've sent you many, but you
don't ever read them do you?

1347
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:50,612
I've always admired
your self control.

1348
01:05:53,191 --> 01:05:55,099
- Where'd you get that photo?

1349
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,011
- He sent it to me, of course.

1350
01:05:58,104 --> 01:06:00,246
- Oh, so this is all you, huh?

1351
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,200
You got one of your whacked
out followers to ruin my life?

1352
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:08,254
- No, Margaret, I don't
want to hurt you anymore.

1353
01:06:10,116 --> 01:06:12,116
When you ran away
from me that night,

1354
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,044
I had no idea the fame
you would bring me.

1355
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:17,864
Your book, it's the only reason

1356
01:06:17,957 --> 01:06:19,808
the world appreciates my work.

1357
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,143
I'm an artist.

1358
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:24,721
And you've provided me with

1359
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:27,816
what I've always
wanted, an audience.

1360
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:30,819
I don't want you dead.

1361
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,988
- So why is he doing this?

1362
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:41,237
- A son often struggles
with his father's legacy.

1363
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,813
- What?

1364
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,150
- My wife changed their names,
moved across the country,

1365
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:47,335
for obvious reasons.

1366
01:06:48,897 --> 01:06:51,822
Being my son comes with
social consequences.

1367
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,249
- Kyle is your son?

1368
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:58,179
- I suppose in some deranged
way he wants to win my favor.

1369
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:03,476
But I'm not interested
in a younger, weaker,

1370
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,647
less interesting
person copying my art.

1371
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:14,029
Homage or not, he's just a run
of the mill copycat killer.

1372
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:18,158
- What does he want from me?

1373
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,537
- He wants to hurt
you to hurt me.

1374
01:07:23,765 --> 01:07:25,431
- What the hell does that mean?

1375
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,501
- Oh, you'll figure that out.

1376
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:32,955
You are the criminal
psychologist after all.

1377
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:36,367
You know, I've grown quite
fond of you, Margaret.

1378
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:37,610
- I'm getting the police.

1379
01:07:37,703 --> 01:07:39,220
You're gonna tell
'em everything.

1380
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,705
- Let's be clear.

1381
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,541
I don't want you to die,

1382
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,802
but I advise against
calling the police.

1383
01:07:45,954 --> 01:07:47,287
That would be cheating.

1384
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,064
And I will be of no
help to you in that.

1385
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:55,195
I want you to defeat
him, as you did me.

1386
01:07:56,464 --> 01:07:58,907
(Eerie music)

1387
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,242
Fair and square.

1388
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:06,397
- If his plan is to kill me,
then what is he waiting for?

1389
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,249
- He wants to break you first.

1390
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,211
By taking everything
away from you.

1391
01:08:13,164 --> 01:08:14,547
First your husband and...

1392
01:08:16,576 --> 01:08:19,577
- Jenny?
- I would hurry if I were you.

1393
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,263
(Light dramatic music)

1394
01:08:22,415 --> 01:08:24,599
Ah, good luck, Maggie.

1395
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:27,268
- Jenny!

1396
01:08:29,664 --> 01:08:30,105
Jenny!

1397
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:34,016
Jenny.
(Suspenseful music)

1398
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:34,776
Oh god.

1399
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,340
(Lips smacking)

1400
01:08:40,358 --> 01:08:43,767
- Wait, wait.
- Sure, I'm sorry.

1401
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,027
I'm moving too fast.

1402
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,530
- You know that I want to.

1403
01:08:47,682 --> 01:08:48,865
I'm just going crazy
with everything

1404
01:08:49,017 --> 01:08:49,515
that's going on right now.

1405
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:51,367
- You're not crazy.

1406
01:08:51,519 --> 01:08:53,294
Your whole world is upside down.

1407
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:56,297
- Yeah, like it's your fault.
(Both chuckling)

1408
01:08:56,449 --> 01:08:59,025
So, what did you and
my mom talk about?

1409
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:01,118
- She was upset because
I'm a student in her class

1410
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:02,262
and I'm older than you.

1411
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,140
And I was just reassuring her.

1412
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,307
You know how parents can be.

1413
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:09,310
- Are you close
with your parents?

1414
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:13,148
- Dad's been gone
since I was a kid.

1415
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:15,275
And he was my hero, but
he never had time for me.

1416
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:18,444
- What about your mom?

1417
01:09:20,398 --> 01:09:23,158
- With dad gone, she
just couldn't handle

1418
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:24,284
being alone I guess.

1419
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:27,829
She um, killed herself.

1420
01:09:29,557 --> 01:09:30,832
- Oh my god, Kyle, I'm so sorry.

1421
01:09:32,076 --> 01:09:33,001
How old were you?
- 12.

1422
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:37,321
After that there was just
foster home after foster home.

1423
01:09:37,415 --> 01:09:38,965
They kept getting rid of me.

1424
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:41,342
Apparently I was a bad kid.

1425
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,304
- I can't believe that's true.

1426
01:09:46,424 --> 01:09:47,348
- No one would believe it.

1427
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,429
(Lips smacking)

1428
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:56,024
(Light music)

1429
01:10:13,785 --> 01:10:15,859
(Fist knocking)

1430
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:16,878
Wonder who that could be.

1431
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:18,379
- Should I?
- No.

1432
01:10:19,457 --> 01:10:20,548
This won't take a second.

1433
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,461
(Hand pounding)

1434
01:10:25,613 --> 01:10:27,296
(Maggie sighs)
Mags.

1435
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:28,798
What a pleasant surprise.

1436
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:29,557
- Where is she?

1437
01:10:31,469 --> 01:10:32,301
(Ominous music)
Jenny.

1438
01:10:32,454 --> 01:10:33,636
- Mom, what are you doing here?

1439
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,212
Leave me alone.

1440
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:36,547
- It's okay, Jenny.

1441
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,957
Just give me a sec.

1442
01:10:37,976 --> 01:10:38,900
I'll handle this.

1443
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:43,905
Unfortunately, it seems your
daughter doesn't wanna see you.

1444
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:47,725
- You win.
- What's that?

1445
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,986
- Tomorrow night, my place.

1446
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,745
You and me.

1447
01:10:52,474 --> 01:10:53,397
I'll answer every
question you have

1448
01:10:53,491 --> 01:10:54,582
about the east bay butcher.

1449
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:56,734
- If everything is in
your book like you said,

1450
01:10:56,828 --> 01:10:58,419
why should I bother?

1451
01:10:58,571 --> 01:10:59,254
- Because it isn't.

1452
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:03,258
I left one part
out, out of my book,

1453
01:11:04,819 --> 01:11:06,502
and out of my lectures.

1454
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,837
- You're lying.

1455
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:10,932
- And you're gonna find it
very enlightening, Kyle.

1456
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:15,495
Surprising in fact.

1457
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:16,420
- I still don't believe you.

1458
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:17,680
- Well, I'm telling
you the truth

1459
01:11:17,832 --> 01:11:19,089
because I know
the danger I'm in.

1460
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,016
I know the danger
my daughter is in,

1461
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,517
and I want it to stop.

1462
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:24,520
I want you away from her now.

1463
01:11:24,672 --> 01:11:26,263
- And if I do, then
tomorrow night-

1464
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,282
- whatever you want.

1465
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:30,693
9:00 P.M., I'll be alone.

1466
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:32,528
- If you run.

1467
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,788
- You'll know where to find us.

1468
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,250
- Jenny.
- What?

1469
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,278
(Dramatic music)

1470
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,038
What are you doing?

1471
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,523
Let go, Kyle!

1472
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:45,541
- I'm not interested
in you anymore.

1473
01:11:45,693 --> 01:11:47,877
Leave me alone.
(Door slamming)

1474
01:11:48,029 --> 01:11:49,304
- Honey.
- Just take me home.

1475
01:11:56,037 --> 01:11:57,478
- Wait, wait, I need
to talk to you please.

1476
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,388
- [Jenny] I don't
wanna talk to you.

1477
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,481
- It's important.

1478
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:01,965
There are things that
you need to know.

1479
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,985
- I need to know what you did
to make him act like that.

1480
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:06,470
- I didn't do anything,
that's who he is.

1481
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:08,305
He's been lying to you.

1482
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:09,732
- You don't even know him.

1483
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:10,491
- I do know him.

1484
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:13,661
That's how I knew
how to find you.

1485
01:12:13,813 --> 01:12:15,721
- What does that mean, mom?

1486
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:17,981
How did you know where he lived?

1487
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:20,501
- Because I've
been there before.

1488
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:21,336
- Oh my god.

1489
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:24,297
- I made a mistake.

1490
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,566
I didn't know he was a student.

1491
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:28,084
He targeted me,
he manipulated me.

1492
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:30,678
Just like he's manipulating you.

1493
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,139
- You slept with him?

1494
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:35,808
You slept with Kyle?

1495
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:39,595
Answer me!

1496
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:40,521
- I did, yeah.

1497
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,524
- What is wrong with you?

1498
01:12:43,751 --> 01:12:45,751
- I wanna tell you
everything, honey.

1499
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:47,362
I'm just, I'm trying
to protect you.

1500
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:50,089
- Yeah, 'cause you
and dad are just doing

1501
01:12:50,182 --> 01:12:51,657
a great job of
protecting me, right?

1502
01:12:56,522 --> 01:13:00,041
- Kyle killed Sarah Ellet.
(Ominous music)

1503
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:03,603
- What?

1504
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:04,528
- That's what I've
been working on.

1505
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:06,047
And I'm gonna prove it.

1506
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:08,674
- I can't...

1507
01:13:11,112 --> 01:13:13,388
I don't even know what
to believe anymore.

1508
01:13:30,632 --> 01:13:32,481
- Hey, thank you for doing this.

1509
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,574
- Did I have a choice?

1510
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:35,651
- I just, I
understand and respect

1511
01:13:35,803 --> 01:13:37,578
that you're old enough
to do whatever you want.

1512
01:13:37,805 --> 01:13:38,538
- Hey, Jenny.

1513
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:40,706
- I appreciate you.

1514
01:13:41,993 --> 01:13:43,809
- I do not need a babysitter.

1515
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:45,978
- No, it's just
for tonight, okay?

1516
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:47,588
I'll tell you
everything tomorrow.

1517
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,998
- Whatever.

1518
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:53,386
- Hey, I love you so much.

1519
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:58,099
- Where are you going?

1520
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:01,269
- Um, I'm gonna tell
you everything tomorrow.

1521
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,104
- You be careful.

1522
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:05,606
- Yep.

1523
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:07,733
Okay.

1524
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:10,445
- Wait, mom.

1525
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:13,448
I love you too.

1526
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:16,358
(Maggie sighs)

1527
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,618
- See you soon.

1528
01:14:20,014 --> 01:14:20,621
- Come on.

1529
01:14:24,777 --> 01:14:27,628
(Light dramatic music)

1530
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,302
(Door slamming)

1531
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:37,472
(Door latch clicking)

1532
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,310
(Dramatic music)

1533
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:24,185
(Eerie music)

1534
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,023
- You coulda rang the doorbell.

1535
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:30,858
- But what kind of
entrance is that?

1536
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:32,652
- You have a flair
for the dramatic.

1537
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,198
- More like an instinct
for self-preservation.

1538
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,035
You look amazing.

1539
01:15:45,783 --> 01:15:47,041
All dolled up for me?

1540
01:15:48,027 --> 01:15:49,359
(Maggie sighs)

1541
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:52,713
- Well, I did tell you you
could have whatever you want.

1542
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,296
(Ominous music)

1543
01:16:00,448 --> 01:16:01,964
- You think I want you for sex?

1544
01:16:02,116 --> 01:16:04,058
That I'm some lovesick
stalker or something?

1545
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,044
Is that what you think?

1546
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,564
I want you for your mind.
(Maggie groans)

1547
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:10,523
Not your body.

1548
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:12,858
- You're hurting me, Kyle.

1549
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:14,735
- Like he did?

1550
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:17,963
Like he hurt you?

1551
01:16:17,982 --> 01:16:22,076
- No, you're different
than your father.

1552
01:16:25,306 --> 01:16:28,749
- Mags, you're
full of surprises.

1553
01:16:29,827 --> 01:16:32,878
- Hm, I went to the prison.

1554
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,758
And I saw him.

1555
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:40,553
- What did he say?

1556
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:43,505
- He said you were gonna kill me

1557
01:16:43,658 --> 01:16:45,841
if I didn't give
you what you wanted.

1558
01:16:45,993 --> 01:16:46,434
- He's right.

1559
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:49,228
- So, what do you wanna know?

1560
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:55,835
The detail I left
out of my book,

1561
01:16:55,928 --> 01:16:57,278
but I didn't want
anyone to know.

1562
01:16:58,189 --> 01:16:58,738
- Tell me.

1563
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:03,075
- Was you.
(Eerie music)

1564
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:07,179
You're the reason I escaped.

1565
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:11,959
(Phone ringing)
(Cordell groans)

1566
01:17:17,525 --> 01:17:18,299
- What?

1567
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:18,966
I'm working!

1568
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:22,470
This is my private time.

1569
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,809
Is it so difficult for you
to give me a moment of peace?

1570
01:17:30,629 --> 01:17:32,313
Well, what's wrong with him?

1571
01:17:32,464 --> 01:17:33,314
Babies cry.

1572
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:38,377
If you're that worried
about it call a doctor,

1573
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:39,820
but don't bother
me again tonight.

1574
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:43,473
I'm working on a
special project.

1575
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:44,825
(Suspenseful music)

1576
01:17:45,052 --> 01:17:45,567
(Hammer thudding)
(Young Maggie grunts)

1577
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:46,402
(Cordell groans)

1578
01:17:46,554 --> 01:17:48,954
- You were the distraction.

1579
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,502
You were a sick baby,
your mother was worried,

1580
01:17:56,155 --> 01:17:57,505
but your father didn't care.

1581
01:17:59,158 --> 01:17:59,840
(Young Maggie grunts)
(Foot thudding)

1582
01:17:59,992 --> 01:18:02,584
(Young Maggie panting)

1583
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:03,660
- Help!

1584
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,470
Help me!

1585
01:18:07,074 --> 01:18:07,682
- Cordell?

1586
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,075
What did you do?

1587
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:12,411
What did you do to him?
(Suspenseful music)

1588
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:12,978
- Help!

1589
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:18,192
- You saw me when I was a baby?

1590
01:18:21,105 --> 01:18:23,180
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1591
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,865
- Because you two were innocent.

1592
01:18:26,944 --> 01:18:28,869
No one needed to know
that you existed.

1593
01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:31,205
- I wasn't innocent for long.

1594
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:34,600
After you escaped
from that shed,

1595
01:18:34,693 --> 01:18:36,043
the truth came out
about my father.

1596
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,048
My mother took me away, lied
to everyone about who we were.

1597
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,384
About who I was.

1598
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,887
Until she realized what I was.

1599
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:48,723
- And what were you?

1600
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:51,875
- How do most serial
killers get their

1601
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,352
first taste for killing, mags?

1602
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:55,187
Don't you know?

1603
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:58,566
- Killing animals.

1604
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,403
- Mom loved our dog.

1605
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,966
Don't know if she was more
upset about the dead animal

1606
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:08,743
or that her son was a killer.

1607
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,899
The next day, she told
me who my father was,

1608
01:19:15,993 --> 01:19:16,751
and not to be like him.

1609
01:19:18,737 --> 01:19:21,088
I think she was just trying
to scare me straight.

1610
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,716
She went in her room
and hung herself.

1611
01:19:25,152 --> 01:19:25,760
I was 12.

1612
01:19:29,173 --> 01:19:32,266
I've gone to the
prison, written letters,

1613
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:35,102
he's never accepted me.

1614
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:39,515
I didn't know until just now
why he's always hated me.

1615
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:40,833
- And why is that?

1616
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:44,111
- Because of me, you
escaped and he was caught.

1617
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,949
A crying baby that he
would never forgive.

1618
01:19:51,195 --> 01:19:52,453
Thank you, Maggie.

1619
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:56,773
Thank you for telling me that.

1620
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:58,292
- Can you answer
something for me?

1621
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:04,039
How did you get that
detective to believe

1622
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:06,634
that Richard killed Sarah?

1623
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,469
(Kyle chuckling)

1624
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:18,370
- What are you doing?
(Alyssa hushes)

1625
01:20:18,389 --> 01:20:18,979
- This is it.

1626
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:23,133
- You think I can't
outsmart some local cops

1627
01:20:23,227 --> 01:20:24,443
and your idiot husband?

1628
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,489
- Richard is not an idiot.

1629
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,641
- What is this?

1630
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,643
Why is she here with him?
- Jenny, I love you,

1631
01:20:33,737 --> 01:20:35,162
but shut up and listen.

1632
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:38,481
- Yet he's in jail right
now because of you.

1633
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,667
- I saw your argument.

1634
01:20:40,911 --> 01:20:42,169
I followed him to the bar.

1635
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:43,653
He was weak.

1636
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:45,414
- So you picked
a fight with him?

1637
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,509
- By the time the cops took
him in, the bar was empty.

1638
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,661
I popped his trunk,
left the knife,

1639
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:53,906
called it in the next day.

1640
01:20:53,924 --> 01:20:55,516
- She's getting a confession.

1641
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,351
- Now you believe he
killed Sarah Ellet?

1642
01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:03,524
- She didn't give me a choice.

1643
01:21:05,102 --> 01:21:07,769
Luckily she didn't tell
anyone where she was going.

1644
01:21:07,922 --> 01:21:11,532
But she's a cop,
they won't give up.

1645
01:21:11,759 --> 01:21:13,534
So, unfortunately, I
have to be leaving soon.

1646
01:21:18,616 --> 01:21:20,190
- That's it, that's the signal!

1647
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,710
(Ominous music)

1648
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,454
- I need a drink.

1649
01:21:25,606 --> 01:21:27,289
You want one?

1650
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:29,550
- I don't think I want
you too far away from me.

1651
01:21:31,278 --> 01:21:35,222
- Oh, I thought you were
just interested in my mind?

1652
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:40,895
- Maggie, you are fearless.

1653
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,398
Like you've got ice water
running through your veins.

1654
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:50,404
It's time for me to go, which
means it's time for you to go.

1655
01:21:51,632 --> 01:21:52,531
- Wait, wait.

1656
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,536
(Ominous music)

1657
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:01,582
- He's looking right
into the camera.

1658
01:22:02,826 --> 01:22:03,566
Get the police there now!

1659
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,085
- I'm still on hold, Jenny.

1660
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:07,070
- Funny, you don't strike me

1661
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,815
as a Teddy bear
kinda girl, mags.

1662
01:22:09,908 --> 01:22:11,717
- That's because
you don't know me.

1663
01:22:13,578 --> 01:22:16,722
I'm a softie at heart.
(Ominous music)

1664
01:22:19,918 --> 01:22:24,730
(Teddy bear ripping)
(Dramatic music)

1665
01:22:26,091 --> 01:22:28,016
- I get why my
father respects you.

1666
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,776
- That's funny.

1667
01:22:31,172 --> 01:22:33,113
Because he certainly
doesn't respect you.

1668
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:37,618
- What did you say?

1669
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:41,513
(Hidden camera thudding)

1670
01:22:41,606 --> 01:22:43,791
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

1671
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:48,629
That's why you targeted
me, seduced me,

1672
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,874
seduced my daughter, got
my husband thrown in jail,

1673
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:54,876
because you're trying to
gain your father's respect

1674
01:22:55,029 --> 01:22:56,470
by finishing what he couldn't.

1675
01:22:58,382 --> 01:22:59,640
Well, it's not gonna work.

1676
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:04,478
Still trying to impress daddy?

1677
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,648
It's pathetic.

1678
01:23:08,726 --> 01:23:11,226
You're an embarrassment to him.

1679
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:13,320
Tarnishing his accomplishments.

1680
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,657
A shameless copycat.

1681
01:23:18,385 --> 01:23:20,569
He's never gonna love you.

1682
01:23:20,721 --> 01:23:21,570
- Shut up!
(Hand slapping)

1683
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,146
(Maggie screams)

1684
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:25,557
(Suspenseful music)

1685
01:23:25,576 --> 01:23:26,575
- It's over.

1686
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:27,909
The cops are on the
way and you're going

1687
01:23:28,062 --> 01:23:29,169
to go to jail just
like your dad.

1688
01:23:30,564 --> 01:23:31,913
- You got in my
head a little there.

1689
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,674
(Kyle panting)

1690
01:23:33,825 --> 01:23:35,175
- Don't come any closer.

1691
01:23:35,327 --> 01:23:36,493
I'll do it.

1692
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,680
- You did your whole
criminal psychology thing.

1693
01:23:40,758 --> 01:23:43,517
Okay, I'm impressed.

1694
01:23:44,669 --> 01:23:45,644
- I mean it.

1695
01:23:47,431 --> 01:23:48,689
- You're gonna stab me?

1696
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,432
- Don't.

1697
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,434
- I saved you!

1698
01:23:52,586 --> 01:23:54,695
If it hadn't been for me
you would've been victim 17.

1699
01:23:56,607 --> 01:23:57,531
Now look at me.

1700
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:01,093
You made me the killer I am.

1701
01:24:01,186 --> 01:24:02,852
(Maggie grunts)
(Flesh squishing)

1702
01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:06,765
- Oh my god.
(Kyle gasps)

1703
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,541
- You did it.

1704
01:24:09,787 --> 01:24:11,453
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1705
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:14,106
(Maggie panting)

1706
01:24:14,124 --> 01:24:15,274
(Kyle groans)

1707
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:20,012
- Oh my god.
(Dramatic music)

1708
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,453
(Rifle clicking)

1709
01:24:28,547 --> 01:24:30,972
(Maggie screams)
(Gunshot banging)

1710
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:35,903
(Dramatic music)
(Maggie panting)

1711
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:41,408
(Gunshot banging)
(Maggie screaming)

1712
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,306
(Suspenseful music)

1713
01:24:47,324 --> 01:24:50,475
(Rifle clicks)
- Dammit!

1714
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:55,255
(Suspenseful music)
(Maggie panting)

1715
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,826
Maggie!

1716
01:25:07,845 --> 01:25:11,438
(Suspenseful music continues)

1717
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:22,116
(Door rattling)
(Keys clinking)

1718
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:25,619
(Intense dramatic music)

1719
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:33,460
(Ominous music)
(Maggie panting)

1720
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:34,795
Back to school, mags?

1721
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:40,634
How nice.

1722
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,306
(Suspenseful music)

1723
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,889
(Light dramatic music)

1724
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:55,440
- Jenny, wait!

1725
01:25:57,302 --> 01:25:58,652
- Hold it.
- My mother's in there.

1726
01:25:58,803 --> 01:26:00,228
- No, she's not.
- What do you mean?

1727
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:01,396
- [Alyssa] Is Maggie okay?

1728
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,972
- There's signs of a
struggle in the house,

1729
01:26:03,066 --> 01:26:03,824
but the house is empty.

1730
01:26:03,975 --> 01:26:05,233
- Oh my god.

1731
01:26:05,386 --> 01:26:06,493
Do you think he took her?

1732
01:26:06,645 --> 01:26:08,387
- We don't know yet.

1733
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,555
- [Alyssa] Come on,
we need to find her.

1734
01:26:10,649 --> 01:26:15,460
(Ominous music)
(Kyle panting)

1735
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:27,181
- I know what you think.

1736
01:26:28,759 --> 01:26:31,310
You think that I'm like him.

1737
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:34,688
You beat good ole dad, then
you can certainly beat me.

1738
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:40,343
(Eerie music)

1739
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:41,820
I'm not my father, Maggie.

1740
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:45,824
He thinks he's better
than me, but he's wrong.

1741
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:47,701
I'm smarter.

1742
01:26:48,946 --> 01:26:49,703
I'm stronger.

1743
01:26:52,599 --> 01:26:54,933
You can't hide from me!
(Suspenseful music)

1744
01:26:55,026 --> 01:26:58,286
(Plate shattering)
(Kyle groaning)

1745
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,939
(Kyle panting)

1746
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:03,008
There's that killer instinct.

1747
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,721
(Fire alarm blaring)

1748
01:27:07,872 --> 01:27:11,466
- Did you hear that?

1749
01:27:11,618 --> 01:27:13,285
- That's coming
from the university?

1750
01:27:13,303 --> 01:27:14,043
- It's mom.

1751
01:27:14,137 --> 01:27:16,212
It's her, I know that it is.

1752
01:27:16,306 --> 01:27:18,957
