1
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,091
My brother and I
grew up in the desert.

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,969
We knew every rock and
every sage brush out there.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,098
That's how he was able to
avoid capture all those years.

4
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,060
Finally, they sent
me to bring him in.

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,687
I went after my own
brother because I knew

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,816
he would have ended up
lying face down in the desert.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,820
There already was a bounty
reward out for him, dead or alive.

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:34,076
Jake was a smuggler,
hauling people across the border trench.

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,663
He figured they were
just looking for a better life.

10
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:42,793
I really believe that helping these
pilgrims was when Jake started to change.

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,837
That was when he
stopped being an outlaw.

12
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,005
And the coyote?

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,090
No, he's going to be here, friend.
Don't worry.

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,800
He going to be right along.
Don't worry now.

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,428
- Ei coyote's not coming.
- He's coming. He's going to come.

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,098
Now I told you,
don't worry about anything.

17
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,434
I'll take care of everything
concerning you and the baby.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,477
Huh?

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,623
How you boys?

20
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,126
Who are you? What do you want?

21
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,921
Don't worry about anything,
we're technicals.

22
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,297
We control the sector.

23
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,758
What you got in there,
amigo, huh?

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,094
- And I'll take this little chica.
- No!

25
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,470
Come on, pojita.
Come here little chicky, chicky, chicky.

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,650
Ieste loco!

27
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,168
Well, let's go pilgrims.

28
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,839
Okay, folks, here we go.

29
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,384
Cash up front,
15 grand to see the promised land.

30
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,510
15,000.

31
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
Thank you, sir.

32
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,348
Here's for me and my girl.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,769
$8,000 is all I have.
Please take us.

34
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,522
I'm sorry, fella. But my tax guy says
I'm all maxed out on charitable donations.

35
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,693
Just like the others, Esteban.
He'll take everything we've got.

36
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,279
Oh, hell lady.
If it's all you got.

37
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,245
Okay, folks, what kind
of music would you like?

38
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,081
I got vintage rap,
classic metal, a little salsa.

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,083
Wagner.

40
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,085
Wagner it is.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,140
Perimeter intrusion.
Proximity, border trench.

42
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,351
Moving at high speed.

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,772
What's this?

44
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,944
It's him.

45
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,739
Laser tracking,
target locked on.

46
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,326
Commence firing.

47
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,915
Watch out! Duck!

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,171
- Here we go!
- Whoa!

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,173
Holy!

50
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,511
I love this stuff.

51
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,812
Keep your heads down, everybody!

52
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,783
McQueen.

53
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,359
Help me.
He'll sell me and my baby.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,488
Oh, listen, lady.
Don't take this wrong,

55
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,407
but I'm not your
knight in shining armor.

56
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,867
Got problems of my own.

57
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,787
You understand, right, amigo?

58
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,706
We're just a couple of good
old boys in the same business.

59
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,125
Right?

60
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,798
She is prime labor...
Or spare parts.

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,554
I don't deal in organs.

62
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,393
We're talking about big
money here, my friend.

63
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,523
You already got the
woman and the baby.

64
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,651
I will still cut you in.

65
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,323
I don't want to see you on
the border or in the zones, ever.

66
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,117
Oh, what is wrong?

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,662
You afraid of a
little competition.

68
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,541
Could you please take
us as far as the zones?

69
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,253
Listen, lady, I'm a wheelman.

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,090
I haul cargo from point a
to point b with no questions.

71
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,510
I look out for number one,
I get the cash upfront.

72
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,973
And most importantly,
I don't stick my neck out for anyone.

73
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,663
When they figured out how
to light up the sky over L.A.,

74
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,292
the glow spread all the way
down the coast to San Diego.

75
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,795
It was so bright you
could see it for 500 miles.

76
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,005
They called it the dome.

77
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,008
And that's where the
pilgrims were headed.

78
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,050
Good luck, lady.

79
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,854
It was dawn before Jake
limped all the way out

80
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,900
to Dean's high tech junk
yard in the middle of the desert.

81
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,698
We knew that Dean
was supplying vehicles

82
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,743
and weapons to bandits
and the border smugglers.

83
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,245
Dean was a genius of a mechanic,

84
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,623
but I don't think he could
feed himself two days in a row.

85
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,792
If it wasn't for the
apache woman,

86
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,712
he'd just be bones
bleached by the sun,

87
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,714
picked clean by the vultures.

88
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,059
Jake's truck was so shot up that
the time it took him to get there

89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,603
was all the time I needed.

90
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,191
Maria.

91
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,947
You're a no-good,
iyin' sack of coyote crap, McQueen.

92
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,156
Yes, I am, Maria.

93
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,159
Now look, you're not still
upset about that money.

94
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm going to make good on that.
You know that.

95
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,914
I'd like to shoot you right now,

96
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,085
but then I guess we'd never
get the money, would we?

97
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,424
Well, I never knew you
to be sentimental, Maria.

98
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,765
I found this pot buried
in the ashes of a fire pit.

99
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,270
It's almost a thousand years old

100
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,898
and this single anasazi pot

101
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,864
is worth more than the
bomber out there in my yard.

102
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,952
Old junk, newjunk.

103
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,373
I guess it's all just
a matter of time.

104
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,838
You're not going to get all
metaphysical on me now, are ya?

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,589
No, it's Karma.
You know what I mean?

106
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:14,679
It's like... whatever we
prize gets buried with us.

107
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,351
Maria seems
very irritable today.

108
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,269
We had some visitors last night,

109
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,897
a us marshal and
a couple of deputies.

110
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,292
They were looking for this
smuggler that crashed the border.

111
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,442
Mention any names?

112
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,487
Your name might've come up.

113
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,702
They said there was
a reward for your hide.

114
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,749
How'd they know to
come straight to you, Dean?

115
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,710
I see what you mean.
But it wasn't me.

116
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:53,218
It seems that there's a
new us marshal after you.

117
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,222
You know, the funny thing is:
His name's McQueen.

118
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,766
Are you sure about that?

119
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,728
I think you should go
underground for a while.

120
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,524
I think that you should
get lost in the zones.

121
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,025
Yeah.

122
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,112
First I got to get
my truck moving.

123
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,245
Well, you need a new
titanium cage under there,

124
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,165
which I can borrow from
the frame of the bomber.

125
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,293
Drop a new engine and
you're back in business.

126
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,004
But what are you going to do after you
cannibalize all the parts off that bird?

127
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,714
When the gold mine pans out?

128
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,009
Hey, I am not a cannibal, man.

129
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,302
Well, you think the spider
bomber just happened to

130
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,639
drop out of the sky right
down onto sacred Indian site.

131
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,392
And I just happened to
be walking by and find it.

132
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,894
I don't think so.

133
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,149
Spirits, baby.

134
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,984
Well, do it!

135
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,944
I mean, if it's a vision
thing I say, go for it.

136
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,281
- How much money do you have?
- I'm a little tight right now.

137
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,993
See, if you made that run, you have a whole
roll of bills in that pocket right there.

138
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,834
And that's good. You're going to need it.
This is going to be expensive.

139
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,164
Oh, come on, Dean.

140
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,959
You know me, I can't make it
last that long. Now put it on my tab.

141
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,628
In your dreams.

142
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,673
You'll get the truck back
when I get the money.

143
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,593
This is the us marshal.

144
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,055
Lay down on the ground
now or you will be fired on!

145
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,814
Perimeter units, la y the...

146
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,650
Backup units are en route.

147
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,152
Jake McQueen.

148
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,112
What a guy.

149
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,825
Come on out of there, Jake.

150
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,204
- How are ya, big brother?
- Brothers?

151
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,872
How's things with the old man?

152
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,511
Pop sends his best wishes.

153
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,555
He said he'd like
you to come and visit.

154
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,974
When you get a chance...

155
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,564
Let's stop all this
fooling around!

156
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,943
Let's go see old Zeke, together!

157
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,618
Sorry, brother!

158
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,857
Do have any
infections or a flu virus?

159
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,859
No, sir.

160
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,612
- Feeling nausea?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,657
I could feel my body
rejecting the parts.

162
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,367
It's to be expected.

163
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,620
We lost another
shipment last night, sir.

164
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,289
Same smuggler.

165
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,040
McQueen, I know.

166
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,835
I'm having him brought to me.

167
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,005
Well, we can't continue
to rely on desert rats like

168
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,424
the hillbilly to bring in
bodies from the border.

169
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,551
We'll have to use
a different source.

170
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,721
I want you to do it personally.

171
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,557
I'm just a soldier, sir.

172
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,854
I'm afraid I'll need more interferon
to stop this kind of rejection.

173
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,608
Until I can find a way to
make the synthetic work,

174
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,779
I need more bodies
to extract it from.

175
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,160
What donors
should I target, sir.

176
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,165
Those in the zones
who have no purpose.

177
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,753
They'll have an opportunity
to give their lives meaning.

178
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,437
You were the perfect soldier.

179
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,732
They tore you to pieces
and left you to die.

180
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,794
Restore.

181
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,468
No good living if I have to keep
getting these shots to keep me going.

182
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,601
Just outside the dome of light
they walled off the industrial zones.

183
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,146
Most people in the zones were there
because they were forced out of L.A.:

184
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,944
Rockers, carnival people, artists,
underground rock clubs, gambling.

185
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,865
The zones is where you go if
you're looking for anything I've listed.

186
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,575
Since they outlawed that
internal combustion engines

187
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,870
and weapons inside the dome,

188
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,374
the trade in those items
all took place in the zone.

189
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:22,088
That's where Jake picked up
his smuggling jobs from kabuki.

190
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,424
And she ran things
with an iron hand.

191
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,053
I heard you had a little
disagreement with will.

192
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,221
Yeah.

193
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,182
It's going to put a damper on McQueen
family reunion, I can tell you that.

194
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,269
Listen, kabuki.
I need another run.

195
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,230
I got to get my truck out of hock.
Got anything?

196
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,608
Will and his boys
are a pretty relentless.

197
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,734
Uh-huh.

198
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,363
I think you'd better
stay with me for a while?

199
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,782
What's wrong?

200
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,077
That hillbilly, you know him?

201
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,830
- He's new.
- Who's that he's talking to over there?

202
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,207
Robert Lee.

203
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,002
There's a rumor he's trying to
corner the black market in organs.

204
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:05,088
Hey, it's not pretty,
but it's the hottest commodity in la.

205
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,841
Who's he work for?

206
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,926
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

207
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,889
They'd have to be
someone with a lot of juice.

208
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,515
I'll be right back.

209
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,062
Not in my place, McQueen.

210
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,857
Stay where you are.

211
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,692
Everyone stay where you are!

212
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,201
Always the first
rat out the door.

213
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,661
Would you get that
thing out of my face.

214
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,288
It's time to pay
your dues, Jake!

215
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,750
You're still just like the
old man, will, straight up.

216
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,003
It's not about that!
You break the law, I take you in.

217
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,881
I told m yselfl was
just doing my job.

218
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,508
I had no way of knowing
that when I brought Jake in,

219
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,678
I was hand delivering
him into a world of trouble.

220
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,348
They weren't interested
in Jake paying his dues.

221
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,936
- They wanted his life.
- The thief has been apprehended.

222
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,270
He is secured in transport six.

223
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,815
Hey, McQueen,
you don't feel so rugged now, huh?

224
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,736
You know, there's no way you're going
to come up with bail money for smuggling.

225
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,281
You're looking at
10 years in a hole.

226
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,420
You McQueen?

227
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
I heard of you.

228
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,968
They say you're the best
wheelman in the zones.

229
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,427
Well, look it here, man.

230
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,473
You don't know yet, but,
whew, this is your lucky night.

231
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,351
You believe in
chance encounters?

232
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,146
What have they got you for, kid?

233
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's just say it was kind
of a misunderstanding.

234
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,402
Oh, Johnny, don't be so shy.

235
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,445
Tell the man what a truly
dangerous criminal you are.

236
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,031
Hey, hey,
nobody's talking to you, lab rat.

237
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,493
He broke the window at
the rock and roll museum,

238
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,787
and stole Bruce
Springsteen's guitar.

239
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,291
Truly steely eyed gunman.

240
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,503
I was just so curious, you know,
leaning hard against the glass.

241
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,090
Not so many guys playing
those old guitars anymore.

242
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:15,344
Everybody's using those synth squat boxes,
man, crankin' out computer music,

243
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,222
and feeding it to all the
pod people in the light.

244
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,475
And that's the kind of noise
you listen to, ain't it, jailer?

245
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,399
So, you know,
naturally they come looking for me.

246
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,069
Yeah, well don't
quit your day job, kid.

247
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,488
When you get out of here, you're going to
need somebody to ride shotgun, you know?

248
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,866
Now and then?

249
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,951
Yeah, well, maybe I
will need some backup.

250
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,786
Now and then.

251
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,871
Are you serious?

252
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,041
You don't even know
anything about me though.

253
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,212
I figure anybody who steal's
Bruce's guitar can't be all bad.

254
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,267
You have been
experiencing kona waves.

255
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,729
And now for the chrysalis
corporation's newest environment,

256
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,149
Brazilian rainforest.

257
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,279
Identification, please.

258
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,504
Irradiating.

259
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,217
Access security code.

260
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,593
Hannah tyrie.

261
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,137
Thank you, miss tyrie.

262
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:06,122
Do you have any
infections or flu virus?

263
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
You're nervous.

264
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,338
I've worked with your company
for five years on your design team.

265
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,592
Just seeing you on screen. You've
never asked to see me in person before.

266
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,928
I've seen you every day.

267
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,602
"Zone rangers" is one of the most
popular virtual reality games in la.

268
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,355
I know it was
largely your design.

269
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,525
Although others have
put their names on it.

270
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,489
I want you to design a
new one on your own.

271
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,908
We'll call it "the smuggler."

272
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,618
An action game?

273
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,786
What are the stakes?

274
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,917
The player will be the
smuggler trying to stay alive.

275
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,005
I'll need a wheelman to
establish the parameters of skill.

276
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,507
I think I found someone for you.

277
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,601
I love that dress, miss tyrie.

278
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,478
Yes, it's new.

279
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,023
It goes with your perfume.

280
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:19,779
Patou, parisian.
Not the synthesize versions held in la.

281
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,114
It's not the same.

282
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,949
How'd you know that?

283
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,702
I don't have many
sensory pleasures,

284
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,413
but my nose works very well.

285
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,712
Ins security cameras
on the border.

286
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,964
He's the real thing.

287
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,634
We won't have to film an actor.

288
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,515
We can pump the images into the
computer and recreate it from digital.

289
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,852
You know him?

290
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,481
Just by reputation.

291
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,567
Do you think a quarter
of a million is enough?

292
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,028
If he didn't like money,
he wouldn't be a smuggler.

293
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,613
Give him whatever he wants.

294
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
I need him.

295
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,833
Why did you lie just
now about knowing him?

296
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,589
It must've been exciting with
a boy from across the tracks.

297
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
Good afternoon, Hannah.

298
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,480
Is anyone here?

299
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,649
We are alone.

300
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,905
Security level one,
outside power,

301
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,491
internal computer feeds closed.

302
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,994
Internal feeds closed, Hannah.

303
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,699
Prism, prepare optical memory.

304
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,619
Good evening, Hannah, working.

305
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,625
Flash optical, nano memory,
autonomic responses.

306
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,876
Ready.

307
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,213
Did Jared access to your memory?

308
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,674
Yes, it's curious.

309
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,049
How did he get in?

310
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,259
I don't know.

311
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,303
It was not accessed externally.

312
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,389
It was accessed from
inside the computer.

313
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,185
Okay, Jared, let's find out
what's inside your secret heart.

314
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,230
Prism, jacking in
a medical research.

315
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,524
Security bypass.

316
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,882
Been sleepin' okay?
You look a little pale.

317
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,883
What did you come
here to gloat, will?

318
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,221
Me? No, no, not at all.

319
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,475
Well, okay.

320
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,479
That was the main thing,
but there was other stuff too.

321
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,023
Yeah, well, let's get
on to the other stuff.

322
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,025
Okay.

323
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,695
We could use a good
wheelman in the desert.

324
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,489
There've been a lot of
attacks along the interstate.

325
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,951
Are you trying to
cut a deal with me?

326
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,245
They told me to make you an offer.
So I'm making it.

327
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,331
You give up smuggling, you get
your charges dropped. That's it.

328
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,211
Wait a minute here.

329
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,133
You mean to tell me, you...

330
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,517
Marshal will McQueen
wants me to slap on a badge.

331
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,520
Well, I told 'em
it was a bad idea.

332
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,442
I'd rather sit in here and rot.

333
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,568
Come on, Jake.

334
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,404
Everything outside the light
is up for grabs these days,

335
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,947
everything and every one.

336
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,782
So what about our old man? Huh?

337
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,951
Zeke lives out there
in the desert alone.

338
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,952
Oh, you're breaking
my heart, will.

339
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,499
Okay, so he was a little tough on us,
but he's a good man.

340
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:29,546
He's a cranky old man who has always
been a barnacle on the ass of progress!

341
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,679
Hey, I'll see ya.

342
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,727
Listen, if you get a chance,
if you get bailed, go see him.

343
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,854
He won't live forever.

344
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,148
Hello, will.

345
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,734
Jake McQueen.

346
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,196
I see you're still making
runs on the border, huh?

347
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,575
Yeah.

348
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,119
I haul cargo once in a while.

349
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,996
Some of us do work for a living.

350
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,709
Hey, don't tell me you're
going to bail this guy out.

351
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,586
Well, he looks
so forlorn in there.

352
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,013
Hannah owned him now.

353
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,684
And if he ever left the dome,
they'd come after him for bail jumping.

354
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,479
I knew Jake wouldn't
last long in la.

355
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,190
We put you into my custody.

356
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,068
As your employer.

357
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,535
I'll pay you $250,000.

358
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,458
I want you to drive for me.

359
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:57,384
You'll pay me
$250,000 just for driving?

360
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,303
Just for driving.

361
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,890
400k.

362
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:03,974
300.

363
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,644
And some clothes
that don't smell bad.

364
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,151
I'm not much good
with computers.

365
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,360
See the difficulty
level's based on you.

366
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,778
You're the benchmark.

367
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,948
You want to make me
into a computer game.

368
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,327
The sweat bands
are called trodes.

369
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,954
Inside are electrodes,
which sends signals into the brain,

370
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,167
into the inner ear
and the optic nerve.

371
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,170
All you have to do is
close your eyes, Jack in,

372
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,215
and you'll be in the computer
generated world of cyberspace.

373
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,635
Well, would you show
me how to Jack in?

374
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:44,306
Iplaced the video images from the night
you crashed the border into the computer.

375
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,850
How do you do, Mr. McQueen?

376
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,104
I've been studying your military
record from the war in Israel.

377
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,314
Purple heart.

378
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,566
Silver star.

379
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,900
Yeah, well, I was a wild kid.

380
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,487
I didn't know how to
keep my head down.

381
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,783
Do you know that you were given
all the gifts that god can bestow?

382
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,329
Powerful, quick, durable,
brave beyond doubt.

383
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,832
You were given
everything I wasn't.

384
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,085
Looks like you did okay to me.

385
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,547
We are not simply
the makers of games.

386
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,467
Here at chrysalis we
have a medical facility.

387
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,720
It was here that the Jared
13 heart was designed.

388
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,640
This place, these medical devices,
they are the only way

389
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,186
I can do battle
against my enemy, disease.

390
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,857
You see my experience
is that the flesh is weak.

391
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,069
Why don't you try this on.

392
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,221
Man, it's just the same.

393
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,308
It's exactly like the night
I crashed the border.

394
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,351
You have a lot of work to do.

395
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,020
I'll leave you to it.

396
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:24,906
So is that what you do all day,
make computer games?

397
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,283
Yes.

398
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,120
What about all night?

399
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,543
Nothing changes.

400
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,212
I'm still a wheelman.

401
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,757
And you're still playing games.

402
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,100
Do you ever think about us?

403
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,019
I burned out every trace of you.

404
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,688
Did you?

405
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,220
Phone Robert Lee,
chrysalis warehouse.

406
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:36,561
In Hong Kong they keep grasshoppers
in little bamboo cages for good luck.

407
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,524
Now I have McQueen
in his bamboo cage.

408
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,817
Shall I come and collect him?

409
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,569
Oh god, no.

410
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,156
I have a much more
interesting fate in store for him.

411
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,618
I'm going to absorb him.

412
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,502
Isn't it beautiful?

413
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,254
Where are we?

414
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,882
Smugglers are supposed to
be able to navigate at night.

415
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,719
Well, Venus is supposed to be the brightest
star on the horizon this time of night,

416
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,764
but it's not there.

417
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,560
No, it's up there.
See, it's the bright one in third quadrant.

418
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,814
You never did
get your stars right.

419
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,692
I'm a woman.
I know where my Venus is.

420
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,863
What's wrong, McQueen?

421
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,407
The night is wrong.

422
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,285
The stars aren't where
they're supposed to be.

423
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,829
I shouldn't have
brought us here.

424
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,414
How'd my truck get fixed?

425
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,176
Whoa, what the hell is this?

426
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,970
- What is this place?
- It's cyberspace.

427
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,473
Is that snake another
one of your programs?

428
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,558
I don't know where
that snake came from.

429
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:11,823
I'm sorry, but it was the only way I could
think of to show you how far we've come.

430
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,408
How did you do that?

431
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,950
You fell asleep
with the trodes on.

432
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,662
- What happens if you can't get out?
- You flat line.

433
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,207
But I have a back door,
an automatic response, so...

434
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,541
You programmed stars wrong.

435
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,586
How do you know you
didn't program that wrong too?

436
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,046
Think about it, McQueen.

437
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,714
What if.

438
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:33,637
What if you could place yourself
piece by piece in a cyberspace.

439
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:40,769
You're talking about leaving your body
and literally getting inside the computer.

440
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,814
You've done it, haven't you?

441
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,363
Well, at first I wasn't
sure what was happening.

442
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,571
It was like I was blacking
out for a few minutes.

443
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,533
Then I realized I was
seeing into the computer.

444
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,952
It was then I knew
that I was ingraining,

445
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,120
or on the verge of
something that no one's ever...

446
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,498
I don't belong here.

447
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
Keep the money.

448
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:16,263
And now presenting: The living drama of
chrysalis corporation's summer storm.

449
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,898
Just passed McQueen in the hall.

450
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,191
He's gone.

451
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,820
Everything's
working out quite well.

452
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:36,700
- I have him in cyberspace on digital.
- What would you want me to do with him?

453
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,661
Consider him an enemy soldier
and do what comes natural.

454
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,290
He has family in the desert.

455
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,014
Can I help you, gentlemen?

456
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,308
Zeke.

457
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,351
That's right.

458
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,687
Oh, they tell us you're
the best mechanic around.

459
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,775
Well, I'm the only one in town.
So I guess that makes me the best.

460
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,070
Well, actually they said
that in your younger days,

461
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,906
you used to design engines
for the Indianapolis 500.

462
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,825
You know,
everyone reminds me of that.

463
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,245
Then they asked me to
fix that damn lawnmowers.

464
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,583
You ever worked on one of these?

465
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,877
Some.

466
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,343
She's, uh,
she's runnin' a bit rough.

467
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,555
I was wondering if maybe
you could take a look at it.

468
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,690
Well, it is a beaut. Yes, it is.

469
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,863
Oh yeah, it's one
of them Dean engines.

470
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,825
It's flashy, but it's good.

471
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,745
Let me see here.

472
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,959
Oh yeah, it's been modified to burn
94 octane, but it's doing a lot of carbon.

473
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,172
You got to take out the
injectors and bore it out.

474
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,094
I was wondering if I could
borrow your tools to do the job?

475
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,804
No, I don't loan out my tools.

476
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,890
That's a garage policy.

477
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,810
But you're welcome
to leave the car here.

478
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,188
Yup.

479
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,898
Hillbilly.

480
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,737
Why don't you go on, and get
that rack of tools from the garage.

481
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,406
All right.

482
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,793
You put 'em back, sir.

483
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,212
This here scatter gun
will cut a man in half.

484
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,631
I don't think so, grandpa.

485
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,763
Get this over with.
Iesta pasando El dia!

486
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,522
Where's Jake?

487
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,149
Go to hell.

488
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,484
Where is he, old man?

489
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,611
Runnin' out of spit.

490
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,324
I don't need my boys
to take on you punks.

491
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,251
All right, old man.

492
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,880
Tell Jake that
Robert Lee came by.

493
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,704
Well, how is he?

494
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,415
I don't like it.
He keeps bleeding from his ear.

495
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,754
Yeah, I thought I
heard your voice, Jake.

496
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,423
How are ya, pop?

497
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,719
It's good to see you
two boys together.

498
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,683
I, uh, I got some stuff
I got to take care of.

499
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,654
Who beat ya, pop?

500
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,617
Boy, you look lousy.

501
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,037
Yeah, well you don't
look so good yourself.

502
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,331
Listen, boy.

503
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,668
I figure you old enough now,
you should know the truth.

504
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,212
I ain't your real daddy.

505
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,757
You know,
I suspected that, Zeke.

506
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,969
I've been preparing
myself for this shock.

507
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,138
What was your first clue?

508
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,348
I can't dance worth a damn.

509
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:57,937
I guess that explains why I could never get
your narrow ass to walk the straight line.

510
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,939
Yeah, well, don't worry yourself
about it, old man. I sure don't.

511
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,692
Ooh, tough guy.

512
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,446
Even when you was a little
guttersnipe lost in the desert.

513
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,156
Yeah, well,
orphans are like that.

514
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,784
Maybe you was an orphan,
but you was never abandoned.

515
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,161
Your folks was murdered.

516
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,334
No, ever since I was a kid, people
around here said I was just left for scrap.

517
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,711
No, that ain't what happened.

518
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,970
If I had told the truth,
they would have took you from me.

519
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,060
What are you going
to tell me about it?

520
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,021
I saw it out on the highway.

521
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,025
Your folks was dragged
from their car in the desert

522
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,611
and the technicals shot
them both and took you.

523
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,321
Well, how did I end up here?

524
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,156
I bought you from 'em.

525
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,914
Had to trade in my damn
good Harley I rebuilt.

526
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,710
Well, sounds like you've
got the bad end of the deal.

527
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:12,971
Don't you see, son.

528
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,016
We need someone out
here to keep the peace.

529
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,978
And maybe we wouldn't
have no more orphans.

530
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,573
Look under that tarp over there.

531
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
I reckon there's
something you'll need.

532
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,125
Oh, come on, pop.

533
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,545
- Let me get you to your bed.
- No.

534
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,883
I lay down in that bed,
I won't get up.

535
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:56,931
I'd just as soon
wait right here.

536
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,908
Keep that engine tuned up, now.

537
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,582
Got to be strong in the middle.

538
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,755
Did you say goodbye?

539
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,215
What for?

540
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,011
His brain is bleeding.
He's dying.

541
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,396
Listen, you got to
settle up with him.

542
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,704
I think Lou gehrig's disease is
a very odd name for my illness.

543
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:08,419
It makes the degeneration seem
heroic when in fact, it's pathetic.

544
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:17,386
There's something in the
very chromosomes of humans

545
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:23,142
that fears and loathes
the sight of a ruined body.

546
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,688
You find my body grotesque?

547
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,280
Would you kiss my cheek?

548
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,680
There's something
I want to show you.

549
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,315
Hey.

550
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,903
If you're going out there,
you're going to need some company.

551
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,660
He'd want you to have it.

552
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,705
This used to be a town, will.

553
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,501
Yeah, everyone left.
Including us.

554
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:55,795
Hannah came by.

555
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,130
You know,
you ought to go see her.

556
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,968
I mean, she still lives up there in
that old mansion her daddy built.

557
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,596
Right now I got some
things to take care of for Zeke.

558
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,140
What did he say to you?

559
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,893
He said I wasn't his real son.

560
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,940
You didn't believe him, did you?

561
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,319
You know, you ought to think
about staying around this place.

562
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,953
I was thinking
maybe I'd do that.

563
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,664
Good place to raise my kids.

564
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:38,129
Course, that'd make me
the marshal in these parts.

565
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:43,968
Well, marshal, I hope
you find Robert Lee first,

566
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,262
so I don't have to kill him.

567
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,215
Where's my Harley?

568
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,719
Oh, man, where's my Harley?

569
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,561
It's these damn little red
ants that are the worst.

570
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,646
What are you doing?

571
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,733
Oh, this ceremony is a kind of a
traditional thing with the apaches.

572
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,986
It's how a man proves
that he's worthy to marry.

573
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,489
- It looks painful.
- It's excruciating.

574
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,995
It's manuela,
she's very timorous.

575
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,831
- Can we get on with some business?
- Absolutely.

576
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,917
Ain't it beautiful?

577
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,712
What's wrong, McQueen?

578
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,923
Zeke's been killed.

579
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,594
Take me out of here.

580
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,096
- Robert Lee.
- You know him?

581
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,474
Yeah, you're going after him,
this truck isn't fast enough.

582
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,809
That's what I figured.

583
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,189
What can I say?
A legend, creamy, runs like hell.

584
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,149
It's nice, but too light.

585
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,693
I put a machine gun on
there it's going to flip right over.

586
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,865
It's Italian. If I wanted a temperamental
woman, I would have married one.

587
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,076
Oh, what's this?

588
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,663
All right, you want American,
you got American.

589
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,793
- Look at the fins on this mother.
- What about this one?

590
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,506
Oh no. You're not interested in that thing.
This, this is, this isjunk.

591
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,883
Now the cobra over
there is beautiful.

592
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,594
And I promise you the price
will not come between us.

593
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,722
I don't even know why we have this.
We don't have running water.

594
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,891
I just told you it's junk, Jake.

595
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:01,981
A 1969 Ford mustang boss 429.

596
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,650
I have no idea why
I keep this heap.

597
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,318
Sonny Johnson.
Zeke told me about him.

598
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,780
He's the guy that used to run
moonshine up in the mountains.

599
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,072
Best wheelman that ever lived.

600
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,534
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something about your legend, okay?

601
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,078
He brought this in on a trailer,
broke down in the desert,

602
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,582
had to trade me his precious
stock car for repairs on his truck.

603
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,127
Big block v8. Does it run?

604
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,670
The engine is blown.

605
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,298
He neglected to mention that
when we concluded our agreement.

606
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,467
A tough old bird.

607
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,553
I got an engine for it.

608
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

609
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,397
It's not going to fit.

610
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,491
Fits perfectly.

611
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,830
All right, listen up,
this laminate is alternating layers

612
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,958
of carbon fiber
polymer and rytan.

613
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,170
So that makes me bulletproof?

614
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,757
It will protect you where
you are vulnerable.

615
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,885
Okay, now weapons.

616
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,517
Laser, radar or
heat-guided tow missiles?

617
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,435
I used heat-guided in the war.

618
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,228
You got two right there.
One for each side.

619
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,029
- What about more?
- Oh, I can work with that.

620
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,356
- I need infrared scope.
- Sure.

621
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,440
- Smoke canisters.
- Sure.

622
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,526
- 50 caliber.
- No, no.

623
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,028
Come here, look at these
little gatling babies on there.

624
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,491
That's it.
Now if you're feeling really imaginative.

625
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,162
- What are those?
- I just got these in.

626
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,664
These are from the
old star wars program.

627
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,082
Look like Christmas tree balls.

628
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,669
Oh yeah. Pretty aren't they?
They're called brilliant pebbles.

629
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,379
The idea was that
we could knock down

630
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,715
all those nasty russky
icbms coming in on our heads

631
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,220
by filling up their projected
airspace with millions of these babies.

632
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,267
However, for our purposes,
get a light.

633
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,815
This is slate wiper.

634
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:13,237
Now the only drawback that I can see
is that there's no interior to speak of.

635
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,738
Well, I don't need anything
but a seat and a steering wheel.

636
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,991
Yeah?

637
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,997
We can work on that release.

638
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,459
What are you doing?

639
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,795
Zeke's, just in case your
high tech stuff doesn't work.

640
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,423
You just saw it work.

641
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,010
They're completely
non-flammable.

642
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,388
This will keep the skin
of the car from burning off.

643
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,348
The same stuff they
used on the bomber.

644
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,728
See?

645
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,861
You don't think it's
too much, do ya?

646
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,612
No, Jake, no.

647
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,239
It should have flames.

648
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,308
A little bit down and dirty,
but Sonny Johnson would be proud.

649
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,856
Robert Lee has a
pretty nice car too.

650
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,073
You built Robert Lee a vehicle
from pieces of the bomber?

651
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,658
Hey business is business.
All right?

652
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,160
The guy pays me for what I do.

653
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,663
Is he a technical?

654
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,291
He works for some guy in la.

655
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,794
He wouldn't tell me who.

656
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,761
Be careful of him.

657
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,598
Guy's mostly made
up of vat-grown plastic.

658
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,519
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find him, would ya?

659
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,355
I don't have a clue.

660
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,607
Uh-huh.

661
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,993
Check the bar
at Indian junction.

662
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,623
Location 15,
coordinates 15 west,

663
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,085
29 south, Indian junction.

664
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,004
This is the last one, will.

665
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,467
Yeah, it looks like we got another
roadside attraction here, boys.

666
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,010
Stay tuned.

667
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,451
Robert Lee, us marshal.

668
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:52,289
Marshal, hey,
I've been waiting for ya.

669
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,754
You're under arrest for the
murder of Zeke McQueen.

670
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:03,675
I want you to get up real slow, holding
your hands where I can get a good look.

671
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,562
If you move funny,
there's 160,000 volts in this thing.

672
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,147
I know you're a trained soldier.

673
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:20,108
So I'm showing my respect
by keeping my distance.

674
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,568
I suggest you do the same.

675
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,238
Put these on.

676
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,256
Howdy.

677
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,014
I can't miss you
from this range.

678
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,141
Now...

679
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,395
We both walk out of
here or we both die.

680
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,065
You know...

681
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:05,069
He's not the brother we were looking for,
but hey, sometimes these things happen.

682
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,446
Stop.

683
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,875
I've been hearing a lot about them
vests you marshals are wearing.

684
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,795
Is it true they stop
steel jacketed shells?

685
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,381
That's what they say.

686
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,803
Officer down.

687
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,763
You ever think of getting
a warranty on that?

688
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,769
For an itty bitty cop,
he weighs way too much.

689
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,354
You know what I think it is?
It's that body armor he's wearing.

690
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,856
I think is that
Mexican body armor...

691
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,316
- Hold up, hold on.
- It's too heavy.

692
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,320
You know, I know where
I can get five, maybe $600.

693
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,788
What the hell is that?

694
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,919
Come on.

695
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,482
Let's go, cowboy!

696
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,029
Get out of here!

697
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,146
What happened?

698
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:07,901
I was running some field tests on the
new vests, passed with flying colors.

699
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,738
But my transmitter's down.
I hope my boys can find us.

700
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,618
Oh, baby, we got company.

701
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,428
Keep your head down.

702
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:50,736
Hang on!

703
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,270
- You hit?
- It's nothing.

704
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,529
Come on.

705
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,663
- Real nice car, McQueen.
- It's got flames on it.

706
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,873
Yeah, did you glue
it together yourself?

707
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:46,917
Oh boy.

708
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,711
See now you know what it's
like on the side of the good guys.

709
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,345
Yeah, you're one of those guys
who goes by the book, aren't you?

710
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,763
You going to be
taking me in now?

711
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,808
That's right. I go by the
book and the book says

712
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,560
when an officer's down,
you take him in first,

713
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,271
and then you come
back for the prisoner.

714
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,150
Well, in that case,
I'll be waiting right here for ya.

715
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,903
- Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
- Oh, yeah?

716
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,531
Yeah, I'll be sitting right here.
Trust me.

717
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,497
- Help me.
- I'll get you to the medic.

718
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,000
No, I'm not going to a medic.
I'm not going back to jail.

719
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,345
See, this is why I left
you in the first place.

720
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,556
Come back from
a run all busted up.

721
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,099
I patch you up.

722
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,601
Just so you go out
again the next night.

723
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,854
I see you got what you wanted.

724
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,106
It's just the way I'm wired, Jake.

725
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,108
Well, you could have
lived anywhere, Hannah.

726
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,110
Why here?

727
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,696
No one can touch me here.

728
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,787
I remember climbing up the mountain side,
and peeking through

729
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,457
those trees at the parties your
parents had going on up here.

730
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,420
Lights, blazing at night,
the music,

731
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,300
and rich people doing the
cha-cha-cha out on the terrace.

732
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:20,927
Is it like that for you?

733
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:22,929
Thought it would be.

734
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,516
I got to get out of here.

735
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,561
I can't let the marshals
find me up here.

736
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,408
What is that thing?

737
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,333
Can I talk to it?

738
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,463
- Prism?
- Yes, Jake.

739
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,257
What do you know about me?

740
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,969
You, Hannah and will
grew up together in Zion.

741
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:06,306
When you got in trouble with the marshal,
you and Hannah run away.

742
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:09,059
You became smugglers and lovers.

743
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,981
- What about now?
- You're still Hannah's lover, Jake.

744
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:21,071
No, no, no, was,
past tense, a long time ago.

745
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,364
Now also.

746
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,704
Turn off the hologram.

747
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,082
Can I see that again?

748
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,252
I don't know how
I let that happen.

749
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,505
Now I know what they mean,
by computer friendly.

750
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,966
I swear I told the
prism to erase it.

751
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:49,599
You know, I'm starting to feel like I did
when you were 16 and back in my Chevy.

752
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,062
Are you sweet
talking me, McQueen?

753
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,485
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

754
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,070
Sure you do.

755
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,281
What kind of perfume you got on?

756
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,532
Not wearing any.

757
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,743
My ribs.

758
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,538
Just lie still.

759
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,540
I'll do all the work.

760
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,577
Hey, McQueen.

761
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,622
Rise and shine.

762
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,215
It's so nice to have
a man in the house.

763
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,678
Backdoor timer, three minutes.

764
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,058
Timer initiated, Hannah.

765
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,269
I know you're hungry, Hannah.

766
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,064
I'm waiting.

767
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,543
Hey, McQueen, hurry up.

768
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,859
What, what's the matter?

769
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,445
Don't you like me this way?

770
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,751
Don't be afraid.

771
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,878
We'll always be together.

772
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,799
Alarm, system override.

773
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,678
Warning!
Back door alarm, system override.

774
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,158
Hannah?

775
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,884
Wake up.

776
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,264
Hannah, wake up!

777
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,886
I was hoping you came here for me,
but, uh, with this look, I don't think so.

778
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,568
Listen, thanks for
giving Johnny that job.

779
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,724
You saved me the trouble
of having to find him.

780
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,352
I heard about Zeke and Hannah.

781
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,439
I'm real sorry, McQueen.

782
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,566
Want a drink?

783
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,819
Mm, listen, I'm going to have to
take Johnny boy away from ya.

784
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,404
Too bad, he's the real thing.

785
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,906
Best rockabilly in the zones.

786
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,576
Look, you as good with the
gun as you are with that thing?

787
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,412
- Yeah, take a guess.
- I'm going to need a good backup.

788
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:45,705
I'll get my gear.

789
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,835
Listen, kabuki. You told me about
this black market and organ stuff.

790
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,796
- But where'd you hear that?
- That was crazy street people.

791
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,964
Maybe it's just rumors.

792
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,800
- I heard about the girl.
- Mm-hmm.

793
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:58,926
Who killed her?

794
01:08:58,968 --> 01:08:59,969
Only Hannah knows.

795
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,537
Hannah.

796
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,457
- What are we looking for?
- The prism, it's gone.

797
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,210
- Say what?
- It's a crystal. She's inside.

798
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,922
Is she a wee
little person, or what?

799
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,592
Hey, McQueen.

800
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:41,636
What?

801
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,430
You live with this Hannah woman?

802
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,601
She have a boyfriend
or anything like that?

803
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,228
No. Why you asking?

804
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:51,729
Justcufious.

805
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,360
Hey, knock, knock.

806
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,863
I know you can't see too
good with the door and all,

807
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,491
but why aren't you just
wondering what I'm carrying?

808
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,035
Well, I call this
my streetsweeper.

809
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,747
See, it automatically removes the
trash from my immediate vicinity.

810
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,667
So why don't you come
out of there before I

811
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,544
blow the wetware out
of the back of your head?

812
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:35,272
- You did good, kid.
- The legend grows.

813
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,942
These guys wouldn't have waited
for us if they had found the prism.

814
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,318
Keep him company.

815
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,405
This is my first day
on the job, right?

816
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,199
I'm trying to impress the boss.

817
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,076
So why don't you just sit still,
shut up, stop moaning.

818
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,537
The man's trying
to think, you know.

819
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,918
What was it?

820
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,464
Hide it in plain sight
and nobody will see it.

821
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:41,172
You're getting into some
very interesting territory here.

822
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,093
Hey, why would this Jared
guy risk a whole empire

823
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,055
just to snatch a few homeless
guys out of the zones?

824
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,515
He's experimenting.

825
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,977
Rippin' off Bruce's guitar was kind of
mild compared to all this, you know?

826
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,610
It's ready.

827
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,084
Hannah...

828
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,419
Are you there?

829
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,883
Good afternoon, McQueen.

830
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,720
I can't see anything.

831
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,139
Is that you, Hannah?

832
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,642
I'm Hannah's prism.

833
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,644
- Where am I?
- You're with friends.

834
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,523
Uh, Hannah talk, talk, talk.

835
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:43,985
Where's Hannah?

836
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,821
Well, you are Hannah.

837
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,867
Well, if I'm Hannah,
where's my body?

838
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,537
You don't have one.

839
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,790
What do you mean?

840
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,752
You're dead.

841
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,548
Am I in heaven?

842
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,341
You're in Dean's junkyard.

843
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,343
Oh, lovely.
My prayers are answered.

844
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,345
I want to see it.

845
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,683
I know you can't see right now,
Hannah, but we can fix that.

846
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,645
Wait, I can see.

847
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,273
Inside of the power grid,
I see all these electrons

848
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,859
and they're moving around
in these beautiful patterns.

849
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,402
How do you feel?

850
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,529
I feel powerful.

851
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,826
Hannah!

852
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,995
Now, can we talk about this?

853
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,332
- Where are you going with the car?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

854
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,632
My god.

855
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,384
Okay, McQueen,
let's see how fast I can go.

856
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,137
- Can I drive now?
- Forget about it.

857
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:13,407
Hannah, let's stop for now.

858
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,875
God, this is fantastic.

859
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,794
But I can't see you.

860
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:25,962
I want to see you.

861
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:32,592
I don't know if it's,
if it's really her or some machine.

862
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:33,928
Really?

863
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,013
Hannah, I'm plugging
in the optical drive.

864
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,766
All right, access.

865
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,351
Juicing up, boys.

866
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,149
McQueen, I can see you.

867
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,195
I can't see you.

868
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,198
I'll work on creating a
hologram of myself for you.

869
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,618
Hannah told me that you that
you could learn and remember.

870
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,539
Now tell me something
you remember about us.

871
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,583
What do you remember
about our last night together?

872
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,878
You were injured
and I taped you.

873
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,213
What else?

874
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,715
You made love to me.

875
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,891
Hannah, you just said "me."

876
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,437
Why'd you bring me back?

877
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,397
'Cause I can't lose you again.

878
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,442
It was better when I was unplugged.
It didn't hurt.

879
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,611
Now why did Jared kill you?

880
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,239
I know about the interferon.

881
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,491
He's extracting it
at one of his labs.

882
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,036
Well, let's go get him.

883
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,179
I think I'm going
to name it Bruce.

884
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,062
This time wear it.

885
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,937
Now where do you
think you're going?

886
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,523
We don't want to
lose our best customer.

887
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,549
- We'll be there by midnight.
- I'm going there now.

888
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,426
How are you going to manage
that from inside the computer?

889
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,388
My low-tech guy.
I'm not in the computer, McQueen.

890
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,183
I'm electrons,
I'm anywhere I want to be.

891
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,893
But who are you calling?

892
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,395
Chrysalis medical lab.
Choose an option, please.

893
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,106
I'm connected,
keep the line open, McQueen.

894
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,565
I'm going out on a signal.

895
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,067
Hannah!

896
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:57,446
Guys always think you're
supposed to stay in the car.

897
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,786
How you doin', McQueen?

898
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,206
Where are you?

899
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,834
In the chrysalis computer
at the warehouse in wilms.

900
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,084
Where are you now?

901
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,712
About two miles down the road
since the last time I spoke to ya.

902
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,965
Boy are you slow.

903
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,384
Well, you're just a
bunch of electrons.

904
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,595
We are both a bunch of electrons.
Mine are just arranged a little different.

905
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,474
Keep in touch.
I'll guide you in.

906
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,456
It is a custom job.

907
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,962
You see how I got them tires
all tied around there like that?

908
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,591
I thought of that myself.

909
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,555
Legend grows, lab rat.

910
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,828
All right, Hannah,
we're through the barricade, now what?

911
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,497
Head for the lights of the dome.

912
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,749
Okay, but I don't know
where the warehouse is.

913
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,334
It's in the old mall.

914
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:17,211
McQueen,
they're storing bodies here.

915
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,714
I'm coming back to you now.

916
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,939
Something's out there, Jake.

917
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,315
I don't see anything.

918
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,860
It's moving fast, I can see the engine.
It's almost on top of us.

919
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,100
We 're losing hydraulic pressure.

920
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,350
I don't care.

921
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:15,602
Hey, I'm in here too.

922
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,688
That's okay.
I'm going to finish this now.

923
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,108
This is not an
authorized entrance.

924
01:20:58,771 --> 01:20:59,772
Hannah?

925
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,483
Out of bullets, cowboy.

926
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:27,466
My god.

927
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,761
Hey, McQueen.

928
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,560
You okay?

929
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,450
It's you.

930
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,659
Help me.

931
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,873
Don't let them hurt my baby.

932
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,538
Airlock,
you're letting in the germs.

933
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,133
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

934
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,360
You're puny compared to me.

935
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,920
Can't be so. I'm falling apart.

936
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,272
Hey, lab rat!

937
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,863
I figure you didn't have
everything replaced.

938
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,746
The interferon...

939
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,374
Oh my god.

940
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,376
That's all that I have left.

941
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,128
You're just a damn machine.

942
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,964
These plastic parts will
never break or decay.

943
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,717
The newest model Jared
heart will pump forever.

944
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,763
But the body always
rejects the machine.

945
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:04,850
Why?

946
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,228
Why the machine leaves trash.

947
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,982
That's where the problem lies.

948
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:51,688
You know, you can't never come back
into the dome 'cause they'll nail your ass.

949
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,733
That's fine with me.
I mean, this is my place. Zeke was right.

950
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,696
Well, of course, outside the
dome the marshals are the law.

951
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,282
Well maybe you could
use some help, marshal.

952
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:06,495
- Well, don't put yourself out, Jake.
- See? There you go. Just like the old man.

953
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,997
I'm just like the old man.
No, you're like the old man.

954
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,126
No, you're stubborn.
You're like the old man.

955
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,338
You better check the
brakes on your car.

956
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,883
- Will you stop it?
- When are you going to tell him about me?

957
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,760
Oh, that's a good idea, Hannah.

958
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,970
By the way, will, I forgot to mention,
Hannah's not really dead.

959
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:28,433
- She just became my car.
- Tell him you're living at my place now.

960
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:29,976
I am not going to
live in some damn...

961
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,603
Hey, will.

962
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,188
- Jake?
- What?

963
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,233
What's going on?

964
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:37,567
Ah, it's nothing.

965
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,029
Listen, Hannah left me
her house up on the hill.

966
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,072
Really?

967
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,325
I figured I'd hang my
hat there for awhile.

968
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,457
Well, in that case, I guess we'll have
to change the sign outside of town.

969
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,502
It seems like the population's
increased by three.

970
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,757
Mariciella,
she was a school teacher.

971
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,468
We're going to need
one here in Zion.

972
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,846
It's a baby boy?

973
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,305
Yeah.

974
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:11,768
What's his name?

975
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,270
Jake.

976
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,524
I tried to talk
her out of it, but...

977
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,812
First baby born
in Zion in 20 years.

978
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,026
You did good, McQueen.

979
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:22,589
I told you I 'd work
on my hologram.

980
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,132
How do I look?

981
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,595
You look beautiful.

982
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:30,889
[Miss you too.

983
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,477
Oh, come on, Hannah.
This is difficult enough.

984
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,022
Some things I have to
experience on my own.

985
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:41,733
Like touching you.

986
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,653
So we can be close like this

987
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,532
but we can't ever be together?

988
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:53,745
Well, if I can get into cyber
space for a few minutes

989
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,455
so can you.

990
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,167
I'm willing to give it a try.

991
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,298
Let's go home.

992
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,308
Problem is cowboy, you've only got
three minutes Max before you fiatline.

993
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:17,769
Three minutes?

994
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,565
That'll do.

995
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,136
