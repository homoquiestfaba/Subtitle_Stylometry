Throw the bomb !

1004
01:27:29,956 --> 01:27:32,186
This bastard
ain't smarter than us.

1005
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:35,360
For chrissakes, Val !

1006
01:27:35,428 --> 01:27:37,953
- I'm gonna go for it.
- Go for what ?

1007
01:27:49,509 --> 01:27:53,502
- What are you doing ?
- I got a goddamn plan !

1008
01:27:56,049 --> 01:27:57,983
Where the hell is it ?

1009
01:28:02,088 --> 01:28:04,613
I've got it !

1010
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:11,953
[ Earl ] This better be
one hell of a great plan !

1011
01:28:18,538 --> 01:28:21,132
Get ready !

1012
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,199
- Light it, man !
- Not yet. Not yet !

1013
01:28:23,276 --> 01:28:25,244
What are you waiting for ?

1014
01:28:26,613 --> 01:28:28,547
Go !

1015
01:28:29,482 --> 01:28:31,416
Come on, come on !
Come on !

1016
01:28:32,652 --> 01:28:35,246
Too far !
You threw it behind him.

1017
01:28:41,795 --> 01:28:44,059
Run, Val ! Run !

1018
01:28:47,934 --> 01:28:49,424
Yeah !

1019
01:28:51,805 --> 01:28:55,832
Can you fly, you sucker ?
Can you fly ?

1020
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:27,602
Well, it just...
suddenly hit me, you know.

1021
01:29:27,674 --> 01:29:30,802
- Stampede.
- [ Laughing ]

1022
01:29:37,617 --> 01:29:41,144
- [ Cheering ]
- Way to go, Val ! Yeah !

1023
01:29:45,525 --> 01:29:47,891
Now...

1024
01:29:47,961 --> 01:29:50,657
the second we hit Bixby,
we start making some phone calls.

1025
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:52,925
We could make
some real money on this thing.

1026
01:29:52,999 --> 01:29:55,797
We could get
in People magazine.

1027
01:29:55,869 --> 01:29:58,997
People ? Hell !
National Geographic.

1028
01:29:59,072 --> 01:30:01,131
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1029
01:30:01,207 --> 01:30:02,572
Yeah.

1030
01:30:02,642 --> 01:30:05,076
Smile.

1031
01:30:10,517 --> 01:30:12,849
Hey.

1032
01:30:16,723 --> 01:30:18,850
Burt loaned me his camera.

1033
01:30:18,925 --> 01:30:21,086
Yeah.
He gave us these tires too.

1034
01:30:26,366 --> 01:30:28,800
It's all pretty exciting, huh ?

1035
01:30:28,868 --> 01:30:32,497
There's gonna be major research,
and I'm gonna be in on it.

1036
01:30:32,572 --> 01:30:34,506
Hmm.

1037
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:38,874
The first thing to do is take pictures
of that one we dug up.

1038
01:30:38,945 --> 01:30:43,006
Yeah. Yeah. Pictures...
seem like a good idea.

1039
01:30:45,251 --> 01:30:48,482
Well, thanks for everything,
saving my life and stuff.

1040
01:30:49,656 --> 01:30:53,319
Yeah. Well, uh...
you're welcome.

1041
01:30:55,895 --> 01:30:59,831
- Maybe I'll see you sometime ?
- Uh-huh.

1042
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:12,038
Well... see ya.

1043
01:31:17,784 --> 01:31:21,743
I know. I know !
I'm working up to it.

1044
01:31:21,821 --> 01:31:23,755
What am I doin' ?

1045
01:31:23,823 --> 01:31:26,815
I mean, what's a woman like her
want with a guy like me ?

1046
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:28,884
She's going for her damn Ph.D.

1047
01:31:32,132 --> 01:31:34,726
- Rhonda ?
- Yeah ?

1048
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:38,396
I-l-l just...
wanted to--

1049
01:31:55,922 --> 01:32:01,656
* Well, pardon me
but you've had my attention *

1050
01:32:01,728 --> 01:32:06,995
* Ever since you strolled
into the room *

1051
01:32:07,067 --> 01:32:12,403
* Believe me
that it's not my intention *

1052
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:17,739
* lf I appear
to come on too soon *

1053
01:32:17,811 --> 01:32:23,249
* It's not like me
to make such advances *

1054
01:32:23,316 --> 01:32:28,686
* But this time, baby
I could not resist *

1055
01:32:28,755 --> 01:32:34,660
* So if you're up for taking
a chance on love *

1056
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:39,096
* I can't see
a better time than this *

1057
01:32:39,165 --> 01:32:43,693
* So, baby, why not tonight *

1058
01:32:45,705 --> 01:32:50,699
* This could be the start
of something right *

1059
01:32:50,777 --> 01:32:53,678
* Hey, we can take it easy *

1060
01:32:53,746 --> 01:32:56,442
* We can take it slow *

1061
01:32:56,516 --> 01:33:00,748
* We can take it anywhere
that you'd like to go *

1062
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:05,120
* So, baby, why not tonight *

1063
01:33:06,993 --> 01:33:12,397
* Well, the stars are out
and I'm sure they'll agree *

1064
01:33:12,465 --> 01:33:17,835
* Whoa, it's a perfect night
for fallin' in love *

1065
01:33:17,904 --> 01:33:23,308
* So why not fall in love

1066
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:31,516
* Whoa, maybe we could go out
for some dinner *

1067
01:33:31,584 --> 01:33:36,988
* And later on now
we could do the town *

1068
01:33:37,056 --> 01:33:42,790
* You know I'd consider
myself a winner *

1069
01:33:42,862 --> 01:33:47,959
* Just to have
a boy like you around *

1070
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:52,801
* And if you're up
for doin' some dancin' *
