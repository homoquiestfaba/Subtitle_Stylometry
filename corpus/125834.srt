00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,486
The Obeamyway peninsula
a remote and fascinating region

2
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,905
teaming with extraordinary marine life.

3
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,618
we choose this mysterious water
as Bellefontaine's next destination.

4
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,120
In preparation for our voyage

5
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,791
The members of team Zissou's gathered
at my Oceanographic observatory

6
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,584
here on Precious Spot Island.

7
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,506
This was to be our most ambitious adventure
to date and ultimately a tragic one.

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,681
Our team included Esteban du Plantier, chief diver, our
senior statesmen, my closest colleague for 27 years.

9
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,020
Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer,
calm, collected, German.

Eleanor Zissou, my wife, vice
president of the Zissou Society.

17
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,217
We also invited 7 marine science students
from the University North Alaska

18
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,304
to accompany us as unpaid interns
in exchange for school credit.

19
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,603
October 12th, Esteban and I explore
the blue reefs beyond the peninsula.

20
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,110
Florescence Snapper unexpectedly appeared
in shallows extremely rare in this depth.

21
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,082
Where is your gun?

22
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,711
Steve
Steve, where is Esteban?

23
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,601
Check the scanning monitor, start
tracking before it goes too deep.

24
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,396
- Esteban was bitten?
- Eaten!

25
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,399
- Is he dead?
- Esteban was eaten!

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,402
- He was swallowed whole?
- No! killed!

27
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,404
Check the scanning monitor!

28
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,597
Steve, we think you got crazy eye.

29
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,694
Get him out of the fucking water.

30
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:27,791
Esteban! Esteban! Esteban...!

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,293
- what?
- Esteban! Esteban...!

32
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,298
- Steve
- Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban...!

33
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:50,189
(Italian question)

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,483
Was it a deliberate choice never
to show the Jaguar Shark?

35
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,321
No, I dropped the camera.

36
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,199
(Answer in Italian )

37
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,785
Why are they laughing?

38
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,416
(Italian: up there, the young man)

39
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,418
yes, what is next for team Zissou?

40
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,506
Well, that was only
part one. It's a cliff hanger.

41
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:21,595
Now, I am going to hunt down that shark
or whatever it is and hopefully kill it.

42
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,891
I don't know how yet, maybe Dynamite.

43
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,687
- You don't what it is?
- No, I never seen anything like it before in my life.

44
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,814
You said it was a Jaguar Shark,
that was the title of your film.

45
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,194
It was coming right at us I just said the
1st 2 words that came into my head.

46
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,280
(French question)

47
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,208
Revenge.

48
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,302
Bravo!

49
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,803
What fun!

50
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,808
Steve, I would like to introduce you to Tonie
Coach the new head of the film society.

51
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,685
You must be so excited.

52
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,750
I hope so, Do you it went ok?

53
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:15,606
No, congratulations, seriously.

54
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,611
Thanks, I wish it didn't require
the "seriously" but thank you.

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,991
Well, I just don't think they got it.

56
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,700
Steve

57
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,911
You know Larry Arman,
chairman of a Saudi firm

58
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:28,911
- Oh yea Hi
- Nice to see you

59
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,205
Larry was discussing
our financial difficulty.

60
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,501
I thought it was nice for just the 3 of us
roll out the party together, just the 3 of us.

61
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,003
- Why? Does Larry have that kind
of spending power to invest?

62
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,299
- Keep him happy now
- I have got 500 million dollars capitalisation worth

63
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,509
Capitan Zissou, can I get a shot
of you with captain Hennessey?

64
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,134
Where?

65
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,183
Make it quick.

66
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,520
Hey Steven, how is going with your err...
what are you calling... Leopard Fish...?

67
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,482
- Jaguar Shark!
- Jaguar Shark! Exactly, I love it.

68
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,903
Tell me something, does it actually exist?

69
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,114
You know Ali (Hennessey)
I don't wanna give away the ending.

70
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,909
Good man

71
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,203
Oh, here comes our girl

72
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,001
You are the most ravishing creature
that I have seen ever in my life.

73
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,419
- Hello, Skinny.
- Hello Eleanor

74
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,378
Is that a new merit badge?

75
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,383
yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.
I just became a knight in Portugal.

76
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,013
- The presidenty gave us a special bottle of...
- Tell me to be nice to Ali, because I am nerves.

77
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,558
How could you lay that slut faggit!

78
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,018
I was in love with him at the time.

79
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,315
- Yeah, just gets me mad.

80
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,110
I am right on the edge.

81
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,904
Wait here, I will be right back.

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,411
I just want to say hello.

83
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,704
Hi ya babe.

84
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,210
I said I wanted to say hello.
I did not say I wanted you to touch me.

85
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,005
I am here with my wife,
Eleanor, this is Mandiser.

86
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,508
Do you really wanna put me through this?

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,389
People say, Eleanor is
the brain behind team Zissou.

88
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,099
What is Steve?

89
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,602
He is the Zissou!

90
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,989
Steve, this is my little nephew Vernard.

91
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,198
He wanted to meet you.

92
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,409
How are you doing, Vernard.

93
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,620
He brought you a present.

94
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,082
A cramloli fish.

95
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,295
Wow... Interesting specimen.

96
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,006
Thanks pal.

97
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,382
You are welcome.

98
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,387
Steve

99
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,599
How is this?

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,103
Steve, there's a bloke over
wants to have a word with you.

101
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,104
What do you need, old man?

102
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,708
How many of this do you have?

103
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,588
Hi, look, just forge
the rest of them yourself.

104
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,884
Get out of here.

105
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,405
Hey Steve

106
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,117
How come you are not shit
and shiver for your friend Esteban?!

107
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,579
What did you say?

108
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,917
Who are you going to kill in part 2?

109
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,788
(Singing in French)

110
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,185
Larry Arman is flying to Mecca tonight.
See you can make the numbers work.

111
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:04,313
You should have an answer from us in 10 days

112
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,940
Tell him I need to know by Sunday.

113
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,192
Why would I do that, my darling?

114
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,550
Call his bluff, damn it!
and light a fire under his ass.

115
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:15,908
My darling, we haven't made
a hit documentary in 9 years.

116
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,492
Lets not fuck with Larry Arman.

117
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,912
- Explain to him, would you Eleanor?
- screwdriver

118
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,562
He understands, Arman need to make
projection of the world grosses

119
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:28,212
to see if he can run a tax break,
run it through his output deal.

120
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,714
I don't understand but
I can tell it is bullshit.

121
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,719
- Oh, what the hell is going on?
- You need a blackjack and reel cleaner.

122
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,681
Well, if you excuse me, I am
gonna go an overnight drunk

123
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,686
and in 10 days I am going set out to find
the shark that eat my friend and destroy it.

124
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,898
Anyone who is care to join me
is more than welcome.

125
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,197
Captain Zissou, I am sorry
to bother you. I am Ned Plimpton.

126
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,618
My mother's Catherine Plimpton.

127
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,290
You kidding?

128
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,707
No.

129
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,001
How is she?

130
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,092
I am sorry. Shit!

131
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:19,096
She was...

132
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,405
I don't know if it is true
or not by the way, do you?

133
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,698
No, I don't.

134
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,119
I haven't heard from her in 30 years.

135
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,080
I guess its too late now.

136
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,795
She never contacted me, you know.

137
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,589
Yes, I see.

138
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,219
You are suppose to be my son, right?

139
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,596
I don't know...

140
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,601
but I did want to meet you... just in case

141
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,520
I appreciate that.

142
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,614
I'll be right back. Don't go away.

143
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:23,118
(Song: Life on Mars
Sailors fighting in the dance hall

144
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,789
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go

145
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,836
It's the freakiest show

146
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,818
Take a look at the Lawman

Beating up the wrong guy

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know

149
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,018
He's in the best selling show

150
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:55,484
Is there life on Mars?)

151
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,587
Sorry about that you caught me with
one foot off the the other one tonight.

152
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:18,590
That's alight, I don't wanna
take too much of your time.

153
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:21,008
I wanna thank you for talking to me.

154
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,511
- We'll find a way, mate.
- I know we will.

155
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,013
I just had a lovely chat with Si brooman.

156
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,016
He wants you to make an
Oceanographic explorer article.

157
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,980
Possibly going to be the front cover
so do be nice to this girl, Won't you?

158
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,317
Apparently she worships you
and clearly need the press.

159
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,489
Oseary, this is probably my son, Ned.
We just met.

160
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,516
Anyway, his mother just died.

161
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,913
Plus we are having some problems.

162
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,918
I just think it to be a very
special opportunity for all

163
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,795
Ok, bring him over.

164
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,017
So, what do you do?

165
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,980
I am a pilot, Air Kentucky.

166
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,899
- Air Kentucky
- co-pilot actually.

167
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,611
- Yeah, I don't know that one.
- We help out at Louisville.

168
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,614
Sure, there is pretty country in those parts.

169
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:25,698
Landlocked

170
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,703
I have to tell you I have been a member
of the Zissou Society since I was 11.

171
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,082
Well, I will be damned, look at that!

172
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,294
Wanna kill this?

173
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,381
Frankly, I been denied
I don't usually try grass.

174
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,806
Let me tell you about my boat.

175
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,900
The Bellefontaine was a long range
sub hunter during the 2nd world war,

176
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:03,487
which we bought from the
US navy for 900,000 dollars.

177
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:07,491
This is my mentor Lord
Mandrake, he is dead now.

178
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:13,288
The sauna, which was designed by an engineer
from the Chinese space programme

179
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,292
and we keep a Swedish masseuse on staff

180
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,380
Here is where we do all our different
science projects, experiments and so on.

181
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,511
This is the kitchen which contains probably some of the
most technologically advanced equipments on the ship.

182
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,080
Eleanor and I put together
a top notch research library for us

183
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,479
with complete 1st edition set
of life aquatic companion series.

184
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:42,401
We process our own rushes and keep a cutting man
on board so we can do a assemble while shoot it.

185
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,465
I can't find them.

186
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,113
Once again please.

187
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,910
This is the observation bubble, which
I thought up in a dream actually.

188
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,414
Two Albino scouts swim with the ship.

189
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,419
They're supposedly very intelligent
although I have never seen any evidence on it.

190
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,506
Here's the engine room, the bearing
casing is not suppose to look like that

191
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,009
but we can't afford to fix them on the ship.

192
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,451
Tops that, we get the bridge,
then a sub, an old chopper,

193
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:14,892
all kinds of radars, sonar and
underwater movie gadgets.

194
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,894
What happened to Jack Cleeny?

195
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,105
She did not really love me.

196
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,785
Old Mandrake.

197
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,206
It is wonderful.

198
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:42,211
- Very lifelike.
- I am not crazy about it.

199
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,092
This guy is a big time asshole.

200
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,595
We were roommates at the academy.

201
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,244
He used to married to Eleanor.

202
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,891
He owns apparently a lot of money.

203
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,894
You think you will wanna change your name?

204
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,895
Ned...?

205
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,314
No. nothing the Ned part unless you want to.

206
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:08,612
I meant your last name I thought you
might like to let me give you mine.

207
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,490
- Ned Zissou...
- Ned Zissou, exactly.

208
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,452
Or if you want to, you can
change the first part too.

209
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,413
I would have named you
Kingsley if I have a say in it.

210
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:21,582
Kingley... I don't know.

211
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,918
Maybe I will stick with Ned for now.

212
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,881
Sure, that is ok. Anyway I will order
you some correspondent stuff.

213
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,717
What are you doing, I ordered the wine.

214
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,097
Pour it over here please, he
doesn't know anything about wine.

215
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,399
Are those assholes talking about me?

216
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:06,003
People say when people say something like
that about you is because they are jealous

217
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,213
but it still hurts

218
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,506
It hurts bad.

219
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,219
That man was damn rude,
he can go straight to hell.

220
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,698
How did she die by the way? your mother.

221
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:39,203
She took her own life, took sleeping pills.

222
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,788
Why would she do that!?

223
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:46,210
Well, she was in a great
deal of pain, you know.

224
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,794
Oh...

225
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,089
I see, yeah.

226
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:56,303
You know my best friend
just got killed, Esteban.

227
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,598
Yea, I know. Your old man.

228
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,895
Let's go to my island.

229
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,900
Well, I have to be back
in Kentucky on Thursday.

230
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:13,904
Thursday? ok! that is ok.

231
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,909
(Singing in French)

232
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,819
Your cat's dead.

233
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,820
What? Which one?

234
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,198
Marmalade, I am sorry.

235
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,409
What happened?

236
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,204
A rattle snake bit it in the throat.

237
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,791
God damn it, Eleanor, why did
you have to say it like that!

238
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,794
You couldn't try and
break it a little bit nicer!?

239
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,803
She is a rich bitch, you know.
She was raised by maids.

240
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:25,184
Her parents paid for this Island
during my worst moments.

241
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,897
People say she the brain behind team Zissou.

242
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,984
People say a lot of things.
What kind of cat was it?

243
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,112
Who gives a shit!

244
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,784
- I think it was a Tammy.
- Ned, wanna come inside, we'll make up a room for you.

245
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,913
Steve, that reporter called.

246
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,304
- Ned, wake up!
- yes

247
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:07,308
I am on echo box.
Press the red button to answer.

248
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,313
- Meet me on the beach in 12 minutes.
- The what button? OK.

249
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,608
Action!

250
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,613
Only twice before have I a good
future to observe a rubber tide.

251
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:25,619
That rare occurrence when 100s of electric jellyfish
spontaneously washed on to a beach all at once.

252
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:30,582
Bobby Ogata brings exactly
this to our attention tonight.

253
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:39,299
Steve, what produces this effect of illumination?
Is there chemicals inside the organism?

254
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:45,514
No, Ned, its actually the reflection of the
moon light on their outer membranes.

255
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,310
That is very good outlet.

256
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:55,107
Klaus, come over here, get a shoot
of me and Ned. Ned, come in here.

257
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,114
Would you like to join my crew?

258
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,410
- Would I like to...
- I want you on team Zissou!

259
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,496
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

260
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,083
Well, it's my field, I don't
have a background before.

261
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:14,584
No one here does.

262
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,711
Klaus used to be a bus driver.

263
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,152
Wolodarsky was a high
school substitute teacher.

264
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:21,832
We are a pack of straights, don't you get it?

265
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,511
See, I am not even that strong in swimming.

266
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,184
- The answer is Yes.
- Well, it's gotta be.

267
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,103
I will order you a red cap and a Speedo.

268
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,104
Cut.

269
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:38,317
- Klaus, why aren't you rolling?
- Can I have a word with you please?

270
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,694
Why aren't you getting this?

271
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,282
That was a God damn tear jerker
why did you cut it, man!?

272
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:50,204
Because this sounds going to be shit
he does not even know how to hold a broom.

273
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,207
He doesn't diddly jack
about work with me.

274
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,209
Don't cut unless I say cut.

275
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,005
I never seen so many
electric jellyfish in my life.

276
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,508
Thay are Viacon madawores.

277
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,104
Ah, shit, she is right.

278
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,606
Where do you come from? You look pregnant.

279
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:24,112
I am pregnant, not even going ask what you men are doing
out here with your matching pajamas by the way.

280
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,199
We are producing a film
as a matter of a fact.

281
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,699
Who are you?

282
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,996
I am Jane Winslet-Richardson, I am the
reporter from Oceanographic explorer.

283
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,084
- Oh, yea, sure, how did you get out here?
- I hired some drunk in a fishing boat.

284
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,586
That would take 4 hours,
why would you do... that?

285
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:45,592
- Because no one picked me up at the FN airport.
- Jesus Christ, Klaus.

286
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,803
One of my guys suppose to do that.

287
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,306
How long have you been working with Zissou?

288
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,187
Ah... Approximately... only 10 minutes actually.
I was hired doing the scene on the beach.

289
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:58,688
He is Steve's son supposedly.

290
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,816
You are?
No, you are not, he doesn't have one.

291
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,821
We are not 100% sure about
that yet, we just met yesterday.

292
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,616
Not this one, Klaus.

293
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,416
You heard me, not this one.

294
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,084
Ok.

295
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,209
First thing in the morning.

296
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,214
- It's got everything?
- Yeah, tell him to pus a stop and a half (photographic term)

297
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,301
What are you going to do with him?

298
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,804
Who? Ned?

299
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,390
What do you mean?

300
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,810
I don't understand the question.

301
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,484
I offered him a spot on the Bellefontaine.

302
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,112
He didn't take it, did he?

303
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:52,117
Of course he took it, we are going
to put him on the map, Eleanor!

304
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,120
We are going to throw him a life-preserver.

305
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,206
I believe in this boy.

306
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,582
Why?

307
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,795
Because he looks up to me.

308
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes, Sir, and Mckernan's going
to take my shadow flights.

309
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:12,804
That is right.

310
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:18,602
I just feel like I need to see
this thing through, so...

311
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:24,191
Thank you for understanding. I'll check in
with the Louisville office next month.

312
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:38,997
(Jane, reading a book)

313
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,395
Hold it!

314
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,400
That's poetry?

315
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,986
No, It's a six volume novel.

316
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,697
Oh, I see. You are going read that
whole thing to yourself out loud?

317
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:15,284
I am not reading it to myself,
I am reading it to... him.

318
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,582
When did you learn Zissou was your father?

319
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:26,086
- Does it freak you out for me to ask that?
- No, it doesn't.

320
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,215
But its a difficult question.
I sew the pieces together over the years.

321
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,885
Well, How did he first contact you?

322
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,888
He didn't. I went looking for him
last month after my mother died.

323
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,684
She had ovarian cancer, then it
spread to her stomach and liver

324
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:42,686
and she took her own life.

325
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,897
Oh...

326
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,817
- Oh, good night I guess.
- Good night

327
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,613
Do you mind if I sit down
and listen for a little while?

328
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,992
Ok.

329
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,918
Do you want me to catch
you up on the story?

330
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:12,007
No, I will be able to figure it out.
I'll just catch as much as I can.

331
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,303
They made these about...

332
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,807
3 and a half year before
they terminated my sponsorship.

333
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,047
These are great!

334
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,486
May I turn this on?

335
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,196
Fire one.

336
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:39,993
So, what happened in your opinion?

337
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,411
What are you talking about?

338
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,083
Well, don't you think the public reception of your
work is significantly odd over the last 5 years!

339
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:49,503
That's your first question! I thought
this suppose to be puff piece.

340
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,588
Should we come back to it?

341
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,651
Yeah...

342
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:53,590
Ok...

343
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,720
Is it true this is going
to be your last voyage?

344
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,953
Wow, no comment.

345
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:04,810
Who told you that?

346
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,812
No, God damn it! I am only 52.

347
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:11,107
I am gonna to start with some stark dialog.

348
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:14,507
favourite colour, blue,
favourite food, sardines.

349
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:17,906
How do you feel about
part 1 of your new film?

350
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,993
Why? How do you feel
about part 1 of my new film?

351
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:24,997
- Well, I am honest, you know.
- Just say it!

352
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,294
I thought I suspect it is slightly fake.

353
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:34,590
Wolodarsky, I am going to take 5 (minutes).

354
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,302
Did it seem fake...

355
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,389
when my best friend was bitten
in half right in front of me?

356
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,892
and eaten alive screaming?

357
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,603
I think you are fake.

358
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,897
I think you are phoney.

359
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,606
Not a bad reporter.

360
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,984
How's that feel?
and tell me something

361
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,487
Does this seem fake?

362
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,407
How dare you!

363
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:04,912
This entire article was my idea,
no one else gives a shit!

364
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,788
What about Si Brooman?

365
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:11,001
Are you joking, he is not
even covering my expenses.

366
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,881
You are taking something out on me.

367
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,391
Wah, stop crying.

368
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:30,687
What is the deal here? I was
only trying to defend myself.

369
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:33,190
Well, you did a great job.

370
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,193
I am sure you will make a terrific father.

371
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,784
So...

372
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,995
You really think you are a Zissou?

373
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,289
I don't know.

374
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,919
You travelled a long way
for "I don't know" sonny.

375
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,003
That's true

376
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:58,005
but it's important to me.

377
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:02,803
Yah, well, there are a lot of things that are
important for some people around here sonny!

378
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,679
Klaus, don't call me sonny!

379
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,518
One more thing, it's Steve
Zissou show, not the Ned show!

380
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,397
You hear me?

381
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,816
Yes, I do.

382
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,486
- Klaus
- Yah?

383
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,280
If you ever touch me again,

384
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:26,702
I will kick your God damn
teeth out, is that understood?

385
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,289
Not if I don't see you first sonny.

386
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,802
We gonna watch ourselves
around this Jane character.

387
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:45,720
Don't tell her anything personal.

388
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:49,683
If you are not sure about something
change the subject and look for me.

389
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,687
This bulleye (Lesbian term)
got something against us.

390
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:57,191
I don't think she's
a lesbian, she is pregnant.

391
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,984
bulleye can get pregnant.

392
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:03,780
Anyway, I would back out
now but we need the press.

393
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:05,282
See you tomorrow

394
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,910
Steve.

395
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,495
Hmm.

396
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,706
When did you first hear about me?

397
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,710
About 5 years ago, I...

398
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,214
Read it in an article about myself.

399
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,508
Do you believe it?

400
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,388
It was in the paper, I assumed
they checked their facts.

401
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,893
Why didn't you contact me?

402
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,399
Because I hated fathers
and I never wanted to be one.

403
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:51,912
I forgot, your correspondents stuff came in.

404
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,085
(Text: Paper title Kingsley (Ned) Zissou)

405
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,505
Hi Ross, it started today.

406
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:06,510
I will forward some pages to you
through the copy department.

407
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,888
You probably right there.

408
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,393
What am I doing here?

409
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,105
I miss you and...

410
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,483
Oh God, I don't know Ross.

411
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,402
Where are you?

412
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,408
Listen! I am not leaving this message!

413
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,287
Don't even know why I am still pregnant.

414
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,590
Script girl use this for continuity.

415
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,114
Here.

416
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,887
- No no no no...
- No exceptions, everyone gets one.

417
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:56,310
- Ann Marie, did the interns get guns?
- No, they all share one.

418
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,021
Take it, Ned.

419
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,190
- Steve.
- What?

420
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,401
Wack on the echo box.

421
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,903
Zissou here.

422
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:10,282
Steve, Oseary Drakoulias on line 2.

423
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:12,617
Yeah.

424
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:16,288
I spoke with Larry Arman and it's a pass.

425
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,916
In another word, you fucked us!

426
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,939
Let's not cast stones on one another, my boy.

427
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,120
- Do you hear me, damn it, do you?!
- No, I don't!

428
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:28,300
- I told you I will not quit!
- Listen here mate...

429
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:30,886
Can I have a moment?

430
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,095
Who the places is there?

431
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:37,100
It's me Ned. Maybe this is not
nothing, maybe it's something.

432
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:41,480
I don't know your problems, I don't know...

433
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:44,838
but I just inherited 275,000 dollars.

434
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,195
Would that amount make any difference?

435
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:52,199
What sort of expression
the lad is wearing on his face?

436
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,701
Can you ply a chopper?

437
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,914
I have! Certainly not licenced
but let's see how she performs.

438
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,791
Great, let's go.

439
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,801
When this water bird last serviced?

440
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:15,305
I don't know, Klaus suppose
to check it every 6 months.

441
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,480
You are back on the water, boys.

442
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:30,319
The wire transfer came right through from Kentucky
and jackman get finance a rest.

443
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,199
but we have a few hooks on it. So, take a pill
for a spill (cockney slang as in take a seat)

444
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,788
No.1. the bank wants to take a drug screen
for everyone on the crew before they forward the money.

445
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,290
- A piss test?
- Yes, piss test.

446
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:48,380
2. A Stooge from the bond company will be riding
everywhere during the whole shoot to keep you on budget.

447
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,714
Who is the stooge?

448
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:53,719
A chap with the name of Bill Ubell and there is not
a damn thing you can do about that, Steve.

449
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:59,183
3. You must swear, legally swear that
you will not kill that shark or whatever it is.

450
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,310
If it actually exists.

451
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,106
I am going to fight it
but I will let it live.

452
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,107
What about my dynamite?

453
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:12,112
Philip, dynamite.
I am off to Zurich, follow me chaps.

454
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:18,118
Mr. Ubell, I would like you to know Steve
Zissou and our equity partner, Ned.

455
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,712
I hope you are not
going to bust our jobs, Bill.

456
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,088
Why do I ever wanna do that!

457
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,155
Because you a bond company stooge.

458
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:37,221
Sss... I am also a human being.

459
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:42,017
Oh right, that is, I will take it back.

460
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,604
Let's have some teamsmenship.

461
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,318
Hold.

462
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,497
-1, 2, 3
- come on

463
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:34,879
1, 2, 3

464
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,011
Head up, head up, boy, here he is,
here he is, you ok, Ned? You are ok?

465
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:46,099
Alright, give him some room, he is ok.
He just drunk a little too much water.

466
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:54,900
- How are you shooting this? Wide open?
- Err, 5 by 6 (picture ratio)

467
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,895
As always, even in the most
challenging circumstances

468
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:14,294
the members of team Zissou
find ways to keep moral high.

469
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,803
Wait, hold it! Is that a distress bark?

470
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,809
Is something wounded out there?

471
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:33,105
We quickly located the
source of the mysterious cry.

472
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,505
What is she, Steve?

473
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:39,318
A wild snow mongoose

474
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,613
We thought they were extinct.

475
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:43,906
Her ankle's broken.
Ogata...

476
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:47,661
Go and get some hot milk and
put these guys in the incubator.

477
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:51,415
We radioed for emergency transport
of our beautiful new friends.

478
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,796
That's what it used to be like.

479
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:13,812
Has Ned's heart stopped beating
before you pulled him out of water?

480
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:18,692
Has Ned's heart stopped beating
before we pulled him out of water?

481
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,404
Yes but we got him to
start again pretty quickly.

482
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,699
Don't go on this voyage right now, Steve.

483
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,785
One of you is already dead after all.

484
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:29,995
Who?

485
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,583
Oh, you mean Esteban?

486
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,585
Thanks for bringing that up.

487
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,383
Who is going to tell us the Latin
names of all of fishes and everything!

488
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:45,886
You know I can't remember all that shit.

489
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:48,013
Please stop Eleanor, Eleanor! Stop!

490
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:48,888
Why are you leaving?

491
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:52,392
I am leaving because I don't wanna be a part
of whatever is going to happen out there.

492
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:53,893
Nobody knows what is going to happen

493
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:56,897
and then we film it,
that is the whole concept.

494
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,898
It's what we've always done.

495
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,485
I can't believe you took that boy's money.

496
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,903
He is an investor.

497
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,781
You are my sidekick.

498
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,909
The sugar crabs are back.

499
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,204
They are early this year.

500
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:15,916
I never saw them mating
before the they sourced us.

501
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,210
Is that mating?

502
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,511
Bye Steve.

503
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,603
- Don't say that, even it's true, it's too painful.
- What do you want me to say?

504
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,108
Say Bon Voyage.

505
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,905
Bon Voyage.

506
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:51,910
(Singing in French)

507
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:30,616
Kinsley Ned Zissou, 29 junior grade
diving tech, excusive producer

508
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,495
energetic, spirited, youthful.

509
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:40,417
Normally, we would track the Jaguar shark
with a scanning monitor we keep on board of Bellefontaine

510
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:44,505
but it's power tube sized up in Madagascar.

511
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:50,093
We now proceed to a more advanced system
located on a colleague's off-shore facility.

512
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,400
See Renzo, this is what I am
talking about, a relationship sublock

513
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:07,903
There is chemistry between us, you know!

514
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,407
- Here is a quote.
- When? Who from?

515
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:17,120
Zissou almost has a magical
connection to the life of the sea.

516
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:19,288
He speaks it's language fluently.

517
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,709
I never met a boy like
that through all my life.

518
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,418
Lord Mandrake.

519
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:25,795
You should have opened with that one.

520
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:29,800
- He was your mentor.
- Hey intern, Come here compart it, will ya?

521
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:31,885
On rocks?

522
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:35,806
You wanna go up my ballon?

523
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,686
I like her hairdo.

524
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,605
Me too but Steve called it first.

525
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,487
I am sorry I made you cry the other day.

526
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:54,700
Oh, that's ok, not
completely your fault anyway.

527
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:57,286
I do have some personal problems.

528
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,288
Really, what do you got?

529
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:00,997
Well, I am...

530
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:05,002
5 months pregnant, my editor is the father
He's married but...

531
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,087
not to me.

532
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,715
Wow, that's breath taking.

533
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,719
You know my first wife
left me when I was your age.

534
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:19,892
- What is deep search?
- a submarine.

535
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:27,399
I had the exact the same image of you tacked up
on the wall of my aquarium all through primary school.

536
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,695
Oh yeah, you mean the official
photograph when I am doing this?

537
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:33,906
That's the one.

538
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:39,119
Maybe it's just me but I don't
feel like that personally.

539
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,787
I never did.

540
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:56,595
Why did you abundant Ned?

541
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,183
I didn't, I never even met him.

542
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,105
What kind of piece you are writing, cowgirl?

543
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,609
Are you going to screw us on this deal?

544
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,487
I hope not.

545
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,082
You really think it's cool to hit the source
when you got a bun in the oven?

546
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,086
Pele, bring us back down please.

547
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,801
I don't have a problem
with objective reporting.

548
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:41,807
What I have a problem with is some wombat
coming on my boat and trying to reel with me, you know.

549
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:48,814
I need to see if you can you get one of the dolphins
swimming onto the hole and give us a look.

550
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:01,910
Nah, either they can't hear us
or they don't understand.

551
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:06,790
Son of a bitch, I am sick of these dolphins.

552
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,586
Quiet out there tonight.

553
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:13,589
Can you hear the Jack-whale singing?

554
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,594
Beautiful, I wonder what they are saying.

555
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:21,597
That was the sludge tanker over there but...

556
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:24,099
There you go
that's them.

557
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,815
By the way, Would you mind if I made a few
modifications to the team Zissou insignia?

558
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:35,110
- I have some ideas...
- New badge?

559
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:37,195
Yes, insignia.

560
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,491
Yea, it's probably kind of dated, isn't it?

561
00:45:40,492 --> 00:45:42,451
Sure, take a crack at it.

562
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:44,411
Make it a little trendier.

563
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:48,290
Alright.

564
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,503
Are you finding what you are looking for?

565
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:54,588
Out here with me?

566
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:59,008
I hope so.

567
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,803
I wrote you a letter about 17 years ago.

568
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,516
You mean like a fan letter?

569
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,186
Did I write you back?

570
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:12,689
I tried to answer
as many as I personally can.

571
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:14,858
"reading a letter... Dear Ned Plimpton,

572
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,901
First, in answer to your question. Always.

573
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:20,489
Second, thank you very much
for naming your bug after me.

574
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,282
My wife tells me it is
actually a type of gnat,

575
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:27,287
you strike me as a very special boy and
a key member of the Zissou society.

576
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:31,792
I wish I could come visit you in Kentucky
and assist you with your work.

577
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,085
I remember your mother

578
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,003
Take care yourself, Ned Plimpton.

579
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:39,508
You've severed well.
Your friend Captain Steve Zissou

580
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,301
Dictated but not read (sz/jz)

581
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,808
Yeah, more or less end
of the board play I guess.

582
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:54,689
There are some real high tech
gears inside this steel, believe me.

583
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:58,694
First, we go stairs and turn on the tracking system,
then as long as the battery on that homing dart...

584
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,115
- Who locked us out?
- No one, we are trespassing.

585
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:05,492
Steve, are we allowed in here?

586
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,410
It's scientific community, man.

587
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:11,415
Captian, I am required by law to notify
the bank of any illegal actives.

588
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,710
Just do what you gotta
do and cover your ass, Bill.

589
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,511
Fuck! They wired it!

590
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,889
Klaus, go down and get me some cables.

591
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,810
Warning: this is captain Hennessey,
you have trespassed on a private facility.

592
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:35,147
The coast guards have
been alerted by Satellite.

593
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:38,484
Again, this is Hennessey,
immediately leave the...

594
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,489
Ok, action. Look who's back in town!

595
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,889
You travelled 150 miles since
we last heard from you.

596
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,287
This sun of bitch is heading
for the south Pacific.

597
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,999
- Turn your tape recorder, carbie (Jane).
- Is the attack of the shark?

598
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,543
On the record, yes. Cut.

599
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,775
Rips all takes, Vikram.

600
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,005
Was I just in the film?

601
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:05,511
- Yeah, you are going have to sign a release.
- But, but you actually located the shark...

602
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,512
You bet your fucking ass we did.

603
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:12,184
Alright, everybody, we've got about 25-30 minutes
before the coastguards get here to arrest us.

604
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:16,480
I want you all get Hennessey's best
gear onto Bellefontaine in 15 (minutes).

605
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,982
- You are going to steal this stuff?
- No, we will give it back to him.

606
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,985
Interns, let's seize some house.

607
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,051
Arr... what is this, Pele?

608
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:27,908
Don't know err.. the map...

609
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:30,409
- Steve
- Arhuh.

610
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,081
Do you know you just charted us
on a course to unprotected waters.

611
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:36,290
Yar, we are taking a shortcut.

612
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:40,295
- But it's outside IMU Jurisdiction there, isn't there?
- I know, give me the map.

613
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,382
We go your way, that is about 4 inches.

614
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:47,511
We go my way, that is an inch and a half.
Do you pay for the extra gas?

615
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:49,512
What kind of system is this?

616
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:53,517
It's Burnstain 9, just started last summer.
- Is the 9 out already!

617
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,519
- Is this for Capriccio?
- Yah

618
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,482
Wait a second, Steve,
this isn't the procedure.

619
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:05,320
Steve, one of the interns just fell downstairs
with the mine tracking Processor.

620
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:07,196
Aright, just make sure we steal the backup.

621
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,616
Are you listening to me!? I was
told under no circumstance...

622
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:13,620
Shut up before they jail us, Anne-Marie.

623
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:29,511
You are catching anything?
- Mmm mmm.

624
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,808
Hook this up and make me a latte.

625
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:45,819
You know, carbie (Jane) is kind of sucke
maker but she's got some moves.

626
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,405
I agree.

627
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,910
If she wasn't a bulleye, I might
have a bit of thing for her.

628
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,091
As you can see...

629
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:13,096
If the creature continues it's current to migratory
route. Our path should converge... less than 4 days.

630
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,181
I wanna get there in 3.

631
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,997
- Ogata...
- Vladimir, what is this... right over here.

632
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:20,812
I don't know, I have been
trying to figure that out.

633
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:24,106
We might have them both mixed up
or it could be the other way around.

634
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:27,694
But anyway, we are going to be right
on top of it first thing in the morning.

635
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:33,408
- Good point, Ned.
- Thank you, should we investigate it?

636
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:36,911
Yah, let's make a quick dive at 6am

637
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:38,704
and we will scope out the phantom signal

638
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,291
It's probably just one of
Hennessey's research turtles.

639
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:45,087
I wanna be back on the route by lunch.

640
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:48,714
Do me a favour.

641
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:52,719
Next time you got a hot idea in front
of a reporter, whisper to my ear first.

642
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:56,598
Otherwise, I look kind of
like a day-dream jonny.

643
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,517
Alright, I got it.

644
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:03,313
- You let him change your name!
- Well, we changed it together.

645
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:06,607
- What was it before?
- Edward Plimton.

646
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:11,405
That is a million times better, change it back,
Ned. I really don't think you as a Kingsley Zissou.

647
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:15,701
Do you think Steve and I
have a family resemblance?

648
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:17,786
No.

649
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,582
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway.

650
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:29,006
Here

651
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,592
I stole it back.

652
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,806
I strung it on some peppermint dental floss
in case you wanna wear it like a necklace.

653
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:02,414
- Happy with the piece, Jane?
- What are you doing in here!

654
00:52:02,415 --> 00:52:04,916
Am I? No.

655
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,209
Put that down!

656
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,215
I assume I am Mr.Z. I am sorry
you think my red hat is err..

657
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,384
what did you use... contrived.

658
00:52:14,385 --> 00:52:16,511
and that...

659
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:21,517
the Zissou of my childhood represent
all the dreams I come to regret!

660
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:26,688
- What? Why?
- I am going have to start locking my cabin door.

661
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,191
It was locked, I kicked it in.

662
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:31,818
Why don't curse like other people?

663
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:35,113
Because I am trying to get out of the
habit before I have my fucking baby!

664
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:38,116
Ok, that makes sense.

665
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,203
Please clean your room anyway,
it looks like God damn Typhoon...

666
00:52:41,204 --> 00:52:43,413
Get out!

667
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:53,590
Please don't make fun of me,
I just wanted to flirt with you.

668
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:57,511
I will have an intern come and fix the door.

669
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,400
This is a message from the IMU coastguard

670
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:16,405
Apparently some crooked fuckers
broke into my sea lab yesterday.

671
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,906
How awful! Did they nick anything?

672
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,993
It doesn't say, they probably
just trashed the place.

673
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:23,495
I am so... pissed, I wanna spit.

674
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:34,298
We are going to hunt these sickos.

675
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:40,512
Supposely, Crew stole this cronies invented
the idea of putting walkie talkie into the helmet.

676
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:45,100
We made ours with a special rabbit ear
on top, so we can pipe in some music.

677
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,483
Let's start with a reverse scene.

678
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,495
Ok, roll it, Vikram.

679
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,793
Would you be comfortable for me
to address you as dad in this scene?

680
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:54,294
No, why?

681
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,008
Oh, excuse me, I am sorry,
I forgot... I am sorry.

682
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:03,387
Where are you coming from! check off? Shit!

683
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:07,516
It's not a bad impulse though,
some of kind of nickname.

684
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,811
Not that one, it's too specific.

685
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,397
Try invent something else.

686
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:15,607
Another name?!

687
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:18,819
How about Stevezy?

688
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,198
That is good, try it.
What were going to say before?

689
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,703
Good luck, Stevezy.

690
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,997
Fantastic, let's go.

691
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:39,798
Ok, action.

692
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:49,516
Look, Ned, there is a
sunken airplane down there.

693
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:50,893
Let's check it out.

694
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:04,990
We examined the crash site but we were
careful not to disturb the forensic evidence.

695
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:06,908
How was that?

696
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,912
Not bad, the first thing was a little faster.

697
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,582
Klaus... Klaus!

698
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,294
- Yar?
- Can I have a work with you please?

699
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:23,716
What?

700
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:26,093
- Why did do that?
- Because I owe you one.

701
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:30,098
What! You give me a warning already!
You stood up for yourself!

702
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,308
I still owe you one.

703
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:35,187
- Now I owe you one.
- No, now we are even.

704
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:39,483
Why did you do this? it is not my
fault, you know I don't have that...

705
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,319
What are you talking about?

706
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,781
We are even, damn it! that's it!

707
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:09,304
No, it was like a... beat up little jalopy.

708
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,890
I don't know what you call it.
You didn't see it!?

709
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:13,392
I don't see it, boss.

710
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,520
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

711
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:20,190
Klaus, check who is the
watch. I will be in the Sauna.

712
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:26,280
Pele and who the shit is Kingsley Zissou?

713
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,702
- Is that him?
- Hmm, that is him.

714
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:36,290
I never felt a baby in
someone's stomach before.

715
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,880
I think you will make a
very good single mother.

716
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:47,300
Thanks.

717
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:51,305
Although it does bring you
both tremendous disadvantage.

718
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:09,281
You know...

719
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,910
Steve got a little bit of thing for you.

720
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:15,913
Why do you say that?

721
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,415
Because he told me.

722
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,212
Really! I thought he hated my guts.

723
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:26,215
Oh, I think you have hurt his feeling
a little bit but it doesn't mean...

724
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:30,219
He said that I hurt his feelings...?

725
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:35,098
So! I've fucked up.

726
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,419
Yeah?

727
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:51,383
Steve, would you please open the door?

728
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:07,399
Jane, is Ned in there?

729
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,280
Stevesie, what's happening?

730
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:15,114
Are those hijackers?

731
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:17,868
Well, we call them pirates out here, Ned.

732
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:20,621
You are supposed to be on watch, by the way.

733
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:25,584
My god, you are right.

734
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,090
So tell me, you are reading
to each other in French?

735
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:33,446
No, it's in English.

736
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:34,800
It was translated.

737
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,804
You know, you are not supposed to
go into each other's cabin on a boat.

738
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:39,096
Why not?

739
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:44,102
It's just kind of an unwritten maritime rule
when you are at sea.

740
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:46,897
Especially be an goddamn lookout.

741
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:48,482
I am so sorry.

742
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:49,482
So am I.

743
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:52,694
You hung myself to dry.

744
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:55,906
We don't handle this right,

745
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:59,116
We'll all get murdered.

746
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:04,081
Including her unborn British child.

747
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,379
I will kill you asshole.

748
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,590
I am gonna hit you so fucking hard.

749
01:01:13,591 --> 01:01:17,803
You will be blind.

750
01:01:17,804 --> 01:01:22,015
Please don't hurt him.

751
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:23,599
Watch me.

752
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,185
I'll let you know what I am
going to make them a little...

753
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:27,187
Steve, it's a way to save the passengers.

754
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:27,895
Do what they say.

755
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,148
Help them put money and jewelry in the chest.

756
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:32,401
Yeah. How am I going to finish my movie then?

757
01:01:32,402 --> 01:01:35,486
Jesus Holy!

758
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,488
They are going to kill us, Steve.

759
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,992
I am patting you on
the back right now, Klausie.

760
01:01:39,993 --> 01:01:41,117
Don't be scared.

761
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:46,081
We'll get through this, everybody.

762
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,209
Wake up, Nedo.

763
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,587
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

764
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:57,009
I need to speak to the man in charge, fellas.

765
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,010
Don't point that gun at him.

766
01:01:58,011 --> 01:02:01,596
He's an unpaid intern.

767
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:02,805
What kind of coverage did you get?

768
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:07,811
I just kept it rolling until they
put this hood over my head.

769
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,813
Bill speaks their language.

770
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:11,106
What are they saying, Billy?

771
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:16,111
Hold on.

772
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,991
Apparently they are taking a hostage.

773
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:25,996
Obviously they have chosen Ned.

774
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:30,208
Now they find out that I speak Filipino,

775
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:34,004
They seem to be changing their minds.

776
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,217
You have a vault?
They want to know if there is a vault.

777
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:39,509
There's no vault.

778
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:44,014
"Our vault contains at least ten different currencies
from all over the world at any given moment.

779
01:02:44,015 --> 01:02:49,019
"We are prepared for every
kind of financial necessity."

780
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,814
There goes Ned's inheritance.

781
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:55,108
Tell them if they don't
get off my boat right now,

782
01:02:55,109 --> 01:03:00,113
There is going to be a major shit storm.

783
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,146
Nedo, can you hear me?

784
01:03:12,147 --> 01:03:13,971
We'll get you back, Billy.

785
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:15,795
Is everybody else save?

786
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:16,880
Anne-Marie, are you ok, honey?

787
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:17,797
No, I'm not.

788
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:20,884
I told you there are unprotected waters.

789
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:25,889
What a fucking nightmare.

790
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:29,183
Be cool on this shit, ok?

791
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,937
I mean at least try to show both sides.

792
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:35,816
I need to find a baby for this father.

793
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:39,695
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

794
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,585
Here we go.

795
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:56,502
Steve?

796
01:03:56,503 --> 01:04:01,508
I said "Get your ass the hell off my boat!"

797
01:05:05,614 --> 01:05:10,619
I've never seen a bond company stooge
stick his neck out like that.

798
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:21,088
What's this sound?

799
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:22,380
Is that...

800
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,091
Artic night lights, yeah.

801
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:30,097
As if the natural world
has been turned upside down.

802
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:37,812
Get some cuts away of this miracle.

803
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:42,818
Klaus and Ogata,
put out the deck fire before we sink.

804
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:48,699
Those fucking amateurs,
you left your dog, you idiots.

805
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:56,790
Wrap this stiff in a table cloth.
We are going to bury him at sea.

806
01:05:56,791 --> 01:06:00,502
Should we give him to
the authority or something?

807
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:02,795
No.

808
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:06,591
I'll write up a few words to read over.

809
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:11,597
How are you holding up there, intern?
Doing ok?

810
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:16,602
Ned, how many fingers am I holding on?

811
01:06:16,603 --> 01:06:18,019
I don't know.

812
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,399
That's not my job.
Too many to tell.

813
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,404
He's gonna be just fine.

814
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,287
I believe it's criminal that
Steve allowed this to happen to us,

815
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:38,206
By which I mean illegal.

816
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:43,212
We are being led on an illegal
suicide mission by a selfish maniac.

817
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:45,379
I hear what you're saying.

818
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:50,385
But I think you misjudged the guy.

819
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:02,898
Holy shit!
Son of a bitch!

820
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:07,902
Cut.

821
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:12,908
We are here to response to your
distress signal. Remain calm until...

822
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,917
Ogata, run upstairs to put a chart board
over, says "Operation Hennessey" on it.

823
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:23,417
What about this guy?

824
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:28,382
Just throw him over the other side.

825
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:34,096
Your engine blown up and all your
fuel been stolen. Is that correct?

826
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:35,096
Uhuh.

827
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:36,305
I certainly know how you feel.

828
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:40,394
Some fuckers just stripped
my sea lab, you know.

829
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:44,188
Probably the same dudes.

830
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:47,400
I can tow you as far as Port-Au-Patois.

831
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,986
I'll need your signature
on that invoice first,

832
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:54,199
to account for the expenses of this rescue operation
as well as my time and that of my crew.

833
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,618
This is more than the
budget of my whole project.

834
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:57,410
It's an estimate.

835
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:02,416
What is your dog's name?

836
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:08,088
Cody.

837
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:14,887
Be still, Cody.

838
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:18,807
I have to run this by my bond company stooge.

839
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:20,391
He's been kidnapped.

840
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:24,041
It's true. I have to rescue him first.

841
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:27,691
Sorry, in an hour I'm leaving out here.

842
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:34,697
Oh, I dined with Eleanor last weekend.

843
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:39,411
By the way, she's summering in my villa
in west part of Patois, don't you know?

844
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:44,416
Say, how's Team Zissou
holding up without her?

845
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:55,886
The first thing that goes through a captain's head
when he hears there is low moral going around is

846
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:57,512
"What did I do?"

847
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,410
"Is that all my fault?"

848
01:08:59,411 --> 01:09:01,307
Well, it's probably right.

849
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,811
Most of us have been
together for a long time.

850
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:07,148
The others got here before we left.

851
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:10,484
Do you all not like me anymore?

852
01:09:10,485 --> 01:09:12,693
I mean.

853
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,988
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know.

854
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:18,784
Look, if you are not against me,

855
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:21,118
Don't cross this line.

856
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,083
If yes, do.
I love you all.

857
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:32,109
Are you sure?

858
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,506
Yes, I am.

859
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:35,801
I don't understand. Why?

860
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:37,885
What do you mean?

861
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:39,742
Wait a second. What are we doing?

862
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,597
You said cross the line if...

863
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,308
Cross the line if you are going to quit.

864
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:48,313
Oh, do it again. I misunderstood.

865
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,196
Hi, Ross.

866
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:00,909
I got your questions.
They are fine.

867
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,911
But I am not coming back.

868
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:03,619
It's over.

869
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,414
Please don't try to contact me, ok?

870
01:10:05,415 --> 01:10:10,419
You'll hear from us sometime.

871
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:15,007
He got attacked by pirates.

872
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:20,012
I fear if life is...

873
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,013
Well, you get the idea.

874
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:25,309
Anyway, take care of yourself. Jane.

875
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,393
Will you write to me?

876
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:31,314
Of course. Give me the address.

877
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:36,320
Actually I went ahead with stamp and
self-addressed 50 or so envelops.

878
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,781
I think it will be easier for you.

879
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:42,617
Thanks. I'll use them.

880
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:47,206
Each one has three blank pages in it.

881
01:10:47,207 --> 01:10:50,291
Here's a pen.

882
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:55,297
Maybe I am going to write you a letter right now.

883
01:10:56,507 --> 01:11:01,512
OK.

884
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:11,688
Bet I'm really going to miss you, Ned.

885
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:14,191
I'm going to miss you too.

886
01:11:14,192 --> 01:11:16,692
In fact I feel like,

887
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:21,114
I don't know. I feel like my heart
is almost getting broken.

888
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:26,119
I guess I'm over-reacting.

889
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:31,416
Is it really true?

890
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:34,919
Yes, it is.

891
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,090
That was all off the record.
That whole deal.

892
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:42,219
Actually, I was surprised you
didn't cross the line yourself.

893
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,386
What line?

894
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:46,390
The line I drew on the deck just now.
You weren't up there?

895
01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:48,307
No.

896
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:50,309
You're kidding.

897
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:54,314
That was one of the most dramatic things
that ever happened on this boat.

898
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:57,316
I just lost all my best interns.

899
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,194
I thought you were supposed
to be covering this story.

900
01:11:59,195 --> 01:12:00,612
You just said it's all off the record.

901
01:12:00,613 --> 01:12:03,866
Yeah, but you didn't know that.

902
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:07,119
Must have down here packing.

903
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:11,080
So, you are leaving?

904
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:13,583
You are jumping ship out of me.

905
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,085
Thinking of scrap the article.

906
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:20,007
You mean you are not even gonna
write the cover story on me?

907
01:12:20,008 --> 01:12:22,300
I just don't have any statue anymore.

908
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,180
Sorry, Steve. Everything
just got too weird. That's all.

909
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:31,185
But I gave you a goddamn
showstopper up there.

910
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:34,292
Are you sleeping with Ned?

911
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:36,482
That's none of your business.

912
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:38,107
Ok.

913
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:40,861
Are you?

914
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:43,613
No, I'm not.

915
01:12:43,614 --> 01:12:45,990
You are gonna miss the Jaguar shark.

916
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:49,119
Or what ever it is if it actually exists.

917
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,414
Are you crying?

918
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:56,293
You cry easily, don't you?

919
01:12:56,294 --> 01:12:57,502
Bloody hell.

920
01:12:57,503 --> 01:13:00,087
God save that poor little stooge.

921
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:02,799
This never would've happened
if Eleanor was with us.

922
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,508
Thanks, man.

923
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:06,804
You are lack of a bit damn well Zissou mate.

924
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:07,678
Now I must go away.

925
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,515
I'll send you a postcard from my chapels.

926
01:13:09,516 --> 01:13:11,600
What? Where are you going?

927
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:13,309
Abroad, my darling.

928
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,249
It's my passport status.

929
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,970
I am X-9 for the moment.

930
01:13:16,971 --> 01:13:18,689
Legally I am a fugitive.

931
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,109
Wait a second. They stole my budget,

932
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,485
My boat is broken,

933
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,696
You are ditching me up the creek.

934
01:13:24,697 --> 01:13:26,906
What am I supposed to do here?

935
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:29,409
I must say, nothing is jumping to mind.

936
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:32,850
Phillip, any suggestions?

937
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:36,291
No, he's shaking his head.

938
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:56,519
No. I can't give you full credit.

939
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,480
But I'm not going to flunk you either.

940
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:03,318
You are all getting incompletes.

941
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:08,282
This is bullshit.

942
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:42,982
Oh shit, what do you want?

943
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,694
Do you mind if I buddy up a little bit
before I answer that question?

944
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:49,406
Yes, I do. Tell me now.

945
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:50,698
I need some money.

946
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,116
To get the boat out of Patois.

947
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:54,786
and rescue my bond company
stooge who got kidnapped.

948
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,998
Could you ask your parents
to loan money to me?

949
01:14:57,999 --> 01:15:00,960
No.

950
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:03,920
OK.

951
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:05,713
Could I go ahead and buddy up anyway?

952
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:10,719
It took me two and a half hours to get down here.

953
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:12,804
Who's that dude?

954
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:17,810
He's my research assistant.

955
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:24,191
Steve.

956
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,407
You know I have to be jealous about
you staying at Ali's place.

957
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:37,119
I always thought it's a closet aquarium.

958
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,019
How's your father-son
relationship coming along?

959
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,918
Well, nobody has a real luck on any of these.

960
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:44,502
So I don't know how it all times out.

961
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:48,298
I mean, I know I want him
to think of me like a father.

962
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:51,009
But the fact that there is an outside chance,

963
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,179
That he could really be my actual...

964
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:58,391
Biological son,

965
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:03,397
It's very difficult for me.

966
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:10,111
You know I'm not big on apologizing.

967
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:12,197
So I just skip it if
it's all the same to you.

968
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:13,489
Ok?

969
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:17,410
Anyway, I'm sorry.

970
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:21,206
I know I have not been
in my best in the past decade.

971
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:25,001
That's true.

972
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,005
What happened to me?

973
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:31,007
Did I lose my talent?

974
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:34,720
Am I ever gonna be good again?

975
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:38,806
I don't know.

976
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,892
Doesn't matter anyway.

977
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:43,311
It's probably the last adventure I got in me.

978
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:46,106
I was hoping to go out
and flash a blaze as it has been.

979
01:16:46,107 --> 01:16:49,443
I probably just end up going home.

980
01:16:49,444 --> 01:16:52,613
Unless you plan to sell the island.

981
01:16:52,614 --> 01:16:55,782
I don't know how much I can get for it.

982
01:16:55,783 --> 01:16:59,911
In this market?

983
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:02,164
You are probably right all along.

984
01:17:02,165 --> 01:17:04,416
We should've had a kid together.

985
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:06,584
Of course,

986
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:11,590
You are kind already on
the edge of being too old.

987
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:17,095
Unless maybe cop out

988
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:23,894
It's worse than a cop out. I was 34.

989
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:32,110
It's good to see you, Eleanor.

990
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,488
I'm about to blow my stack.

991
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:38,200
I turned my back and the bullshit begins.

992
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:41,285
Ned, yours come back.

993
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,788
Jane, you're a goddamn liar.

994
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:46,041
What the fuck are you doing here?

995
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:48,292
What the F are you doing here?

996
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:50,879
I warned you of being
in the other people's cabins.

997
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,588
You were supposed to go home.

998
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:56,885
You can beg me to stay and finish the story.

999
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,742
Is there still a cover?

1000
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:02,598
I don't fucking know.

1001
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:06,895
Don't you dare to put on that uniform.

1002
01:18:06,896 --> 01:18:08,604
It's all I have with me.

1003
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:11,400
I told you I have a bit of thing for her.

1004
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:13,192
Not this one, I said.

1005
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,988
You said: " Not this one, Klaus."

1006
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:17,196
So you heard me.

1007
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:19,992
You are too old for me, Steve.

1008
01:18:19,993 --> 01:18:21,617
Well, you are pregnant.

1009
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:24,496
I have a word with you privately.

1010
01:18:24,497 --> 01:18:29,501
Yes.

1011
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:35,507
Follow me.

1012
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,510
Are you two fighting?

1013
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:40,721
I'll deal with you later.

1014
01:18:40,722 --> 01:18:41,804
Look, Steve.

1015
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:43,306
I know we both like her.

1016
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:45,893
You are angry and embarrassed.

1017
01:18:45,894 --> 01:18:47,602
Leave her out of it.

1018
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,395
You think that was what this is about?

1019
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:52,608
Shit. What was that
bull I've been telling you?

1020
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:54,109
All right, I am gonna warn you now.

1021
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:56,611
Be a gentleman.

1022
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:57,487
What are you doing here?

1023
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:59,302
I thought your interns ran out on me.

1024
01:18:59,303 --> 01:19:01,116
I want to help you find that shark.

1025
01:19:01,117 --> 01:19:02,993
Goddamn it. Thank you, intern.

1026
01:19:02,994 --> 01:19:04,349
You'll get an 'A'.

1027
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,704
His name is Nico.

1028
01:19:05,705 --> 01:19:07,788
Hello.

1029
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,081
Give me that camera.

1030
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:12,503
I'm gonna smash it, or you could.

1031
01:19:12,504 --> 01:19:15,296
Cut.

1032
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:17,298
I misread you, man.

1033
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,384
I'm gonna have to rethink some shit.

1034
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,093
You don't know me.

1035
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:22,220
Never wanted to know me.

1036
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,390
I'm just a character in your film.

1037
01:19:25,391 --> 01:19:26,682
It's a documentary.

1038
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:29,019
It's all really happening.

1039
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:33,481
Damn you for that.

1040
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:38,487
Go to bed, you sons of bitches.

1041
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:43,408
That pregnant slug has been
playing us like a cheap film.

1042
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:48,204
- That's it.
- I'm gonna fight you, Steve.

1043
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,499
You never say: "I'm gonna fight you, Steve."

1044
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,501
You just smile and act natural.

1045
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:53,918
Then you suddenly punch.

1046
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:56,213
You fight your way and I'll fight mine.

1047
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:57,213
Listen, Ned.

1048
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:02,219
Don't you try...

1049
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:08,517
I think your "Team Zissou" ring
might have caught me on the lip.

1050
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:13,668
You call yourself my son.

1051
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:16,817
But I just don't see it.

1052
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:19,987
It's nothing personal.

1053
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:24,116
What do you want?

1054
01:20:24,117 --> 01:20:26,284
Nothing.

1055
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,745
That's so arrogant.

1056
01:20:28,746 --> 01:20:31,205
That's... screw off.

1057
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:34,501
I can't believe I've asked
if I could call you dad.

1058
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:35,918
Of course you said no.

1059
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,588
I like you call me Stevesie.

1060
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:42,091
It sounds better.

1061
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:47,097
It doesn't mean the same thing.

1062
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,391
A week before she killed herself,

1063
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:55,397
my mother told me that you've known about me
since the day I was born.

1064
01:20:55,606 --> 01:20:58,609
Is that a fact?

1065
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:01,611
That's a fact.

1066
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:06,617
I ought to stay in Kentucky where I belong.

1067
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,789
Quiet.

1068
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:18,795
Somebody pays for this water taxi.

1069
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:25,093
You got any petty cash on you?

1070
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:28,806
Remind me of sending the owner's parents of
a "thank you" note on a good correspondent stock.

1071
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:32,391
Ok.

1072
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:37,397
This is the message we received earlier tonight
on our answering machine.

1073
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,402
"Billy Ubell here.
I am on a pay phone.

1074
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:43,486
"I'm still blind-folded.

1075
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,907
"My arms are bound. But a young boy
has been kind enough to assist me.

1076
01:21:46,908 --> 01:21:49,785
"There is not much chance I will
get another opportunity to call.

1077
01:21:49,786 --> 01:21:52,579
"So I thought I would ask if...

1078
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:57,584
What? No.

1079
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:00,711
Well, thanks for checking in, Bill.

1080
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:04,507
Next time maybe you could let
us know where you are at.

1081
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:09,388
Based on the quality of the connection,
the variety of wild life in the background and

1082
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:14,101
The lapse of time between Mr.
Ubell's capture and this message,

1083
01:22:14,102 --> 01:22:17,896
There is a good chance he is
on one of the Ping Islands.

1084
01:22:17,897 --> 01:22:21,482
There used to be a four-star
hotel on Little Ping.

1085
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:25,195
But the entire island was destroyed
by monsoon five years ago.

1086
01:22:25,196 --> 01:22:28,303
It's been uninhabited ever since.

1087
01:22:28,304 --> 01:22:31,409
I know the place. Hotel Satoir.

1088
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:35,204
I'd like to speak on the record for a moment.

1089
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:38,916
Eleanor has always been
the brain behind Team Zissou.

1090
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:43,881
By the way, are you going to put in a good description
of the command center set up down here.

1091
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,509
Ok, gang. That's the plan.

1092
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:51,304
Set the course for the Ping
Islands, full speed ahead.

1093
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:56,101
You need to hire a team of mechanics to
rebuild the engine first of course.

1094
01:22:56,102 --> 01:22:59,312
I know. I am saying after that.

1095
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:04,318
Just because I've decided to save your neck again,
help you do this rescue, doesn't mean you've won me back.

1096
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:09,907
Yes, Ma'am.

1097
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:19,290
Thanks.

1098
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,210
The father is out of the picture?

1099
01:23:21,211 --> 01:23:23,085
Uhuh.

1100
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:27,508
Actually I was sort of terrified
about having this baby.

1101
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:31,386
Right now, I am not
really scared of anything.

1102
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:33,680
Maybe it's my hormone.

1103
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:37,099
That makes sense.

1104
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:41,480
I'm going to tell you something confidentially,
which will not be mentioned again.

1105
01:23:41,481 --> 01:23:45,692
I'm pretty sure I'm the only person
who could say this, including Steve.

1106
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:48,611
Never mind how I found out. I'm a scientist.

1107
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:51,615
It's the thing that puzzles
me about Ned's situation.

1108
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:52,782
What is it?

1109
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:56,495
Zissou shoots blanks.

1110
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:58,079
Hum.

1111
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,085
I think maybe it's because he
spent half of his life underwater.

1112
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:40,414
let's try track 3 against this picture.

1113
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:49,089
"A treacherous reefs surrounds the Ping Islands,
warning intruders to keep their distance.

1114
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,305
"Today we discovered one of its
victims off the coast of Ping Three.

1115
01:24:57,014 --> 01:25:02,019
"Our colleague Alistair Hennessey and
his crew are nowhere to be found.

1116
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:05,814
"We will land at dawn.

1117
01:25:05,815 --> 01:25:07,899
Not bad.

1118
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:12,905
We will temper with that anyway.

1119
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:50,192
All right, let's go.

1120
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,587
Oh, shit. Swamp leeches.

1121
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:16,593
Everybody, check for swamp
leeches and pull them off.

1122
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:23,892
Nobody else got hit. I'm the only one?
What's the deal?

1123
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:26,102
What a shame!

1124
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:31,108
They had a bar tender here, who
made the best Rum I ever tasted.

1125
01:26:31,483 --> 01:26:36,488
You are ready?

1126
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:42,286
Should we do this?

1127
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:04,683
The barometer is falling.
It's gonna rain in five minutes.

1128
01:27:04,684 --> 01:27:05,683
We gotta be quick.

1129
01:27:05,684 --> 01:27:07,310
Where are they?
Unknown.

1130
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,019
We will split into two groups.

1131
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,689
I'll take Ned, Ogata and Wolodarsky.

1132
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:11,898
Thanks.

1133
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,693
Thanks a lot for not picking me.

1134
01:27:14,694 --> 01:27:15,610
What?

1135
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:18,405
We are smack in the middle of
a lightning strike rescue op, Klaus.

1136
01:27:18,406 --> 01:27:20,990
- What's the deal?
- I'm sick of being on B squad.

1137
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:25,996
Listen, maybe you're on B squad.
But you're the B squad leader.

1138
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:27,997
Don't you know me and Estaban

1139
01:27:27,998 --> 01:27:31,606
We always thought of you as a baby brother.

1140
01:27:31,607 --> 01:27:35,213
I've always thought of you two as my dads.

1141
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:38,592
Please don't let any new one
make fun of me for saying so.

1142
01:27:38,593 --> 01:27:41,386
I can't guarrantee that, Klausie.
But I'll try.

1143
01:27:41,387 --> 01:27:45,286
Can we get on with maneuvers now?

1144
01:27:45,287 --> 01:27:49,186
Wolodarsky, got something?
Not yet.

1145
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:58,904
Anybody sees anybody?
Empty.

1146
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:06,620
I think the whole place is deserted.

1147
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:11,583
Shit!

1148
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:14,503
Ok, let's not get down on ourselves.
We still get two more Ping Islands to check out.

1149
01:28:14,504 --> 01:28:17,214
Except I don't know if we
have enough gas to do it.

1150
01:28:17,215 --> 01:28:20,467
Damn it, Steve.

1151
01:28:20,468 --> 01:28:23,719
This sucks.

1152
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,684
I'm disappointed in myself.

1153
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:37,317
My first wife Jacqueline and I
spent our honeymoon here.

1154
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:43,490
Things are pretty different now.

1155
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:48,996
All right, let's check out.

1156
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:54,209
Did you get that?

1157
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:55,585
Yeah.

1158
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:59,213
Good. We'll give them reality this time.

1159
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:03,218
A wash-up old man with
no friend, no distribution deal.

1160
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:04,616
Wife on the rocks.

1161
01:29:04,617 --> 01:29:06,012
People laugh at him.

1162
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:08,514
Feeling sorry for himself.

1163
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:13,520
Can I have a word alone with my son, please?

1164
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:15,606
Are you all right?

1165
01:29:15,607 --> 01:29:19,609
Not really.

1166
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:24,615
By the way, I've been thinking of a nickname
that might mean the right thing.

1167
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:30,913
I came up with "Papa Steve".

1168
01:29:38,587 --> 01:29:43,509
I'm sorry I've never acknowledged
your existence all these years.

1169
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:48,514
It will never happen again, I mean it.

1170
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:51,600
You're my son to me.

1171
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:54,602
Almost more so.

1172
01:29:54,603 --> 01:29:59,608
See, for me to meet a guy
like you at this time of my life,

1173
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,111
I don't know, it's just...

1174
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:07,491
I want to communicate my feelings for you.

1175
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:09,283
But...

1176
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:13,997
I think I'm gonna start to cry.

1177
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:19,002
That's ok.

1178
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:24,091
There's something in the coat check-in.

1179
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,305
Hey, Billy. Are you ok?

1180
01:30:30,306 --> 01:30:32,599
Did you get my message?

1181
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:37,604
Yeah.

1182
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:43,901
Jesus.

1183
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:46,404
These pirates are monsters.

1184
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:49,700
Well, yeah. They remember I shot one of
their guys in the neck last week and killed him.

1185
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:54,204
So I think we are OK too.

1186
01:30:54,205 --> 01:30:59,209
Where is Cody?

1187
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:04,798
Cody?

1188
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,481
Steven?

1189
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:26,487
Are you rescuing me?

1190
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:33,118
Fold.

1191
01:31:45,798 --> 01:31:50,803
Klaus, bring the dynamite.

1192
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:04,191
They are in there after all.

1193
01:32:04,192 --> 01:32:09,196
Run! Go! Move now!

1194
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:19,790
We got some great footage
of your boat out there.

1195
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:21,207
I guess it's totaled.

1196
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:25,754
Perhaps. We are extremely well-ensured.
We will come out ahead, man.

1197
01:32:25,755 --> 01:32:30,300
Although allow me, I have to recruit
the crew from scratch next time.

1198
01:32:30,301 --> 01:32:35,305
They made soup out of my research turtles.

1199
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:45,314
Ogato, get the first aid kit.

1200
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:50,320
Klausie, Nedo, dig in here and hold these
weapons off while I call in rendezvous.

1201
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:54,408
We'll meet on the beach.

1202
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:58,119
You're A squad.

1203
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,290
Renzo, Renzo.
Anybody? Hello? Hello?

1204
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:06,295
This one is out of juice.

1205
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:11,383
Thanks.

1206
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:14,156
No, Captain.

1207
01:33:14,157 --> 01:33:16,086
This is Cedric.

1208
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:18,093
He's a friend.

1209
01:33:18,094 --> 01:33:20,099
May I see, Cedric?

1210
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,105
Remind me. We'll send him a red cap.

1211
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:28,317
Wolodarsky, go get the
keys to their fishing boat.

1212
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:29,400
Throw them in the water.

1213
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:34,406
No, wait. They may have another set.
Just blow it up.

1214
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:40,496
Hey, Ned.
It looks like we recovered your inheritance.

1215
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:46,418
Klausie.

1216
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:58,514
That's it. I'm retired.

1217
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:15,906
Oh, no. We forgot Cody.
We gotta go back.

1218
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:25,290
Good bye, Cody.

1219
01:34:41,598 --> 01:34:43,308
See, this represent Belafonte.

1220
01:34:43,309 --> 01:34:45,309
Here is the island.

1221
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:47,604
That circle represents friendship.

1222
01:34:47,605 --> 01:34:50,357
And KS stands for Klaus.

1223
01:34:50,358 --> 01:34:52,672
Where's your symbol, Ned?

1224
01:34:52,673 --> 01:34:54,986
I don't want to pose myself.

1225
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:58,614
Klaus is right.
The flag needs a Ned's symbol.

1226
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:03,412
I suppose we could put an "N"
on the side of that octopus.

1227
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:06,081
What does that stand for over there?

1228
01:35:06,082 --> 01:35:08,916
Estaban.

1229
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:13,881
Worked last night. But now the whole
tracking goes completely on the fritz.

1230
01:35:14,715 --> 01:35:15,506
Screw it.

1231
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:18,385
We'll sell it for scrap along with
the boat and the submarine.

1232
01:35:18,386 --> 01:35:20,887
We're going home.

1233
01:35:20,888 --> 01:35:23,807
Just take up the whirlybird and see
what we will find out there anyway.

1234
01:35:23,808 --> 01:35:27,519
I got a feeling we can spot
this fish from 111 feet up.

1235
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,190
Ned, I don't know if I
really saw the bastard.

1236
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:36,320
I have $275,000 investment
in this damn production.

1237
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,405
Something ate Esteban, did it?

1238
01:35:38,406 --> 01:35:42,055
Now lead!

1239
01:35:42,056 --> 01:35:45,704
Right?

1240
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:10,978
What's that?

1241
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:13,586
A letter from Jane.

1242
01:36:13,587 --> 01:36:17,392
What does she say?

1243
01:36:17,393 --> 01:36:21,198
Nothing to speak of.

1244
01:36:27,579 --> 01:36:30,144
Thank you for putting me on the flag, Ned.

1245
01:36:30,145 --> 01:36:32,709
Of course, Klaus.
It was my pleasure.

1246
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:34,418
But you stick me on the dolphin.

1247
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:37,297
I want you to know how much it means to me.

1248
01:36:37,298 --> 01:36:39,216
Well, I'm very pleased you like it.

1249
01:36:39,217 --> 01:36:42,615
You didn't listen to me.

1250
01:36:42,616 --> 01:36:46,014
I didn't just like it.

1251
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:50,394
You understand?

1252
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:52,478
Yes, I do.

1253
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:57,484
Thank you, Klaus.

1254
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:07,786
I still got yours of course.

1255
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:12,791
My what?

1256
01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:15,918
"Dear Captain Zissou,

1257
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:18,881
I am 12 years old and live in Kentucky.

1258
01:37:18,882 --> 01:37:20,591
A creek runs behind our house.

1259
01:37:20,592 --> 01:37:21,883
I live with my mother.

1260
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:23,718
She met you once some years ago.

1261
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:27,889
I collect catalogue of
amphibians, reptiles and insects.

1262
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:31,017
I don't know what this one was called.
So I named it myself.

1263
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:35,564
You are probably my one of,
if not the favorite person I've ever studied.

1264
01:37:35,565 --> 01:37:40,110
I plan to be either: A. an oceanography,
B. an architect, C. a pilot.

1265
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:42,111
Thank you very much for your good work.

1266
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:46,200
Sincerely, Ned Plimpton,
Blue Star Cadet, Zissou Society.

1267
01:37:46,201 --> 01:37:51,205
P.S. Do you ever wish you
could breath underwater?

1268
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:56,084
I still wish I could breath underwater.

1269
01:37:56,085 --> 01:38:01,089
Me too, Ned.

1270
01:38:04,301 --> 01:38:05,719
Fluorescence snapper.

1271
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,470
What?

1272
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,220
Where?

1273
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:08,305
What's that?

1274
01:38:08,306 --> 01:38:09,388
A good sign.

1275
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:14,394
The last time we saw that, the big fish...

1276
01:38:17,981 --> 01:38:19,899
Zap a bark up there, didn't it?

1277
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:24,905
I heard a pin snapped,
loose the rotator mechanism.

1278
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:33,205
This is gonna hurt.

1279
01:38:47,803 --> 01:38:52,808
Ned!
Ned!

1280
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:57,103
Ned!

1281
01:38:57,104 --> 01:39:02,109
Hey, Stevesie.

1282
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:11,263
Are you ok?

1283
01:39:11,264 --> 01:39:14,912
I'm ok.

1284
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:19,918
What happened? Do we hit something?

1285
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,716
Maybe the push drive failed.

1286
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:30,595
I am sorry, Ned. I should've scrapped
this chopper ten years ago.

1287
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:35,601
No. maybe I should've auto rotated
and perform a hard bank for the descent.

1288
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:40,480
We might crash a little softer.

1289
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:45,486
I wouldn't make any difference at all.

1290
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:57,599
All hands bear the deck.

1291
01:42:00,621 --> 01:42:04,583
This is the first time Eleanor's ever cried
in front of me as long as I've known her.

1292
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:09,379
Except once when she got her arm
caught in the deck wrench.

1293
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,444
Is this mine...

1294
01:42:11,445 --> 01:42:13,508
Espresso machine?

1295
01:42:13,509 --> 01:42:17,012
What is, how did you get my espresso machine?

1296
01:42:17,013 --> 01:42:18,888
Well, uh...

1297
01:42:18,889 --> 01:42:23,894
He fucking stole it, man.

1298
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:29,983
Ali, Why don't you go party.
You know, I need to talk to your ex-wife.

1299
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:37,199
We've never made great husbands.

1300
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,701
Have we?

1301
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:40,201
Of course.

1302
01:42:40,202 --> 01:42:43,413
I have got an excuse. I'm part gay.

1303
01:42:43,414 --> 01:42:48,418
Supposingly, everyone is.

1304
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:01,390
I never told you this, but I was hoping,

1305
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:03,496
We might get a chance to adopt Ned.

1306
01:43:03,497 --> 01:43:05,602
I think he would've wanted it that way.

1307
01:43:05,603 --> 01:43:07,312
Would you go along me on that?

1308
01:43:07,313 --> 01:43:08,980
He was 30, Steve.

1309
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:11,817
But I would have considered it.

1310
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:13,818
Thanks, Eleanor.

1311
01:43:13,819 --> 01:43:15,696
We are a dying breed.

1312
01:43:15,697 --> 01:43:18,698
Yeah.

1313
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:21,493
I guess we were all right while
we lasted thought, weren't we?

1314
01:43:21,494 --> 01:43:24,120
We would like totally escape, my darling.

1315
01:43:24,121 --> 01:43:29,084
We would like the body shot of yours.
You slam with the ahhh...

1316
01:43:29,085 --> 01:43:31,086
Damn it. I had it on the plane.

1317
01:43:31,087 --> 01:43:32,588
What was I gonna to say?

1318
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:33,504
Oh, well...

1319
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:34,881
It's good to see you.

1320
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:36,133
How's your passport status?

1321
01:43:36,134 --> 01:43:37,927
Much better, thank you.

1322
01:43:37,928 --> 01:43:39,720
I'm back down to X-4.

1323
01:43:39,721 --> 01:43:40,803
Tell me.

1324
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:44,892
Who knocked up the reporter?

1325
01:43:44,893 --> 01:43:49,897
I don't know.

1326
01:43:53,317 --> 01:43:55,319
By the way, thank you for
showing me the first draft.

1327
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,819
You read it.

1328
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,696
What did you think?

1329
01:43:58,697 --> 01:44:01,115
I was a little embarrassed at first.

1330
01:44:01,116 --> 01:44:05,913
Obviously people is gonna think I am
a showboat, a little bit of a prick.

1331
01:44:05,914 --> 01:44:08,916
But then I realize,

1332
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:10,708
That's me.

1333
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:14,880
I said those things.
I did those things.

1334
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:19,217
I can live by that.

1335
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,720
You are a good writer, Jane.

1336
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:25,098
It's the icing cover.

1337
01:44:25,099 --> 01:44:28,393
Is that a girl?

1338
01:44:28,394 --> 01:44:30,686
Excuse me.

1339
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:31,604
I am sorry to interrupt.

1340
01:44:31,605 --> 01:44:33,753
But we've just got the
scanning module to back up.

1341
01:44:33,754 --> 01:44:35,900
It looks like the Jaguar
shark or whatever it is,

1342
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:40,906
We're tracking it in the trench
on the far side of the reef.

1343
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:56,797
Everybody feels like going for a ride?

1344
01:45:11,812 --> 01:45:16,817
I hook up a bluefin on the rope
to give it something to eat.

1345
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,779
Is that one of mine?

1346
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,785
I think one of my research turtles survived.

1347
01:47:58,687 --> 01:48:00,480
Is that him?

1348
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:05,486
That's him, Klaus.

1349
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:26,590
Are we safe in here?

1350
01:48:26,591 --> 01:48:29,091
I doubt it.

1351
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:33,242
You still want to blow him up?

1352
01:48:33,243 --> 01:48:37,392
No. We are out of dynamite anyway.

1353
01:48:40,187 --> 01:48:43,606
It is beautiful, Steve.

1354
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:48,612
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

1355
01:48:49,613 --> 01:48:54,618
I wonder if it remembers me.

1356
01:49:18,308 --> 01:49:23,313
In 12 years, he will be eleven and a half.

1357
01:49:24,106 --> 01:49:29,111
That was my favorite age.

1358
01:49:40,581 --> 01:49:42,290
Like this?

1359
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:45,085
Just like that.

1360
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:47,879
You do it too.

1361
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:49,088
We completed the adventure.

1362
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:53,302
But another member of my crew has been lost.

1363
01:49:53,303 --> 01:49:56,243
This one was my son.

1364
01:49:56,244 --> 01:49:59,182
Also our equity partner.

1365
01:49:59,183 --> 01:50:04,188
We started our voyage
home in our wounded vessel.

1366
01:50:25,292 --> 01:50:30,297
This is an adventure.
