1
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,122
A toke?

2
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,302
Do the fucking toe thing, all right?

3
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,341
You know the rules.

4
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,026
I'm getting out!

5
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,423
- Just look at my feet. Jesus Christ.
- Fuck it!

6
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,558
- Just do the fucking...
- Just look at my feet.

7
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,862
Shut up!

8
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,701
- Don't fucking look at me!
- Fucking pussy.

9
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
- Pay me.
- You fucking like it.

10
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,429
I'd fucking like it if you pay me.

11
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,434
Fucking loser.

12
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,473
Fucking slut.

13
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,817
I don't want to deal with this...

14
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,752
You have to deal with this.

15
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,224
- Thank God this was not an emergency.
- Well, it isn't?

16
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,563
That is very interesting, ma'am.

17
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,967
It's against the law to call 911
when it's not an emergency.

18
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,699
Let's take her in right now. Come on.

19
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,571
Is that the best thing
the police department has to do today?

20
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,906
It'd be the best thing I've done all year.

21
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,446
Okay, ma'am,
what seems to be the problem?

22
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,911
Besides her attitude?

23
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,514
Yes, besides that. How can we help you?

24
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,881
I haven't heard from my son in days.

25
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,356
And he's not answering his phone.

26
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,994
Just stand back. Stay here.
We'll take a look around.

27
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,898
- Check all the windows.
- Thank you.

28
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,028
I'm going in.

29
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,857
Hello?

30
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,954
Calm down.

31
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,962
- Shit.
- Calm down.

32
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,595
I entered the house from the side.

33
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,298
Found Officer Martinez in the kitchen.

34
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,701
- Look, keep her out of here.
- I'm from the <i>Los Angeles Chronicle</i>.

35
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,573
No civilians. Period.

36
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,014
Dumb bitch.

37
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,317
...and found Officer Martinez in the kitchen.

38
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,547
Who dropped the evidence there?

39
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,751
Who came in through the back door?

40
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,959
I did.

41
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,956
Well, you stepped on
the only good footprint.

42
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,431
Good work.

43
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,964
You got a spot on your uniform.

44
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,770
I ordered Officer Martinez around the back.
It was my call.

45
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,171
- I had no cause.
- We're gonna take it from here.

46
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,009
Can I say something?

47
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,175
I know you guys know everything and all...

48
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,479
but there's something
you might want me to point out.

49
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,416
- We'll take it from here.
- What is it?

50
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,652
Was she raped after she was killed?

51
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,928
- Police work's a guessing game for you?
- No.

52
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,893
Why do you think she was raped?

53
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,332
Am I right?

54
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,701
The medic said that...

55
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,704
it was something like that...

56
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,241
except a little more sick.
You know what I mean?

57
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,970
Let's go, Martinez.

58
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,614
I bet he only cut out the man's eyes, right?
Not the woman's.

59
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,684
He's afraid of men,
and he wants power over women.

60
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,152
You're brilliant. Survey says: Wrong.

61
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,486
Are we fucking done here?

62
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,458
He cut the woman's eyes out, not the man's.

63
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,726
You'll earn your stripes some other time.
Is that it?

64
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,389
Yeah, that's it.

65
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,028
Next time you show up at a homicide,
you see a body, call us.

66
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,105
Don't fucking touch nothing. You got it?
Good.

67
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,520
Officer, can I speak to you for a second?

68
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,058
What is it?

69
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,327
What did you find inside that house?

70
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,762
Why don't I tell you
all about it over dinner, sweetheart?

71
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,403
Leave her alone. Come on.

72
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,338
I'm sorry we can't be of any more help.
You're gonna have to wait...

73
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,347
for the official press release like
the rest of the media. That's all. Thank you.

74
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,391
Can you believe the way those guys
spoke to me? I am so fucking over it.

75
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,358
Forget about that shit.

76
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,295
That punk white boy's got his head
so far up that nigger's ass...

77
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,226
you can't even understand him anyway.

78
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,298
Is that why you didn't back me up?

79
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,534
I didn't back you up because
I don't give a shit what them <i>putos</i> think.

80
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,506
Can we go?

81
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,881
Mommy, you left the door unlocked
again and it's very late at night.

82
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,486
It's very dangerous.

83
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,417
<i>In Beirut, Lebanon,</i>
<i>a militant Islamic faction...</i>

84
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,681
<i>has claimed responsibility</i>
<i>for the deadly suicide bombing...</i>

85
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,278
You want pizza?

86
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,223
<i>... more than 230 U.S. Marines dead.</i>

87
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,853
Let me cut. You know what, stop it.
This is, you know, for everyone.

88
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,965
Did you see Mom today?

89
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,835
Is she still listening to that crazy stuff?

90
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,217
Open your fucking trunk.

91
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,785
You want to do business, or no?

92
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,760
What's taking so long?

93
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,666
What the fuck is this?

94
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,801
There's something wrong with you.

95
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,715
That's four people in one night.

96
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,454
This is unbelievable.

97
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,685
My fucking wife is going crazy.
All my PG neighbors are going crazy.

98
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,598
I was thinking about
asking Father Rodriguez...

99
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,536
if he has any insight.

100
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,837
Homo Rodriguez? Whatever works for you.

101
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,977
If I were you, I'd be thinking
about what I was gonna say...

102
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,573
if they ask me to be on
the Night Stalker Task Force...

103
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,019
as a homicide detective.

104
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,923
Why do you say that?

105
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,659
Because Lt. Mayberry
was asking me about you.

106
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,458
I told him you were perfect for the job.

107
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,495
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,699
Why didn't I... Who cares why? I don't care.

109
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,800
Don't go getting all high and mighty on me.

110
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,670
They probably just need...

111
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,850
a chick cop from East LA
to make themselves look good on TV.

112
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,854
I knew you were gonna say
something stupid like that.

113
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,186
- Okay.
- Thanks.

114
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,952
If you're so fucking psychic...

115
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,190
you should be making
a lot more than $20,000 a year.

116
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,898
Now, detectives... They make about $25,000.

117
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,166
You think the job is bullshit?

118
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,869
- I think everything is bullshit.
- Maybe I'll take the job.

119
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,874
Forget about why they're offering it to me.
I can prove them wrong.

120
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,885
Why don't you just take that job,
make a good paycheck...

121
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,155
and go fucking shopping?

122
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,352
What about you?

123
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,223
What do you mean, what about me? What?

124
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,193
- What about you?
- Shoot.

125
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,298
Why would I care what you do?

126
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,802
<i>Community leaders from East Los Angeles</i>
<i>staged a protest today at City Hall...</i>

127
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,840
<i>blaming a lack of police involvement</i>
<i>and concern in the Night Stalker case.</i>

128
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,036
<i>Protestors demonstrated,</i>
<i>and argued that the LAPD...</i>

129
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,443
<i>has turned a blind eye</i>
<i>to the recent killings...</i>

130

Mommy, I've told you at least a thousand
times to keep the front door locked at night!

142
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,288
- How long have you been here?
- Five minutes.

143
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,862
I was upstairs talking with your mother.

144
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,762
How is she?

145
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,430
Father Rodriguez is here for dinner.
You want dinner?

146
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,133
- I don't think they're here.
- Where are they?

147
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,732
<i>Yo no sé.</i> But I do want dinner.

148
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,975
- You want to eat?
- That's what I came for.

149
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,548
I'm so glad you're here.

150
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,223
<i>- Estoy Ilena.</i>
- You're a good cook.

151
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,691
Yeah, right.

152
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,062
What did you want to talk to me about?

153
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,128
So, I was offered...

154
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,670
a job as a Detective, Homicide Detective...

155
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,111
in this case.

156
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,737
And it's really crazy.

157
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,785
I want to ask you some questions
to see if you have any insight.

158
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,912
- Detective.
- Yeah.

159
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,918
Can you believe that?

160
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,406
Come on, don't do this.

161
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,187
I was there.

162
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,363
What do you want me to say?

163
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,998
I don't know.

164
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,669
Can you tell me anything about him?

165
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,199
About this one.
See, look at the markings there...

166
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,142
and numbers...

167
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,978
This isn't Satan at work.

168
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,808
If you want me to say
that this is a religious thing...

169
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,247
a battle between good and evil...

170
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

171
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,717
I guess I was just hoping...

172
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,020
that such awfulness
would have an equal match.

173
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,755
- What about you?
- What about me what?

174
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,798
Maybe this is a sort of divine intervention.

175
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,494
Maybe you were always meant
to work on this case.

176
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,299
Maybe this will help you
to put to rest your father's death.

177
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,836
Or I was just...

178
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,674
I don't know.
I wanted to be like that so much that...

179
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,976
I took a job that I can't handle.

180
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,851
Then don't take it.

181
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,025
What about that job offer you had
teaching at the university?

182
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,289
I still have it.

183
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,366
And?

184
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,394
It's back East and
I can't leave Mom and the kids.

185
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,263
- Why?
- I can't do that.

186
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,034
What's gonna happen to them?

187
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,840
- What's happening to them now?
- I take care of these people.

188
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:13,043
Can you imagine Mom out there by herself,
and Gustavo and Marco... Please.

189
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,142
And who takes care of you?

190
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,585
Hello?

191
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,892
Hi, honey.

192
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,194
Yeah.

193
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,663
No, I'm sorry you have to work so late.

194
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,902
I wish I was there with you.

195
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,208
Yeah, really.

196
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,806
You know, the usual stuff.

197
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,546
Trash TV, shopping. Exciting.

198
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,411
Again?

199
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,750
Where do you think you put it?

200
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,317
Okay.

201
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,232
Honey, I...

202
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,842
You fucking bitch!

203
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,754
- Say you love Satan!
- Don't hurt me.

204
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:55,149
- Swear to Satan, you fucking bitch!
- I won't do anything.

205
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,886
- Don't fucking look at me!
- Please, God.

206
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,298
Don't look at me! Fuck.

207
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,628
Swear to fucking Satan! Fucking bitch!

208
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,203
- Swear to Satan.
- Take everything you want.

209
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,643
Don't fucking look at me!

210
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,807
Fuck you, look at me!

211
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,314
I'll do that for you.
I will fucking kill her for you.

212
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,379
I want to fucking rape her for you.
Yeah. Dead one.

213
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,956
She's got hair all over her shirt and hands.

214
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,621
I would say it's probably the victim's.

215
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,296
Satan's vengeance.

216
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,701
10-52.

217
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,566
We got to stop him.

218
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,344
Look at this.

219
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,739
The mother wiped his hands.

220
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,153
All the pictures are turned over.

221
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,082
Look.

222
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,593
The fucker doesn't want anyone to watch.

223
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,512
Look at this.

224
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,114
And?

225
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,956
And it's the same shoe print again.

226
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,459
We already know it's the same guy.

227
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,155
Yeah. And now we know
that he wears a unique type of shoe.

228
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,794
Okay, listen. Forensics have had this
for three months now.

229
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,335
They still can't tell us what brand it is.

230
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,200
Now that's something.

231
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,567
- All right?
- Right.

232
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,478
Come in.

233
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,011
So, you're taking the job?

234
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,652
I guess so.

235
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,719
I know that
you've already turned down two...

236
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,453
<i>dos...</i>

237
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,431
promotions since you've been here.

238
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,299
- Why now?
- I don't know.

239
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,240
Maybe it's because you saw
the pain this guy caused firsthand?

240
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,903
Maybe.

241
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,577
And you think you want to
do something about it?

242
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,749
I don't know. Maybe.

243
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,386
Come in. Sit down. We won't bite.

244
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,360
- Do you have her file?
- Yeah.

245
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,756
Let me see that.

246
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,106
UCLA undergrad.

247
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,405
Masters in Criminology from Berkeley.

248
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,273
Impressive.

249
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,880
That just means
I'm overqualified and under-skilled.

250
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,118
Doesn't mean that
I'm going to be a good detective.

251
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,789
Damn right.

252
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,487
But I've got a gut feeling.

253
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,095
You're making it look like
I don't have any manners.

254
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,195
Take my seat. Go ahead.

255
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,994
Sit down. Go ahead.

256
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,877
- So what do we have so far?
- Very little.

257
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,757
We know he's sick, vicious, strikes at night.

258
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,284
So far he's targeted
mostly middle-class family neighborhoods.

259
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,193
No fingerprints. His gun's unregistered.

260
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,363
No clues.

261
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,463
Other than a pair of shoe prints.

262
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,936
Basically, we don't got shit.

263
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,707
What about the FBI?

264
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,017
They've been working
for months on a profile.

265
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,685
They haven't come to any conclusions.

266
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,714
Welcome aboard.

267
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,085
My love, you have a phone call.

268
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,915
What happened, Mom?

269
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,287
You have a telephone call.

270
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,085
What time is it, Mom?

271
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,318
It's 5:00 a.m.

272
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:06,260
What are you doing up so early?

273
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,395
Jesus woke me up, he's here in the house.

274
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,202
The Devil killed someone again last night...

275
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,137
...and I knew it was going to happen.

276
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,903
Who told you that?

277
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,778
Jesus, my love.

278
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:30,049
Everybody has to die sometime
and some people go to hell.

279
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,815
It's okay, Mommy, it's okay.

280
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,289
Hand me the phone. Who's calling?

281
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,862
- Nobody.
- Nobody? You said someone called.

282
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,704
Yeah, sorry, yeah?

283
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,765
Yeah, I'll be right there.

284
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,241
Hang it up. I have to go out.

285
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,177
I have to go, Mommy,
they are calling me in to work.

286
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,515
I'm going to tell you a story...

287
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,486
No stories right now, I have to go.

288
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,854
We can play if you want to...
let's play a game!

289
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,360
Mom, when I get back I promise
I'll play any game you want.

290
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,693
Then I'll give you a bath and dress
you up and make you very pretty.

291
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,030
I already did the report.
You sure you want to see this?

292
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,406
- Yeah.
- Good.

293
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,778
Ladies first.

294
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,657
It's the third night in three weeks.

295
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,996
Our guy's getting meaner and sloppier.

296
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,863
You know, Martinez...

297
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,740
Homicide's not for everybody.

298
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,874
- Well, it's for me.
- Really?

299
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,084
Yeah, really.

300
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,814
- You notice anything unusual in there?
- Unhuman is more like it.

301
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,890
Fuck.

302
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,319
No, our guy's human.

303
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,996
He made himself dinner
while the husband bled to death.

304
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,591
He only ate a few bites,
and a glass of her blood.

305
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,191
Jesus, stop it.

306
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,836
Go home, Martinez. Get some rest.

307
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,434
You know, our guy's skinny.

308
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,945
- What?
- I bet he's skinny.

309
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,173
Why would he only take a few bites...

310
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,150
after going through the trouble
of making dinner?

311
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,114
It's drugs.

312
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,290
Maybe.

313
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,221
He's no genius serial killer either.

314
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,331
Why?

315
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:59,059
Because almost every word
scribbled on the wall was misspelled.

316
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,896
He's definitely uneducated.

317
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,274
Juvenile son of a bitch.

318
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,209
Good.

319
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,975
Makes sense.

320
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,276
Let's go back to the station.
Mayberry's waiting for us.

321
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,021
It's good.

322
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,731
<i>Anti-U.S. protests in the Middle East</i>
<i>are rising to a fevered pitch...</i>

323
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,269
<i>as the President struck a deal</i>
<i>with our Middle East Allied Front...</i>

324
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,362
<i>to provide them with chemical</i>
<i>and ballistic weapons training...</i>

325
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,101
<i>and support</i>
<i>in exchange for using military bases.</i>

326
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,111
<i>In order to combat the evil,</i>
<i>totalitarian regimes of Libya and Iran...</i>

327
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,979
<i>the people of Iraq can be</i>
<i>an invaluable friend of the United States.</i>

328
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,574
<i>According to the plan suggested...</i>

329
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,213
<i>supplying regimes in the Middle East</i>
<i>with weapons of mass destruction...</i>

330
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,914
<i>further escalates tension.</i>

331
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:58,085
<i>Citizens of East Los Angeles are protesting</i>
<i>again downtown today...</i>

332
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,154
<i>as two more victims of the Night Stalker</i>
<i>were found today, both young women.</i>

333
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:06,832
<i>In a related story, gun sales in Los Angeles</i>
<i>are at an all-time high.</i>

334
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,291
Get up!

335
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,795
Wake up! Let's go.

336
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,367
You stay.

337
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,871
Don't look at me!

338
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,370
Do you love Satan?

339
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,174
Do you love Satan? Say you love Satan!

340
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,307
- Come here.
- Wait.

341
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,520
- Take me.
- Don't look at me.

342
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,786
Do whatever you want to me,
but please leave my daughter alone.

343
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,185
Do you love Satan?

344
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,862
Yes, I love Satan. Please leave...

345
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:02,932
Mom...

346
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,800
Shut up, Tina. Go to the other room.

347
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,427
Nobody can leave! Take your clothes off.

348
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,339
Yes, I want to take my clothes off.

349
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:16,742
But my daughter cannot watch this, please.
Let us have a little privacy.

350
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,643
Go into the closet and close your eyes.

351
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,649
Can you walk?

352
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,513
Okay, then. Let's hurry.
Sneak out the back door.

353
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,330
You fucking bastard!

354
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,279
He had really dark eyes. Really dark...

355
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,416
and oval shaped.

356
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,996
He had a... long, thin face.

357
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,233
He kind of had, like,
these dark circles under his eyes.

358
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,466
He was really pale.

359
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,154
Do you have any idea
who the suspect might be?

360
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,690
He's a male, late 20s, early 30s.

361
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,892
Size nine-and-a-half shoe.

362
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:03,794
Loner, drug user.

363
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,994
Maybe had some military training.
Possibly a Vietnam veteran.

364
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:12,030
Why Vietnam?
Have the murders been particularly violent?

365
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,241
They have been, particularly.

366
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,109
Look, we're going to catch this guy,
whoever he is.

367
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,613
Thank you for your time.

368
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,514
Can't you release a sketch of the suspect?

369
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,554
How is the public
supposed to protect itself?

370
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,890
We're releasing the sketches
to members of our task force.

371
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:33,319
- We're doing our job.
- But you're not doing your job.

372
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,521
There have been 14 murders...

373
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:39,033
A vigilante scenario would not be
in the public's best interests.

374
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,069
- Why not?
- Like I said earlier...

375
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,332
we have an all-points bulletin
on the suspect...

376
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,704
while the supercomputer
searches for a match.

377
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,472
What if the supercomputer
doesn't find a match? Then what?

378
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,308
Then we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

379
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,939
You'll cross that bridge...

380
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,510
This is the first bit of information
that could save someone's life...

381
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,851
and you're not releasing it. Why is that?

382
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,424
Thank you for your time.

383
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,457
Thank you for your time.

384
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,418
Great.

385
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,392
"Why is that?" Fucking imbecile!

386
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,771
I'll tell you why is that. Fucking stupid.

387
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,212
His back, his left incisor's crooked?

388
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,949
- Look.
- Let me see.

389
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,878
Here. Here.

390
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,554
Our guy's got a smile
only his mother could love.

391
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,157
The sicko doesn't have a mother.

392
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,320
Just wanted to let you guys know
that there's still no match.

393
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:48,202
The Chief wants everybody back
out on the street, including you guys.

394
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,532
Still no match.

395
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,671
How exactly does
this supercomputer work anyway?

396
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,505
I've no fucking idea.

397
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,578
Okay. So how long we gonna wait?

398
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,347
- I don't know.
- Maybe we should've released the sketch.

399
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,421
Maybe.

400
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,523
I'll tell you one thing,
if this guy kills again...

401
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,924
we'll see a community uproar out there
like nothing we've seen.

402
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:15,293
Yeah. That Mexican community's not happy.

403
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,266
I think it's more than strange
that he's hit three times in East LA.

404
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,729
Easy access. Close to freeways.

405
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,999
Not a lot of local police presence.

406
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,805
- Yeah. Or...
- The killer is Latino.

407
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,311
- Bingo.
- Yes.

408
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:33,781
The mother and daughter never said
he had an accent.

409
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,542
Not every Hispanic person has an accent.

410
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,346
Still, why would he go after his own people?

411
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:46,593
That is the most racist thing
I've ever heard in my entire life.

412
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:47,663
What?

413
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,293
This psycho doesn't have any people.

414
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,925
You watch the way you talk to me,
young lady.

415
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:57,268
Do you hear that? "Young lady."
"His own people." Listen to yourself.

416
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,737
- You fucking mock me.
- Easy. Come on.

417
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,638
All right.
We're all after the same bad guy here.

418
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,781
Come on.

419
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,522
Great work, Martinez.

420
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,666
You're really doing a great job here.

421
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:29,736
Smart and beautiful.
Now, that's a rare combination.

422
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,120
Excuse me. What are you trying to do?

423
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,515
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

424
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,689
You don't look fine.
You look like you've been crying.

425
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:25,818
I'm fine.

426
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,155
Do you want to talk about it?

427
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,530
I said I was fine. Even if I wasn't,
I wouldn't talk about it with a stranger.

428
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,460
Come on. I know you and you know me.

429
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,767
I'm the evil reporter, right?

430
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:45,377
How would you feel
about letting me borrow that sketch...

431
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,449
for, you know, like an hour or so?

432
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,444
Really. I'm sorry.

433
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,145
No.

434
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,188
We could talk about it
over a cocktail or two.

435
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,488
- I'm buying.
- I don't drink, honey.

436
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,990
Do you eat?

437
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,798
Maybe some other time.

438
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,535
You know, if you drop the sketch again...

439
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,698
I wouldn't tell anyone.

440
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,440
You're so sure of yourself. How nice.

441
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,278
Only when I know I'm right.

442
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,680
I'm not going to risk my job for you.

443
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,647
You're not risking anything.
A reporter never burns their source.

444
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,921
I promise.

445
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,158
No one will ever know
that you gave it to me.

446
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,304
- Take a seat.
- Yes, sir.

447
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,870
Do you know why I've been here an hour
waiting for you?

448
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,784
- Did he kill again last night?
- Cut the crap.

449
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,682
Don't make yourself look like more of a fool.

450
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:11,053
I'm here because of your blatant disregard
for protocol and procedure.

451
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,930
Now, how did she get the sketch?

452
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,441
I gave it to her.

453
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:32,076
And what did you think
you would accomplish by doing that?

454
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,287
- Chief, I made a mistake and I apologize.
- Really?

455
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,314
- I can explain...
- No, you can't.

456
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:46,350
Do you know how many strings
I had to pull to get you this job?

457
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,432
Homicide is the créme de la créme of LAPD.

458
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,866
And you let some uppity reporter
get the best of you.

459
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,696
You don't deserve this.

460
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,332
It won't happen again.

461
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,741
What a headache.

462
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,645
Leave your gun and badge,
and the rest of this mess with Lt. Mayberry.

463
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:12,988
Got it?

464
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,990
- Chief, listen...
- Not now, Martinez.

465
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,257
I need a word with you.

466
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,565
I could talk to the Chief for you.

467
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,170
No, thanks.

468
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,273
A formal suspension...

469
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,647
does not look good for the career.

470
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:47,984
I could talk to the Chief for you.
Tell him to relax a bit.

471
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,789
I heard what you said, and I said no, thanks.

472
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,863
Maybe you don't understand what I mean.

473
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,170
What do you want from me?

474
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,971
What every man would want.

475
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,042
What any guy would want.

476
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,297
I know.

477
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,839
What kind of example am I setting
for the rest of the community?

478
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,403
If you don't care what other people think,
you came to the right place.

479
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,740
Have a beer.

480
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,546
<i>Gracias.</i>

481
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,786
You obviously heard what happened, right?

482
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,023
What? Getting suspended?

483
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,195
Every good cop gets suspended
at least once.

484
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:03,959
And besides...

485
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,860
because I found your suspect...

486
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,735
and told the Chief that it was your lead...

487
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:19,106
- you'll be back to work tomorrow.
- You found something?

488
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,943
Not something, someone.

489
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,341
No shit.

490
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,782
How did you find this out?

491
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,183
Some down and dirty police work.

492
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,590
- It wasn't that hard.
- Where is he?

493
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,726
Downtown hotel.

494
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,961
Real crack-land shithole.

495
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:40,463
SWAT should be raiding it
right now as we speak.

496
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,337
- Drink your beer.
- You know what?

497
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,744
After we go downtown. Come on.

498
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,442
And since when have you cared?

499
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,410
I just do.

500
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,195
All right.

501
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,405
Shit. I don't have my fucking badge.

502
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,601
- What am I...
- Here, take this.

503
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,557
- Is Mayberry here?
- Just left about 15 minutes ago.

504
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,557
Did they catch the suspect?

505
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,576
I know I'm on fucking suspension.

506
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,480
Send someone to my house right now.
My family is in danger.

507
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,279
<i>We're not allowed to speak with you.</i>

508
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:14,685
Stop this bullshit,
and get some fucking balls.

509
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,326
<i>- I don't have time for this.</i>
- Give me the mic.

510
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:20,486
This is Officer Luis.

511
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:24,362
Officer Martinez has me held hostage
at gunpoint at her house.

512
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:27,459
Send backup immediately.
The situation is critical.

513
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,835
<i>- Is this some kind of a joke?</i>
- Does this sound like a joke?

514
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,647
Here, take my piece.

515
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,272
Mommy?

516
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,320
Shit!

517
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,264
Mommy.

518
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:15,376
The Devil.
The Devil was here.

519
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,902
He's looking for you...

520
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,313
Is he gone?

521
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,181
Where are Marco and Gustavo?

522
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,526
Marco and Gustavo, your sons,
where are they?

523
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:37,565
I don't have any sons
and it's you he's looking for.

524
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,036
Where did he go? Over there?

525
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,219
When did he leave?

526
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:09,628
I don't remember.
Why are you looking for him?

527
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,332
He can't do anything good for you.

528
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,735
You're okay, right? Did he hurt you?
Did he touch you?

529
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,275
It's you that he wants to hurt.

530
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,104
He's going to teach you a lesson...

531
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,774
...and some reporter as well.

532
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:30,852
The reporter.

533
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:35,747
- What?
- The reporter, the girl.

534
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,617
Let's go.

535
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,659
Mom, the police are on the way and
they're going to take care of you.

536
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,599
Just stay here and calm down.

537
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:51,935
If something happens to you, it's
because Jesus wants it to happen.

538
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,602
It's okay, Mom. Promise me that
you're going to calm down.

539
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,903
Let's go!

540
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,378
I told the Devil everything
about your Father,

541
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:03,315
everything about your Father, my little girl.

542
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:43,219
<i>... and has so far killed hundreds</i>
<i>and injured thousands of local villagers...</i>

543
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:46,692
<i>surrounding the plant in question.</i>
<i>The plant manager...</i>

544
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,035
<i>Hundreds of women and children are dead...</i>

545
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,837

<i>in this small city in India.</i>

548

<i>The Red Cross expects the death toll</i>
<i>to rise to the thousands...</i>

549
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,018

550
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,654

552
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,194
<i>A surprising turn of events...</i>

553
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:30,996
<i>... as Los Angeles police officers</i>
<i>Frank Luis and Gabriella Martinez...</i>

554
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,232
<i>just might have cracked</i>
<i>the Night Stalker case...</i>

555
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,607
<i>Ironically, both officers are on suspension...</i>

556
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:44,550
<i>and were unavailable for comment,</i>
<i>pending investigations by Internal Affairs.</i>

557
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,549
<i>Do you know what kind of shit you're in?</i>

558
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,820
Why didn't you tell me
about the hotel room?

559
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,089
You put me and my family in danger.

560
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,597
<i>You are on suspension, that's why.</i>

561
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,568
You sacrifice me and my family
because I'm on suspension? Fine.

562
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:06,232
But what about the reporter?
What did she do? What didn't she do?

563
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,503
<i>We have her house and your house</i>
<i>under surveillance.</i>

564
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,770
That's bullshit
'cause I was just at my house.

565
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,577
<i>I know. My guys saw you and Luis</i>
<i>break into your own house.</i>

566
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,849
Did they tell you the Night Stalker
went into my mother's bedroom?

567
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,383
<i>Nobody has entered the house.</i>

568
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,628
Send somebody there right now.
And go check it. Please.

569
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,203
<i>Martinez, you there?</i>

570
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:45,740
Yes, sir.

571
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:50,839
<i>How close are you guys to Malibu?</i>
<i>My surveillance team isn't responding.</i>

572
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,022
Freeze, fuckhead!

573
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:20,961
He went out the front door.

574
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,469
Hang in there, come on, partner.

575
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,169
That fucking bum got me.

576
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:40,344
Just breathe, come on. It's okay.

577
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,473
But he ain't got much. I...

578
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,167
Dear God.

579
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,735
I did it for you.

580
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,176
I killed them for you!

581
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,793
I'll kill her.

582
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:17,436
Okay, sir.

583
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,441
You okay?

584
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,239
I'm all right.

585
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,247
I'm sorry, Martinez. He was a good cop.

586
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,693
You didn't even know him.

587
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,161
No, I didn't.

588
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,096
You want a ride home?

589
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,599
<i>10-34 to Alpha 72.</i>

590
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,368
<i>Respond to a 2-13, downtown,</i>
<i>Alameda and Seventh.</i>

591
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:24,044
You want another shot at the title?

592
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:16,464
Well, if it isn't the creepy foot freak.

593
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,769
What will it be tonight?

594
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:26,272
And remember, don't touch me
unless you've got $60.

595
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,647
There you go.

596
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,146
Come on.

597
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,214
Here they are.

598
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,349
Hello?

599
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,393
We're going to do this, or what?

600
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,499
Come on. Fucking faggot.

601
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,437
Whip it out
or I'm getting out of this shitmobile.

602
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:05,076
These freaks. All over the fucking place.

603
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,223
How come this guy keeps disappearing?

604
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,666
We just gotta keep looking.

605
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,498
We've been here six hours.

606
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:43,377
Your partner just died in your arms.
You wanna give up and go home?

607
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,113
Don't even go there, all right?

608
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:49,523
Don't talk about Luis.

609
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,859
All right. As soon as we stabilize her.

610
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,922
What did he look like?

611
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,034
Not now, Elliot, please.

612
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,828
- Excuse me.
- Not now!

613
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:05,235
- At least wait till she gets to the hospital.
- What did he look like?

614
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,905
Real good-looking.

615
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,166
Very thin.

616
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,246
His eyes looked black or something.

617
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:18,647
Have you been watching TV?
Have you seen the police composite?

618
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:21,815
I don't even have a toothbrush.

619
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,491
- Where's the sketch?
- It's in the car.

620
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,893
I apologize for his behavior.

621
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,661
We're just a little out of it with this one.

622
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,464
- Is this him?
- Yeah, that's him.

623
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,938
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

624
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,566
- Where did you see him last?
- Leave her alone.

625
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,372
- Yeah. That's it!
- Shut up!

626
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:48,575
- Where did you see him last?
- Under the Sixth Street bridge.

627
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:59,123
- I'm calling for backup.
- I'm not leaving this now. Wait here.

628
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,917
I can handle it.

629
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:04,021
- Like you handled the hooker?
- The woman back there.

630
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:07,568
I was trying to be compassionate.
That's part of being a good detective.

631
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:10,035
That's also why I was hired
for this case. Clear?

632
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:15,007
You were hired to be part of this case
as a public service announcement.

633
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,673
That's all.

634
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:18,345
Fuck you.

635
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:31,486
Okay, you wait here, okay?
You watch my back.

636
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:43,086
Elliot, look! No, behind you!

637
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,599
Go call for backup.

638
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,966
- I'm going in with you.
- No, go call for backup.

639
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,168
Don't go near him, Elliot.

640
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,422
It's not him.

641
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,119
Fuck! Martinez!

642
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,130
Do you love Satan?

643
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:30,440
Say you love Satan, you bitch!

644
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,048
I can see you're a fucking slut. Yeah.

645
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,490
Don't touch me.

646
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:48,596
I can smell you.

647
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:54,465
- I'm not afraid of you, motherfucker.
- Yes, you are!

648
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:55,803
You are.

649
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:59,802
You know it. Daddy's girl can't hide.

650
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,046
I'm not afraid of you.

651
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:10,015
I can see. I can see Satan's
been with you a very long time.

652
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:16,249
I'm gonna be glad
when you're gone, motherfucker.

653
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:19,922
But I'm not gonna be gone ever!

654
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,670
Is he dead?

655
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,640
He's not moving. Come on, let's see.

656
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:39,008
You make sure he's dead.
Check up, all right?

657
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:42,178
I'm gonna go get an ambulance.
I'm gonna go see if...

658
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:44,808
Fuck me! You fucking kill him.

659
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:46,610
You fucking kill him.

660
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:34,360
This is Detective Martinez. I have an officer
down on Sixth Street and Santa Fe...

661
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:37,666
underneath the bridge.
I need backup and paramedics, please.

662
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,605
<i>10-34 responding.</i>
<i>We have a unit in that area.</i>

667
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:46,731

Come on.

669
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,115
Shoot me.

670
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:03,255
Put the gun in my mouth
and pull the trigger. Come on, fucking bitch.

671
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:05,450
Shut the fuck up and don't move!

672
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:07,822
Come on, you fucker.

673
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,423
Come on, you little fucking bitch!

674
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:17,599
Fucking kill me, come on.

675
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:22,235
You come here to kill me.
Fucking kill me, bitch.

676
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,270
Come on, fucking bitch, shoot me!

677
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,515
