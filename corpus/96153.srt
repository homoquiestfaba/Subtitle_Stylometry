1
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,342
We climbed 'cause it's fun.

2
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:47,265
And mainly it was fun.

3
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,479
That's all we ever did.

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,200
And we were fairly anarchic
and fairly irresponsible,

5
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,201
and we didn't give a damn about
anyone else or anything else,

6
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:56,828
and we just wanted to climb
the world. And it was fun.

7
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,811
It was just brilliant fun.

8
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:02,812
And every now and then it went
wildly wrong. And then it wasn't.

9
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,459
Got into Peru when I was 25, Simon 21.

10
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:44,216
But we had done a lot
of climbing in the Alps.

11
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:57,743
To climb mountains that have not been
climbed before, or a new route at a mountain

12
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,829
is what my climbing life
had been moving towards.

13
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:15,081
A friend of us, who'd done an amazing
amount of climbing in South-America

14
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:19,082
had seen this face in the mid-70's.

15
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:23,854
I think he said it would
be a challenging day out.

16
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,125
It was the last big mountain
face in this range of mountains,

17
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:38,126
that hadn't been climbed.

18
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,375
There's a great unknown there.

19
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:45,376
What's so compelling is
stepping into that unknown.

20
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:22,586
It was an isolated spot, a 2
- days walk from a road.

21
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,701
The mountains all around seemed very big,

22
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:28,702
compared to the mountains
I'd seen in the Alps.

23
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,576
We eventually reached a spot,
on the approach to Siula Grande.

24
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:43,577
You couldn't really take the
donkeys any further than this point.

25
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:48,913
I guess it would be 7-8 km from
the bottom of the mountains.

26
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:59,422
We knew Siula Grande was at
the back, but we didn't see it.

27
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,611
We'd met this lad called Richard Hawking
in Lima. He'd been travelling on his own.

28
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,677
And I think we said, "Why don't
you just join us on our trip?"

29
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:16,613
I think he said that he didn't
know anything about mountaineering.

30
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:19,307
I didn't really know
what pot of brew I was in.

31
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:22,963
or quite, what I was
letting myself in for.

32
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,745
We wanted Richard because
when we were on the mountain,

33
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,527
if he were at base camp he
could look after our kit.

34
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:31,042
I got to know Simon quite well.

35
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:34,723
I don't know whether it was
because of his personality,

36
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:38,156
or whether it was because he
was more forgiving towards me,

37
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:41,775
being a non-climber
in that environment.

38
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:45,776
But I found it very
hard to get to know Joe.

39
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:51,273
I was much more ambitious
about doing it than Simon was.

40
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:57,119
Siula Grande meant a lot.

41
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
We knew, a number of
expeditions had failed on it.

42
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,330
If no one had tried, it
wouldn't be quite the same.

43
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,331
It was the the fact that people had
tried and failed, so we knew it was hard.

44
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:13,657
And my feeling was, "Well, we'll
just do it. We're better than them."

45
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,887
Since the 1970s people
have been trying to climb

46
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:29,888
mountains in the great ranges
in what's called "Alpine style".

47
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:34,844
And essentially, Alpine style
means you pack a rucksack

48
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:38,000
full of all your clothing, your
food and your climbing equipment,

49
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,001
and you start off from a base camp
and you try and climb the mountain

50
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:43,463
you're gonna climb in a single push.

51
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:46,279
You don't fix the line of
ropes uphill beforehand,

52
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,280
you don't have a set of camps
that you stock and come down from.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's the purest style and that's the style
that Joe and I had climbed Siula Grande.

54
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:03,295
It's a very committing way of climbing,
because you have no line of retreat.

55
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,350
If something goes wrong,
it can be very very serious.

56
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,536
There's no rescue, there's no helicopter
rescue and there's no other people.

57
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,495
There's no margin for error.

58
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:21,496
If you get badly hurt,
you'I probably die.

59
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:32,179
I hadn't seen it from this
angle, and it looked steep.

60
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,180
I sort of thought, you
know, "Christ, that's big".

61
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:43,181
Looks harder than I
thought and than I expected.

62
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:47,182
But I was excited.

63
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,999
Starting doing it was brilliant.

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is what we live for.

65
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,846
I love the actual movement of climbing.

66
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,500
When you're climbing well
it just feels brilliant.

67
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:42,122
It's like a combination
between ballet and gymnastics.

68
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:46,123
It's that mixture of power and grace.

69
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,728
For me, mountains are the most
beautiful places in the world.

70
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,886
When I go into these places I
feel an amazing sense of space,

71
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:02,378
an amazing sense of
freedom, when I get away

72
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,379
from all of the clutter
that we have in the world.

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think we surprised ourselves as
we got up the icefield about 300m,

74
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,920
and got up to a point where the
ice is running through rock bands,

75
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:48,921
and you've got vertical cascades.

76
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,672
We started intricately
climbing through these.

77
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,661
The fact, that you are
tied to your partner,

78
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:13,662
means that you put an immense amount of
trust in someone else's skill and ability.

79
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:18,600
But at some point, you may be thinking,

80
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,601
"For god's sake, Simon, don't fall
here, for god's sake, don't fall here"

81
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:31,861
The rope can be something that rather
than save your life, could kill you.

82
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,862
If your mate falls off then all
this gear rips out, you're dead,

83
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:38,591
you're gonna go with him.

84
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:42,592
If you're gonna do that sort of climbing
at some point you're gonna have to rely

85
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:46,966
wholly on your partner.

86
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:57,082
I think we were very pleased
at the end of that first day.

87
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,086
We had done a lot of
climbing, good climbing.

88
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:03,087
And we were very confident at
that point that we should make it.

89
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:11,492
That altitude, you dehydrate enormously.

90
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,424
You have to drink a lot
of fluid, 4-5 liters a day.

91
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,425
And the only way you can
get it, is by melting snow.

92
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,771
Everything is so time-consuming.

93
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:25,367
To make a single brew at that
altitude takes a very long time,

94
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:29,368
You're perhaps looking at an hour
just to make a couple of cups.

95
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,939
For that reason, we perhaps didn't
brew up as much as we should have done

96
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,940
but we didn't have an awful lot
of spare gas with us, either.

97
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:51,212
There's not a lot of risk
in our lives normally now.

98
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,669
And to put an element of risk back
into it takes us out of the humdrum.

99
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,166
In that sense, it makes
you feel more alive.

100
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,870
I've never been that
high before, and it's

101
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:17,871
very very strenuous
to climb ice like that.

102
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:23,802
Not only is it technically difficult
and unstable and frightening,

103
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:27,803
but your heart is going like
crazy because of the altitude.

104
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:20,161
It would now go very cold indeed.

105
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,400
And we were up
5800-6000m, it was windy.

106
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,063
Then it started snowing, and it meant

107
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:30,064
that the whole face was pooring
with powdersnow avalanches.

108
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:46,508
The snow would actually stick
on the outside of your clothing.

109
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,509
It would then freeze on top of you,
like you're wearing a suit of armor.

110
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,747
The last section on the face

111
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:05,748
was about 100m of the
most nightmarish climbing.

112
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,032
Completely unstable powder snow.

113
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:13,268
No anchors at any point.

114
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,269
It was physically very, very
tiring, full-body climbing really.

115
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,963
It took us the best part of 5 or
6 hours to climb about 65 meters.

116
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:43,042
Carried on way after it got dark.

117
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:46,154
I was getting extremely cold,
'cause I was sitting still

118
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,921
while Simon was trying to climb.

119
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:51,683
I was getting near hypothermic.

120
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,291
You just knew that if you'd
just carried on, regardless,

121
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,000
it was gonna go tits up.

122
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:01,001
So we dug a snow cave.

123
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,406
In the morning, in good weather,

124
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:22,407
we actually saw what
we'd been trying to climb.

125
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:32,194
It was this undeering nightmare of

126
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:36,195
flutings of the finest powder
gouged out by snow falling down

127
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:41,612
meringues, and mushrooms, and
cornices all over the place.

128
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,853
We'd heard about these strange powder
snow conditions you get in the Andes,

129
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,655
and we've never seen it before.

130
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,656
I don't know the physics that explains why
powder snow can stay on such steep slopes.

131
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:59,552
In the Alps it would just slide off
if the slope was about 40 degrees.

132
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:08,552
It is some of the most precarious, unnerving
and dangerous climbing I've ever done.

133
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,168
We were actually scared, that
we would get to an impass,

134
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,622
where we couldn't climb any further up.

135
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,623
Because we knew we wouldn't
be able to get back down,

136
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:27,000
not what we've already climbed.

137
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:31,001
We were climbing ourselves into a trap.

138
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:36,072
And not only that, we could see this
150 meter drop that was waiting for us.

139
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:49,282
And so it was with great
relief that by 14:00,

140
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,781
we got onto the north
ridge and on the west face.

141
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:56,782
And we vowed that we didn't want to
go near any of the flutings again.

142
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:09,434
We were pretty tired, by the
time we got onto the ridge,

143
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:13,899
I was knackered. And
I remember thinking,

144
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,629
"Oh sod it, we've done the face,"

145
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,540
"now I can't really be bothered
to go all the way up there"

146
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,541
And then we thought, "Hang
on, we've come all this way,"

147
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,400
"we might as well stand on the top"

148
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:44,662
I don't particularly like summits,
because 80% of accidents happen on descent.

149
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,717
We decided before we even climbed the
face that we were going to come down

150
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:56,931
the north ridge of the
mountain, down to a cul

151
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:00,698
between the mountain Siula Grande
and another mountain called Yerupaja.

152
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:04,699
and then we'd be able to abseil
down the smaller section of the face.

153
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:14,874
Already the clouds were coming
in from the east. Big clouds.

154
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,976
We expected this ridge to
be quite straightforward,

155
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:27,232
quite an easy way to descend.

156
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,899
We were hoping, we would
be able to sort of walk.

157
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,620
And it turned out to be very difficult.

158
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:35,724
It was horrendous.

159
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:39,000
Vertical on the west side, with the
cornices overhanging the west side,

160
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:43,001
and on the east side steep
fleetings running down 100m below us.

161
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,887
It was a shock. And
it was quite dangerous.

162
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:53,888
It all got a bit out of
control. That stage of things.

163
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:08,960
Half an hour to an hour after
leaving the summit, we were lost.

164
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:12,961
We were in the wild now,
we couldn't see anything.

165
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,674
Then we got like a little break
in the clouds and I saw the ridge,

166
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:28,675
so I started climbing back up to it.

167
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,876
I didn't know it was the side
of the ridge I was on, but

168
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:43,877
it was actually an enormous
cornice, an overhang of snow and ice,

169
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,527
and I was walking up over the top of it.

170
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:11,883
I was left hanging, looking
down, as all this snow and ice

171
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,160
then fell away from me, down the
west side of the Siula Grande.

172
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:22,325
I got back up on the ridge
and shouted then to Joe

173
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,207
that I'd found the
ridge, like that, I said,

174
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,208
"I found the ridge, Joe!"

175
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:31,510
We'd hoped to go down that day,

176
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:34,822
but by the time it got dark,
we were still very high.

177
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:37,637
Still at 6000m.

178
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,638
And that night, as we made
a brew, the gas ran out.

179
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,393
It was pretty obvious
the following morning

180
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,292
that we descended the
worst part of the ridge.

181
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:09,293
And I was pretty confident that we'd
get back down to the base camp that day.

182
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,502
I thought at that stage it was pretty
much in the bag I suppose, the whole climb.

183
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,135
I was ahead of Simon,

184
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:24,136
and suddenly there was this
vertical wall, bisecting the ridge.

185
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:29,486
I then get on my hands and knees, and
hammer both my axes into the ice at the top

186
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:33,693
and then lower myself off the ice cliff.

187
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,900
When you hammer the axe in, you listen
to the sound it makes. And you look at it.

188
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,559
Now I was hanging with both axes,
right. I took the hammer out, and

189
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,749
what I wanted to do is now
place it in the vertical wall.

190
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,750
And I swung, and the pick
went in, and it just made a...

191
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:57,525
just a strange sound.

192
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,275
And I thought, "Well, I'll take
it out, make a good placement."

193
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:04,276
So I just wanted to put bona... dead
solid axe placements in. All the way down.

194
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:10,579
And I was about to
swing at the ice again

195
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:30,053
The pain is... came
flooding down my thigh

196
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:34,054
and my knee was very, very very painful

197
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:42,253
The impact drove my lower leg
straight through my knee joint.

198
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:49,954
As the bone went into my tibia it
split the tibial plateau straight off

199
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:56,927
and carried on up.

200
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,333
Quite wild, the pain now. I
couldn't cope with it at first.

201
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,958
I just breathed on and it started to
go and I can remember looking across

202
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,989
to the west and seeing that we
were level with the summit of Rasac,

203
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,062
so I had a height gauge, where we were.

204
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:23,451
and I just thought, "fuck,
I can't have broken my leg",

205
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:27,452
"If I have broken my leg I'm dead."

206
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,988
And then the rope went slack.

207
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:51,989
I knew that meant that
Simon was coming towards me.

208
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:07,894
I couldn't feel any bone under anything.

209
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:10,708
I brought my hand down,
there's no blood on it,

210
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,079
and the pain had gone down a little bit.

211
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,000
And I thought, maybe I
was being a bit whacked,

212
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:19,001
I'd just torn a ligament or something.

213
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:26,551
I tried to stand on it

214
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,190
I felt all the bone go, all grating and
everything and I knew it was broken then.

215
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,845
The look that he gave
to me sticks in my mind

216
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:48,709
A look of shock and desperation
and a sort of terror.

217
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,710
Lots of things in a single look.

218
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,626
And he said, "Are you ok?"

219
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,627
I think it did occur to me to say,
"Yeah, I'm fine". That was stupid.

220
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:04,482
I think I said, "No,
I've broken my leg".

221
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Immediately, just doom. I
thought "god, we're stuffed".

222
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:16,455
We're gonna be doing well if
either of us gets out of this now.

223
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:21,167
It did come into my mind, just thinking,

224
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:25,168
"If he slips off the side of the
mountain now, then I can just clear off,"

225
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:29,545
"and leave him and get myself down and
I don't have to have all the hassle,"

226
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,501
"of trying to deal with him and
with the situation we're in".

227
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:41,428
He gave me these painkillers which
were effectively headache tablets.

228
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,429
And he didn't really
talk about anything.

229
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:50,384
It was almost as if he...
He knew, what this meant.

230
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:54,385
He knew, and I knew, that he
was going to have to leave me.

231
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,501
He could have said something like
"I'm just going to get some help"

232
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:03,350
and I'd gone "right, yeah"

233
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,476
'Cause I knew there wasn't any help.

234
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:08,999
That'd been an easy
way for him to say it.

235
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I didn't think we really seriously
thought that there was any choice

236
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:26,214
I couldn't put my finger on it, why
I thought something had happened.

237
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:31,805
And I started to think "Is one of
them dead, or are both of them dead?"

238
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,752
Even "If one of them is dead", not
"which one do I want to be dead", but

239
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:40,753
"if one comes back,
who do I want it to be?"

240
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,839
It's kind of, quite cold
to say it, but I guess

241
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I would rather have it
would have been Simon.

242
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,776
I thought, "oh, he's not leaving"

243
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:02,516
I calmed down a bit and
managed to focus myself again

244
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,700
to think how I was going to
get him down the mountain.

245
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:13,743
We discussed, between us, what
we were going to have to do.

246
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:16,597
We thought, well, we got
2 ropes that are 50m long.

247
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:20,598
And if we tie them together we have a
100m rope with a knot in the middle of it.

248
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,058
So I tied to one end and
Simon tied to the other,

249
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,059
in theory he could lower me down 100m.

250
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:33,742
To really get anchors to
lower him from that do matter,

251
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:37,743
what I did was cut a bucket in the
snow, sit in there and brace myself.

252
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,091
And I sort of lay down between his legs.

253
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,378
And Simon started lowering then.

254
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,793
I'd lower him one rope length, 50m,

255
00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:57,449
and then the knot would come
up between the two ropes.

256
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,526
Now the knot would not go
through the belay plates.

257
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:02,314
So he would stop me.

258
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,145
I would stand on my
left leg, my good leg,

259
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:07,088
so that I could get
the weight off the rope.

260
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,022
I gave him enough slack to
be able to unclip the rope

261
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:14,023
thread the rope back through the lowering
device, with the knot on the other side

262
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:18,603
clip it back to himself and
lower me the remaining 50m.

263
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:29,819
He'd make himself reasonably secure,
and I down climbed to join him.

264
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,309
And we'd repeat the process again.

265
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,459
Simon was trying to lower me fast,

266
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,460
and it meant that my foot kept jabbing
in and jabbing in and bending the knee.

267
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,457
Excruciatingly painful.

268
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,913
I can remember feeling angry with
him because he was hurting me,

269
00:28:49,914 --> 00:28:51,277
and I was thinking "do it slow",

270
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,278
and I also knew that he had to do
it this fast. He hadn't got a choice.

271
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:00,877
And he was very grim faced,
I remember looking at him,

272
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:06,353
wondering if he was pissed
off with the whole thing.

273
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:11,001
I couldn't take too much notice
unfortunately of these cries of pain,

274
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,580
because we got to go down.

275
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:23,580
We would dig these holes from
the sitting in the powder snow,

276
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:27,543
and they would last about the length
of the time it took to lower me.

277
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:30,091
And in fact they were
crumbling around him.

278
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:33,954
And he was lowering me on a 9mm,
well 8.8mm rope. That's that thick.

279
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,889
But hands sort of frozen.

280
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,430
What he did was quite extraordinary,

281
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:42,431
and I've never heard of any single
handed mountain rescue like that.

282
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:59,979
We were now lowering in a full storm. I
don't know what the wind chill factor was,

283
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,051
but it would be like -80
or something like that.

284
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:07,052
I lost a liter of blood in my leg,
I was in shock and severly dehydrated

285
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:13,023
It was a point where we should have
dug a snow cave and taken shelter,

286
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:17,024
got in our sleeping bags and
made a hot brew, and rehydrate.

287
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,452
We couldn't, 'cause we'd run out of gas.

288
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:24,206
And we just lost control at this point
because we couldn't dig a snow cave,

289
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:28,207
and risk getting trapped by
a storm that didn't break.

290
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:26,373
It was all starting to look up in many ways
at that point, as we were virtually down.

291
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,331
And I started to slowly think,

292
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:38,332
"maybe after this one we will have
one more, and we'll be on the glacier".

293
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:43,282
And suddenly all got hard
on my elbows, and icy,

294
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:47,001
and it got steeper, going down a
slope and suddenly it's steeper,

295
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:51,002
and I just was full of alarm.

296
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,662
I was screaming at Simon to stop as loud
as I could, and he just couldn't hear me.

297
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:14,398
I did notice that more
weight came onto the rope,

298
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,399
but didn't really think a lot
about this. And I just thought,

299
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,800
"Well, he's going over
some steeper ground"

300
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:24,801
When I looked down, and I glimpsed
'cause there was a big drop underneath me,

301
00:32:26,732 --> 00:32:30,732
I was horrified to
discover what I'd gone over.

302
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:35,023
And I could clearly see that there was
a large crevice directly under the cliff,

303
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,130
about 25m below me.

304
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:44,116
I was trying to get my axes to see if I
could reach this wall that was out there,

305
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:48,197
I think, almost as I start and try to
do that, I started being lowered again.

306
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:51,695
And I was thinking, "Christ,
don't do it, don't do it",

307
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:55,696
'cause I knew, that there wasn't
enough rope to get me to the bottom.

308
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:57,931
And if I couldn't get
my weight off the rope,

309
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,936
he couldn't disconnect the
rope, to get on the other side.

310
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,239
And I knew all this, and I was
screaming again, not to lower me.

311
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,240
I carried on lowering him, until I
reached the knot, then shook the rope.

312
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:12,238
My signal to him, to take
the weight off the rope.

313
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,009
And nothing happened.

314
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,010
And nothing continued to happen.

315
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:50,325
I knew, that the only way out of
this is if I could climb up the rope.

316
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:08,835
I had two prusik loops. Prusik
loops are thin cords of rope.

317
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:14,666
And if you use a special twisting knot
on the rope, you can slide it up the rope,

318
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:17,550
and pull on it, and
the knot grips the rope.

319
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:20,682
Clip a snapping to it and then a
sling to it, and you can stand up.

320
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,418
And if you got another one, tied
above it, you slide that one up,

321
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,419
Standing this loop is now higher.

322
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,865
I was trying to hold myself
upright, to keep the rope in place.

323
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:43,684
And then trying to put this knot
through itself, and through itself,

324
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:47,685
and this fiddly bloody rope... it is just
hard to describe how I couldn't do it.

325
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,314
Because my fingers, I just
couldn't feel the fingers at all.

326
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:53,922
And I'd be looking and trying to
push the thing in, and using my teeth,

327
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:57,923
and getting it round,
and getting it round.

328
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:05,739
My hands were cold, my feet
were... I was very very cold.

329
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:13,140
It was a desperate position, made worse
by the fact that that I had no idea

330
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,141
what Joe was doing, or
what position he was in.

331
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:21,453
I just couldn't figure out why it was taking
him so long to get his weight off the rope,

332
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:27,516
there was no sensible
explanation for it.

333
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:35,967
I got one on, and I clipped it to my
chest, because that would keep me upright.

334
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:41,024
And I tried to put the other one on,
and I had real trouble with my hands.

335
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:53,209
And I dropped the bloody
thing, and I watched it fall.

336
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:58,204
And I knew that I was stuffed then.

337
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,832
I just thought, "Well,
I can't climb the rope",

338
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,465
this idea that you can climb a
rope hand over hand, you can't,

339
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:07,466
especially when your hands are
frozen. You just can't do it.

340
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:20,489
Nothing I can do, and I
felt completely helpless.

341
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:24,843
And really angry.

342
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:37,509
There was nothing I could do. I
couldn't get the weight off the rope,

343
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,510
I was just there, and this went
on for maybe an hour and a half,

344
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:45,448
during which time my position
became more and more desperate.

345
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:49,449
I was struggling to maintain the,
sort of shivery seat that I sat in,

346
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:55,466
and the snow was gradually
sliding away from under me.

347
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:01,933
So my position was getting desperate.

348
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:13,316
I think psychologically I was beaten.

349
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,414
'Cause there was nothing I could do,

350
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:19,415
so I just hung on the
rope and waited to die.

351
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:24,617
And I think I would have died pretty soon,
actually. The wind chill was very low.

352
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,030
I was literally going down the
mountain in little, jerky stages.

353
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:46,779
'Cause this soft, sugary snow
collapsed away underneath me.

354
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:52,652
I was expecting him to come off,
and couldn't do anything about it.

355
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:56,550
He was gonna fall about 100m.

356
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:00,551
50m away from me, he was gonna
fall double that, he was gonna die.

357
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:06,427
And he really didn't know, whether I was
meters off the ground, or centimeters,

358
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:10,428
he just didn't know. But he knew, I
think, pretty sadly, that he was gonna die.

359
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:19,684
Then I remembered that I've got a
pen knife in the top of my rucksack.

360
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:26,454
I took the decision pretty quickly.

361
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:30,655
To me, it just seemed like the right
thing to do under the circumstances.

362
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:39,183
Because there was no way that
I could maintain where I was,

363
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,283
sooner or later, I was going
to be pulled from the mountain.

364
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,522
I took the rucksack off, and then
unzipped the top pocket with one hand,

365
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:53,523
and got the pen knife out.

366
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:12,774
Boof!

367
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,161
It was an awful night.

368
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:51,052
My mind was plagued with the
thoughts of what had happened to Joe.

369
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:55,053
It took a long time to warm myself
up. And I didn't properly, I guess.

370
00:39:56,267 --> 00:40:00,267
Had a very, very cold night.

371
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:07,175
The overriding memory is just feeling
desperately, desperately thirsty.

372
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:11,176
To the point where I felt I could
smell the water in the snow around me.

373
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:15,162
I felt that very strongly.

374
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,163
It was quite a strange thing.

375
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,865
I didn't know what had happened.

376
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,867
What I landed on wasn't flat,
it was sloped on each side.

377
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:17,868
And I was sliding, in the dark.

378
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:25,906
I think I must have
fallen about 50m in total.

379
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:29,907
I was pretty surprised to be alive.

380
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:46,246
The head torch beam just
went down, and down, and down,

381
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:50,247
and the darkness just ate it, just gone.

382
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,036
I felt very unnerved,
very very vulnerable.

383
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:58,037
If I had landed less than
1m further to the right,

384
00:41:58,538 --> 00:42:02,538
I would have just gone
down this huge hole.

385
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:08,016
I got this ice screw in, pretty quickly.

386
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,722
And then looked around, and thinking,

387
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:22,723
"Jezus, it's gonna be nearly
impossible to get out of"

388
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,119
My rope was going all the way up,
25m, up to this small entry hall.

389
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:39,296
And I thought, Simon
is on the end of that.

390
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:45,254
But I felt sure he was dead.
And it didn't mean anything.

391
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:48,839
I just thought, "If I pull on this
rope, it will come tight on his body".

392
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Because he would have flown off the
cliff, on to the downside of the crevice,

393
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,946
and then, Iying dead
there, like a counterweight,

394
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:59,819
the rope would have come back up
and then dropped into the crevice.

395
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,820
So I thought, if I pull on this
rope it will come tight on his body".

396
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:22,309
And it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming,

397
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,360
As soon as I saw it,
I knew it had been cut.

398
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:52,141
I thought, "you're gonna die in here".

399
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:57,535
I had a pleased feeling, that
it meant that Simon was alive.

400
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:05,001
Simon!

401
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:18,706
Looking where I was
was an awful prospect.

402
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:22,845
You don't die of a broken leg.

403
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:36,379
I think I did turn my head
torch off to save the batteries.

404
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:54,056
It was dark, and it began to get to me.

405
00:45:02,662 --> 00:45:05,716
There is something about crevices,

406
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:09,717
they have a dread feel, not
the place for the living.

407
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:21,492
I could hear the ice cracking,
and wind noises in the ice.

408
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:29,922
I turned the light on again,
'cause I didn't like it in the dark.

409
00:45:42,588 --> 00:45:46,588
I felt very, very alone.

410
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:51,933
And I was very scared.

411
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,280
I was 25, I was fit,
I was super ambitious.

412
00:45:59,616 --> 00:46:03,616
And this was the first trip I've
been on. I wanted to climb the world,

413
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:08,292
and it just didn't seem... this
hadn't been part of our game plan.

414
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:16,959
It must have been quite late.

415
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I think that I pretty much was
thinking that I wasn't gonna get out.

416
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:28,638
Fuck. Stupid, stupid...

417
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:08,558
As a climber you should always be in
control, you have to be in control.

418
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:12,969
So doing that, you could be seen
as half a failure. You lost it.

419
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:38,656
This is childish. I
just cried and cried.

420
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:42,657
I thought,

421
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:47,909
I'd be tougher than that.

422
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:19,727
It was getting light, as it was 5 or 6.

423
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:24,633
And I started screaming
Simon's name again.

424
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:33,443
I got myself up, got dressed inside the
snow home and packed everything away,

425
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:41,335
Just a horrible feeling of dread.

426
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:45,336
By this stage, I strongly felt that
Joe had been killed the previous day.

427
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:49,981
And that now I was going to
die, as some form of retribution.

428
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:57,935
But rather than just sit here,
feeling sorry for myself or whatever,

429
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:02,761
"I'll get on with it and
I'll die on the way down".

430
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:08,871
Very quickly, the ground
dropped away steeply.

431
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:12,872
So I skirted around this
area of steeper ground.

432
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:22,827
As I abseiled down, I could
see this overhanging ice cliff,

433
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:25,038
which was what I had lowered him over,

434
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,802
so I knew that he'd had
actually been hanging in space,

435
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:31,803
which is the reason he couldn't
get his weight off the rope.

436
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:36,123
And as I went down lower,
I could see to my horror,

437
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:40,124
that the base of this ice cliff
was an absolutely enormous crevice,

438
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:46,001
that's 12m wide and just bottomless
from where I was looking at it.

439
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:56,095
SIMON!

440
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,942
He would have been up with
first light, I thought.

441
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:00,219
'Cause I was desperately,
desperately thirsty.

442
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,220
And he would have been. And he would
have wanted to get down, and get water.

443
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,683
And he would have wanted to find me.

444
00:50:07,684 --> 00:50:11,129
Now I did stop and pause, and I
shouted across into the crevice,

445
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,130
and I yelled and yelled, "Joe, Joe".

446
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:19,344
And I suppose again, with
the benefit of hindsight,

447
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:23,428
after I got off the rope, I
should have gone and looked,

448
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,720
into the crevice, to see where he was.

449
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:30,721
But to be quite honest, the thought
didn't occur to me at that time.

450
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:37,139
I was just convinced he was dead.

451
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:47,390
Absolutely convinced, by 10, totally
convinced, that I was on my own.

452
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:53,547
That no one was coming to get me.

453
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:01,009
I was brought up as a devout Catholic.

454
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,874
I had long since
stopped believing in God.

455
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:07,875
I always wondered, if things really hit
the fan, whether I would, under pressure,

456
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:12,851
turn around and say a few Hail
Mary's, and say "get me out of here".

457
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:18,756
It never once occurred to me.

458
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:21,132
It meant that I really don't believe.

459
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:25,133
And I really do think that when you die,
you die. That's it, there's no afterlife.

460
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:29,793
There's nothing.

461
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:36,583
And I was thinking, "Could
I climb out of here?"

462
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:25,166
25 meter of overhanging ice. No way,
I couldn't do it with a good leg.

463
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,838
I knew that they were both dead. But I
couldn't just clear off and leave the camp.

464
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:38,231
For one thing, I didn't
know anything about them,

465
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,968
except for their first
names, Joe and Simon.

466
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:44,911
I didn't know their family names,
I really knew nothing about them.

467
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:48,692
And I had this bizarre idea, that
if they'd fallen off the mountain,

468
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:51,969
they would have just
landed at the bottom of it.

469
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,970
And I thought, perhaps from the bottom
of the glacier, I'd be able to see them.

470
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,510
And set off with the aim
of going as far as I could.

471
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:07,283
I started to go down
the glacier on my own.

472
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,284
In this stage I was still certain
that I was gonna die myself.

473
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:15,854
Crossing a glacier is very
very dangerous on your own,

474
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:19,855
because there are crevices in
the ice, and the snow covers them.

475
00:53:21,288 --> 00:53:24,632
Fortunately I managed to find
a faint outline of our tracks,

476
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:27,659
from when we walked in.

477
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,660
It was only when I got off the glacier,
I realized that I was going to get down,

478
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:35,982
I was going to get out of it,

479
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:39,983
I was gonna live.

480
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:54,016
I can't really describe how
scary the night had been.

481
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:03,098
I thought, it would
be like that, for days.

482
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:08,748
You gotta make decisions, you
gotta keep making decisions,

483
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:12,749
even if they're wrong decisions.

484
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:17,669
If you don't make
decisions you're stuffed.

485
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:37,658
Short of dying on the
ledge, my only chance was to

486
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:42,677
lower myself deeper into the crevice.

487
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:45,872
I didn't what I would find down there.

488
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:49,873
I was just hoping there might be some
way out of the labyrinth of ice and snow.

489
00:54:55,183 --> 00:54:59,183
And I really struggled to make that
decision, I was so scared of going deeper.

490
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,964
The other option was
to just to sit there,

491
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,167
blindly hoping that
somehow it might get better,

492
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:19,168
and I just knew it wasn't
going to get better.

493
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:47,940
I didn't want to look down,

494
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,941
I was horrified at the thought
that it was just empty down there.

495
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:12,037
I didn't put a knot
near the end of the rope,

496
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:15,775
and if there was nothing down there
I wouldn't be able to hold the rope,

497
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:19,776
and then I would fall,
and it would be quick.

498
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And I thought "Jesus, this is big!"

499
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:57,639
By this stage I was
completely physically done in,

500
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,500
staggering back down these
meringues, still desperately thirsty.

501
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,164
There werre all these sort of
thoughts swirling around in my mind,

502
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:10,165
guilt, worry, thinking about how on earth
am I going to explain this to Joe's parents,

503
00:57:12,136 --> 00:57:16,136
my friends, to Richard.

504
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:21,164
The thought did cross my mind that
maybe I could think up a decent story,

505
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:25,165
that would make me look better.

506
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:29,445
And I did quite think about
that, for quite a while.

507
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:39,649
Really the only image that sticks
in my mind from all the time in Peru,

508
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:43,999
is seeing this figure.

509
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And it was fairly close
before I could see who it was.

510
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:54,902
But he looked absolutely horrendous.

511
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:58,903
You wouldn't recognize him.

512
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,443
And I said, "Where is Joe?"

513
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:07,051
And he just said, "Joe is dead".

514
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:11,052
I told him the whole story,
as we walked back to the camp,

515
00:58:11,173 --> 00:58:15,173
I told him the whole
story of what had happened.

516
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:19,309
He wasn't in the slightest bit
judgemental about me or what I'd done,

517
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:27,521
he took it very well.

518
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:45,388
I must have lowered myself about 25m from
where the ice screw was at the bridge.

519
00:58:53,388 --> 00:58:56,904
I was now in what seemed to
be the base of the crevice,

520
00:58:56,905 --> 00:59:00,089
that was shaped like a big hourglass.

521
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,993
To the ceiling, was probably about 50m.

522
00:59:02,994 --> 00:59:06,994
I think it's as big as the
St. Paul's dome in scale.

523
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,340
I remember looking down, and
there was just solid snow.

524
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,599
And I thought, "this is
the bottom of the crevice!"

525
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:26,651
About 15m away from me,
there was a slope leading up.

526
00:59:27,905 --> 00:59:31,905
Right at the top, there was the
sun coming through this hole.

527
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:37,323
And it was shining, just this
big beam of sunlight coming in.

528
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,710
This was the way out
I'd been looking for!

529
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:50,323
I remember thinking, "Whoo, I can climb that
slope, I bloody well will climb that slope!"

530
00:59:52,962 --> 00:59:56,962
I crawled across this flat floor, and
I started crawling across on my stomach.

531
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:12,308
Then I heard things
breaking away underneath me.

532
01:00:13,465 --> 01:00:17,465
I realized that this wasn't a solid floor,
it seemed to be hollow underneath it.

533
01:00:21,236 --> 01:00:25,236
I was absolutely horrified.

534
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:30,913
It was suddenly, as if
I was on an egg shell.

535
01:00:32,485 --> 01:00:36,485
If I break through, I'll never be
able to get across to this slope,

536
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:40,717
and that was my way out.

537
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:59,949
Alright, I'm on it, this is solid now.

538
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:09,183
I started to get my axe in and hop up.

539
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:16,964
That is extremely painful, as your legs
hopped up, they both came down together.

540
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,469
I was trying to get into a better
position, so that my left foot ain't first.

541
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:29,586
But I inevitably went
onto my broken leg.

542
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:33,516
I feel the displacement
go, the bone move,

543
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:37,357
so every hop I nearly faint.

544
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,358
It was just excruciatingly painful.

545
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,859
And it was a bright sunny day.

546
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,860
Wow, the whole world has come back.

547
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:47,250
I was Iying on the snow, just laughing.

548
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:59,457
That was the relief of
getting out that place.

549
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,690
And I then looked at the
glacier and I thought,

550
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:37,711
"Well, you haven't even started, mate".

551
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:41,712
It's kilometers and kilometers
and on really bad ground.

552
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,200
But I think I was contemplating just
sitting there, because I was coming at this,

553
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:08,875
having done the most
serious climb in my life.

554
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:12,512
You come down safe from a climb like
that, you'd be exhausted for days.

555
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:16,000
You'd just eat and drink and sleep.

556
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:20,001
I'd just come out of that, I'd badly
broken a leg, I was in great pain,

557
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,740
highly dehydrated, I had no food, and
I was looking at trying to do that.

558
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:30,117
Just no way, just no way
you're physically gonna do that.

559
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:34,917
And then it occurred to me that
I should set definite targets.

560
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:40,296
I started to look at things and think,

561
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:43,674
"right, if I can get to that
crevice over there in 20 minutes",

562
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:46,986
"that's what I'm gonna do".

563
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:50,987
If I got there in 18 minutes I
was hysterically happy about it,

564
01:04:51,276 --> 01:04:55,276
and if I'd gotten 22 or 24 minutes, I
was upset almost to the point of tears,

565
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:59,639
and it became obsessive.

566
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:05,075
I don't know why I did it, I think I knew
the big picture of what had happened to me,

567
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:09,865
and what I had to do was so
big I couldn't deal with it.

568
01:05:52,017 --> 01:05:55,413
I stayed on Simon's tracks, and
they were weaving around over humps,

569
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,713
and past obvious crevices and stuff.

570
01:05:57,714 --> 01:06:01,272
I thought, "Well, unless I come to a
hole with his body in the bottom of it,"

571
01:06:01,273 --> 01:06:05,273
"these tracks will lead me
through the minefield of crevices".

572
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:18,317
All these huge mountains
around you, big mountain walls.

573
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:22,705
And they do make you
feel small and vulnerable.

574
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:26,706
And you wonder whether there's
some malign presence out to get you.

575
01:06:39,957 --> 01:06:42,809
It was like somebody
was just teasing an ant,

576
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,450
and putting something
in its way all the time,

577
01:06:44,451 --> 01:06:48,451
and eventually gonna stand on it.

578
01:07:46,764 --> 01:07:50,318
I could see Simon's
tracks were filling in.

579
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,319
They were my lifeline off the glacier.

580
01:07:54,811 --> 01:07:58,811
And I started to get very desperate.

581
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:16,661
I carried on crawling in the dark, a stupid
thing to do on the slope of the glacier.

582
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:20,662
But I was frightened and I was
just trying to see Simon's tracks.

583
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:47,038
In the morning, it was a bright,
sunny day, all the tracks had gone.

584
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:58,915
I started quite early,

585
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:02,916
and every now and then I had to stand
up on one leg to try see the way,

586
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,920
and then sit down again, and shuffle on.

587
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,975
There was one very horrendous
crevice bit right near the edge,

588
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:42,976
and I got into a maze of them.

589
01:10:07,576 --> 01:10:11,576
I suddenly came to a point where I could
see ice running down, then I could see rocks.

590
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:27,506
It was probably me, who brought
up the subject of leaving.

591
01:10:28,168 --> 01:10:30,164
Partly 'cause I was worried about Simon.

592
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:34,165
I just felt it was best to get as far away
as possible from where it had happened.

593
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:40,453
I didn't want to leave immediately,

594
01:10:40,454 --> 01:10:44,454
I felt I needed a day or two
just to collect my thoughts,

595
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:49,969
and to regain some strength.

596
01:10:54,937 --> 01:10:58,937
Spend a long time washing myself.

597
01:11:03,112 --> 01:11:07,112
That felt good, to wash my hair and
to wash my face, to have a shave, to...

598
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:13,623
get the...

599
01:11:13,624 --> 01:11:17,624
get the remnants, the
mountain out of my system.

600
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:52,637
I was desperately thirsty, because it
doesn't matter how much snow you eat,

601
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:56,638
you just can't get enough
water into your system.

602
01:11:56,871 --> 01:12:00,871
And I saw the rocks, I knew how big these
boulders would be and how far it was,

603
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:04,029
and that was the first time
that I really thought about,

604
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:08,030
whether I could get the distance.

605
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:16,305
I got rid of all my gear.

606
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:33,130
I knew that I couldn't crawl over these
rocks, they were just too big and jumbled,

607
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:37,131
and that the only way to
do it was to try and hop.

608
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:42,148
I knew I was gonna fall a lot.

609
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:37,820
I'd fallen virtually every hop,

610
01:13:37,821 --> 01:13:41,193
and it's just like having your leg
broken about every time, and I remember

611
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:45,067
looking back where I'd come
from, it was just over 20m,

612
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:49,068
and it had taken me ages. And
the pain, just of the 20+m...

613
01:14:01,374 --> 01:14:04,412
I can be insanely stubborn.

614
01:14:04,413 --> 01:14:08,359
And I do like to have things my way.

615
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,360
And things were seriously not
going my way over these days.

616
01:14:18,571 --> 01:14:22,571
I'd look at a rock and then I'd go,
"Right, I get there in 20 minutes".

617
01:14:23,695 --> 01:14:27,636
Once I decided I was going to
get that distance in 20 minutes,

618
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:31,637
I bloody well was gonna do it.

619
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:35,849
And it would help me, because I'd
get halfway through the distance,

620
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,107
and I'd be in such pain,

621
01:14:37,108 --> 01:14:40,598
I just couldn't bear the thought
of getting up and falling on again,

622
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:44,599
but I'd look at the target and
think "I've got to get there".

623
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:57,123
And I'd think, when I was
Iying a bit long, and I think,

624
01:14:57,124 --> 01:15:01,124
"no, you gotta get there. You only got
10 minutes left, only 10 minutes left!"

625
01:15:03,391 --> 01:15:07,391
It seemed like there was a very cold,
pragmatic part of me that was saying,

626
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:12,189
"You have to do this, this and
this, if you're gonna get there".

627
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:31,350
"Come on, keep moving, keep moving"

628
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,340
"Right, get up, and do it again"

629
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:49,881
It was quite insistent, and quite clear.

630
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:54,742
It was almost like a voice or a separate
part of me, telling me to do something.

631
01:15:58,963 --> 01:16:02,375
Very uncaring. No sympathy,

632
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:06,376
no acknowledgement of the fact
that I might be tired or hurt.

633
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:11,463
It was very, very odd.

634
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:23,719
That part of me kept saying, "Keep
moving, stop resting, keep moving",

635
01:16:24,757 --> 01:16:28,757
and the other part of me, my
mind, anyway, just was, "Alright.",

636
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,796
looking around and absorbing things.

637
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:34,797
And as the hours went, and
certainly as the days started to go,

638
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:38,798
it became weirder and weirder.

639
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:27,738
So I was very, very, very
thirsty. Very dehydrated.

640
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,555
And the agonizing thing is, all
these boulders, these meringues,

641
01:17:34,556 --> 01:17:38,556
are on top of the glacier. And
you could hear water running.

642
01:17:38,938 --> 01:17:42,938
All the time.

643
01:17:48,448 --> 01:17:52,448
I'd fall over a lot and I'd hear water and
I'd start digging around searching for it.

644
01:18:15,548 --> 01:18:17,619
Couldn't find it, couldn't get it.

645
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:21,620
And it was driving me mad,
to be able to hear water.

646
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,615
I was worried about Simon.

647
01:18:47,616 --> 01:18:51,616
About his health, 'cause his fingertips
were still quite bad from frostbite.

648
01:18:53,387 --> 01:18:57,387
And I just felt it wasn't
a place to be lingering in.

649
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:02,217
We just started getting
ready to leave in the morning.

650
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:12,626
I did eventually collapse amidst the
rocks, and I didn't sleep very well.

651
01:19:12,775 --> 01:19:16,771
My leg was very painful. It was agony.

652
01:19:16,772 --> 01:19:19,553
It was the first night, I
think, it hadn't stormed.

653
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:23,554
It didn't snow on me, and it didn't
rain. And I could see the stars.

654
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:27,827
I can remember Iying on my back for
what seemed endless periods of time,

655
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,340
staring at the stars.

656
01:19:32,654 --> 01:19:36,375
At one point I had this weird sensation
that I had been lain there, conscious,

657
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:39,024
for centuries, for lifetimes.

658
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:43,025
Becoming part of the rocks, and part
of where I was never gonna move from.

659
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,668
The sun came up, and
it started to warm me.

660
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,669
And I thought it'd be just so nice to
just lie there, don't move, and never hurt,

661
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:16,395
and christ, I got so,
so close to doing that.

662
01:20:23,926 --> 01:20:26,926
I genuinely believed that I
wouldn't make the distance,

663
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,927
and I also believed
that I was going to die,

664
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,928
and I sort of acknowledged it
in a very matter-of-fact way.

665
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,015
And it seemed very rational
to keep on crawling,

666
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:42,016
if you didn't think it
was gonna be of any good.

667
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:47,751
I think that it was that loneliness,
that sense of being abandoned.

668
01:20:48,416 --> 01:20:52,416
It was there all the time.

669
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:57,421
I didn't crawl, because
I thought I would survive,

670
01:20:57,422 --> 01:21:01,422
I think I wanted to be
with somebody when I died.

671
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:32,979
Probably just a symbolic act to
say goodbye to him, in my own mind,

672
01:21:35,773 --> 01:21:39,773
by doing that.

673
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I drank liters and liters of it.

674
01:22:47,568 --> 01:22:50,142
And it was just like putting fuel in,

675
01:22:50,143 --> 01:22:54,143
I could feel myself immediately
just getting stronger.

676
01:23:58,553 --> 01:23:59,946
I kept wetting myself.

677
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:03,947
And I can remember actually quite
liking the sensation, the warmth of it.

678
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:13,973
It was just a slow, steady reduction.

679
01:24:15,206 --> 01:24:18,206
Not just physically.
Physically is very obvious,

680
01:24:18,207 --> 01:24:21,104
but you, everything, yourself.

681
01:24:21,105 --> 01:24:24,336
I felt left with nothing.

682
01:24:24,337 --> 01:24:28,337
And I didn't care anymore.

683
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,400
Didn't have any dignity, you didn't care
whether you're brave or weak or anything.

684
01:24:33,775 --> 01:24:37,775
You just became almost
nothing. It was strange.

685
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I was still doing these test 20
minutes things, get here, get there.

686
01:24:52,952 --> 01:24:56,952
And then I saw these footprints.

687
01:24:57,878 --> 01:25:01,650
Then I got convinced, that
it was Simon and Richard.

688
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:04,651
They were up above me, and
they were just following on,

689
01:25:04,652 --> 01:25:08,117
and I carried on crawling down,

690
01:25:08,118 --> 01:25:12,118
utterly convinced that they
were wandering along behind me.

691
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:17,882
And I can remember thinking, "that is
really stupid, they would come and help you",

692
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,739
and I think I persuaded myself
that they were just following on,

693
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:25,740
because they didn't want to embarass me
'cause I peed myself and I was crying.

694
01:25:28,269 --> 01:25:32,269
I don't know how long it
lasted, maybe about an hour.

695
01:25:33,749 --> 01:25:37,749
I totally believed it, and then
suddenly it was like popping a bubble.

696
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:45,099
And then I realized that they weren't
there, and I felt utterly shattered.

697
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:02,568
It was about 4 o'clock
when I reached the lake.

698
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:08,171
And I that at the far end of
it, there was a meringue dam.

699
01:26:08,172 --> 01:26:09,586
And from the top of that meringue dam,

700
01:26:09,587 --> 01:26:13,587
I would be able to look down into
the valley where the base camp was.

701
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:17,648
In fact, I would be
able to see the tents.

702
01:26:17,649 --> 01:26:19,136
This was the first time I thought it,

703
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:23,137
I thought, "I'm gonna make the distance,
I can actually make the distance".

704
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:30,253
Almost as soon I thought it, the next
thought that popped into my head was,

705
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:34,353
"Will there be anyone there?"

706
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:38,354
I thought, "Christ, this is the
fourth day since I saw Simon",

707
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:44,844
and as I worked it out, I thought,
"Why on earth would they be there?"

708
01:26:47,922 --> 01:26:51,590
I knew it got dark at six, and thought
"I got to get there, I got to get there",

709
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:55,591
and I was trying to do
it as fast as possible.

710
01:27:00,527 --> 01:27:02,125
The rest of that afternoon,

711
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:06,126
I was plagued by this dreadful
feeling that they would have gone.

712
01:27:10,269 --> 01:27:14,269
I hadn't paid attention to what
was happening with the weather.

713
01:27:14,682 --> 01:27:17,930
Between leaving at four and getting
to the top of the meringues, about six,

714
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:20,743
the weather had changed.

715
01:27:20,744 --> 01:27:24,744
So when I looked down at the
valley, it was just full of clouds.

716
01:27:29,436 --> 01:27:33,436
I listened intently, hoping to hear a
whistle or an answer, a cry back, something,

717
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:38,630
and I didn't hear anything at all.

718
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:48,751
and I spend a long time, sat
there, crying, not sure what to do.

719
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:54,111
I thought about getting
in my sleeping bag.

720
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,260
For some reason it just seemed a
bit of a pathetic way to end things,

721
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,261
just in a sleeping bag.

722
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:05,516
I thought, "Well, nice but just keep
going, you'll end it down there, somewhere".

723
01:28:16,327 --> 01:28:20,327
I don't know entirely what
happened for the rest of that night.

724
01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:27,949
I stopped looking at the watch, and
everything just started to go apart.

725
01:28:47,765 --> 01:28:50,721
And I think I just got lost.

726
01:28:50,722 --> 01:28:54,722
And I didn't know what
I was doing anymore.

727
01:28:56,378 --> 01:29:00,378
I don't remember thinking of anyone,

728
01:29:00,879 --> 01:29:04,879
anybody I loved or any of that.

729
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:11,299
I did have one time, when I got
a song going through my head.

730
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,538
And it was by a band called Boney M.

731
01:29:14,539 --> 01:29:18,539
And I don't really like Boney M's music.

732
01:29:45,248 --> 01:29:48,962
<i>Brown girl in the ring,</i>

733
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:52,963
<i>there's a brown girl in the ring,</i>

734
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:58,031
<i>brown girl in the ring,</i>

735
01:29:58,032 --> 01:30:01,484
<i>she looks like a sugar in a plum,</i>

736
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:03,253
<i>plum, plum!</i>

737
01:30:03,254 --> 01:30:07,254
<i>Show me your motion,</i>

738
01:30:08,524 --> 01:30:12,524
<i>come on show me your motion,</i>

739
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,631
<i>show me your motion,</i>

740
01:30:15,632 --> 01:30:19,632
And it just went on and
on and on, for hours.

741
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:25,113
I found it very upsetting, 'cause I
wanted to try and get it out of my head.

742
01:30:25,114 --> 01:30:29,114
And I wanted to think of other things.

743
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:39,074
I was thinking, "Bloody hell,
I'm gonna die to Boney M".

744
01:30:54,235 --> 01:30:57,088
I remember sometimes not waking up,

745
01:30:57,089 --> 01:31:01,089
I think I was awake all the time,
but coming to, it was like waking up,

746
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:04,459
and sort of find myself sitting there,

747
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,877
I didn't know where I was.

748
01:31:07,878 --> 01:31:11,040
It was pitch black and snowing, and
I'd think I was back on the glacier,

749
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:14,480
or I'd think I was in a public car
park, and had been beaten up again,

750
01:31:14,481 --> 01:31:18,481
and then I'd just drift off again.

751
01:31:29,504 --> 01:31:33,450
I remember smelling something.

752
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:36,647
It was a really strong smell.

753
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:40,648
And it acted like a smelling salt,
to cut through all this delerium.

754
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,040
And I remember being really confused,
I couldn't understand what it meant.

755
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:50,156
It took me ages to to try
and work out what it meant.

756
01:31:50,157 --> 01:31:53,503
I thought it was me.

757
01:31:53,504 --> 01:31:55,740
And very slowly, I worked
it out, and I thought,

758
01:31:55,741 --> 01:31:59,741
"I've crawled through the
latrine area of our camp site".

759
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:06,149
And I realized then, that
I was close to the tents.

760
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:19,797
As I was shouting it, I thought, "This
is it, this is as far as this game goes".

761
01:32:24,902 --> 01:32:28,902
I'm not capable of going any further.

762
01:32:33,558 --> 01:32:37,558
I made the mistake of having a little
bit of hope, that they'd still be there.

763
01:32:39,204 --> 01:32:42,655
And when I shouted,
and they weren't there,

764
01:32:42,656 --> 01:32:46,656
I sort of knew I was dead then.

765
01:32:59,025 --> 01:33:03,025
That moment, when no
one answered the call,

766
01:33:13,317 --> 01:33:17,317
it was... I lost something.

767
01:33:20,247 --> 01:33:24,247
I lost me.

768
01:33:26,612 --> 01:33:29,921
I woke up, not knowing why.

769
01:33:29,922 --> 01:33:33,244
And was aware of this
kind of strange atmosphere,

770
01:33:33,245 --> 01:33:36,553
I could hear the wind
howling outside the tent.

771
01:33:36,554 --> 01:33:40,554
And started hearing something.

772
01:33:43,406 --> 01:33:45,490
It did slowly dawn on me,

773
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:48,196
that really the only thing it could be,

774
01:33:48,197 --> 01:33:51,813
would be Joe outside shouting.

775
01:33:51,814 --> 01:33:55,814
But that was completely
impossible, because he was dead,

776
01:33:56,266 --> 01:34:00,266
and he died 3 or 4 days ago.

777
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:04,625
And then head it again, much sharper,

778
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:09,050
and it really sounded like
somebody shouting. Simon.

779
01:34:13,536 --> 01:34:16,882
I can have gotten into a panic,
but first, it couldn't be Joe,

780
01:34:16,883 --> 01:34:19,799
because Joe's dead.

781
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,800
And then, if he is out there,
it's gonna be this horrible thing,

782
01:34:25,857 --> 01:34:28,339
it can't be a human being, because,

783
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,340
no human being can possibly go
through that, and be outside the tent.

784
01:34:38,099 --> 01:34:42,099
I was just kind of Iying there,
really not knowing what to do.

785
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:45,227
And then Simon woke up.

786
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:49,228
"Simon!", it was quite
clearly a shout of my name.

787
01:34:50,156 --> 01:34:54,156
I knew it was Joe actually,
I knew immediately.

788
01:34:55,175 --> 01:34:59,175
I was looking around, and then
I saw this thing, floating.

789
01:35:03,425 --> 01:35:07,425
Of course Simon exploded into action.

790
01:35:09,689 --> 01:35:13,689
Suddenly I heard voices.

791
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,891
Is that you?

792
01:35:15,892 --> 01:35:19,892
I was holding back, because I didn't
feel that was a human being out there.

793
01:35:35,906 --> 01:35:39,903
And we went back up the stream, right
from where these cries had come from,

794
01:35:39,904 --> 01:35:43,904
about maybe 60-80 m outside
the camp, and there was Joe.

795
01:35:50,552 --> 01:35:54,552
I couldn't completely believe
it, until I actually saw him,

796
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:57,970
but then it was still a little
difficult to believe that,

797
01:35:57,971 --> 01:36:01,971
because of the eerie night
and the state he was in.

798
01:36:02,444 --> 01:36:04,606
Absolutely awful state.

799
01:36:04,607 --> 01:36:08,172
It was almost like he was
a sort of ghost-like figure.

800
01:36:08,173 --> 01:36:12,173
It was like I had to sort of pinch
myself almost to believe this was true,

801
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:17,476
that this was really happening.

802
01:36:17,477 --> 01:36:21,477
Help me!
- Oh fuck, Joe!

803
01:36:23,013 --> 01:36:25,843
Simon,

804
01:36:25,844 --> 01:36:29,844
he was swearing a lot. Swearing a lot.

805
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:33,197
Richard, lift him!

806
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,198
Richard, hold him, you
stupid bastard! Lift him!

807
01:36:37,779 --> 01:36:41,779
I remember Simon grabbing my shoulders,

808
01:36:42,467 --> 01:36:46,216
and holding me.

809
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,979
I remember that.

810
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:52,980
That feeling of being held.

811
01:37:14,937 --> 01:37:18,937
He thanked me for trying to
get him down the mountain,

812
01:37:21,694 --> 01:37:25,694
for all that I'd done up to the point,

813
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:29,490
where I cut the rope,

814
01:37:29,491 --> 01:37:33,491
and he said to me, "I'd
have done the same".

815
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:40,148
Those were the first
words he uttered to me.

816
01:37:50,585 --> 01:37:54,290
And I remember, before we'd done anything
to him, before we'd even close the door,

817
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,715
he said, "Where are my trousers?"

818
01:37:56,716 --> 01:38:00,716
We had to explain, that we burned his
trousers, which made him quite angry.

819
01:38:02,718 --> 01:38:06,718
And I think that kind of brought
me back into life, to some extend.

820
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:10,755
realizing it was the
same old Joe, back again.
