1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,109
Crimson and clover

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,869
Over and over

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,039
Crimson and clover

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,276
...believe your eyes...

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,678
those are the northern lights
on view above the city...

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,759
forthe first time
in nearly eighty years.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,317
Oh, Susie Q, baby, I love you

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,914
It's 5.00 a.m.
Hello, New York.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,669
The big story this morning
is the Amazings...

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,633
taking the field today
in Baltimore...

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,718
fortheirfinal practise
before tomorrow's opener...

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,196
of the 1969 World...

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,868
Early this morning,
sanitation workers...

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,719
discovered the dead body
of another nurse...

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,309
in a Dumpster in Queens.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,671
This is the third nurse killed
in what New York papers...

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,430
are now calling
the Nightingale murders.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,678
All three victims
have been nurses...

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,189
each of them found strangled...

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,471
with their hands gruesomely
bound behind their backs...

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,717
with glass tape.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,230
The lights, also known
as the aurora borealis...

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,318
Look out!

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,998
Manhattan calling
Eye of the Storm.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,795
Engine company one-two,
ladder company nine-three...

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,275
respond to Manhattan box...

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,076
one-three-two off-ramp
on George Washington Bridge.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,238
On ourway.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,959
Frank, we're the second in.
We got the rescue.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,833
Great.

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,548
Commander,
what do you need done?

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,194
That dike's about to go.

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,755
We're one spark away
from losing the block.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,950
Is there anotherway in?

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,197
Only that manhole
leads to the vault.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,709
Forget it, Sullivan.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,436
Vault door's rusted shut,
and they can't kill the juice.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,235
Frank, you're not gonna make it.
There's not enough time.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,999
What, miss the World Series?

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,715
Not a chance.
Give me my tools.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,148
Sullivan,
this is Commander O'Connell.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,396
Can you hear me?

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,670
I hear you, Commander.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,633
The gasoline
is rising in the vault.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,390
Those downed cables
hit that gas, it's gonna blow.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,556
Way to go, Gib.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,389
I should have been
a goddamn mailman.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,795
Clearthis channel.
Explosion's imminent.

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,913
Guys. Can you hear me?

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,078
- We're in here.
- Comin' in.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,353
- Get us out.
- He's got a broken leg!

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,197
Frank, it's gonnaflash.
Get outta there.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,631
The dike isn't holding.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,830
Get us out!

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,474
Frank, did you hear me?

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,956
I hear you, Butch.
Grab that axe.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,549
Here.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,592
Gimme a whack. No sparks.
Again.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,077
One more.
OK, stand back.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,917
Thank God!

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,828
My leg's all busted up.

62
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,430
Please hurry.

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,472
We're in, Butch.

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,478
Get them and get the hell out!

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,150
Hey, fellas.
Time to go home.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,511
Watch it! Watch it!

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,109
It's falling.
It's gonna break!

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,915
Let's go. That's an order!
Everybody goes!

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,951
All right. Let's move
before the gas lights up.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,913
Watch thatwire!

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,119
Get out, for Christ's sake!

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,788
I got you.

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,552
Butch,
we're comin' out right now.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,989
Go!

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,156
You all right?

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,874
Watch your head.

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,110
Get up that ladder!
Go ahead!

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,232
Get up! Get up!

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,908
Go on up!

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,116
Go! Right behind you!

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,276
I'm going!

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,709
Pull him up!

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,990
Come on!

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,477
Come on. I got you.

85
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,876
Welcome to the company, Gib.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,393
Hey, fellas?

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,995
Hey, Dad.

88
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,078
Hey. Hey, Gordo.

89
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,078
Hey, Mr Sullivan.

90
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,714
How you doin'?

91
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,751
- How's my Little Chief?
- Good.

92
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,435
- Where's your mother?
- Inside the house.

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,791
Hey, Jules.

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,479
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, bud.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,436
How about
a little bit of the King?

96
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,678
Yeah, why not a little
of the King?

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,836
Damn!

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,235
You all right?

99
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,468
Yeah. I think I ruined
the sauce... again.

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,830
What's the matter, bud?

101
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,510
Trouble working an 8-hour shift
at the hospital...

102
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,110
watchin' the kid,
whipping up a little Bolognese?

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,435
You didn't marry Donna Reed.

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,836
I'd go for you...

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,033
and Chinese takeout
over her any day.

106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,679
Because I love you too much,
baby

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,439
Why can't you see

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,709
What you're doin' to me

109
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,718
- How was yourtour?
- The usual.

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,354
Butch called.

111
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,438
- Did he?
- He did.

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,194
Itwas under control, bud.

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,074
Butch, he's getting
a little tight in his old age.

114
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,954
Nothing wrong with old age,
as long as you get there.

115
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,275
All right, Chief.

116
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,995
When I let go,
I want you to keep pedalling.

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,237
Put the wheels back on.
I'm gonnafall.

118
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,399
Don'tworry aboutfalling.
You're ready to do this.

119
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,149
Come on.
Spirit and guts, OK?

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,349
All right.
Keep pedalling.

121
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,711
I'm gonna let go. That's it.

122
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,799
Keep pedalling. Keep pedalling.
Keep pedalling.

123
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,995
You all right?

124
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,953
Johnny?

125
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,028
You OK? Are you hurt?
Are you OK? You OK?

126
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,276
Go on, honey. It's OK.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,915
Come on, Chief.
Don't quit on me now.

128
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,999
Don't be so tough on him.
He's just a kid.

129
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,639
He just needs to know
you're behind him.

130
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,514
OK. You're right. All right.

131
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,632
CQ-22,this is W2QYV,
by for call.

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,308
...because of
the solar activity.

133
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,476
It's beautiful.

134
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,558
We got the sky
lit up like a bonfire.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,752
Word is the sunspots
are shooting off flares...

136
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,395
that stretch out
half a million kilometres.

137
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,795
Tell me about it.

138
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,435
I'm picking up signals
I could never reach before.

139
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,996
Francis, is that you?
How are you doing, my friend?

140
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,555
I'm doing great.
How you doing?

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,796
Fantastic.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,073
My wife, Sophia,
she's giving me another baby.

143
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,476
So, that's it, Samantha?
You're justwalking out?

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,478
I've been walking out
for six months, John.

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,070
You just didn't notice or care.

146
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,670
You're right.
We shoulda quit a long time ago.

147
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,673
I'm sorry.
I know it's my fault.

148
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,351
I can't change, Sam.
I wish I could, but I can't.

149
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,190
No, John,
it's that you won't change.

150
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,236
And that's what hurts so much.

151
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,873
Goodbye, Chief.

152
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,677
Next up, Johnny Sullivan.

153
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,077
It's a hit up the middle.

154
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,316
And Johnny's gonna
hold atfirst.

155
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,235
Now battingforJohnny's father,
Coach Newman.

156
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,834
He checks the runner andfires.

157
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,077
Lined hard to right.

158
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,351
No problem.
One on. One out.

159
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,870
- Hi, Uncle John.
- I'm not your uncle, kid.

160
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,548
Hey, Sully. Is that you?

161
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,116
Gordo, what are you guys
doing in my house?

162
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,471
My TV's out again.

163
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,196
Hey, you want a brewski?

164
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,272
Do you believe Linda still
won't let me cook in the house?

165
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,676
I melt one lousy frying pan,
you know?

166
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,838
John, guess what?
Dad's taking me fishing.

167
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,589
- Wanna come?
- I wish I could, Gordy.

168
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,190
But you bring me back
a big one, OK?

169
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,392
Is it OK if Gordy
uses your old gear?

170
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,432
I think it's somewhere
in the hall closet...

171
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,710
if you can find it.

172
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,388
Gordy, have a look.

173
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,515
Yahoo went up
anotherfive points today.

174
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,837
Did I miss the boat on that one.

175
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,396
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, pal.

176
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,229
So Sam called Linda.

177
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,910
Dad, John, come here!

178
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,430
Gordy, what are you
doing back there?

179
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,472
Dad, check it out.

180
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,993
Fire department.
Can I open it up?

181
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,032
Sure.

182
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,355
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Gimme that gun.

183
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,677
All right?

184
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,997
What's this, Dad?

185
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,919
Oh, my God.

186
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,272
John,
it's your dad's old ham radio.

187
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,554
Remember how we used to beg him
to let us talk on this thing?

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,116
- This... is not a toy.
- Is not a toy.

189
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,788
Can we try it, Dad?

190
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,990
Ask Uncle John.

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,668
Can we try it?

192
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,950
What the hell.

193
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,153
All right. Here.
Let's grab this baby out.

194
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,115
This is whatwe used
when I was your age.

195
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,916
Let's go overto the den.
Plug it in, like the old times.

196
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,998
We want CW or LSB.

197
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,716
Standby function.
Operator. Come on.

198
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,354
I don't know what's going on.

199
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,314
Let's take a look
underthe hood.

200
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,398
See whatwe got here.

201
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,433
Check this baby out.

202
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,154
There she is.

203
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,477
This is what people used
before the Net?

204
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,636
Not exactly.

205
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,275
I'll tell you.
Hams were... Ah, bingo!

206
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,073
These babies were different.

207
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,555
Not everybody
had one of these...

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,549
and you needed a special licence
just to be able to talk on them.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,149
Damn. I just...

210
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,999
I don't think it's gonna work.

211
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,156
It's junk, kid.

212
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,556
Nobody
uses those things anymore.

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,309
Gordo,
do you know what time it is?

214
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,670
- Hey, John.
- Hi, Linda.

215
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,917
Come on, Gordy. Let's go.

216
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,469
I'll catch you later,
if I'm lucky.

217
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,312
Hi. This is Julia Sullivan.

218
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,399
Please leave a message
afterthe tone.

219
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,432
Hey, Ma. It's me.

220
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,632
Just checking in.

221
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,752
You're probably atwork.

222
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,716
Anyways,
I'll see you tomorrow night.

223
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,988
Love you.

224
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,558
The aurora borealis,
to anyone who's seen it...

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,037
is one of the stunning events
of your lifetime.

226
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,994
They're brighterthese days.
Is something going on there?

227
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,556
Do they tie in with yourfield?
Where do they come from?

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,070
It's truly a stunning sight.
It's beautiful to look at.

229
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,478
I don't think we've seen one
this brightforthirty years.

230
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,798
From the point of view
of physics and string theory...

231
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,389
there's nothing really
thatwe gain...

232
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,159
from studying
the aurora borealis.

233
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,828
History does teach us...

234
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,952
that every time we thought
we had itfigured out...

235
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,630
there was some major discovery
right around the bend...

236
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,877
that required complete
dramatic change...

237
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,594
in our understanding
of the laws of physics.

238
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,918
This is a phrase people have
begun to hear, string theory.

239
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,759
Yes, that's right.

240
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,236
String theory dramatically
changes our understanding...

241
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,874
of space and time.

242
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,958
For example, it turns out
that string theory...

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,551
requires our universe to have 10
or possibly even 11 dimensions.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,830
The strange thing is...

245
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,474
some physicists
are even pursuing the idea...

246
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,638
that there might be more
than one time dimension.

247
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,196
So in addition to time as we
know it, psychological time...

248
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,393
which seems to organize events
in the universe around us...

249
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,955
there may be
a second time dimension...

250
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,994
where the universe evolves
in some different manner.

251
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,839
Another phrase...

252
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,192
CQ-15. Come in, 15.

253
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,314
W2QYV here. Who have I got?

254
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,751
Name's John.

255
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,632
You licensed to broadcast,
buddy?

256
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,756
Look. I really don't remember
how this thing works.

257
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Listen. You can't broadcast
without a licence.

258
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,998
Unless this is an emergency,
you have to get off the band.

259
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,432
Hey, pal,
my whole life's an emergency.

260
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,155
Where you transmittingfrom?

261
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,272
Queens, New York.

262
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,712
What do you know?
Bayside, born and raised.

263
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,876
No kidding?

264
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,436
I thought these things were
fortalking around the world.

265
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,359
The 15 band
closes down at night...

266
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,676
but during the day...

267
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,998
you can chew the band with China
if you want.

268
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,510
I can't believe people
are still using these things.

269
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,518
You must be a real old-timer.

270
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,918
Days like this, lfeel like
I'm getting there, you know?

271
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,828
So, Queens,
you psychedforthe series?

272
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,989
You know, I really don't
follow baseball anymore.

273
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,793
What?

274
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,719
I gotfed up
with all the bullshit.

275
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,639
What are you talking about?

276
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,798
Let me tell you something.
A thousand years from now...

277
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,719
when school kids study
about America...

278
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,639
they're gonna learn
about three things.

279
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,039
The Constitution,
rock 'n' roll, and baseball.

280
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,796
How can you live in Queens
and not love the Amazings?

281
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,279
The Amazing Mets?
What, the '69 series?

282
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,757
Man, I'll love Ron Swoboda
till the day I die.

283
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,509
Now I'm with you.
He's got the heart of a lion.

284
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,598
Mets can'twin game one
without him.

285
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,075
Can you hear me?

286
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,476
Game one?
What are you talking about?

287
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,955
Ltwas all over after Buford...

288
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,550
nailed Seaver's second pitch
out of the park.

289
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,791
No way, buddy.
Ain't gonna happen.

290
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,639
Hey, CQ-15.

291
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,753
CQ-15, are you there?

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,319
Who the hell was that?

293
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,194
Queens, are you there, Queens?
Did I lose you?

294
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,835
Hey, Frank.
Give the radio a rest.

295
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,191
Your son wants
to say good night.

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,039
All right.
I'll be right there.

297
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,358
Would parallel universes
ever become aware of each other?

298
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,472
Who knows?
It's a strange idea...

299
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,638
Elvis, you all right?
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,229
- You OK, Frank?
- We're fine.

301
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,908
You all right, buddy?

302
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,635
You OK, buddy?

303
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,233
The sunspots are going to
have a serious impact...

304
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,797
on radio communications
forthe next six or seven days.

305
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,753
In fact,
quantum theory tells us...

306
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,555
that the rigid notions
of past, present andfuture...

307
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,479
although useful
in day-to-day life...

308
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,559
may dissolve and be replaced
by a complex formulation...

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,479
in which time
is far more fluid...

310
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,319
than anybody
would have imagined.

311
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,992
Take me out to the ballgame

312
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,989
Take me outwith the crowd

313
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,753
Buy me some peanuts
and CrackerJacks

314
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,876
I don't care if I never get back

315
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,514
'Cause it's root

316
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,509
Root, rootforthe home team

317
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,155
If we don'twin

318
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,710
Two, three strikes you're out

319
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,836
At the old ballgame

320
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,555
That's perfect.

321
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,439
Butch,
you gotta turn the whole set.

322
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,836
Can'twait till the game.

323
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,511
It's not the tuner.
It's the antenna.

324
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,069
- Proby.
- What?

325
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,239
Point the antenna out
from underthe house.

326
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,319
There it is.

327
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,832
Proby, walk away.

328
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,589
Satch, grab a seat.

329
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,270
Sully, I think I need
a new set of cleats.

330
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,551
I lost my footing there.

331
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,154
Dr DeLeon,
you decided to join us.

332
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,555
You don'twanna know.

333
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,958
Thirty-six hours,
I was bouncing off the walls.

334
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,311
That's why you're the doctor,
I'm the nurse.

335
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,875
Can I get you something?

336
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,230
No. It's all right.

337
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,750
In leftfield, Don Buford.

338
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,555
Paul Blair is in centre field.

339
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,511
- How you boys doing?
- Good, Satch.

340
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,236
OK. I've got somethingfor you.

341
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,352
I can't believe it!

342
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,438
And I got somethingfor you.

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,471
- Dad, look!
- What? You gotta be...

344
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,751
Hey, Satch, what are you,
Santa Claus or something?

345
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,589
Game three tickets.

346
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,359
- Did you say thank you?
- Thank you.

347
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,313
You're welcome.

348
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,636
Thank you, Satch.

349
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,594
Hey, all right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,918
Everybody.
Everybody say, "Amazing Mets."

351
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,316
Amazing Mets.

352
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,512
Don't choke on your pride, Sul.

353
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,235
You ain't never gonna
find another one like Sam.

354
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,194
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothin' I do is gonna change it.

355
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,914
Nothing you're willing to do.

356
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,237
- What's the story?
- Construction crew found a body.

357
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,830
Actually, a skeleton.

358
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,352
OK. Well, be real careful
when you pull it out.

359
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,792
Make sure you get
the dirt around it.

360
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,116
What's this construction?

361
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,199
I think I'll visit
the neighbours, Satch.

362
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,790
Yeah, OK.
What did they tear down here?

363
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,514
Greek diner.

364
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,872
I used to get breakfast there
all the time.

365
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,958
Them Greeks were good people.

366
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,515
Careful. It's hot.

367
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,154
Thank you, Mrs Shepard.

368
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,238
Once that McDonald's
opened up on Dyckman...

369
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,671
they lost all their business.

370
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,793
- I see your son's on the job.
- Was.

371
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,834
Jack died a while back.

372
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,032
It's hard. I know.

373
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,710
It just seems like yesterday.

374
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,270
My son lived and bled blue.

375
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,438
- Get out of here.
- OK, Detective.

376
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,110
- Give my regards to Beth.
- Sure will.

377
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,671
This isn't going to be anything
but a history lesson.

378
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,031
Let's go back to the house.

379
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,031
Hey, Barney. How you doing?

380
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,549
Good.

381
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,915
Here you go. Have a good night.

382
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,637
I thought it'd be nicer
to eat here.

383
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,071
Sounds good.

384
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,556
I'm sorry Samantha
couldn't make it.

385
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,915
Those grad school applications
are driving her crazy.

386
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,636
How's it coming?

387
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,799
I got the VCR hooked up.
It's just this friggin' clock.

388
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,798
Doesn't matter.

389
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,795
I'm sorry, Mom.

390
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,037
I know. It's all right.

391
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,994
I'm sure everything
will work out.

392
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,236
What's that?

393
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,635
With Sam.

394
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,992
Oh, yeah, you know,
just a tough time right now.

395
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,908
So how are things
at the hospital?

396
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,557
Fine.
Dr Schwartz retired last month.

397
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,955
No kidding.

398
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
- He must have been pushing 90.
- Close, yeah.

399
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,115
So how'd you like
"The Lion King"?

400
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,198
I loved it.
Itwas sweet, kid.

401
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,470
I wish you'd gone.

402
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,911
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. It's work.

403
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,794
Yeah, well, you work too hard.

404
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,912
Look who's talking.

405
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,595
- It's tomorrow.
- Thirty years.

406
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,436
I wish I could
remember him better.

407
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,871
He was just a big kid.

408
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,231
He wanted to
play baseballforever.

409
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,468
Andfightingfires,
he loved that.

410
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,550
And you, he loved you.

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,070
OK, guys. Bedtime.

412
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,236
Looking good.

413
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,238
We'll do it again tomorrow,
Chief.

414
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,671
Good night, Dad.

415
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,237
CQ-15. CQ-15.

416
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,596
W2QYV calling
unidentified station Queens.

417
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,031
CQ-15?

418
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,070
W2QYV calling
unidentified station Queens.

419
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,988
CQ-15, come in, Queens.

420
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,148
Is that you?

421
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,670
I've been trying to "Q" you
all night. Where you been?

422
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,953
How the hell did you do it?

423
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,349
Do what?

424
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,835
Do what? The series.

425
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,078
You called Buford's homer.
How the hell did you do it?

426
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,432
Ltwasn't too tough, buddy.
The game happened 30 years ago.

427
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,155
Yeah, right. Yeah,
thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.

428
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,670
I suppose you could tell me
what happened in game two?

429
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,078
Sure. Top of the ninth, AI Weis,
game-winning RBI single.

430
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,910
Brooks Robinson
grounds out to end the game.

431
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,191
Daddy, come up
and sing the baseball song.

432
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
Hey, Little Chief.
You all right?

433
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,509
Just go on up.
I'll be there in a minute.

434
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,717
Sorry about that.
Thatwas my kid.

435
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,070
What'd you just say?

436
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,953
Sorry about that.
My kid just came in.

437
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,197
You call your son
"Little Chief"?

438
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,156
What'd you say your name was?

439
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,556
Frank. Frank Sullivan.

440
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,115
Is this some kind of joke?

441
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,551
Gordo, is that you?
Are you messing with me?

442
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,230
I ain't messing with you.
I'm just trying to figure out...

443
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,999
You're telling me
your name is Frank Sullivan...

444
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,158
you live in Queens,
and you wanna know...

445
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,115
how I called the first game
of the 1969 World Series?

446
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,233
Yeah, that's exactly
what I wanna know.

447
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,559
Gordo, if this is you,
so help me.

448
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,115
- What'd you say...
- Gordo?

449
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,917
What'd you say your call station
or your call letters were?

450
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,232
W2QYV.

451
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,513
Now you listen to me.

452
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,678
My name is
John Francis Sullivan.

453
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,715
I live at34342nd Avenue,
where I've lived my whole life.

454
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,516
I saw the first game
of the 1969 World Series...

455
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,598
right here in this house
thirty years ago.

456
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,870
Bullshit.

457
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,436
My father's name
is Francis Patrick Sullivan.

458
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,838
He was afire-fighter
and a die-hard Mets fan.

459
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,474
- Every night...
- Bullshit!

460
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,196
...he sang to me
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame."

461
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,469
Who the hell are you?

462
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,599
Son of a bitch!

463
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,074
What's going on?

464
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,192
Nothing's going on.

465
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,956
Oh, my God.

466
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,278
You burnt the desk.
I can see it.

467
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,073
Are you still there?

468
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,795
You burnt the desk.
I can see it.

469
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,276
Come back! Talk to me!

470
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,231
Listen to me.
You listen to me right now.

471
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,830
I don't know who you are
orwhy you're doing this.

472
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,679
But let me tell you something,
asshole.

473
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,554
You stay away
from me and my family.

474
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,150
No, no, no.
You gotta believe me.

475
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,238
I don't know how
this is happening...

476
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,999
but it's me, Little Chief.

477
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,396
Hey. Look. I am warning you.

478
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,875
If you touch my kid...

479
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,153
I will hunt you down till
the day I die. You got that?

480
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,114
But you already died.

481
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,834
What are you talking about?

482
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,111
The Buxton fire.

483
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,639
When did that happen,
thirty years ago?

484
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,718
October 12, 1969.

485
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,559
Tomorrow. You're telling me
I'm gonna die...

486
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,638
I ain't dying
in no fire tomorrow.

487
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,116
My God, tomorrow. Listen.
Tomorrow hasn't happened.

488
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,073
Right. It hasn't happened.
It ain't gonna happen.

489
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,397
You gotta listen to me.
Itwas an abandoned warehouse.

490
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,989
Butch always told Ma
itwasn't yourfault.

491
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,395
You wentwith your instincts.

492
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,637
- I'm warning you.
- Listen to me.

493
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,039
If you'd gone the otherway,
you would have made it.

494
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,034
Hello? Shit!

495
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,036
Sully, what are you doing, man?

496
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,675
I talked to him, Gordo.
I talked to my dad.

497
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,348
Sully, go in the house.

498
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,631
I'm gonna come over,
and we'll hang out.

499
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,310
No. I gotta get him back
so he doesn't go in.

500
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,239
Go in? Go in where?

501
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,399
The warehouse in Buxton.
It's tomorrow.

502
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,796
Yeah, right. Yeah,
thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.

503
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,993
I suppose you could tell me
what happened in game two?

504
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,399
Sure. Top of the ninth, AI Weis,
game-winning RBI single.

505
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,878
Come on. Come on.
Hit it out, AI!

506
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,316
Look at the stats.
Look at 'em.

507
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,117
Yeah, all right!

508
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,836
We have a 3 and 2 response.
Ladder93.

509
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,235
You're first due.

510
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,875
Flash is reported to be
an abandoned warehouse...

511
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,753
at the foot of Water Street
and Third.

512
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,633
You got some
construction-limited access.

513
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,594
Al Weis
is having a great series.

514
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,831
Yeah! We won!

515
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,956
Frank. You all right?

516
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,638
We know it's vacant.

517
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,469
Nobody goes in.
Surround and drown.

518
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,789
Callfor a tower.

519
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,719
Help!

520
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,832
Shit! We got squatters inside.

521
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,395
Help!

522
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,669
Help! Help!

523
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,109

525
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,515
Where's your sister?

526
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,871

527
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,469
On the topfloor.

528
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,356
I tried. I tried.
Please help her! Please!

529
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,917
Take her. Come on, Proby.
Anybody else up there?

530
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,598
Ryan, get her medical treatment.

531
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,071
Gimme my gear.

532
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,559
- Hey, Sul.
- Satch.

533
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,629
Here he is.
How youfeeling, Sul?

534
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,274
What can I tell you?

535
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,835
Here you go.

536
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,679
Better.

537
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,996
No visible fire
first or secondfloor.

538
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,711
Watch your step, Proby.
This floor's rotten.

539
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,359
We gotfire on the thirdfloor.
We're goin' up.

540
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,110
Frank, we got two lines
coming behind you.

541
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,594
Back out, kid!
Waitforthe line!

542
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,632
The hell with the line.
I'llfind anotherway up.

543
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,672
No, you can't help me, kid.

544
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,116
So you doing OK, John?

545
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,916
Yeah. Tough day, you know.

546
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,270
Here's to your dad.

547
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,914
Thirty years today.

548
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,679
To your dad.

549
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,112
To my dad.

550
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,510
We're pulling everyone
out of the building.

551
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,675
Get that up to the topfloor.

552
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,235
It's cooking up here.

553
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,797
So afterthat Halloween thing
with the fire truck, remember?

554
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,549
I remember riding around
with Butch and your dad...

555
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,479
and the whole neighbourhood
was watching.

556
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,956
I remember.
I wanted to go as a cop.

557
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,709
Yeah, so then Jules
makes your dad...

558
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,798
buy you that cop kit
for your birthday.

559
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,753
I rememberthat.

560
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,952
I was always the robber.
I was always being handcuffed.

561
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,436
That's right.
I taught you to do that.

562
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,393
Ten-forty-five.
Ifound the girl.

563
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,070
- She's breathing.
- Get them out.

564
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,550
Hang on!
What the hell is going on?

565
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,035
Gino, what's the matter?

566
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,118
The gear box, it's cracked!

567
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,074
Frank! Frank!
The ladder's jammed!

568
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,078
You gottafind anotherway out!

569
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,159
Frank, can you hear me?

570
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,116
Ltworked out OK.

571
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,357
You're a better cop
than afireman.

572
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,630
No doubt about it.

573
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,479
Worked out goodfor me, too.

574
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,593
I'm glad I didn't have to spend
ten years as his hose man.

575
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,316
Yeah, I bet you are.

576
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,394
The Buxton fire.

577
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,796
If you had just gone
the otherway.

578
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,239
Frank,
we're losing the building!

579
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,750
I know.

580
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,639
Hey, hey, hey.
This is not a toy.

581
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,836
Wave to Ma.

582
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,633
Ma, look at us.

583
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,112
He's some ballplayer.

584
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,193
John, you all right?

585
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,639
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

586
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,719
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Can you bring a towel?

587
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,038
Satch, my father didn't die
in afire, right?

588
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,550
Gordo,
my father didn't die in afire.

589
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,308
What are you talking about,
Johnny? He had cancer.

590
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,478
Cancer. Because itwas
the cigarettes, right?

591
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,990
Yeah, lung cancer,
ten years ago.

592
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,154
Little Chief.

593
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,433
Gordo, I ain't dreaming here.
I talked to him. Itwas real.

594
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,314
Little Chief!

595
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,591
What are you talking about?

596
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,712
Ltwas a ham radio.

597
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,628
That's how come he didn't die.

598
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,959
Little Chief!

599
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,316
That's how come he didn't die.

600
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,999
John. John Sullivan,
are you there?

601
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,150
Come on. Answer me.

602
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,918
Chief. Chief, are you there?

603
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,635
I'm right here, Daddy.

604
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,273
Come here.

605
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,473
Come on.

606
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,752
- Where's Elvis?
- He's sleeping.

607
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,634
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- You woke me up.

608
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,195
I did?

609
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,353
I got an idea.

610
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,472
What's that?

611
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,631
All right, Chief.

612
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,913
What do you say we tame
this bronco?

613
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,429
I'm scared.

614
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,110
I know.
And you know what?

615
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,596
I'm gonna be right here
with you.

616
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,519
Always.

617
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,598
Daddy, I can't.

618
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,600
Well, we can.
We can do it together.

619
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,836
You and me.

620
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,589
Spirit and guts.
What do you say?

621
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,479
All right. Come on.

622
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,949
Now, you just take yourtime.

623
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,676
I'm not going to let go
until you say it's OK.

624
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,473
All right.
Start pedalling.

625
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,830
That's it.
Get your balance.

626
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,030
- Ready?
- Wait!

627
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,833
OK, I'm still here.

628
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,755
All right.
It's all you.

629
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,916
Look at me!

630
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,078
It's all you, Chief.

631
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,430
Look at me, Dad.

632
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,598
Look at you.
You're doing it.

633
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,076
- I'm doing it!
- You're doing it.

634
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,036
- How's itfeel?
- Good.

635
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,636
This is great!

636
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,559
It's like I'm on
aflying trapeze!

637
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,433
- Look at you!
- This feels great!

638
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,757
- You're goin' around the world!
- It's like flyin'!

639
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,431
- Wait'll your mother sees this!
- Look at me!

640
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,872
Let's wake up the world, huh?

641
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,874
Oh, my God.

642
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,477
John Sullivan?

643
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,710
It's me.

644
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,790
You're the voice of an angel.

645
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,275
Reached right out of heaven...

646
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,030
and you pulled my butt
out of the fire.

647
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,038
Tell me I'm not dreaming here.

648
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,516
Tell me it's really you.

649
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,430
It's me, John.
This ain't no dream.

650
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,949
But how could it be?

651
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,674
I don't know.

652
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,237
Butwe gotta be talking off
the mother sunspot of all time.

653
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,557
Yeah, I'd say so.

654
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,274
You OK, Chief?

655
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,751
Yeah, I'm fine.

656
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,918
You sure?

657
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,510
Yeah, it's...

658
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,316
It's tough to explain.

659
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,320
I mean, I got all these
new memories, but it's...

660
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,318
it's like I don't know
what to believe.

661
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,159
What do you mean?

662
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,828
'Cause I still remember
what itwas like...

663
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,395
when you died in the fire.

664
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,750
But I'm the only one.

665
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,078
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

666
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,592
I remember both...
at the same time.

667
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,315
And... it's like
waking upfrom a dream...

668
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,159
and you're not sure what's real.

669
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,637
I remember you being here, but I
also rememberwhen you weren't.

670
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,469
I'm sorry, John.

671
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,638
I'm sorry.
I neverthought that...

672
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,593
Well,
you gotta think about that...

673
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,316
and you gotta be more careful,
'cause I can't lose you again.

674
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,432
Not like that.

675
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,757
You won't, John.
You won't.

676
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,555
I swearto God,
no matterwhat, not like that.

677
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,433
You got it? You hear me?

678
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,472
You hear me, Chief?

679
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,831
I hear you.

680
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,868
So how old are you?

681
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,516
I'm thirty-six.

682
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,313
Thirty-six.

683
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,159
You're all grown up.

684
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,512
You gotta be married
and everything.

685
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,315
No, I'm not married.

686
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,796
What, you're too busy
playing ball?

687
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,198
No, it didn'twork out.

688
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,119
I gave it up.

689
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,390
What happened?

690
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,594
I just... blew my arm out
my senior year.

691
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,268
Didn't have a shot.

692
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,517
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Johnny.

693
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,552
I know that had to hurt.

694
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,468
Yeah. Thanks.

695
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,831
So, what'd you wind up doing?

696
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,190
You join the department?

697
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,189
Actually, I went the otherway.

698
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,914
I'm a cop.

699
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,593
You're third-generation
fire-fighter.

700
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,031
I thought you were gonna
grow out of that cop phase.

701
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,471
You got Satch to thank
forthat one.

702
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,399
You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,590
Satch.

704
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,999
He always crazy about you
ever since you were born.

705
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,600
You're still my Little Chief.

706
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,758
Right?

707
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,555
Yeah, I'm trying to be.

708
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,956
I'm trying.

709
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,678
Well, tell me about yourself.

710
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,395
Tell me about your life.

711
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,038
I mean,
where do I start, you know?

712
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,391
Mustang? I don't own a Mustang.

713
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,957
Well, you will,
and you loved it.

714
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,231
Fire-engine red.
Four on the floor.

715
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,430
Seventy home runs?

716
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,995
That's a record
thatwill never be broken.

717
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,273
I wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit sixty-six.

718
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,438
Really? You mean like
those bigfield radios...

719
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,790
they use in the army?

720
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,956
No, much smaller.

721
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,719
Works off a satellite
or something.

722
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,673
You carry it around
in your pocket.

723
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,839
What about "Apollo"?
How did it all work out?

724
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,077
Ltwas a great series, Pop.
Amazing.

725
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,236
We win, right?

726
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,193
Hold your horses.
I'm getting there.

727
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,914
Game three,
Agee came through...

728
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,475
homered off Palmer
in the second.

729
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,876
I knew Agee was going to have
a great series.

730
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,230
Forget about Agee.

731
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,352
Wait until you hear
what happened to Cleon Jones.

732
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,234
- Now you sound like your mother.
- No, I'm serious.

733
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,749
Come on. Your grandfather...

734
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,111
he smoked two packs a day,
and he's still kicking.

735
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,678
Not you. It's gonna get
the better of you.

736
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,633
Well, I just knew.
She melted my heart.

737
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,355
Thatwas it.

738
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,518
You got anybody?

739
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,111
Yeah. Kinda.

740
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,869
Something I gotta work out,
but...

741
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,436
she's worth it.

742
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,952
No, you... go ahead.

743
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,549
You get some rest.

744
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,753
I'm tired, too.

745
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,556
I almost don'twanna
click off here, like...

746
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,070
maybe we won't get this back.

747
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,476
We will.

748
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,555
I'll be here tomorrow.

749
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,310
I know.

750
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,430
I love you, son.

751
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,871
I...

752
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,395
I love you, too, Dad.

753
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,796
And...

754
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,595
I've missed you so much.

755
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,873
Hi. This is Julia Sullivan.

756
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,198
Please leave a message
afterthe tone.

757
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,915
Hey, Ma. It's me.

758
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,798
Just call me. We gotta talk.

759
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,994
- Take overfor me?
- All right.

760
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,430
Frank, what's going on?

761
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,269
Nothing. I justwanted
to see you, that's all.

762
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,513
I'm not going anywhere, Jules.
Notforthe rest of your life.

763
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,990
I got a badfeeling today.
I was worried.

764
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,953
Look at me.
Not a scratch.

765
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,116
Where's Johnny?

766
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,915
He's at Gordo's.
I tucked him in.

767
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,634
You give him his drops?

768
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,559
One in each ear.

769
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,433
Whatwould you do without me?

770
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,472
Probably marry some rich doctor.

771
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,672
Never have to work.

772
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,235
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

773
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,476
Frank, I gotta...

774
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,911
Excuse me, Doctor.
Is that Benazepril?

775
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,952
I gave this patient
fifty mils of Benadryl.

776
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,276
Mix them and he's dead.

777
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,551
- Why wasn't I informed?
- It's in his chart.
