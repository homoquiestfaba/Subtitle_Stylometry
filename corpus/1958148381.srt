1
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,859
One push...

2
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,529
- He hit his head.
- He did not.

3
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,730
Did he just hit
his head?

4
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,631
No, he just caught him.

5
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:37,599
But he hit the floor.
I saw him.

6
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,366
- No, he didn't.
- You dropped him!

7
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,735
Sweetheart,
I promise you. He's fine.

8
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,003
Why isn't he crying?

9
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,905
He'll be crying...
He should be crying,
right?

10
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,607
He will be crying
in no time.

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,475
Where are you taking him?

12
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,546
What... What is wrong?

13
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,914
Why isn't he breathing?

14
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,215
- Did you kill him?
- No!

15
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,416
Did you kill my baby?

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,819
I saw him breathing.

17
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,787
- Did you drop him?
- No! I did not.

18
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,589
- You made me have him.
- The nurse is getting him.

19
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,323
Yes, we are! We're...

20
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,164
Why are you
flinging him?

21
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,422
I accidentally drank
mouthwash Friday night.

22
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,594
You can't get stomach cancer
that way...

23
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,963
Not from one time.

24
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,433
I drank a mouthful
a couple weeks ago, too.

25
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,436
I'm sure it's fine.

26
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,496
I'm visiting my mother
tomorrow.

27
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,633
I know you are.
Your father's anniversary.

28
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,737
The day he died.

29
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,507
How you feeling about that?

30
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,979
You know,
I never met him.

31
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,617
I meant how you feeling
about going home.

32
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,458
I had that dream again.

33
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,964
<i>Let's stay on track.</i>

34
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,633
How are you feeling
about the trip?

35
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,370
It's good I'm going back.

36
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,373
It's been a long time.

37
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,309
Has it?

38
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,614
Several months.

39
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,785
Are you feeling guilty
about that?

40
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,064
And, um,

41
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,902
when you're out there,

42
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,671
are you going with
any sense of a plan?

43
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,373
Hoping for a certain outcome?

44
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,610
Like what?

45
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,882
Do you feel like you're going
with realistic expectations?

46
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,624
If the last time
you were thirsty,

47
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,493
you went to a well and
the water made you sick,

48
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,729
are you gonna go back
to that specific well,

49
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,598
expecting it to be safe?

50
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,907
Hmm.

51
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,485
Do you ever wish
that she was dead?

52
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,522
What?

53
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,657
Of course not!

54
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,459
Well, it wouldn't
be so crazy if you did.

55
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,062
We can sort of want
these things

56
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,531
and also not want them at all.

57
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,433
Those feelings can coexist.

58
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,871
We're here so we can air
those kinds of thoughts.

59
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,374
Okay.

60
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,747
How's the Hydrotipnol?
Still making the eyes itchy?

61
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,884
Only if I don't keep blinking.

62
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,685
Is it helping the anxiety?

63
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,155
Um...

64
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,224
Tell you what,

65
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:35,129
I'm gonna write you a script
for a very cool new drug

66
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,766
which I think

67
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,402
should be smoother
on all fronts.

68
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,509
Always with water.

69
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,179
Always. And if your breathing
changes or you feel warm,

70
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,414
call me immediately.
That's serious.

71
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:55,950
Break a leg.

72
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,886
<i>Hi, carrot, it's Mom.</i>

73
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,021
<i>I'm just calling to say that</i>

74
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,623
<i>I'm so, so, so excited</i>
<i>to see you tomorrow.</i>

75
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,025
<i>- </i> Joseph?
<i>- You're my angel,</i>

76
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,060
<i>and I love you.</i>

77
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,864
<i>Okay. I love you. Okay.</i>
<i>Bye, sweetie. I love you.</i>

78
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,003
Listen to your mother

79
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:19,006
when I tell you
to not leave my side!

80
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,049
Hello.

81
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,951
-Can I please see this one?
-That one?

82
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,152
You think I won't!

83
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,055
Do you fucking want me
to do it?

84
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,024
Oh, yeah?

85
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,862
Beep beep!

86
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,798
Excuse me.
What is that man doing?

87
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,900
We're trying
to get him to jump.

88
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,796
Shut up, bitch!
Fuck you!

89
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,133
- Get away from me.
- Stop fucking with me!

90
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,569
Get away from me.
You get away from me.

91
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,837
Chicken noodle for you.

92
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,238
- Get away.
- You look like

93
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,306
a minestrone man.

94
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,841
-Fuck you!
-Stay away!

95
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,576
It's hot!

96
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,011
Jeez,
we're running low on crackers.

97
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,871
Hey, Dad.

98
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,050
<i>Search</i>

99

100

Hello?

Help!

107
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,013
Please help!

108
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,449
I need some sleep!

109
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,187
Oh, yeah?

110
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:38,646
Come on, dance!

111
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,420
Excuse me, sir? My bag
and my key were just here.

112
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,690
You're fucked, pal.

113
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,292
Hey, wait a minute.
Why would you say that?

114
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:39,433
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Wolski.

115
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,703
This is Beau Wassermann
from apartment 303.

116
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:42,704
I'm calling because
my keys were...

117
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:43,671
<i>No, please, no solicitors!</i>

118
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,607
No, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not a solicitor,

119
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,675
I'm one of your tenants.
I need a locksmith.

120
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,142
-I'm late for the airport.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

121
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,344
Hello?

122
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,145
Hello?

123
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,497
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Martha.

124
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,299
I'm sorry, is Mom there?

125
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,602
<i>Beau! Sweetie!</i>
<i>Yes, she's right here.</i>

126
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:19,707
<i>Beau?</i>

127
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,610
Hi, Mom.

128
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:25,479
<i>Hi... Hi, carrot.</i>
<i>Are you at the airport?</i>

129
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,816
No, not yet.

130
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,717
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

131
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,151
<i>-Are you in the cab?</i>
-No, Mom...

132
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,554
<i>How long is the cab ride?</i>

133
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,155
Mom, I...
I don't want to worry you,

134
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,189
I was on my way,

135
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:38,392
but something, uh...

136
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,293
I don't know.
I was up all night

137
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,728
because my neighbor
kept leaving notes

138
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:42,362
underneath my door
about noise,

139
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,131
even though
I didn't make any noise.

140
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,266
And I overslept,
and when I went to leave,

141
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,869
I forgot something,
I went back in.

142
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,837
And then
I came back out and...

143
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,139
and my key was stolen
out of my door.

144
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,374
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

145
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,646
<i>So where are you</i>
<i>calling me from now?</i>

146
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,348
My apartment.

147
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,187
<i>Wait, what time is it?</i>
<i>Isn't it 4:30?</i>

148
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,156
Yeah, I know.

149
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,125
<i>Baby, your flight</i>
<i>is in an hour!</i>

150
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,563
I know, but Mom, my key
got stolen out of my door.

151
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:22,804
Mom?

152
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,275
Mom!

153
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,285
Mom...

154
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,555
<i>Okay, sweetheart.</i>
<i>I understand.</i>

155
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,255
Wait, what's okay?
No, it's not.

156
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,358
What do you understand?

157
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,427
<i>No, of course it isn't.</i>
<i>Your keys are stolen.</i>

158
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,529
<i>That's terrible.</i>

159
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,565
They were stolen.

160
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,369
<i>Then we'll just do</i>
<i>another visit another time.</i>

161
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:59,741
<i>I can even come to you,</i>
<i>so it's not such a pain.</i>

162
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,845
It's not a pain,
it's never a pain.

163
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,580
You know what?
I can still just come to you.

164
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:07,649
I'm still coming,
I'm on my way. I just...

165
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,518
What do you think I should do?

166
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,224
What do you think I should do?

167
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,229
<i>I'm sure you'll do</i>
<i>the right thing, sweetheart.</i>

168
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,567
What is the right thing?

169
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,907
What would be
the right thing for you?

170
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,646
Do I call the police?

171
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,855
Or maybe there's a way for me
to just still come home now.

172
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:50,892
But is that safe?

173
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,293
If... If my apartment's open
to the public,

174
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,630
and somebody has my keys,
I don't know what's going on.

175
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,330
I mean, it doesn't sound safe.

176
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,533
It's not safe, is it?

177
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,735
<i>Beau...</i>

178
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:01,769
What?

179
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:09,811
<i>No.</i>

180
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:11,612
Yeah.

181
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,353
<i>I'm sorry about your keys,</i>
<i>sweetheart, I have to go.</i>

182
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,489
No, you don't have to go.

183
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:23,658
-Mom...
<i>-I hope you find them.</i>

184
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,026
Wait, wait,
come on, let's fix this.

185
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,293
Let's fix this.

186
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:29,731
Hello?

187
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,470
Yo, you gonna die, bitch!

188
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,357
<i>Always with water.</i>

189
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,626
<i>Always.</i>

190
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,828
<i>Always.</i>

191
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,361
<i>Always.</i>

192
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,582
Ahh!

193
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,550
Help me! Help me! Help me!

194
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,019
Help me! Help me! Help me!

195
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,521
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me! Help me!

196
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,547
Declined.

197
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,715
What?

198
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,684
No, it's not.
Can you try again, please?

199
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,554
No...

200
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:15,589
Oh, no.

201
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,559
Ah, no good.

202
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,762
Oh, God... How much?

203
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,098
You drank already.
You owe $1.79.

204
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,637
-Okay...
-$1.79

205
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:31,806
Oh, no.

206
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,975
Oh, ho-ho!

207
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:37,144
I call the police.

208
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,246
What? No, no, look,
I'm paying! I'm paying!

209
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:43,718
30 cents more.

210
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:44,952
Oh, God...

211
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,658
20 now.

212
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,527
- Oh, my God...
- 20!

213
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,896
-I know!
-Don't curse me, my friend.

214
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,164
I'm not the one.

215
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,967
- Oh, my God!
- Five more now.

216
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,503
There!

217
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,305
I call the police!

218
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:35,069
Mrs. Wolski?

219
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:47,248
Back away!

220
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,683
Stay away! Get away!

221
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:53,988
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Get away! Get away!

222
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,689
Get back! Stay away!

223
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,059
Get back!

224
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,943
Get away!
Get away from me!

225
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:53,280
Fuck you! Fuck you!

226
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,981
Again! Again!
Put it back!

227
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:38,819
Hello?

228
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:08,882
Sir?

229
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:48,989
Hello?

230
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,326
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you've reached Mona!</i>

231
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,262
<i>Leave me a message if you ever</i>
<i>want to speak to me again.</i>

232
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:04,632
Hi, Mom.

233
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:07,935
So, I'm trying to book
a flight for tonight,

234
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,136
but the credit card
got declined.

235
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,138
<i>We're sorry.</i>

236
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,140
<i>Your message</i>
<i>did not go through.</i>

237
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,241
<i>Please hang up and...</i>

238
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,054
<i>Hello?</i>

239
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,590
Hello?

240
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:32,560
<i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

241
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,895
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to call my mom.

242
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,099
<i>This is your mom's number?</i>

243
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,268
Oh.

244
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:42,604
Mm? Yeah, it is.

245
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:45,005
Who... Who's this?

246
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:48,041
<i>I'm with UPS.</i>

247
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:50,277
<i>Um...</i>

248
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,679
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>whose phone this is.</i>

249
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:53,615
<i>I just called the police.</i>
<i>They're already on their way.</i>

250
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:56,618
Oh...

251
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:58,586
Okay.

252
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,155
Why?

253
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,358
Hello?

254
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,060
<i>Can you...</i>
<i>Can you maybe describe</i>

255
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,663
<i>your mother to me?</i>

256
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:10,497
Uh...

257
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:14,669
Brown eyes. Red-brown hair?

258
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:22,943
<i>Can you maybe describe</i>
<i>her physique?</i>

259
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:25,647
Wait, what's going on?

260
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,315
W... Why are you calling
the police?

261
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:31,151
<i>Listen, I don't know</i>
<i>what this is.</i>

262
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,654
<i>I have a package,</i>

263
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:35,022
<i>and I only came in</i>
<i>because of the smell,</i>

264
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,257
<i>and the dogs on the block</i>
<i>were all going crazy,</i>

265
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,293
<i>and the door was open,</i>
<i>so I just barely came inside,</i>

266
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,494
<i>but... um...</i>

267
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:44,164
<i>there's a lady on the floor.</i>

268
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,401
<i>Well, the body of a lady,</i>
<i>and there's no face or head.</i>

269
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:50,605
What?

270
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,409
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I should have answered this.</i>

271
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:58,212
<i>Police are coming.</i>
<i>This isn't my phone.</i>

272
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,314
<i>I'm truly just finding this.</i>

273
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:04,117
I'm sorry, you don't...
makes any sense. You...

274
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,487
What do you mean
there's no face or...

275
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,021
or head for who?

276
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,258
<i>I mean, I'm sure there is.</i>

277
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,327
<i>I'm sure it's here.</i>
<i>I'm sure it's everywhere.</i>

278
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,461
<i>A chandelier...</i>

279
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,431
<i>fell on top of it.</i>

280
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,199
<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>it dropped off the ceiling</i>

281
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,467
<i>and it fell on a woman.</i>

282
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:24,304
<i>And it smashed her head,</i>
<i>it's like it evaporated.</i>

283
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,515
But who is it?

284
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,483
<i>What?</i>

285
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,219
Who is it?

286
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,056
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm trying to be tactful here.</i>

287
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,458
<i>You're saying that</i>
<i>this could be your mom?</i>

288
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,393
What? I didn't say that!

289
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,696
Why are you saying that?

290
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,364
<i>No, you said that to me!</i>

291
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,199
<i>Look, you asked</i>
<i>if your mother was here.</i>

292
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,801
<i>That's what I'm saying,</i>
<i>I don't know who this is!</i>

293
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:56,103
<i>I just picked up the phone and</i>
<i>that's what you said, okay?</i>

294
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,673
<i>I didn't do this!</i>
<i>I didn't do this! You know?</i>

295
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:02,075
<i>I swear.</i>

296
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,749
<i>Maybe you called</i>
<i>the wrong number.</i>

297
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,519
<i>Did you dial this number?</i>

298
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,789
It's saved in my phone.

299
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,693
<i>It's saved on your phone?</i>
<i>Okay, maybe you misdialed.</i>

300
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,362
Oh, my God.

301
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:23,865
Oh, my God... You...

302
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:24,999
<i>Right? Maybe you misdialed.</i>

303
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,199
<i>Maybe this is all</i>
<i>a big misunderstanding.</i>

304
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,301
-You're scaring me. Okay.
<i>-So, we should hang up...</i>

305
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,336
<i>-</i> Okay.
<i>-...then maybe your mom...</i>

306
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,370
<i>-your mom will pick up.</i>
-Okay

307
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,339
<i>That... Okay.</i>
<i>Hang up. Call back.</i>

308
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:33,407
<i>No, I'm sorry...</i>

309
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,151
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

310
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

311
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:57,565
<i>Do I have your permission to</i>
<i>check her purse for some ID?</i>

312
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,601
<i>Since it's more likely now</i>
<i>that this is your mom?</i>

313
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,236
<i>Hello?</i>

314
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,784
<i>Is her name...</i>

315
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,419
<i>Mona Wassermann?</i>

316
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,356
<i>Is that your mother?</i>

317
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:26,193
<i>Hello?</i>

318
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,431
<i>Mona Wassermann?</i>
<i>Is that your mom?</i>

319
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,573
<i>Hey. Hey, m...</i>

320
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:40,908
<i>Is there somebody there?</i>

321
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,560
<i>Hi, you've</i>
<i>reached Dr. Jeremy Friel.</i>

322
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:06,794

00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:09,630
<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>as soon as I'm able.</i>

324
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,765

00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,405
Please.

-Police, please help, will ya?

Drop the weapon! Drop it.

Trust me.
I'm not gonna say it again.

349
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,998
Oh, my God,

-No, no.

353
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:37,939
No, no, no.

354
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,472
Don't make me do this!

355
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:33,921
I'm coming!

356
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:35,990
Roger, he's awake.

357
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,268
Did you hit the button?

358
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:50,171
Are you awake?

359
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:02,850
How're you feeling?

360
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,922
Strange.

361
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,124
I bet. You've been sleeping
for two days.

362
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,094
What?

363
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:16,330
Did I get hit with a car?

364
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:19,100
There was an accident, yes.

365
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:22,236
Oh, goodness...
Uh, I hit you with my car.

366
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,608
Is that this?

367
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:34,949
There was a stabbing.

368
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:36,951
You were assaulted.

369
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:38,819
What?

370
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,265
Just... Why? Why?

371
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:55,035
-What?
-I know!

372
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,904
-Am I dead?
-No.

373
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:59,373
No. You've been healing
so quickly.

374
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,108
And no organs were hit,

375
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:04,345
and your...
your bleeding was really mild.

376
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,780
What, this is...
What room is this?

377
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:09,016
This is a room in our house,

378
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:11,986
but it's your home
for as long as you need.

379
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,687
My name's Grace.

380
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:15,456
Oh, this is Roger.

381
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,924
This is my husband.

382
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:24,932
Hey, guy. Welcome back.

383
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:26,734
Thought you'd sleep in, huh?

384
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:29,270
Roger's a very
respected surgeon.

385
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:32,273
He's the one who dressed
and treated your wounds.

386
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:33,774
You're a lucky man.

387
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:39,246
What is... What is this?

388
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,415
That's my little assistant
health monitor.

389
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:43,117
Keeps track of your condition.

390
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,420
Was that a dream before?

391
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:48,489
-What is?
-Was that a dream?

392
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:49,890
The stabbing?

393
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,091
No, my mom.

394
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:54,028
-Your...Your mommy?
-My mommy.

395
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:56,931
Is my mommy dead?

396
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,866
What was your dream, sweetie?

397
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,270
Her head... just gone.

398
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:05,773
- Her what?
- Her head.

399
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:09,476
Oh, no, no, that's a dream.
That was a dream.

400
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,312
No, her head is gone.

401
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:14,315
No, no, no,
that's a bad dream. It's okay.

402
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:16,917
Shh. That's a bad dream.

403
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:19,987
-There you go. Shh. Oh, no.
-My mommy...

404
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:24,158
Just a dream.
It's just a dream.

405
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,326
Amen.

406
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:02,029
Amen.

407
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:03,797
Amen.

408
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,235
Amen.

409
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,409
That's Nate. Our boy.

410
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:16,477
Nathan.

411
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:21,215
He's Army?

412
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,918
82nd Airborne Division.
Caracas.

413
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:28,523
Killed in action.

414
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,859
Where's that?

415
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:36,297
Oh, is it time
for dessert already?

416
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,398
Here you go.

417
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:41,902
And, uh...

418
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,471
two for the big man.

419
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:53,213
By the way, Beau, uh,
not for the dinner table,

420
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,816
but, uh, I noticed
when you first came in,

421
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,253
your testicles

422
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,389
are significantly distended.

423
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:05,192
Looks like a bad case
of epididymitis.

424
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:07,061
Let him eat, Roger.

425
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,029
But we should get
an ultrasound

426
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:10,431
just to be safe.

427
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:12,499
Oh, Toni!

428
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:13,934
Ton... Come here.

429
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,269
- Come here.
- Oh, she's not dead,

430
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:17,037
- that's nice.
- Come... Come in here.

431
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:21,442
I want you to meet
our new friend.

432
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,177
Beau, this is Toni.

433
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,378
Toni, this is Beau.

434
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,413
Oh, hello.

435
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:30,084
You enjoying my bed
and all my stuff?

436
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:32,353
- What? That's your bedroom?
- Oh, God... here we go.

437
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:34,254
I didn't realize that. I'm...

438
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,623
Beau. Take it easy.

439
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:38,392
Toni's happy to give you
her room.

440
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:39,561
Yeah, no.

441
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:41,362
It's not like we have a
totally empty room available,

442
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:43,197
completely unused.

443
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,998
That's right.
It's not like that.

444
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,133
You know that.

445
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,436
I'm going to school.

446
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:52,106
Honey, it's Saturday!

447
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,874
Don't mix those, Toni!

448
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,144
Little asshole.

449
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,153
Okay, so you wanna dial nine,
and then you're good.

450
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:08,222
Do you have the number
you need?

451
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,457
My mom made me memorize it.

452
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:11,526
Hi, Jeeves!

453
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:17,898
Uh, Jeeves, um... He...

454
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,969
Jeeves and my son
served together in Caracas.

455
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,471
He was with him when he died.

456
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,008
Oh, that's gonna be blood.

457
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,443
Did you give him
his meds?

458
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:30,678
I thought you did!

459
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:32,580
All right...

460
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:34,181
If you need anything,
just shout.

461
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:39,019
Stay right there, Jeeves.
Sweetie, don't touch anything.

462
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:51,633
<i>Hello.</i>

463
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:53,467
Dr. Cohen?

464
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:58,405
<i>I'm not a doctor,</i>
<i>Beau, I'm an attorney.</i>

465
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:00,542
I'm calling about Mom.

466
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,111
Is it true?

467
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:07,147
<i>Is what true?</i>

468
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,184
<i>That she was discovered</i>
<i>with a collapsed head</i>

469
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:11,318
<i>in her living room?</i>

470
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,253
<i>That you were</i>
<i>the first person notified</i>

471
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:14,488
<i>and it's taken three days</i>

472
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,624
<i>for anyone to hear from you?</i>

473
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,626
<i>Yes, Beau,</i>

474
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:21,462
<i>it's true.</i>

475
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:25,299
But how?
I was just speaking with her.

476
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:29,136
I was coming to see her.
I was coming to see her.

477
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,170
Shh!

478
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,542
What...

479
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:35,710
What happened?

480
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:38,546
<i>Wha... What,</i>

481
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,081
<i>am I the first person</i>
<i>you're asking?</i>

482
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:43,518
<i>A chandelier crushed her head!</i>

483
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,155
<i>Hello?</i>

484
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:50,457
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

485
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:52,727
<i>Hello?</i>

486
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,396
What do I do?

487
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,298
What...

488
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,635
do...

489
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,070
Do I call the...

490
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:05,072
funeral... funeral people?

491
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:08,743
<i>About what?</i>

492
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,080
Do I need... to...

493
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:16,450
<i>Everyone was contacted</i>
<i>on the day that she was found.</i>

494
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:20,153
<i>The burial has been</i>
<i>outrageously postponed.</i>

495
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:24,726
So...

496
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:28,362
When...

497
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:29,764
When is it now?

498
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:35,369
<i>A body is to be buried</i>
<i>immediately, Beau.</i>

499
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:38,171
<i>"It shall not remain</i>
<i>all night."</i>

500
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:39,507
<i>Does that ring a bell?</i>

501
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,075
<i>Do you understand anything?</i>

502
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,279
I just woke up.

503
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:46,581
I got hit by a car,

504
00:50:46,614 --> 00:50:48,650
and I got stabbed.

505
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,589
<i>It was your mother's</i>
<i>unfortunate wish</i>

506
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:58,191
<i>that she not be buried</i>
<i>without you present.</i>

507
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,260
<i>So, we are waiting, Beau.</i>

508
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:02,664
<i>And every minute more</i>
<i>that we wait</i>

509
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:06,266
<i>only deepens the humiliation.</i>

510
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:08,736
Okay.

511
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,239
<i>Your mother's body</i>
<i>is being watched at all hours.</i>

512
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,375
<i>There is no rest for her.</i>

513
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,513
<i>There has been no rest</i>
<i>for the people that love her.</i>

514
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,282
<i>You need to be here Beau,</i>

515
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:26,186
<i>dressed in a suit,</i>
<i>with a eulogy.</i>

516
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:30,592
<i>You need to stop</i>
<i>the humiliation.</i>

517
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:33,193
<i>It's all that's being</i>
<i>asked of you.</i>

518
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,296
<i>We'll keep an eye out</i>

519
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,265
<i>for Your Highness's</i>
<i>royal carriage.</i>

520
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:45,372
Was that okay?

521
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:50,678
I...

522
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,848
I... I need to get home.

523
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,852
I... I have to get back.

524
00:51:58,418 --> 00:51:59,419
Oh...

525
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:01,823
Baby.

526
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:04,157
I have to get back.

527
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:07,795
Paging Dr. Rog.
Dr. Rog incoming.

528
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:09,664
- All right, bub.
- I need to go.

529
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:10,832
A little medley here.

530
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:12,232
- Now.
- Under the tongue.

531
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,501
- Can you take me?
- Come on.

532
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:14,802
- Attaboy.
- Oh, God...

533
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:17,839
Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God...

534
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:18,973
How's our patient?

535
00:52:19,007 --> 00:52:21,241
-He needs to get back.
-Oh, I'm gonna need to go now.

536
00:52:21,274 --> 00:52:24,211
Is there a flight tonight
or this afternoon?

537
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:25,278
-Or now?
-Oh, sweetheart,

538
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,413
this is the afternoon.

539
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,315
Okay, well,
can we order one or...

540
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:29,751
- Whoa, partner!
- What are we gonna do?

541
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:31,519
-Partner, hold your horses.
-Oh, God...

542
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,320
He can't fly
in his condition.

543
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:34,856
Yeah, I was gonna say.

544
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,024
What's the problem,
ol' buddy?

545
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:38,191
She needs to be buried.
She needs to be buried.

546
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,561
They're waiting for me.
She's...

547
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:44,866
She's humiliated.
She's humiliated, oh, so much.

548
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,335
Beau, listen,

549
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:50,337
there's nothing worse
than losing a parent.

550
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:53,574
I lost my mother
when I was 11.

551
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:56,276
I don't think
I ever got over it.

552
00:52:57,712 --> 00:53:01,248
But I promise you,
we will get you there, easy.

553
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:03,885
Wasserton's only like
a six-hour drive from here.

554
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:05,753
Can you take me now?

555
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:09,924
But you also need to get
some serious rest, my brother.

556
00:53:09,957 --> 00:53:12,860
- No! I feel fine.
- And some support.

557
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:14,494
When can you take me?

558
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:19,332
-Couple days? Then...
-What?

559
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,602
Then after the show,

560
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,236
we can all swing back
here together.

561
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,973
-Roger. Roger, please.
-As a family.

562
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:28,910
Please, I need to
get back now. I need to go.

563
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,612
<i>Heck, Beau, if you need</i>
<i>to get home ASAP...</i>

564
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:32,747
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- ...we're just gonna</i>

565
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,448
<i>have to find a way</i>
<i>to take you tomorrow.</i>

566
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:36,851
<i>What?</i>

567
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,920
<i>Tomorrow... Not... Not... No.</i>
<i>But... But...</i>

568
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,621
<i>- You know what?</i>
- ... <i>today, why not today?</i>

569
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,756
<i>You're right, honey.</i>
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

570
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:44,892
<i>Roger, please...</i>

571
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:46,794
<i>- Oh...</i>
<i>- What about today?</i>

572
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:49,764
<i>Not in this condition.</i>

573
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,572
I need
more red and blue.

574
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:01,308
Hmm...

575
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:02,510
I found it.

576
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,350
All right!

577
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:12,720
It's beddy-byes
for the Rog-man!

578
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,923
Where's my blushing bride?

579
00:54:17,058 --> 00:54:19,426
Yoo-hoo, babe!

580
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:31,672
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
just going to the bathroom.

581
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:37,410
Would you like to trade?

582
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:39,881
I really don't mind.

583
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,285
Shut my door
and get in my bed.

584
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:50,625
I really, really, really
don't mind, really.

585
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:52,392
I like couches.

586
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:54,394
And I'm leaving tomorrow,
anyway.

587
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:03,403
Well, If you do change
your mind,

588
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:06,473
I'm ready to switch whenever.
I'll be happy to.

589
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:08,576
I'm sorry. Thank you. Sorry.

590
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:14,876
...don't know
where the fuck is it!

591
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,912
...touch it? Why would you
touch someone else's shit?

592
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,481
He moved my toothbrush.
He used... Did he...

593
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:23,117
Did he fucking use
my toothbrush?

594
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,987
Today's the day, Beau.
How's it feel?

595
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:31,391
Is he okay with me?

596
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:35,730
Eh, probably.

597
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:37,531
It's just his nerves,
Beau.

598
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:38,866
He's been through a lot.

599
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,167
Just like you.

600
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:41,936
Man's a hero.

601
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,706
Okay, pal-e-o,
it's you and me!

602
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,975
Grace unfortunately
can't join.

603
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,111
She's got her big
shareholder meeting.

604
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:53,814
Feelin' sad about
going home, Beau?

605
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:57,484
Must feel totally unreal.

606
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:01,055
Yeah...

607
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,723
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

608
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,895
Right. So...

609
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,698
Not "sad" exactly.

610
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,967
I mean, yes. Of course.
I just...

611
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,972
I think I need
to get there to even...

612
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,511
Hey, that makes sense.

613
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:26,479
That makes all the sense
in the world!

614
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:27,782
Hello?

615
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:29,817
Speaking.

616
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:32,153
Uh-huh.

617
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,589
When did it happen?

618
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,793
Water skiing?

619
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:42,630
Ugh. Well, yes, no, of course.

620
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:44,532
Tell them to rush him over.

621
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,734
Oh, my God!

622
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:49,203
Emergency surgery.

623
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:51,005
Carl Oberst
split his head open.

624
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:54,141
One of my oldest patients.

625
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,010
Oh, G...
Well, I can't miss work today.

626
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,111
It's all hands on deck.

627
00:57:57,144 --> 00:57:59,113
Oh, my gosh, Carl.

628
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,649
I know. Good ol' Carl.

629
00:58:01,682 --> 00:58:04,218
Okay... Okay...

630
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:08,488
Mm...

631
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:14,795
Beau,

632
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,264
this is gonna take a while.

633
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,835
I don't know
if today's gonna happen.

634
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,138
Okay...

635
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,174
What do you mean?

636
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,709
I wanna say tonight,

637
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:30,711
but I already pushed
this morning's surgeries

638
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:31,812
to tomorrow.

639
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:38,853
But... if I pull 'em all back
to this afternoon,

640
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:42,023
we could blast off
tomorrow morning!

641
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:43,891
No, but I have to go today.

642
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:45,693
I... I have to leave today,
my mother...

643
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:47,762
Uh-oh!

644
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:53,034
See...

645
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,337
Mm-mm.

646
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,638
Oh, Beau!

647
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,807
You aren't healed,
my dude.

648
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:02,043
Not to mention...

649
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:05,780
Maybe there's a way.

650
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:09,083
Since you're busy,
maybe I can... I can fly.

651
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:11,752
I fly and I can pay you back
when I get my credit card.

652
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:13,287
It isn't about the money,
Beau.

653
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,089
You can't fly
with your wounds.

654
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:17,691
The air pressure
will rip you wide open.

655
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:18,893
Maybe I can take a bus!

656
00:59:18,926 --> 00:59:20,227
I can take a bus.
Can I take a bus?

657
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,730
Or take a train? Or... Or...
Or a cab?

658
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:24,732
Beau, we're responsible
for you.

659
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:27,935
Driving you home is
the absolute least we can do.

660
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:29,770
Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:59:29,804 --> 00:59:31,172
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

662
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:33,207
I'm sorry,
but I have to go today.

663
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,175
I have to go today.

664
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,843
I don't want to impose.
I don't want to...

665
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:38,946
Going tomorrow
won't be an imposition!

666
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:40,714
It'll be my pleasure.

667
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,349
Okay?

668
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,758
How did you get me here?

669
00:59:53,027 --> 00:59:54,161
Is it, Beau?

670
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:57,231
Don't just say that.

671
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,735
This is your decision.

672
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:17,785
Thanks, pal, you're a trouper!
Sorry for the curveball, Beau!

673
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:20,688
Wait, don't you need
to stitch me up?

674
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,090
Ah, it's fine. Just cut back
on the jumping jacks,

675
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,325
you know what I mean?

676
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:27,995
In the meantime, my man,
this is your home.

677
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:30,664
I need to run, too, sweetie.

678
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:32,700
- There's a...
- Oh,

679
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,101
and I'm giving Jeeves
his medicine,

680
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:36,137
so if you hear him screaming,
he's just asleep.

681
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:39,707
Don't forget to hydrate.

682
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,041
What?

683
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,444
Drink lots of water.

684
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,880
We're taking
you back tomorrow.

685
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:47,915
Goodbye, sweetie.

686
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:51,719
"Tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace

687
01:00:51,752 --> 01:00:54,188
"from day to day..."

688
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:56,423
What?

689
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:57,925
What does this mean?

690
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,428
Wait! What does that mean?

691
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:02,763
Shake a leg.

692
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:14,775
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>the office of Harold Cohen.</i>

693
01:01:15,442 --> 01:01:17,278

Hey, Dr. Cohen.
It's Beau.

696
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,290
I'm on my way.

01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:20,774
<i>But she must.</i>
<i>She was 70 years old.</i>

709
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:23,444
<i>Excuse me, sir,</i>
<i>you discovered the body?</i>

710
01:02:23,477 --> 01:02:25,079
<i>Look, I never would've</i>
<i>gone inside if...</i>

711
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:27,281
<i>if, uh, the dogs in the street</i>
<i>hadn't been going nuts</i>

712
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:28,282
<i>and I hadn't smelled</i>
<i>that smell</i>

713
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:29,283
<i>and the door</i>
<i>hadn't been half-open.</i>

714
01:02:29,316 --> 01:02:31,452
<i>That's the only reason</i>
<i>I went inside.</i>

715
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:34,522
<i>Admired by her friends</i>
<i>and feared by her competitors,</i>

716
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:38,092
<i>Mona Wassermann</i>
<i>was a local industry titan</i>

717
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,261
<i>and a force</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

718
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:43,063
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

719
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:44,532
<i>Mona Wassermann has been...</i>

720
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,800
What?

721
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:56,410
What the fuck!

722
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:59,013
Oh... I'm sorry!

723
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,948
I'm sorry I was
on your computer. I threw up.

724
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,316
I'll... I'll clean it up.
I'll clean up.

725
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:04,184
I'll clean up
better than before.

726
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:08,822
We're leaving.

727
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,458
What?

728
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:13,528
I'm taking you home.

729
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:14,729
What about
Roger taking me?

730
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:17,398
Who the fuck do you
think told me to take you?

731
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,568
Meet my new brother.

732
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:23,437
I'm just Grace
and Roger's friend. Hi.

733
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,872
Look at this.

734
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:25,774
I don't even care.

735
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,509
He just threw up
on my fucking computer.

736
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,516
Thank you.
Thank you for taking me.

737
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,051
Taking him where?

738
01:03:40,954 --> 01:03:42,823
Aren't you a little old
to be getting adopted?

739
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:45,459
<i>I'm not adopted.</i>

740
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,361
Yeah, you are.

741
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:50,864
To him.

742
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,901
No, thank you.

743
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,371
Dad told me
you need to smoke it.

744
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:00,240
What?

745
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:03,977
It's for your healing.
He says you need to relax.

746
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,613
<i>That's okay, really.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

747
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:07,181
<i>I already took some pills.</i>

748
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:08,916
Um, no.

749
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:11,218
Actually, it's not,
"Okay, really. Thank you."

750
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,521
Your new dad says
that your pills aren't enough

751
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:16,591
and that you need to smoke
this with your little sister.

752
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:18,492
<i>Please,</i>
<i>I really can't do this.</i>

753
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:20,227
<i>I just saw something</i>
<i>very confusing</i>

754
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,395
<i>and I just need to get home.</i>

755
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,401
Look, you smoke it
and we take you home.

756
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:29,504
You don't and we don't.
That's it.

757
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,074
Wait...

758
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:36,110
Then, I'll just wait
for Roger to take me.

759
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,616
Can you please open the door?

760
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,687
If you don't do it right now,

761
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,488
I'm going to make her
pull my hair so hard

762
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:49,356
that it detaches my scalp,

763
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,558
and she'll say
that you did it.

764
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,226
I will.

765
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:55,929
I remember that you did,
I saw it.

766
01:04:55,963 --> 01:04:57,231
You taking advantage of us.

767
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,076
What's in it?

768
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:11,044
It's three things.

769
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:21,054
Okay, thank you.

770
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,456
Do it actually.

771
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,258
Please. That was enough.

772
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,076
Harder.

773
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:48,248
Keep going.

774
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,050
Don't stop.

775
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,754
Don't cough. Don't...

776
01:05:55,557 --> 01:05:56,558
Dude...

777
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:01,995
Oh, my God...

778
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:03,397
Oh, my God!

779
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:05,466
Oh, my God!

780
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,201
I'll take this.

781
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,472
Wait, what?

782
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:13,407
What is that? What?

783
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,242
"What is that?"

784
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:16,310
All right,
can you please open...

785
01:06:16,343 --> 01:06:17,277
Your brother is fucked.

786
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:20,414
Can you open
the window, please?

787
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,483
Yeah bitch! Hit that!

788
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:27,522
Oh...

789
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:30,324
Oh, my God.

790
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:32,359
Wait, what is in that?

791
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:35,095
You saw
what Sarah posted?

792
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:37,397
Oh, my God.
What a lying little bitch.

793
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:39,132
Bet she never even
met that guy.

794
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,467
Whatever.
He needs to raise your grade.

795
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:43,070
Can you die from this?

796
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,672
Can you die from this?

797
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:47,474
What? I don't know...
Wait, wait.

798
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:50,344
I don't want to.

799
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:52,045
Dude, I'm still
so fucking pissed.

800
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:54,314
Yeah, whatever.

801
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,351
This is, like,
the fifth time!

802
01:06:57,384 --> 01:06:58,620
It is not the fifth!

803
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:00,755
- It's, like, the second!
- I don't care!

804
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:02,624
Not even a D. A D-plus.

805
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,358
Just give me
a fucking C-minus!

806
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,228
It's 'cause
he wants you.

807
01:07:08,262 --> 01:07:10,698
He should be fired
for wanting me.

808
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,567
Oh, my God, he would
totally not survive it.

809
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,234
He's like
a thousand years old.

810
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,771
Oh, my God,
what if we killed him

811
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:17,839
by getting him fired?

812
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:37,157
The car is getting smaller.

813
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:44,298
Oh, wait,
that's the house again!

814
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:46,199
We just passed your house!

815
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:48,135
- Hey!
- What?

816
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:55,475
What?

817
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:15,797
Do you miss Martha,
Beau?

818
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:23,370
Of course. I love Martha.

819
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:26,574
You love Martha?

820
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:31,411
She's my friend. I like her.

821
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,689
Ah, see, Beau?
You're not the only kid here.

822
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:57,605
You know
what I've been through.

823
01:08:57,639 --> 01:08:59,306
So, hearing you
tell me what to do.

824
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:00,908
-You can't even pay for it.
-This is my...

825
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,146
There's
a dead man in the pool!

826
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:09,550
There's a dead man
in the pool!

827
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,222
There's a dead man
in the pool!

828
01:09:16,924 --> 01:09:18,626
There's a dead man
in the pool!

829
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,462
There's a dead man
in the pool!

830
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,506
There's a dead man
in the pool!

831
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:32,640
So you're just here
with your mom?

832
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:36,744
Only sometimes.
Right now, I'm by myself.

833
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:38,880
Mm. I'm Elaine.

834
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:39,981
I'm Beau.

835
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,749
I'm Elaine.

836
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:44,284
Are you here
with your mother?

837
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:45,720
Yeah.

838
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:48,656
She got me, and my dad got
our rich whore neighbor

839
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,991
who he's probably
fucking right now

840
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:53,293
on a pile
of her slut money in Aruba.

841
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:55,763
Here, take a picture of me
and Gene.

842
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,909
<i>Is that the type of girl</i>
<i>you're attracted to?</i>

843
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:10,745
<i>No.</i>

844
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:15,683
<i>Because I've noticed</i>
<i>you noticing certain types.</i>

845
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:20,822
It's okay if you are.

846
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:24,324
You don't have
to feel embarrassed.

847
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,661
I'm not.

848
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:35,670
She's very pretty.

849
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:38,305
Very natural.

850
01:10:40,575 --> 01:10:42,409
You could ask my advice,
you know?

851
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:46,413
Only women know women.

852
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:48,950
That's the truth.

853
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:51,652
Men are blind.

854
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:55,590
That's not a criticism.
That's their charm.

855
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:58,693
Don't be defensive.

856
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:03,263
I'm proud of the man you are.

857
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,601
Hey...

858
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:13,574
I'm proud of the man you are.

859
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:26,286
A girl like that...

860
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:30,390
confident, self-possessed...

861
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,397
A man would have to match her.

862
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,402
But you could.

863
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,306
She should be so lucky.

864
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:51,078
Any woman would be so lucky.

865
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,718
You just have
to commit completely.

866
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:04,592
<i>Nothing in life</i>
<i>is more important</i>

867
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,459
<i>than choosing</i>
<i>the right companion.</i>

868
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:13,768
Hey, my dude!
Long time no see.

869
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:15,136
- How was your day?
- How're you feeling,

870
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:16,771
-sweetie?
-Oh, good!

871
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:18,438
You're already in your PJs.

872
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:21,474
Well, we're hot on your tail!

873
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:23,044
<i>I think</i>
<i>I might go to bed early.</i>

874
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:25,813
Okay.

875
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:28,783
I haven't decided yet.

876
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:35,723
Unless...
you'd rather I stay up.

877
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:40,595
We could
stroll around the deck...

878
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,698
go star gazing.

879
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:48,936
I'll go to bed.

880
01:12:58,478 --> 01:12:59,580
What about eclairs?

881
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,949
People hide razors in them.

882
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,452
What about rainbow cake?

883
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:07,922
The colors make cancer.

884
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,559
What about liquid shit?

885
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:16,831
Do you think
your mom's a cunt?

886
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:19,700
What do you mean?

887
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,869
Well, it's okay.
My mom's a complete cunt.

888
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:24,939
Are you a virgin?

889
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:28,976
Well, it doesn't matter!

890
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:31,078
I am, too.
I mean, who gives a shit?

891
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:35,683
I have to.

892
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:38,819
It's very dangerous for me.
It's genetic.

893
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:41,488
My father died.

894
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,192
Here...

895
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:47,128
-Suck this off.
-What?

896
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:52,667
What?

897
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,203
What?

898
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,441
We're allowed to kiss.

899
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:04,912
Who is?

900
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:06,147
But only for
the next 10 seconds.

901
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,248
What do you mean?

902
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,916
Ten, nine,

903
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,483
-eight, seven...
-What? Wait...

904
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,986
-...six, five...
-We're allowed to...

905
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:13,220
-...four, three...
-Can you just explain?

906
01:14:13,254 --> 01:14:14,889
-Are we...
-...two, one!

907
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,724
One and a half!
One and three quarters!

908
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:18,960
I'm sorry.

909
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,962
Elaine!

910
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:23,931
Shit, fuck. I gotta go.

911
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:26,267
Okay. I'm sorry.

912
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,069
- Tomorrow?
- Now!

913
01:14:28,102 --> 01:14:30,604
...to be in my bed!

914
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:35,776
He's breaking your rules!
Hypocrite!

915
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,012
You want
to test me, young lady?

916
01:14:44,785 --> 01:14:45,786
Jeeves!

917
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,755
He's inside!

918
01:14:48,956 --> 01:14:50,024
Inside!

919
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,561
Beau, Beau, Beau,

920
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,096
they're taking me away.

921
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:57,164
Beau, wake up, wake up!
She's taking me away.

922
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,000
- She's taking me off the ship!
- What's happening?

923
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,134
She's taking me away.

924
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,702
- Will you wait for me?
- Beau, what is going on?

925
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:03,137
I love you.
Will you wait for me?

926
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,005
What's happening?

927
01:15:04,038 --> 01:15:06,173
I love you.

928
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:07,641
Oh, my God.

929
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:08,943
Why are you doing this?

930
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:10,745
What is this?

931
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:11,912
Will you wait for me?

932
01:15:11,946 --> 01:15:12,880
-Yes.
-Promise?

933
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:14,648
-I swear, yes.
-Do you promise? Promise me!

934
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:15,783
-Okay? Okay...
-I promise.

935
01:15:15,816 --> 01:15:17,318
-Enough!
-Who is this bitch?

936
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,185
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

937
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:21,188
- What is this?
- No! No! No!

938
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:23,224
- Now!
- Beau, I love you, okay?

939
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:24,125
Come here right now!

940
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:25,893
Wait for me!
Wait for me, okay?

941
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:27,595
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

942
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:28,929
- Lainie!
- Wait for me!

943
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:29,897
My heart.

944
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,866
- ...never again!
- No!

945
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:32,933
- Oh, my God.
- No!

946
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:33,801
Close it!

947
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:35,669
What did you
promise her, Beau?

948
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:38,139
Beau!

949
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:40,941
Where is she going,
Beau? Was she the one?

950
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:42,610
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>Put that down!</i>

951
01:15:42,643 --> 01:15:44,078
He's on the couch!

952
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,713
He's inside!

953
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,682
Okay, okay, okay...

954
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:50,818
-That's him! That's him!
-Okay... Not him. Okay...

955
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:53,220
That's enough!

956
01:15:53,254 --> 01:15:54,422
No need
to get up, Beau!

957
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:56,257
- He's not straight!
- Stay bent! Stay bent!

958
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,291
All right...

959
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:01,062
- He's laughing!
- No, no.

960
01:16:01,095 --> 01:16:02,363
He's laughing!

961
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:03,731
He's laughing.

962
01:16:03,764 --> 01:16:05,199
Don't worry, Beau.
False alarm.

963
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,634
It's okay, Beau.

964
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,868
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

965
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,703
It's all under control.

966
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:10,971
- Okay.
- He's laughing!

967
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:12,740
When they rescued him
in the jungle,

968
01:16:12,773 --> 01:16:15,376
they found him running around,
shooting at the bodies.

969
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:17,178
And not at... not the enemy,

970
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:19,647
- his own squad too.
- His own squad, Beau.

971
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,149
He was defending
himself. He still is.

972
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:25,086
He's a hero
and he came back to nothing!

973
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,954
We're the only ones
who would take him in.

974
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:29,223
He's gonna be so
ashamed in the morning, Beau.

975
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:31,125
Mark my words.

976
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:34,128
He loves you.
He told me he loves you.

977
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:35,830
He told me yesterday.

978
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,869
That's not
part of the original contract.

979
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,872
I'm a mother myself, you know.

980
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,408
In that case,
I might have to let...

981
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,144
Look alive, pal!
It's grill time!

982
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:52,413
I thought we'd have
a little goodbye barbecue

983
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,115
before we hit the road!

984
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:56,784
- What?
- You got the tri-tip!

985
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,655
Good morning, sweetheart.
How are you feeling?

986
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:02,857
You coming, Gracie?

987
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,024
Be right there.

988
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:08,028
Let's get you up.

989
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,831
Oh, oh, oh...

990
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:12,800
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on.

991
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:16,871
Baby. Breathe.

992
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:25,679
As someone who sees you
and loves you

993
01:17:25,713 --> 01:17:27,214
and knows what
you're going through,

994
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:29,116
even though I know
I can never know,

995
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,417
I have to tell you...

996
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:31,719
Babers!

997
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,991
You mind coming out here
for a sec? I need a hand.

998
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:38,192
Of course.

999
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,196
Why don't you find
something to watch?

1000
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:44,899
I'll be right back.

1001
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,002
Channel 78.

1002
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:15,155
...now!

1003
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,125
What... What is...

1004
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:19,927
What...

1005
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:23,330
What... What...

1006
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:25,399
We're gonna finally
put some color on these walls.

1007
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,502
What?

1008
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,176
Here. Take that wall.

1009
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:42,449
That wall!

1010
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,186
Okay.

1011
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:49,290
Yeah, how about this?

1012
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:53,528
Wait... Wait, what...

1013
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:55,996
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1014
01:19:57,632 --> 01:20:01,235
Hey... Grace is so careful
about this room.

1015
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:02,803
It's my brother!

1016
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:08,409
I know. So, why?

1017
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:13,814
Okay.

1018
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:15,916
-Yeah.
-What?

1019
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:17,151
Yeah, you know what?

1020
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:19,554
You'll just get fucked up
with me.

1021
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,088
I'm supposed to be leaving.

1022
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:22,590
So you'll leave fucked up!

1023
01:20:22,624 --> 01:20:24,559
I feel really, really bad
right now, please!

1024
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:27,529
So what? You can come into
my life and sleep in my bed

1025
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:29,296
and steal my fuckin' parents,

1026
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:31,865
but you can't get
fuckin' fucked up with me?

1027
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,335
No! I'm not trying
to steal anything, I swear!

1028
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:35,869
I know you are.
You've blown it!

1029
01:20:35,903 --> 01:20:38,038
You failed your stupid test!

1030
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:40,974
What?

1031
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:43,010
Everyone pretending
you're some sad old orphan!

1032
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:43,911
It makes me puke!

1033
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,979
Wait...
Wait, what do you mean?

1034
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:47,649
Uh, I'm sorry. Please...

1035
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:48,717
I'll... I'll leave.

1036
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,184
I'll do whatever you want.
But what does that mean?

1037
01:20:50,217 --> 01:20:51,285
What do you mean about a test?

1038
01:20:51,318 --> 01:20:52,986
I'm not asking you to leave!

1039
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,522
I've asked you
to fucking drink

1040
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:56,156
this fucking paint with me!

1041
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,425
-Toni, please!
-Don't call me Toni!

1042
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,094
I'm sorry,
but it is your name!

1043
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,664
It is my name. It's my name.

1044
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:04,465
Wait... Wait, what do you mean

1045
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:05,466
when you said that
about the test?

1046
01:21:05,499 --> 01:21:07,669
- What does that mean?
- I don't care!

1047
01:21:07,702 --> 01:21:08,902
You first.

1048
01:21:10,572 --> 01:21:12,172
Don't, Toni, please.

1049
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,608
You listen to me.

1050
01:21:14,676 --> 01:21:16,443
I have videos of you.

1051
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:19,046
I'll post them.
I'll say what you did!

1052
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:22,517
What? What did I do?
What did I do?

1053
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:27,488
Fine, you fuckin'
pussy faggot.

1054
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:28,956
No, please, Toni, don't!

1055
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:31,992
Stop, please!
You're gonna be sick!

1056
01:21:32,393 --> 01:21:33,561
Stop! Stop!

1057
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:35,362
Fuck you!

1058
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:42,035
Help! Help! Doctor!

1059
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:43,370
Help!

1060
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,644
Oh, God!

1061
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,513
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1062
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:55,182
She should blink!
She should be blinking.

1063
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:56,618
No! She drank...

1064
01:21:56,651 --> 01:21:58,051
What did you do to her?

1065
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:01,656
No! I... I didn't...

1066
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:03,390
I tried to get her to stop.

1067
01:22:03,424 --> 01:22:06,427
I begged her,
please stop doing it.

1068
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:11,498
Oh, my God...

1069
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,668
Come on, Toni. Come on, Toni.
No, Toni.

1070
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:16,738
No! No! Come on, baby.

1071
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:20,140
I... I didn't... I didn't...
I told her not to.

1072
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:22,176
I begged her.

1073
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:23,410
Come on... No!

1074
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:26,013
Come on, baby! Come on.

1075
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:32,252
I see you now!

1076
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:33,621
What?

1077
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:37,124
Replacing my son!

1078
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:39,627
-With a demon!
-No, no. No, Grace.

1079
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:41,395
With a demon!

1080
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:46,433
-I'll kill you!
-No! No!

1081
01:22:46,467 --> 01:22:48,536
-I'll kill you!
-No! Oh, my God!

1082
01:22:58,245 --> 01:23:01,516
This ends up bad.
It's bad. Totally bad.

1083
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:03,484
Jeeves!

1084
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:06,320

1092
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,919
I was in an accident.

1093
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,421

I'm sorry, but can you
please help me?

1095
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:38,533
Are you hurt?

1096
01:26:49,342 --> 01:26:52,479
It's a very big piece of glass
in your head.

1097
01:26:52,513 --> 01:26:53,648
Glass?

1098
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:55,817
Oh, it was a door.

Can I take it out?

1101
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:04,625
Uh-huh.

1102
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,664
- Oh, God...
- Okay. Okay.

1103
01:27:09,697 --> 01:27:11,599
-Oh...
-Okay.

1104
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:12,934
-Does it bleed a lot?
-Okay, it's out.

1105
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:15,335
It's good. The head ones,
they bleed like crazy

1106
01:27:15,368 --> 01:27:16,637
and then they just stop.

1107
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:19,040
Is it?

1108
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:20,407
-Is it stopped?
-Mm-hmm.

1109
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,743
-It is?
-See?

1110
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:23,376
Is it?

1111
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,747
Trust me, my father
bled to death.

1112
01:27:27,982 --> 01:27:29,517
We should clean it up.

1113
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,918
It could still get infected.

1114
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,688
You wanna come with me?

1115
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:38,492
Okay.

1116
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:52,807
Thank you.

1117
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:55,977
We're nearly there.

1118
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:45,358
Hi, Lloyd.

1119
01:28:46,561 --> 01:28:47,695
This is Beau.

1120
01:28:48,162 --> 01:28:49,864
Hello.

1121
01:28:49,897 --> 01:28:51,866
He was in an accident.

1122
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:52,800
His mother just died,

1123
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:54,902
and his father died
before he was born.

This is me. Just a sec, Beau.

1128
01:29:22,663 --> 01:29:24,665
I have an extra sleeping bag
if you need one.

1129
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,535
This way, Beau.

Damn these crossroads!

1136
01:30:00,534 --> 01:30:01,969
How can one stake one's life

1137
01:30:02,003 --> 01:30:04,105
on a choice between
two unmarked paths?

1138
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,541
If one leads forward,

1139
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:10,111
must the other go backwards?

1140
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:14,882
- If it were a trap?
- Or this an opportunity?

1141
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:16,784
Or might they
both lead home,

1142
01:30:18,052 --> 01:30:20,688
where I can take
my rightful seat,

1143
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:22,590
and be lord
of my own possessions?

1144
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,029
They're rehearsing
for the preview.

1145
01:30:28,062 --> 01:30:29,664
Damn these crossroads!

1146
01:30:30,698 --> 01:30:31,832
There, let's not spoil it.

1147
01:30:39,607 --> 01:30:41,108
As great trumpets speak,

1148
01:30:41,142 --> 01:30:44,211
our poor hero
realizes too late.

1149
01:30:44,245 --> 01:30:45,947
But these
are funeral horns!

1150
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,114
Everyone!

1151
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:50,551
This is Beau.

1152
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:52,920
Hi, Beau!

1153
01:30:52,954 --> 01:30:54,155
He was in an accident

1154
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:56,257
and both his parents are dead.

1155
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,693
- No!
- Are you okay?

1156
01:30:58,726 --> 01:30:59,760
That's terrible.

1157
01:31:00,695 --> 01:31:02,229
What is this place?

1158
01:31:02,263 --> 01:31:05,066
We call ourselves
the Orphans of the Forest.

1159
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:06,867
That's right!

1160
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:09,003
Although many of our parents
simply abandoned us

1161
01:31:09,036 --> 01:31:10,838
without even bothering to die.

1162
01:31:10,871 --> 01:31:13,007
We're a traveling
theater company.

1163
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,675
We go from forest to forest,

1164
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:17,211
off the grid, making up homes
from whatever we find.

1165
01:31:17,244 --> 01:31:20,648
And then at
the end, we put on a big show!

1166
01:31:26,954 --> 01:31:28,089
I'm so sorry.

1167
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:30,157
Aw.

1168
01:31:33,227 --> 01:31:34,462
See him?

1169
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:38,566
That's Yesekov.

1170
01:31:38,599 --> 01:31:40,234
He's the man
who started all of this.

1171
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,071
Papa...

1172
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:49,744
It's time for the show!

1173
01:31:49,777 --> 01:31:51,979
Hi, there. Are you joining us?

1174
01:31:52,013 --> 01:31:53,581
What do you mean?

1175
01:31:53,614 --> 01:31:54,648
Do you want a costume?

1176
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:56,884
-Oh...
-We like to, uh,

1177
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,719
blur the line between
the audience and the players.

1178
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,322
Either of these?

1179
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:02,857
I like this color
with your eyes.

1180
01:32:03,624 --> 01:32:04,692
Or this one's fun...

1181
01:32:05,259 --> 01:32:07,161
Um...

1182
01:32:07,194 --> 01:32:09,296
-That one.
-That's my favorite too.

1183
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:10,664
Let's get changed.

1184
01:32:12,266 --> 01:32:13,834
I'm happy
you're joining, Beau.

1185
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,172

Fate has burned my house
to cinders

1199
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,892
and launched me into exile.

1200
01:33:48,129 --> 01:33:52,399
I once thought I knew despair,
and that I could master it...

1201
01:33:55,302 --> 01:33:57,404
but now that I know this pain,

1202
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:00,841
I can't fathom relief.

1203
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:07,181
When I reach out for answers,

1204
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:11,085
I grasp cold air.

1205
01:34:11,118 --> 01:34:17,958
O, with
my mother and father gone,

1206
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:21,262
I have lost my whole self!

1207
01:34:57,464 --> 01:34:59,200

1211
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:21,055

Do I venture forth...

1215
01:35:42,109 --> 01:35:43,410
or stay here?

1216
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:46,013
With what I know.

1217
01:36:07,602 --> 01:36:10,971
If I stay, I die.

1218
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:18,112
No. I must go.

1219
01:36:21,282 --> 01:36:23,150
What? Chains!

1220
01:36:24,519 --> 01:36:25,819

1222
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:16,036
Yes. Push forward.

1223
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:20,374

<i>You will learn a trade...</i>

<i>and eventually earn a living.</i>

1234
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:11,358
<i>You will know the pleasure</i>

<i>and build a house</i>
<i>with your own hands.</i>

1239
01:38:24,471 --> 01:38:26,340
<i>You will cultivate the land.</i>

1240
01:38:38,653 --> 01:38:40,254
<i>You will live off it.</i>

1241
01:38:43,123 --> 01:38:45,459
<i>You will come</i>
<i>to make new friends.</i>

1242
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:51,165
<i>One day,</i>
<i>you will meet a woman.</i>

1243
01:38:52,734 --> 01:38:55,169
<i>The story of your meeting</i>
<i>will change</i>

1244
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:57,337
<i>according to who tells it:</i>

1245
01:38:57,371 --> 01:38:59,006
<i>that you were lost</i>

1246
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:01,341
<i>and she helped you</i>
<i>find your way,</i>

1247
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:03,578
<i>or that she was off course</i>

1248
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:05,279
<i>and you guided her home.</i>

1249
01:39:08,215 --> 01:39:10,484
<i>She will see your fears,</i>

1250
01:39:10,518 --> 01:39:13,521
<i>and your pain, and your dreams,</i>

1251
01:39:13,555 --> 01:39:15,088
<i>and your potential...</i>

1252
01:39:17,759 --> 01:39:19,627
<i>and you will see hers.</i>

1253
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:25,600
<i>In finding your other half,</i>

1254
01:39:25,633 --> 01:39:28,435
<i>the gifts of your life</i>
<i>will multiply.</i>

1255
01:39:32,072 --> 01:39:35,242
<i>Sometimes, she will look like</i>
<i>a man to you.</i>

1256
01:39:38,412 --> 01:39:42,049
<i>She will become pregnant</i>
<i>because you have sex with her.</i>

1257
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,589
<i>You will have children.</i>
<i>Three sons.</i>

1258
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:51,559
<i>You will teach them</i>
<i>what you know,</i>

1259
01:39:51,593 --> 01:39:54,194
<i>and you will tell them</i>
<i>you love them every day.</i>

1260
01:39:55,763 --> 01:39:58,432
<i>They will grow</i>
<i>into handsome boys,</i>

1261
01:39:58,465 --> 01:40:03,638
<i>blessed with courage</i>
<i>and kindness and ambition.</i>

1262
01:40:03,671 --> 01:40:07,575
<i>You will share your feelings</i>
<i>of pride with your therapist.</i>

1263
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:09,376
<i>He will archive them.</i>

1264
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,549
<i>One day, an historic storm</i>

1265
01:40:14,582 --> 01:40:16,416
<i>will sweep through</i>
<i>your village...</i>

1266
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:18,586
<i>...and destroy your home.</i>

1267
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:25,058
<i>You will be carried away...</i>

1268
01:40:25,092 --> 01:40:26,426
<i>...by a great flood.</i>

1269
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:34,368
<i>You and your family</i>
<i>will be separated.</i>

1270
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:45,112
<i>And you will be deposited</i>
<i>in a strange country.</i>

1271
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,188
<i>You will look</i>
<i>for your family for days...</i>

1272
01:40:57,257 --> 01:40:58,392
<i>then weeks,</i>

1273
01:40:59,527 --> 01:41:00,728
<i>then months,</i>

1274
01:41:01,996 --> 01:41:05,165
<i>so many months that</i>
<i>you will come to lose count,</i>

1275
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:06,734
<i>but you will not find them.</i>

1276
01:41:07,735 --> 01:41:09,504
<i>You will try to find work</i>

1277
01:41:09,537 --> 01:41:11,873
<i>to support</i>
<i>your continuing search,</i>

1278
01:41:11,906 --> 01:41:14,842
<i>but no one</i>
<i>will speak your language.</i>

1279
01:41:14,876 --> 01:41:16,678
<i>You will be treated</i>
<i>like a criminal.</i>

1280
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:23,785
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>you will come upon a village</i>

1281
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:26,253
<i>wracked</i>
<i>by an inexplicable plague.</i>

1282
01:41:27,789 --> 01:41:31,793
<i>As you pass through,</i>
<i>a man, deranged by tragedy,</i>

1283
01:41:31,826 --> 01:41:35,395
<i>will identify you as the beast</i>
<i>who burned down his home</i>

1284
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:37,264
<i>and replaced</i>
<i>his children's feet</i>

1285
01:41:37,297 --> 01:41:38,432
<i>with their hands.</i>

1286
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:43,203
<i>You will try to argue</i>
<i>your innocence,</i>

1287
01:41:43,236 --> 01:41:45,540
<i>but this will only</i>
<i>make you sound more guilty.</i>

1288
01:41:47,909 --> 01:41:50,545
<i>You will wonder yourself</i>
<i>whether you are guilty.</i>

1289
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:03,858
<i>You will flee.</i>

1290
01:42:07,595 --> 01:42:09,463
<i>Mad with vengeance,</i>

1291
01:42:09,496 --> 01:42:12,265
<i>they will send an attack dog</i>
<i>to pursue you.</i>

1292
01:42:13,835 --> 01:42:16,403
<i>It will tear through the world</i>
<i>to find you.</i>

1293
01:42:18,372 --> 01:42:21,441
<i>You won't know this,</i>
<i>but you will sense it.</i>

1294
01:42:23,745 --> 01:42:25,780
<i>And you will keep</i>
<i>a detailed record</i>

1295
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:28,516
<i>of these impressions in a log.</i>

1296
01:42:28,549 --> 01:42:32,252
<i>And over time, this log</i>
<i>will become many logs.</i>

1297
01:42:34,254 --> 01:42:38,726
<i>Your adventures will continue</i>
<i>for years and years.</i>

1298
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,929
<i>You will learn to distinguish</i>
<i>birds by their call</i>

1299
01:42:41,963 --> 01:42:45,633
<i>and you will know every tree</i>
<i>and plant by its name.</i>

1300
01:42:46,968 --> 01:42:49,336
<i>Abandoning all comforts,</i>

1301
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:52,607
<i>you will condition your mind</i>
<i>to new ways of seeing.</i>

1302
01:42:54,008 --> 01:42:58,513
<i>You will experience</i>
<i>great highs and profound lows,</i>

1303
01:42:58,546 --> 01:43:00,548
<i>and you will look</i>
<i>for your family</i>

1304
01:43:00,581 --> 01:43:03,785
<i>until your life shrinks</i>
<i>and fades</i>

1305
01:43:03,818 --> 01:43:05,920
<i>into the dream of a ghost.</i>

1306
01:43:09,991 --> 01:43:12,794
<i>You will come to wonder</i>
<i>if they ever existed.</i>

1307
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:20,367
<i>Finally, when you are</i>
<i>old and frail,</i>

1308
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,335
<i>you will collapse</i>
<i>in exhaustion.</i>

1309
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,517
Oh, sweetheart...

1310
01:43:39,654 --> 01:43:40,988
Why are you crying?

1311
01:43:47,762 --> 01:43:51,231
Because I've searched
for my family

1312
01:43:52,365 --> 01:43:53,501
all my life,

1313
01:43:54,936 --> 01:43:56,838
to the end of my life,

1314
01:43:58,005 --> 01:43:59,807
and I'm still alone.

1315
01:44:02,043 --> 01:44:04,979
You should not be crying
for your misfortunes,

1316
01:44:05,012 --> 01:44:06,714
for your own sins.

1317
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:10,585
You also have been
searched for,

1318
01:44:10,618 --> 01:44:12,887
but you're so lost
in your own selfishness

1319
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,722
that no one
could ever find you.

1320
01:44:16,591 --> 01:44:17,725
Confess.

1321
01:44:18,893 --> 01:44:20,393
Before your peers.

1322
01:44:21,461 --> 01:44:22,764
But what did I do?

1323
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,667
You know.

1324
01:44:27,969 --> 01:44:29,302
Confess.

1325
01:44:40,081 --> 01:44:41,949
I've been a coward.

1326
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:44,585
My whole life.

1327
01:44:44,619 --> 01:44:46,687
<i>You will confess everything.</i>

1328
01:44:50,925 --> 01:44:52,894
<i>After which,</i>
<i>you will find the earth</i>

1329
01:44:52,927 --> 01:44:54,762
<i>replaced by good water.</i>

1330
01:44:59,734 --> 01:45:02,970
<i>Sleep will come untroubled.</i>

1331
01:45:07,074 --> 01:45:09,577
<i>To the sound</i>
<i>of distant trumpets,</i>

1332
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:12,547
<i>you will awake,</i>
<i>as if by a miracle,</i>

1333
01:45:14,414 --> 01:45:16,951
<i>at the foot</i>
<i>of your glittering village.</i>

1334
01:45:26,127 --> 01:45:28,563
<i>No one will recognize you,</i>

1335
01:45:28,596 --> 01:45:32,499
<i>but the smell of the air,</i>
<i>and the sounds of the insects,</i>

1336
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:33,968
<i>and the way the evening light</i>

1337
01:45:34,001 --> 01:45:36,403
<i>slashes itself</i>
<i>across the chimney</i>

1338
01:45:36,436 --> 01:45:38,471
<i>of a neighbor's old house,</i>

1339
01:45:38,506 --> 01:45:41,909
<i>will unloose in you</i>
<i>a torrent of vivid memories.</i>

1340
01:45:50,017 --> 01:45:52,954
<i>You will be invited</i>
<i>to a special play</i>

1341
01:45:52,987 --> 01:45:54,989
<i>being put on</i>
<i>in an outdoor theater</i>

1342
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:56,489
<i>just for that night.</i>

1343
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,328
<i>Despite your hunger,</i>

1344
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,731
<i>you will decide to spend</i>
<i>your last dollar on this.</i>

1345
01:46:07,068 --> 01:46:10,504
Over the last 40 years,
his memory had faltered

1346
01:46:10,538 --> 01:46:12,139
to the extent
that he couldn't remember

1347
01:46:12,173 --> 01:46:14,675
his own mother's face,

1348
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:17,111
but just by breathing
in the air,

1349
01:46:17,144 --> 01:46:19,614
he was seized
by the absolute certainty

1350
01:46:19,647 --> 01:46:22,016
that this was his village.

1351
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:24,952
Nobody remembered him,

1352
01:46:24,986 --> 01:46:26,654
and even though
all of his neighbors

1353
01:46:26,687 --> 01:46:29,657
had been replaced
by younger generations,

1354
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:31,926
he recognized everything,

1355
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:35,696
and somehow
he too felt recognized.

1356
01:46:36,764 --> 01:46:39,934
His home had waited for him,

1357
01:46:39,967 --> 01:46:43,871
just as loyally
as he had searched for it.

1358
01:46:43,905 --> 01:46:45,840
Even the sight
of the evening sun,

1359
01:46:45,873 --> 01:46:49,877
casting slashes of amber light
across a familiar chimney,

1360
01:46:49,911 --> 01:46:53,114
sent him reeling
into a flood of memories.

1361
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:57,518
What did our father do next?

1362
01:46:57,551 --> 01:46:58,920
And where was the village?

1363
01:46:58,953 --> 01:47:00,721
We only saw it as boys
and have no memories!

1364
01:47:00,755 --> 01:47:01,822
Please,

1365
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:03,624
-tell us how to find it.
-No, wait...

1366
01:47:03,658 --> 01:47:05,660
What did he do next?

1367
01:47:05,693 --> 01:47:08,996
He was delirious with hunger
and only had enough money

1368
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:12,099
for one bowl of soup,
but before he could spend it,

1369
01:47:12,133 --> 01:47:15,169
he was invited
to a special play.

1370
01:47:15,202 --> 01:47:16,771
It was already in progress,

1371
01:47:16,804 --> 01:47:19,507
but he felt compelled
to go in,

1372
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:21,208
so he spent his last dollar.

1373
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:25,212
Not long after sitting in,

1374
01:47:25,246 --> 01:47:27,682
he saw that
the details of the plot

1375
01:47:27,715 --> 01:47:29,850
were impossibly similar
to those

1376
01:47:30,284 --> 01:47:32,687
of his own life,

1377
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,589
and there were three young men
on the stage

1378
01:47:35,623 --> 01:47:38,259
who looked
remarkably like himself.

1379
01:47:38,292 --> 01:47:39,327
This is me!

1380
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,897
And he rose up, at once
exhilarated and terrified

1381
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:45,166
that it might not be true,
and he announced...

1382
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:47,101
This is my story!

1383
01:47:48,269 --> 01:47:51,839
And the three young men
immediately recognized the man

1384
01:47:51,872 --> 01:47:53,140
as their father.

1385
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:56,043
-Dad?
-No. It can't be.

1386
01:47:56,077 --> 01:47:57,912
My sons!

1387
01:48:02,683 --> 01:48:03,684
Dad...

1388
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:06,120
Dad... Dad...

1389
01:48:06,954 --> 01:48:08,589
Oh, oh, oh...

1390
01:48:08,622 --> 01:48:09,924
Oh, my God.

1391
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,293
-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

1392
01:48:12,326 --> 01:48:14,662
-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

1393
01:48:14,695 --> 01:48:16,530
You're my boys!

1394
01:48:16,564 --> 01:48:18,866
Oh, my beautiful, sweet boys!

1395
01:48:18,899 --> 01:48:21,535
Don't be afraid. I'm here.
Come here.

1396
01:48:22,203 --> 01:48:24,905
Come here. Oh...

1397
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:27,241
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

1398
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:28,976
Oh...

1399
01:48:30,111 --> 01:48:32,246
Where... Where have you been?

1400
01:48:34,982 --> 01:48:37,852
You... You were ripped
from me.

1401
01:48:37,885 --> 01:48:43,791
I've looked for you
for so long... so long.

1402
01:48:43,824 --> 01:48:47,695
Oh...

1403
01:48:47,728 --> 01:48:48,896
Where did you go?

1404
01:48:48,929 --> 01:48:50,131
And how are you?

1405
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:54,869
I made you. Oh, my loves.

1406
01:48:54,902 --> 01:48:58,639
Oh, my loves. Oh, my darlings.

1407
01:48:58,672 --> 01:48:59,707
Oh, my darlings.

1408
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:01,642
I missed you so much.

1409
01:49:01,675 --> 01:49:05,613
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

1410
01:49:05,646 --> 01:49:09,083
It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.

1411
01:49:09,884 --> 01:49:10,985
Oh, my loves.

1412
01:49:11,018 --> 01:49:12,286
This the end of things.

1413
01:49:13,721 --> 01:49:14,822
It's okay.

1414
01:49:17,892 --> 01:49:20,161
What about our mother?
Is she...

1415
01:49:21,328 --> 01:49:22,797
-What?
-Is she...

1416
01:49:23,898 --> 01:49:25,032
She's not with you?

1417
01:49:27,368 --> 01:49:28,769
She's not with you?

1418
01:49:28,803 --> 01:49:29,904
- Oh, God.
- We were...

1419
01:49:29,937 --> 01:49:31,772
We were raised as orphans.

1420
01:49:31,806 --> 01:49:32,973
Oh, no!

1421
01:49:33,908 --> 01:49:36,277
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1422
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:38,279
Where's Mom?

1423
01:49:38,312 --> 01:49:39,713
It's okay, my love.

1424
01:49:39,747 --> 01:49:41,348
- It's okay.
- Dad...

1425
01:49:43,184 --> 01:49:45,019
Mom...

1426
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:46,921
Is there...

1427
01:49:48,322 --> 01:49:51,692
Is there any other family?

1428
01:49:53,661 --> 01:49:54,862
Besides us?

1429
01:49:58,332 --> 01:49:59,934
You had a grandmother.

1430
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:02,136
Where is she?

1431
01:50:04,004 --> 01:50:05,005
Ah...

1432
01:50:06,373 --> 01:50:07,675
Her head.

1433
01:50:08,943 --> 01:50:10,211
And our grandfather?

1434
01:50:14,348 --> 01:50:15,749
How did he die?

1435
01:50:20,354 --> 01:50:22,890
He died
on our wedding night.

1436
01:50:25,059 --> 01:50:27,161
The same night
you were conceived.

1437
01:50:29,096 --> 01:50:33,200
He died the very instant
you were conceived.

1438
01:50:34,802 --> 01:50:35,803
How?

1439
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:39,773
By finishing.

1440
01:50:41,175 --> 01:50:42,843
Into me.

1441
01:50:45,346 --> 01:50:48,282
He had a heart murmur,
just like you.

1442
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:51,752
Did it hurt?

1443
01:50:53,487 --> 01:50:56,924
I'm sure it was excruciating.

1444
01:50:58,726 --> 01:51:00,661
It was the first time
we made love.

1445
01:51:02,763 --> 01:51:07,034
The first time either of us
made love, with anyone.

1446
01:51:10,371 --> 01:51:13,407
Your grandpa
and your great-grandpa

1447
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:15,743
died the same way.

1448
01:51:18,445 --> 01:51:20,247
But he thought
he might be different.

1449
01:51:22,349 --> 01:51:23,751
I'm just as guilty.

1450
01:51:25,819 --> 01:51:26,954
I urged him on.

1451
01:51:29,089 --> 01:51:30,691
I wanted a normal life.

1452
01:51:33,093 --> 01:51:34,461
I wanted a child.

1453
01:51:41,168 --> 01:51:44,205
He died on top of me.

1454
01:51:46,508 --> 01:51:47,875
Inside.

1455
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:56,217
I think about it,
I want to rip my ears off.

1456
01:51:59,019 --> 01:52:00,154
But then...

1457
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,392
But then, that same trauma...

1458
01:52:07,194 --> 01:52:10,364
which changed me so utterly...

1459
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:18,739
also resulted in
the greatest gift of my life.

1460
01:52:21,976 --> 01:52:27,281
I am so sorry for what
your daddy passed down to you.

1461
01:52:29,517 --> 01:52:32,219
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

1462
01:52:38,058 --> 01:52:39,226
Is that a lie?

1463
01:52:41,195 --> 01:52:42,296
No.

1464
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,769
Can...
Can that really happen?

1465
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:53,907
Yes.

1466
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:59,113
It's why I never...

1467
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:03,083
with anyone.

1468
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:06,987
Dad...

1469
01:53:08,355 --> 01:53:10,024
You've never been with anyone?

1470
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:21,435
Then...
Then how... did you have us?

1471
01:53:36,216 --> 01:53:37,217
Ah...

1472
01:53:40,421 --> 01:53:42,189
What should I do?

1473
01:53:42,222 --> 01:53:44,024
Which limb shall I strike off?

1474
01:53:44,058 --> 01:53:48,095
You might act yesterday
and it would be decades tardy.

1475
01:53:48,128 --> 01:53:50,064
Have I not given
all I have?

1476
01:53:50,097 --> 01:53:51,865
All you have?

1477
01:53:51,899 --> 01:53:53,901
You have given trifles.

1478
01:53:53,934 --> 01:53:56,538
You have sacrificed
nothing real.

1479
01:53:56,571 --> 01:53:59,239
I have been pinned down
by my promises!

1480
01:54:00,341 --> 01:54:02,142
I am not
the master of my life!

1481
01:54:03,611 --> 01:54:04,546
Are you okay?

1482
01:54:06,447 --> 01:54:08,982
- I am a mouse in a maze!
- A maze?

1483
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:11,018
I... I feel sick.

1484
01:54:12,353 --> 01:54:13,420
I know.

1485
01:54:19,126 --> 01:54:20,127
Try this.

1486
01:54:21,428 --> 01:54:22,530
It helps me.

1487
01:54:40,648 --> 01:54:41,649
Thank you.

1488
01:54:42,216 --> 01:54:43,217
Thank you.

1489
01:55:35,603 --> 01:55:36,604
Hello?

1490
01:55:38,573 --> 01:55:39,707
Can I help you?

1491
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:42,610
Do you recognize me?

1492
01:55:46,514 --> 01:55:47,615
I don't know.

1493
01:55:49,316 --> 01:55:50,451
When you were little...

1494
01:55:51,553 --> 01:55:52,554
What?

1495
01:55:54,054 --> 01:55:55,389
How did you come here?

1496
01:55:58,225 --> 01:55:59,527
I was chased.

1497
01:56:08,368 --> 01:56:10,237
Your father is alive.

1498
01:56:11,038 --> 01:56:12,072
What?

1499
01:56:12,105 --> 01:56:14,709
I knew him.
After you were born.

1500
01:56:16,076 --> 01:56:18,412
I worked for your mom.

1501
01:56:18,445 --> 01:56:21,181
Not before I was born.
He died before...

1502
01:56:21,215 --> 01:56:25,687
Serving your dad food,
cleaning up after him.

1503
01:56:28,823 --> 01:56:32,092
My parents were in debt
to your mom.

1504
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:34,629
What's that?

1505
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:37,297
What?

1506
01:56:39,333 --> 01:56:41,201
Who... Who are you?

1507
01:56:41,235 --> 01:56:42,537
It doesn't matter, right?

1508
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:45,573
-It does. It...
-No. It's just...

1509
01:56:45,607 --> 01:56:47,374
kidding. I...

1510
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:54,214
I'm so happy to see you.

1511
01:56:58,485 --> 01:57:00,187
Are you him?

1512
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:01,723
Wait.

1513
01:57:03,658 --> 01:57:04,692
Wait.

1514
01:57:04,726 --> 01:57:06,226
You okay, sweetheart?

1515
01:57:09,664 --> 01:57:11,498
Do my eyes deceive me?

1516
01:57:11,533 --> 01:57:13,501
What is this phantom I see?

1517
01:57:16,871 --> 01:57:18,506
Hello, fair stranger!

1518
01:57:22,877 --> 01:57:26,246
Ah, now you see,

1519
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,048
out of the shadows...

1520
01:57:32,854 --> 01:57:36,089
Get me down right now!
Get me down from here!

1521
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,831
- Get me down!
- Somebody help me!

1522
01:57:43,865 --> 01:57:46,366
Get me down from here!
Get me down!

1523
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,570
- I can't!
- I'm tied up. Hurry!

1524
01:57:50,437 --> 01:57:51,539
Beau!

1525
01:57:52,807 --> 01:57:54,474
-Dad?
-Run!

1526
01:59:11,586 --> 01:59:12,787
Am I hurting you?

1527
01:59:20,962 --> 01:59:22,864
Okay, let's go. Clothes off.

1528
01:59:25,733 --> 01:59:28,770
Come on. Enough now.

1529
01:59:30,303 --> 01:59:31,506
What did I say?

1530
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:33,508
Didn't I say I wasn't gonna do
this again with you tonight?

1531
01:59:36,678 --> 01:59:38,613
I'm about to feel hurt.

1532
01:59:38,646 --> 01:59:39,814
You're about
to really hurt me.

1533
01:59:41,683 --> 01:59:42,850
Where's Daddy?

1534
01:59:45,753 --> 01:59:46,821
Excuse me?

1535
01:59:51,358 --> 01:59:52,593
You know where Daddy is.

1536
01:59:53,928 --> 01:59:55,228
Daddy's dead.

1537
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:59,634
Are you trying to hurt me?

1538
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,436
I don't care! I want Daddy!

1539
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:07,809
You want Daddy, too?

1540
02:00:10,578 --> 02:00:13,246
Come on. You want it your way,
let's go!

1541
02:00:25,492 --> 02:00:26,794
Up you go!

1542
02:00:26,828 --> 02:00:29,396
-I can't.
-Oh, but of course you can!

1543
02:00:29,429 --> 02:00:30,732
You're big enough
to hurt Mommy,

1544
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:32,265
you're big enough for this!

1545
02:00:33,568 --> 02:00:35,435
-Nobody's allowed up there.
-Up!

1546
02:00:37,839 --> 02:00:39,874
- Do you wanna go up, too?
- No.

1547
02:00:40,742 --> 02:00:43,343
What is that? Are you nodding?

1548
02:00:47,414 --> 02:00:48,549
This is it!

1549
02:00:50,718 --> 02:00:52,687
We don't talk
about you anymore!

1550
02:00:53,888 --> 02:00:56,323
Get back in!

1551
02:03:13,594 --> 02:03:15,495
Excuse me, sir.

1552
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:18,599
Is the funeral
already happening?

1553
02:03:18,633 --> 02:03:21,068
Already over.
There's a video inside.

1554
02:04:05,746 --> 02:04:06,981
<i>Mona.</i>

1555
02:04:08,916 --> 02:04:10,084
<i>Mona Wassermann.</i>

1556
02:04:12,553 --> 02:04:15,089
<i>We're gathered here today</i>
<i>as a community,</i>

1557
02:04:15,122 --> 02:04:18,526
<i>bound together</i>
<i>by our love for Mona,</i>

1558
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:19,927
<i>and by a feeling of duty.</i>

1559
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,865
<i>The duty to mourn</i>
<i>Mona's passing,</i>

1560
02:04:24,899 --> 02:04:27,735
<i>but also to celebrate</i>
<i>Mona's life.</i>

1561
02:04:30,171 --> 02:04:33,774
<i>Mona, who was</i>
<i>petrified of squirrels.</i>

1562
02:04:35,977 --> 02:04:39,747
<i>Mona, who single-handedly</i>
<i>built a super-business</i>

1563
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:42,016
<i>beyond her wildest dreams.</i>

1564
02:04:44,585 --> 02:04:48,189
<i>Mona, who was</i>
<i>an endlessly dedicated wife</i>

1565
02:04:48,222 --> 02:04:50,558
<i>to her adoring husband,</i>

1566
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:51,726
<i>who passed away tragically</i>

1567
02:04:51,759 --> 02:04:54,095
<i>just as their life together</i>
<i>was blossoming.</i>

1568
02:04:55,963 --> 02:04:59,066
<i>And Mona,</i>
<i>who was a devoted mother</i>

1569
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:02,203
<i>to her sole surviving son,</i>
<i>Beau,</i>

1570
02:05:02,236 --> 02:05:04,605
<i>whom she loved so deeply,</i>

1571
02:05:04,638 --> 02:05:09,577
<i>and who has elected not to</i>
<i>be present with us today.</i>

1572
02:05:09,610 --> 02:05:14,081
<i>Mona loved Beau with a love</i>
<i>that could move mountains.</i>

1573
02:05:14,115 --> 02:05:15,416
<i>In fact, I suggest</i>
<i>when we leave,</i>

1574
02:05:15,449 --> 02:05:18,252
<i>we check on the mountains</i>
<i>to make sure they're okay.</i>

1575
02:05:55,623 --> 02:05:56,891
<i>What can you say?</i>

1576
02:05:57,892 --> 02:05:59,660
<i>I hope she knows that.</i>

1577
02:06:01,195 --> 02:06:02,863
<i>I wish I could tell her that.</i>

1578
02:06:03,831 --> 02:06:06,133
<i>That I... I did, I loved her.</i>

1579
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:08,903
<i>And it's in accordance</i>
<i>with her last wishes</i>

1580
02:06:08,936 --> 02:06:10,671
<i>that we now play this song.</i>

1581
02:06:11,172 --> 02:06:13,207
<i>Her favorite song.</i>

1582
02:06:20,848 --> 02:06:24,185
<i>♪ You sheltered me from harm</i>

1583
02:06:25,186 --> 02:06:31,759
<i>♪ Kept me warm, kept me warm</i>

1584
02:06:33,761 --> 02:06:36,630
<i>♪ You gave my life to me</i>

1585

02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:50,558
Hello?

1614
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:55,296
Hello!

1615
02:10:00,434 --> 02:10:01,536
Yoo-hoo!

1616
02:10:10,477 --> 02:10:12,079
Hello?

1617
02:10:21,455 --> 02:10:23,123
Hello?

1618
02:10:32,066 --> 02:10:33,067
Hi.

1619
02:10:34,569 --> 02:10:36,170
Uh, I'm sorry.

1620
02:10:38,138 --> 02:10:40,474
I thought it started at 8 p.m.

1621
02:10:49,651 --> 02:10:52,186
Okay, um, I brought flowers.

1622
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:53,987
I'll just leave them here,
I guess.

1623
02:10:57,991 --> 02:10:59,293
She also owes me money.

1624
02:11:00,427 --> 02:11:02,129
This certainly isn't the time,

1625
02:11:02,162 --> 02:11:04,098
and you're probably
not the person...

1626
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,475
Okay, um...

1627
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:21,915
I'll be leaving, then. I just
need to call another Uber.

1628
02:11:21,949 --> 02:11:24,218
I can wait for it...

1629
02:11:24,652 --> 02:11:25,919
I'm sorry again.

1630
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:10,397
Elaine?

1631
02:12:15,068 --> 02:12:16,136
It's me.

1632
02:12:22,276 --> 02:12:23,545
It's Beau.

1633
02:12:31,719 --> 02:12:33,721
Oh, my God.

1634
02:12:36,256 --> 02:12:37,391
Beau?

1635
02:12:39,527 --> 02:12:40,695
No.

1636
02:12:40,728 --> 02:12:42,963
Uh, it can't be.

1637
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:46,266
I can't believe it's you.

1638
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:50,370
Oh, my God!

1639
02:12:52,507 --> 02:12:55,175
I mean, of course it's you.
This is your mom.

1640
02:12:57,645 --> 02:12:59,012
I'm so sorry.

1641
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:01,248
For your loss.

1642
02:13:03,150 --> 02:13:04,351
What are you doing here?

1643
02:13:08,823 --> 02:13:12,694
I'm just trying to, you know,
uh, pay my respects. And...

1644
02:13:14,161 --> 02:13:15,697
I guess to give you
my condolences.

1645
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:18,031
Since you're actually here.
I'm...

1646
02:13:19,399 --> 02:13:20,568
so sorry.

1647
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:28,141
I can't believe it's you.

1648
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:33,213
I can't believe it's you.

1649
02:13:36,116 --> 02:13:37,317
Do I look different?

1650
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:39,787
You recognized me.

1651
02:13:40,588 --> 02:13:41,656
I'm old now.

1652
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:44,592
You're the same.

1653
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:48,161
No, I'm not.

1654
02:13:49,196 --> 02:13:50,264
You are.

1655
02:13:51,198 --> 02:13:52,634
Well, you're the same, too.

1656
02:13:52,667 --> 02:13:54,468
Except for your body
and your face.

1657
02:14:01,509 --> 02:14:02,744
You worked for her?

1658
02:14:06,881 --> 02:14:08,215
What do you mean?

1659
02:14:10,484 --> 02:14:12,219
Well, I did until last week.

1660
02:14:16,624 --> 02:14:19,561
I was actually just drowning
my sorrows before I came.

1661
02:14:19,594 --> 02:14:21,361
My breath's like pure wine.

1662
02:14:24,566 --> 02:14:25,800
"Until last week"?

1663
02:14:32,507 --> 02:14:34,074
I'm sorry for your loss.

1664
02:14:42,482 --> 02:14:43,651
I waited for you.

1665
02:14:50,692 --> 02:14:51,826
What do you mean?

1666
02:14:55,462 --> 02:14:56,496
Why?

1667
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:01,736
You told me to.

1668
02:15:04,606 --> 02:15:06,173
I even have it in writing.

1669
02:15:12,346 --> 02:15:13,548
I wanted you to.

1670
02:15:25,292 --> 02:15:28,295
Baby, baby, baby...

1671
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:40,240
Do you want to go inside?

1672
02:15:44,478 --> 02:15:45,813
Do you want me to leave?

1673
02:16:10,672 --> 02:16:11,773
Let's go inside.

1674
02:16:19,814 --> 02:16:20,915
Bedroom, where?

1675
02:16:27,522 --> 02:16:28,756
The dragon's lair!

1676
02:16:41,736 --> 02:16:43,437
Got any candles...?

1677
02:16:54,749 --> 02:16:56,450
Why don't you go
to the bathroom?

1678
02:16:56,483 --> 02:16:57,885
When you come back,
I'll be ready.

1679
02:17:27,447 --> 02:17:29,751
-You didn't get undressed.
-Yup.

1680
02:17:40,561 --> 02:17:43,030
Hi. Hi, sorry. Hi.

1681
02:17:46,333 --> 02:17:47,568
Huh. Mm.

1682
02:17:53,641 --> 02:17:55,643
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1683
02:17:57,678 --> 02:17:59,013
Are y... Are you?

1684
02:17:59,046 --> 02:18:00,548
You're so tense.

1685
02:18:00,581 --> 02:18:02,817
-Oh... I'm sorry.
-Relax.

1686
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:05,753
Okay. It's just because,
you know,

1687
02:18:05,787 --> 02:18:08,421
it's been, like,
kind of awhile.

1688
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:11,626
Yeah, me too.

1689
02:18:20,067 --> 02:18:21,903
I like that
you're not all macho.

1690
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:23,938
Thank you.

1691
02:18:25,773 --> 02:18:27,608
Take these off.

1692
02:18:27,642 --> 02:18:29,677
Okay, what I meant was that

1693
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:32,113
it's been
really kind of a while.

1694
02:18:32,146 --> 02:18:34,347
Well, it hasn't affected
your virility.

1695
02:18:34,381 --> 02:18:36,517
-What?
-You're crazy hard.

1696
02:18:36,551 --> 02:18:37,618
Really?

1697
02:18:47,995 --> 02:18:49,764
Oh...

1698
02:18:50,765 --> 02:18:51,833
Oh, my God.

1699
02:18:53,701 --> 02:18:55,503
-Is it... Is it on?
-Yeah.

1700
02:18:55,536 --> 02:18:57,605
You sure the condom
is on all the way?

1701
02:18:58,673 --> 02:18:59,674
Yeah?

1702
02:19:00,608 --> 02:19:02,442
Oh, my God.

1703
02:19:02,475 --> 02:19:04,912
- Are you really in?
- You feel so good.

1704
02:19:04,946 --> 02:19:06,113
Oh, no.

1705
02:19:06,147 --> 02:19:08,549
Oh, no!

1706
02:19:10,751 --> 02:19:11,752
Wait...

1707
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:15,656
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah...

1708
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:17,592
But wait.

1709
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:18,926
-I...
-Let's start it over.

1710
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,027
What?

1711
02:19:30,171 --> 02:19:31,772
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah.

1712
02:19:31,806 --> 02:19:33,574
Wait a second.

1713
02:19:33,608 --> 02:19:35,176
I... I... I can't...

1714
02:19:35,209 --> 02:19:37,078
I think it's gonna happen.

1715
02:19:37,111 --> 02:19:38,946
Wait! You gotta wait a second.

1716
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:41,782
Stop! Oh, stop! Stop!

1717
02:19:41,816 --> 02:19:44,118
Stop! Ahh! Oh! Oh, no!

1718
02:19:55,997 --> 02:19:58,532
Oh, my! My God.

1719
02:19:59,867 --> 02:20:00,868
God.

1720
02:20:03,037 --> 02:20:04,038
Oh...

1721
02:20:05,706 --> 02:20:07,842
I really felt that.

1722
02:20:07,875 --> 02:20:10,678
Oh, God, that was a lot.

1723
02:20:10,711 --> 02:20:12,179
You just blasted
through that bag.

1724
02:20:14,081 --> 02:20:16,017
Oh, my God.

1725
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:17,184
Oh, yeah.

1726
02:20:24,558 --> 02:20:26,060
I want to come too.

1727
02:20:26,093 --> 02:20:27,895
-I...
-Hold on.

1728
02:20:27,929 --> 02:20:30,231
Hold on. Hold on.

1729
02:20:30,264 --> 02:20:31,933
-Uh...
-Don't move.

1730
02:20:31,966 --> 02:20:33,701
Don't move.

1731
02:20:33,734 --> 02:20:36,737
Don't move. Okay?

1732
02:20:58,125 --> 02:21:00,561
Oh, my God!

1733
02:21:08,235 --> 02:21:09,837
Oh, my gosh.

1734
02:21:11,739 --> 02:21:13,574
Oh, my God.

1735
02:21:16,077 --> 02:21:18,245
I really thought
I was going to die.

1736
02:21:21,015 --> 02:21:23,117
My whole life.

1737
02:21:26,754 --> 02:21:27,955
Oh, thank you.

1738
02:21:28,823 --> 02:21:31,125
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1739
02:21:31,859 --> 02:21:33,060
Thank you.

1740
02:23:05,219 --> 02:23:07,755
No, please.
Continue as if I wasn't here.

1741
02:23:12,893 --> 02:23:14,228
What would be next?

1742
02:23:18,933 --> 02:23:20,000
No?

1743
02:23:24,038 --> 02:23:26,740
You don't look especially
overjoyed to see me, honey.

1744
02:23:28,275 --> 02:23:31,011
I was dead just a minute ago.
This is a miracle.

1745
02:24:27,268 --> 02:24:29,036
Get rid of this. Feed Harry.

1746
02:25:28,996 --> 02:25:30,130
She worked for you?

1747
02:25:33,834 --> 02:25:36,203
I sincerely doubt that,
sweetheart,

1748
02:25:36,237 --> 02:25:39,173
but if you're right, you can
let her know she's fired.

1749
02:25:51,352 --> 02:25:52,486
For how long?

1750
02:25:54,288 --> 02:25:57,958
How many years from...
from the beginning? From...

1751
02:25:57,992 --> 02:25:59,527
How is your head feeling?

1752
02:26:01,262 --> 02:26:03,364
It looks like you really
banged up your face.

1753
02:26:04,865 --> 02:26:06,333
You could have a concussion.

1754
02:26:08,469 --> 02:26:10,004
You don't feel disoriented?

1755
02:26:11,939 --> 02:26:13,107
You know where you are?

1756
02:26:17,378 --> 02:26:18,979
I'm in my house.

1757
02:26:19,013 --> 02:26:22,216
Actually, you're in my house,
sweetheart.

1758
02:26:22,249 --> 02:26:25,919
And my house is your house,
which it always will be.

1759
02:26:27,955 --> 02:26:30,558
But if you know where you are,

1760
02:26:30,592 --> 02:26:32,926
then you must also know
where you just were.

1761
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:34,962
And where you just did
what you just did,

1762
02:26:34,995 --> 02:26:37,064
which I saw every second of.

1763
02:26:39,066 --> 02:26:41,468
You didn't just wake up
suddenly and you were there.

1764
02:26:43,137 --> 02:26:44,572
You didn't just
get dropped in,

1765
02:26:44,606 --> 02:26:46,307
out of the blue,
to your surprise,

1766
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:48,075
your deceased mother's room,

1767
02:26:48,108 --> 02:26:50,110
only days after
what you believed

1768
02:26:50,144 --> 02:26:51,278
-was her death!
-I didn't.

1769
02:26:51,312 --> 02:26:52,614
You didn't just
get deposited there

1770
02:26:52,647 --> 02:26:53,748
-by accident!
-I didn't mean it.

1771
02:26:53,782 --> 02:26:56,183
-Yes, I know you didn't.
-No. I knew you weren't dead.

1772
02:27:04,124 --> 02:27:06,193
I saw with my own eyes

1773
02:27:06,226 --> 02:27:09,330
exactly what you knew
and what you didn't know.

1774
02:27:09,363 --> 02:27:11,131
You saw my body.

1775
02:27:15,336 --> 02:27:17,037
I saw the birthmark, Mom.

1776
02:27:19,907 --> 02:27:22,009
I know those were
Martha's hands.

1777
02:27:28,082 --> 02:27:29,216
That's right.

1778
02:27:33,621 --> 02:27:36,023
-Goodnight, baby.
-Goodnight, Martha.

1779
02:27:36,056 --> 02:27:39,093
And if I hear any noise,
I'll break back in

1780
02:27:39,126 --> 02:27:41,328
and I'll tickle you to death!

1781
02:27:44,965 --> 02:27:46,066
It's...

1782
02:27:47,669 --> 02:27:48,969
What...

1783
02:27:49,336 --> 02:27:50,437
How...

1784
02:27:51,438 --> 02:27:52,574
How you even...

1785
02:27:54,108 --> 02:27:55,510
Ki... H...

1786
02:27:55,543 --> 02:27:57,978
How can you do that to her?

1787
02:27:58,011 --> 02:27:59,313
"Do that to her"?

1788
02:28:00,515 --> 02:28:02,182
Baby, I would never
do anything

1789
02:28:02,216 --> 02:28:03,917
to the loyal
and devoted housekeeper

1790
02:28:03,951 --> 02:28:06,621
who gave me 37 years
of unconditional service.

1791
02:28:08,088 --> 02:28:09,223
She volunteered.

1792
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,662
-No, she didn't.
-Yes.

1793
02:28:14,696 --> 02:28:16,063
-No, she didn't!
-She did.

1794
02:28:16,096 --> 02:28:17,030
No, she didn't!

1795
02:28:17,064 --> 02:28:20,434
I couldn't restrain her
from volunteering.

1796
02:28:28,710 --> 02:28:30,043
For how much?

1797
02:28:38,419 --> 02:28:42,956
Enough that every member
of her extended family

1798
02:28:42,990 --> 02:28:45,025
quit their job
on the same day,

1799
02:28:46,093 --> 02:28:48,228
and won't ever need
to work again.

1800
02:28:49,697 --> 02:28:51,231
And you know something else?

1801
02:28:52,199 --> 02:28:53,535
It was worth every penny.

1802
02:28:59,206 --> 02:29:00,642
Because now I know.

1803
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:05,345
-What do you know?
-Everything.

1804
02:29:09,283 --> 02:29:11,385
You don't know anything.

1805
02:29:11,418 --> 02:29:12,720
Oh, do you think so, Beau?

1806
02:29:14,455 --> 02:29:16,056
Do you really think so?

1807
02:29:17,759 --> 02:29:19,627
Do you also think
I didn't know

1808
02:29:19,661 --> 02:29:22,162
when you called
to give me the big bad news

1809
02:29:22,196 --> 02:29:23,665
about your fictitious keys

1810
02:29:23,698 --> 02:29:26,601
being stolen
from your imaginary door?

1811
02:29:26,634 --> 02:29:28,770
-My key... they were stolen.
-You think a mother

1812
02:29:28,803 --> 02:29:32,239
can even help but see through
her son's blatant lies

1813
02:29:32,272 --> 02:29:35,375
and falsehoods
and endless schemes?

1814
02:29:35,409 --> 02:29:36,845
You think
this is any different

1815
02:29:36,878 --> 02:29:39,647
<i>from the time you gave me the</i>
<i>exact same CD for my birthday</i>

1816
02:29:39,681 --> 02:29:40,949
<i>that you gave me</i>
<i>the year before</i>

1817
02:29:40,981 --> 02:29:44,519
<i>and which you also gave your</i>
<i>fucking high-school counselor?</i>

1818
02:29:45,787 --> 02:29:48,055
Or when you bought me
that kitchen set

1819
02:29:48,088 --> 02:29:52,192
the very week after
I publicly swore off cooking!

1820
02:29:53,528 --> 02:29:55,095
Even when you were a baby,

1821
02:29:55,128 --> 02:29:58,666
you rejected me
and refused to breastfeed,

1822
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:01,335
while every other smug cunt
on the street

1823
02:30:01,368 --> 02:30:04,471
had happy, docile babies
sucking their tits dry!

1824
02:30:05,673 --> 02:30:07,341
Do you think
I hear the absurd story

1825
02:30:07,374 --> 02:30:10,645
of you missing your flight and
that I don't absolutely know,

1826
02:30:10,678 --> 02:30:12,547
that I have any hint
of a doubt,

1827
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:14,348
that you never,
from the very start,

1828
02:30:14,381 --> 02:30:16,784
intended to make that flight?

1829
02:30:16,818 --> 02:30:19,453
The true surprise, the shock,

1830
02:30:19,486 --> 02:30:21,321
would have been
you actually coming!

1831
02:30:21,355 --> 02:30:23,190
Now, that would
have spun my head like a top!

1832
02:30:23,223 --> 02:30:24,191
I wouldn't have known
what to do!

1833
02:30:24,224 --> 02:30:26,460
I'd have thrown myself
flopping on the floor,

1834
02:30:26,493 --> 02:30:29,129
begging God's forgiveness
for ever having doubted you,

1835
02:30:29,162 --> 02:30:33,100
but still I would have been
struck stupid with disbelief!

1836
02:30:37,672 --> 02:30:39,273
What, you walking away?

1837
02:30:44,411 --> 02:30:45,580
Where you going?

1838
02:30:50,652 --> 02:30:52,319
What's behind the door, Beau?

1839
02:30:56,290 --> 02:30:58,425
Where on earth
are you gonna go?

1840
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:07,702
You've always acted like some
dutiful, doting little boy,

1841
02:31:07,735 --> 02:31:10,437
as if it's throwing me
off some scent.

1842
02:31:11,506 --> 02:31:13,808
None of it's ever been real.

1843
02:31:13,841 --> 02:31:16,644
You spent your whole life
going around,

1844
02:31:16,678 --> 02:31:19,279
asking every half-wit
you could find,

1845
02:31:19,313 --> 02:31:21,114
"If I do this,
can I avoid this,

1846
02:31:21,148 --> 02:31:22,215
"or will that happen?"

1847
02:31:22,249 --> 02:31:26,153
As if you were born without
the mechanism to choose.

1848
02:31:26,186 --> 02:31:28,690
You let it all resolve itself
in the absence of you!

1849
02:31:28,723 --> 02:31:30,390
You make everyone
do it for you!

1850
02:31:30,424 --> 02:31:32,359
You think
that makes you innocent?

1851
02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:39,232
My own mother
wouldn't even touch me.

1852
02:31:40,602 --> 02:31:43,303
Not if it was simply to
stamp me out if I was on fire!

1853
02:31:44,839 --> 02:31:46,808
I wasn't worthy of her love.

1854
02:31:46,841 --> 02:31:49,309
I hadn't earned it!
And I never earned it.

1855
02:31:49,343 --> 02:31:50,612
No matter what I did,

1856
02:31:50,645 --> 02:31:53,848
no matter how much
of my deepest real self

1857
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:56,651
I denied and buried,

1858
02:31:56,684 --> 02:31:58,820
and smothered
until it was dead.

1859
02:31:58,853 --> 02:32:00,253
None of it mattered.

1860
02:32:01,656 --> 02:32:04,124
She blamed me for everything
her mother did to her.

1861
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:07,829
When I had you,

1862
02:32:07,862 --> 02:32:09,697
I promised,
"I will never do that to him.

1863
02:32:11,599 --> 02:32:13,735
"I will give him
all the love I have."

1864
02:32:16,537 --> 02:32:18,472
You know what I tell people

1865
02:32:18,506 --> 02:32:20,340
when they ask me
how my son is doing?

1866
02:32:22,275 --> 02:32:23,778
I say, "Your guess
is as good as mine."

1867
02:32:29,216 --> 02:32:30,718
How I wish that were true.

1868
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:35,623
<i>Tell</i>
<i>me more about that period.</i>

1869
02:32:40,394 --> 02:32:41,495
<i>Well...</i>

1870
02:32:42,930 --> 02:32:46,199
<i>When I was just starting</i>
<i>to like my own stuff</i>

1871
02:32:46,233 --> 02:32:47,902
<i>and do my own things,</i>

1872
02:32:47,935 --> 02:32:50,470
<i>she'd take all those changes</i>
<i>very personally,</i>

1873
02:32:50,505 --> 02:32:53,373
<i>and get very mad or sad</i>

1874
02:32:53,407 --> 02:32:56,243
<i>and make me feel bad</i>
<i>about it until I stopped.</i>

1875
02:32:59,947 --> 02:33:02,583
<i>So, through</i>
<i>the weaning process,</i>

1876
02:33:02,617 --> 02:33:04,886
<i>she took your displays</i>
<i>of autonomy</i>

1877
02:33:04,919 --> 02:33:06,420
<i>as a betrayal.</i>

1878
02:33:07,555 --> 02:33:08,656
<i>Exactly.</i>

1879
02:33:11,458 --> 02:33:12,560
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1880
02:33:14,896 --> 02:33:17,297
<i>Can you</i>
<i>give me an example?</i>

1881
02:33:17,330 --> 02:33:19,600
<i>Well, like, she would</i>
<i>give me lots of love...</i>

1882
02:33:19,634 --> 02:33:22,003
Oh, I gave you lots of love!
I'm sorry!

1883
02:33:22,036 --> 02:33:23,838
...b <i>ut if I didn't</i>
<i>give it back to her</i>

1884
02:33:23,871 --> 02:33:24,906
<i>in the exact same way,</i>

1885
02:33:24,939 --> 02:33:27,008
<i>she saw it as</i>
<i>me being not thankful</i>

1886
02:33:27,041 --> 02:33:30,611
<i>and, like, trying to hurt her.</i>

1887
02:33:30,645 --> 02:33:32,613
<i>So the love</i>
<i>was conditional?</i>

1888
02:33:33,014 --> 02:33:34,214
<i>Yes.</i>

1889
02:33:34,247 --> 02:33:37,417
<i>Ah. This is</i>
<i>very good for you, Beau.</i>

1890
02:33:38,485 --> 02:33:39,587
Over 300 sessions,

1891
02:33:39,620 --> 02:33:42,690
and that was about as
flattering to me as they get.

1892
02:33:42,724 --> 02:33:45,258
Which one was my favorite,
Jeremy?

1893
02:33:45,292 --> 02:33:47,494
October 3, 2018.

1894
02:33:47,528 --> 02:33:49,329
How could you do...

1895
02:33:49,731 --> 02:33:50,898
How could you...

1896
02:33:52,499 --> 02:33:54,234
How could you do this to me?

1897
02:33:56,738 --> 02:33:59,707
<i>I've been</i>
<i>having it since I was little.</i>

1898
02:34:00,641 --> 02:34:02,242
<i>Where I'm a little boy,</i>

1899
02:34:02,275 --> 02:34:06,681
<i>probably the same age</i> as <i>when</i>
<i>I started having the dream...</i>

1900
02:34:06,714 --> 02:34:09,617
<i>and there's another me,</i>
<i>who's identical,</i>

1901
02:34:10,885 --> 02:34:13,420
<i>but he's braver,</i>

1902
02:34:13,453 --> 02:34:15,790
<i>and he asks her</i>
<i>about my father</i>

1903
02:34:15,823 --> 02:34:17,959
<i>because I'm too scared.</i>

1904
02:34:17,992 --> 02:34:23,865
<i>And then she sends him away</i>
<i>and locks him up. Upstairs.</i>

1905
02:34:23,898 --> 02:34:25,233
<i>And she never</i>
<i>talks about him again.</i>

1906
02:34:27,969 --> 02:34:30,772
<i>What is it you want</i>
<i>to know about your father?</i>

1907
02:34:30,805 --> 02:34:33,775
<i>If you weren't afraid, if</i>
<i>there were no consequences...</i>

1908
02:34:33,808 --> 02:34:35,475
- I want to know the truth.
<i>- ...what would you</i>

1909
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:36,544
<i>ask your mom?</i>

1910
02:34:37,612 --> 02:34:38,746
<i>I'd ask her...</i>

1911
02:34:40,480 --> 02:34:42,884
- To tell me the truth!
<i>- I don't know...</i>

1912
02:34:42,917 --> 02:34:45,620
<i>Do you feel</i>
<i>she didn't tell you the truth?</i>

1913
02:34:45,653 --> 02:34:46,721
- Yes!
<i>- Um...</i>

1914
02:34:47,522 --> 02:34:49,322
<i>-I don't know.</i>
-Yes!

1915
02:34:49,356 --> 02:34:50,423
- 'Cause I...
<i>- But I think</i>

1916
02:34:50,457 --> 02:34:51,726
- <i>I'm too afraid to believe it.</i>
-I know now.

1917
02:34:51,759 --> 02:34:52,860
I know the truth. I...

1918
02:34:54,629 --> 02:34:58,533
I met my father. I met the man
in the woods, and I know.

1919
02:34:58,566 --> 02:35:00,300
Why did you lie to me?

1920
02:35:02,503 --> 02:35:04,071
Do you want the truth now?

1921
02:35:04,105 --> 02:35:05,338
Yes!

1922
02:35:13,948 --> 02:35:15,315
Follow me.

1923
02:35:37,138 --> 02:35:39,006
- Up there?
- That's right.

1924
02:35:40,775 --> 02:35:41,976
Nobody's allowed
up there.

1925
02:35:43,811 --> 02:35:45,780
Some things are
for your protection, Beau,

1926
02:35:45,813 --> 02:35:47,982
and I want you to remember
that I kept this from you!

1927
02:35:51,919 --> 02:35:53,020
I don't wanna
go up there now.

1928
02:35:53,054 --> 02:35:54,555
-I don't wanna...
-No,

1929
02:35:54,589 --> 02:35:56,691
you want the truth,
and I think you deserve it.

1930
02:35:58,826 --> 02:36:00,728
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll be right behind you.

1931
02:36:00,761 --> 02:36:02,063
No. I don't wanna
go up there, Mom.

1932
02:36:02,096 --> 02:36:04,364
I'll be right behind you.
Don't worry.

1933
02:36:05,132 --> 02:36:06,934
Up you go.

1934
02:36:06,968 --> 02:36:09,070
Don't worry,
I'll be right behind you.

1935
02:36:09,103 --> 02:36:11,471
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Up you go.

1936
02:36:13,007 --> 02:36:15,475
-This is just like my dream.
-I'm right behind you.

1937
02:36:16,811 --> 02:36:19,479
-I'm right behind you.
-Oh... Oh, God.

1938
02:36:19,881 --> 02:36:20,915
Oh...

1939
02:36:22,850 --> 02:36:25,553
Oh, this is exactly
like my dream!

1940
02:36:25,586 --> 02:36:27,420
Don't you get it,
you stupid idiot?

1941
02:36:27,454 --> 02:36:30,157
That wasn't a dream,
that was a memory!

1942
02:36:30,191 --> 02:36:31,959
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1943
02:36:31,993 --> 02:36:33,728
Mommy, wait!

1944
02:36:53,014 --> 02:36:55,983
Oh... Oh... No.

1945
02:36:56,017 --> 02:36:58,019
Come on...

1946
02:37:18,572 --> 02:37:19,573
No...

1947
02:37:23,811 --> 02:37:25,146
Beau?

1948
02:37:28,883 --> 02:37:32,053
My beautiful boy.

1949
02:37:32,086 --> 02:37:35,056
Oh, Beau, don't be afraid.

1950
02:38:20,801 --> 02:38:23,871
No!

1951
02:38:46,927 --> 02:38:50,297
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

1952
02:38:50,331 --> 02:38:53,567
Baby, sweetheart.

1953
02:38:53,601 --> 02:38:56,003
Ooh, sweetheart.

1954
02:38:56,037 --> 02:38:57,805
I didn't want you to know.

1955
02:38:59,273 --> 02:39:01,542
Do you see now why I lied?

1956
02:39:02,209 --> 02:39:03,210
Beau.

1957
02:39:03,944 --> 02:39:04,945
Beau!

1958
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:07,681
That was your father.

1959
02:39:08,816 --> 02:39:12,186
Oh, Mom! Oh, Mom!

1960
02:39:12,219 --> 02:39:15,056
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1961
02:39:15,089 --> 02:39:17,825
I know I've been a bad son.
I'll be a good son.

1962
02:39:17,858 --> 02:39:19,193
Please! I'm sorry.

1963
02:39:19,226 --> 02:39:21,128
I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

1964
02:39:21,162 --> 02:39:22,663
I'll make it up to you.

1965
02:39:22,696 --> 02:39:24,932
Please, please. Please!

1966
02:39:24,965 --> 02:39:26,934
Please, I'm sorry.

1967
02:39:26,967 --> 02:39:28,269
You selfish little boy!

1968
02:39:28,302 --> 02:39:30,237
- I'm sorry...
- What are you crying about?

1969
02:39:30,271 --> 02:39:32,073
Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

1970
02:39:32,106 --> 02:39:33,908
to bring you into this world?

1971
02:39:33,941 --> 02:39:35,042
Stand up!

1972
02:39:40,848 --> 02:39:42,616
You cry now?

1973
02:39:42,650 --> 02:39:44,985
You need a mother now?

1974
02:39:45,019 --> 02:39:46,954
Ever since you clawed
your way out of me,

1975
02:39:46,987 --> 02:39:49,723
I've had to dig down deep
to my very bottom

1976
02:39:49,757 --> 02:39:51,158
and squeeze
the love out of myself,

1977
02:39:51,192 --> 02:39:53,928
but still I gave it to you.

1978
02:39:53,961 --> 02:39:57,231
I've given you
my whole fucking life!

1979
02:39:57,264 --> 02:40:00,034
Which you took,
and you took, and you took,

1980
02:40:00,067 --> 02:40:02,970
and I squeezed myself empty!

1981
02:40:03,938 --> 02:40:06,240
I gave you everything!

1982
02:40:06,273 --> 02:40:09,643
And what do I get back?
What do I have?

1983
02:40:09,677 --> 02:40:12,947
Insults! And empty promises!

1984
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:16,851
You promised to never hurt me.
Do you even remember that one?

1985
02:40:16,884 --> 02:40:19,720
You promised it
a hundred fucking times!

1986
02:40:19,753 --> 02:40:22,056
You swore on your own life!

1987
02:40:22,089 --> 02:40:24,225
But your promises
are nothing but shit!

1988
02:40:26,193 --> 02:40:28,662
I've been ground down
to nothing

1989
02:40:28,696 --> 02:40:30,831
by love and panic and worry.

1990
02:40:30,865 --> 02:40:33,167
Is my baby hungry?
Is he healthy?

1991
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,003
Is he scared enough?
Of the world?

1992
02:40:37,037 --> 02:40:38,906
And the fruit
of all this anguish?

1993
02:40:39,273 --> 02:40:40,708
Is grief!

1994
02:40:42,243 --> 02:40:43,410
And hatred!

1995
02:40:48,282 --> 02:40:49,984
Yes. Yes.

1996
02:40:50,017 --> 02:40:51,752
Hatred. I do.

1997
02:40:52,319 --> 02:40:53,387
I do!

1998
02:40:54,088 --> 02:40:55,089
I hate...

1999
02:41:19,246 --> 02:41:20,948
Mommy?

2000
02:41:20,981 --> 02:41:23,250
Are you okay? You...

2001
02:41:23,284 --> 02:41:24,818
You can breathe.
Can you breathe?

2002
02:41:24,852 --> 02:41:25,986
Can you breathe?

2003
02:41:27,021 --> 02:41:28,822
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

2004
02:41:28,856 --> 02:41:30,391
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

2005
02:41:31,792 --> 02:41:33,427
Are you okay? Are you okay?

2006
02:45:30,330 --> 02:45:31,733
<i>Beau Isaac Wassermann.</i>

2007
02:45:31,766 --> 02:45:35,035
<i>Born May 10th, 1975.</i>

2008
02:45:49,416 --> 02:45:50,585
Proceed.

2009
02:45:52,152 --> 02:45:56,123
We are gathered now
to assess the extent...

2010
02:45:58,058 --> 02:45:59,727
of the subject's guilt.

2011
02:46:03,197 --> 02:46:08,202
To begin with, a seemingly
innocuous tradition.

2012
02:46:10,738 --> 02:46:13,474
Every Monday before
his weekly appointment

2013
02:46:13,508 --> 02:46:15,309
to scapegoat his mother,

2014
02:46:15,342 --> 02:46:19,514
the subject would visit his
local pond to feed the ducks.

2015
02:46:19,547 --> 02:46:22,282
Just as he never missed
an opportunity

2016
02:46:22,316 --> 02:46:24,586
to feed his therapist's fish.

2017
02:46:25,452 --> 02:46:26,621
Very nice.

2018
02:46:27,822 --> 02:46:29,323
Very nice.

2019
02:46:30,090 --> 02:46:32,326
But what happens

2020
02:46:32,359 --> 02:46:37,197
when he meets a human beggar
that very night?

2021
02:46:40,133 --> 02:46:42,336
Now, one can see

2022
02:46:42,369 --> 02:46:44,204
that the subject
will go out of his way

2023
02:46:44,238 --> 02:46:46,373
to feed a bird or fish,

2024
02:46:46,406 --> 02:46:48,375
but not to support

2025
02:46:48,408 --> 02:46:51,713
a suffering member
of his own species.

2026
02:46:51,746 --> 02:46:52,814
Objection!

2027
02:46:52,847 --> 02:46:55,550
Violent street crimes
were everywhere on the news

2028
02:46:55,583 --> 02:46:59,286
and everyone was advised
to avoid strangers!

2029
02:46:59,319 --> 02:47:01,689
This is nothing new!

2030
02:47:01,723 --> 02:47:04,759
The subject
has thoughts every day

2031
02:47:04,792 --> 02:47:07,629
around relieving the suffering
of those less fortunate!

2032
02:47:07,662 --> 02:47:09,162
By all indications,

2033
02:47:09,196 --> 02:47:12,099
he has a healthy,
functioning conscience!

2034
02:47:12,132 --> 02:47:14,569
He just chose to ignore it!

2035
02:47:15,670 --> 02:47:17,371
Consider
the following episode.

2036
02:47:18,438 --> 02:47:20,708
Day 49 of his ninth year.

2037
02:47:20,742 --> 02:47:22,544
He goes shopping
with his mother.

2038
02:47:23,511 --> 02:47:25,245
At one point, she lost him,

2039
02:47:26,246 --> 02:47:28,048
or so she thought.

2040
02:47:28,783 --> 02:47:31,485
Fearing the worst, she panics.

2041
02:47:31,519 --> 02:47:33,086
She searches the building.

2042
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:36,724
She cries out for the boy,
who was in fact

2043
02:47:36,758 --> 02:47:39,226
hiding behind a corner,

2044
02:47:39,259 --> 02:47:41,261
watching the whole thing.

2045
02:47:41,295 --> 02:47:43,665
My client was genuinely lost.

2046
02:47:43,698 --> 02:47:45,667
It was upon
finding his mother,

2047
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:48,836
seeing her frantic state,
that he hesitated

2048
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:50,572
for fear of punishment!

2049
02:47:50,605 --> 02:47:52,540
It was
in this frantic state of mind

2050
02:47:52,574 --> 02:47:55,543
that his mother
tripped and fell,

2051
02:47:55,577 --> 02:47:59,079
tearing ligaments in her knee
and badly harming her ankle.

2052
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:02,282
And still

2053
02:48:02,316 --> 02:48:04,284
the subject did not intervene!

2054
02:48:04,318 --> 02:48:06,521
He was afraid!

2055
02:48:06,554 --> 02:48:09,557
Consider now
the subject at age 15,

2056
02:48:10,424 --> 02:48:13,160
day 210,

2057
02:48:13,193 --> 02:48:17,164
finding himself in the rare
company of other boys.

2058
02:48:17,197 --> 02:48:23,236
The subject, hoping to impress
his horrendous new friends,

2059
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:25,138
invites them into his home,

2060
02:48:25,172 --> 02:48:28,375
while his mother
is out buying him...

2061
02:48:28,408 --> 02:48:31,613
...gifts for his birthday.

2062
02:48:31,646 --> 02:48:35,482
He lets them
into her private bathroom,

2063
02:48:35,516 --> 02:48:39,621
and allows them to rifle
through her dirty laundry,

2064
02:48:39,654 --> 02:48:45,560
and inspect and ultimately
steal her undergarments.

2065
02:48:45,593 --> 02:48:47,862
Oh, God. Oh, God.

2066
02:48:47,895 --> 02:48:49,897
They pressured me!
They pressured me!

2067
02:48:49,931 --> 02:48:51,198
They pressured him!

2068
02:48:51,231 --> 02:48:52,432
What? What are you doing?

2069
02:48:53,233 --> 02:48:55,603
- What?
- No. No!

2070
02:48:55,637 --> 02:48:57,304
No!

2071
02:48:57,337 --> 02:49:00,407
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

2072
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:03,745
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2073
02:49:03,778 --> 02:49:06,681
Even his supposed acts
of thoughtfulness

2074
02:49:06,714 --> 02:49:09,449
are emblematic
of a greater hypocrisy.

2075
02:49:11,619 --> 02:49:13,487
Take this very week.

2076
02:49:13,521 --> 02:49:16,791
The subject asked Grace
and Roger to drive him home

2077
02:49:16,824 --> 02:49:19,259
so that he might
bury his mother

2078
02:49:19,292 --> 02:49:21,194
and commence proper mourning.

2079
02:49:21,228 --> 02:49:24,264
Roger offered the option

2080
02:49:24,866 --> 02:49:26,734
of driving home tonight

2081
02:49:26,768 --> 02:49:28,770
if the offer
of driving tomorrow

2082
02:49:28,803 --> 02:49:30,772
wasn't soon enough.

2083
02:49:30,805 --> 02:49:35,442
And Beau chose
to drive home tomorrow,

2084
02:49:35,475 --> 02:49:36,911
further postponing a trip

2085
02:49:36,944 --> 02:49:40,447
that had already been
outrageously delayed!

2086
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:43,618
And if one examines
the expression on his face

2087
02:49:43,651 --> 02:49:45,753
when Roger made
this challenge,

2088
02:49:46,821 --> 02:49:48,790
one can only conclude

2089
02:49:48,823 --> 02:49:52,459
that the subject was panicked
at the idea of returning home.

2090
02:49:53,528 --> 02:49:55,395
I didn't want to put him out!

2091
02:49:55,429 --> 02:49:58,331
I... He had surgeries!

2092
02:50:01,401 --> 02:50:04,739
I cried!
When I was beside the coffin!

2093
02:50:04,772 --> 02:50:07,274
When I was told the news!

2094
02:50:07,307 --> 02:50:10,511
I... I... I cried for hours!

2095
02:50:10,545 --> 02:50:12,513
Continuing
to bear this in mind,

2096
02:50:13,715 --> 02:50:18,452
I ask you
to consider yesterday.

2097
02:50:18,485 --> 02:50:22,389
Not three hours after meeting
a knocked up dimwit

2098
02:50:22,422 --> 02:50:24,424
who made clumsy eyes at him,

2099
02:50:24,458 --> 02:50:28,261
did he gift her
with a tributary gift

2100
02:50:28,295 --> 02:50:32,499
intended for no one less than
his recently deceased mother.

2101
02:50:33,534 --> 02:50:35,402
Now, when the pregnant slut

2102
02:50:35,435 --> 02:50:38,405
offered to return
the special gift,

2103
02:50:38,438 --> 02:50:42,476
did he insist that
this total stranger keep...

2104
02:50:59,727 --> 02:51:00,728
Oh!

2105
02:51:01,495 --> 02:51:03,330
