1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,760
<i>Are you sitting quite comfortably?</i>

2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>Then I'll begin.</i>

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,160
<i>And the Home Service
will be on the air at 6:45,</i>

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
<i>with a market report for farmers.</i>

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>No, no, I'm the treasurer
of the Picnic Committee.</i>

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,080
<i>The treasurer?</i>

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,600
<i>Answers, please.
Not to me, but to our producer.</i>

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,560
<i>Cheerio! See you next week!</i>

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, James. Straight to bed.

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,440
- Good night, Mum.
- Good night, James. Sleep tight!

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
Off with the lights now, please.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
It's 9:00 at night
and the dull dudes on the planet

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,040
are sitting in their slippers
sipping their sherries,

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,000
but the people who love to rock and to roll

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,360
are ready to ride
the rock 'n' roller-coaster once more.

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,000
You are listening to Radio Rock and I'm
the Count, and I'm counting on you,

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,240
as we count down to ecstasy
and rock all day and all of the night.

18
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
- How much longer?
- No time at all. There she is.

19
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Where she is?

20
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,320
There she is.

21
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,680
- I'm here to see Quentin.
- Come, come.

22
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
Enter.

23
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,800
- Carl?
- Yes.

24
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,640
My favourite godson.

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,320
- Have we met before?
- I don't think so.

26
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
No. There was a lost decade,
so I always have to check.

27
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
- How's your mum?
- She's fine.

28
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Not over-fond of me at the moment.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
She's a very attractive woman.

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,440
- Well, I...
- No, seriously.

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,160
I mean, to you, she's your mum,
but to people of my age,

32
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,520
she's a sexual legend.

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
So...

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,600
Expelled?

35
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,080
- That's right.
- What for?

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,080
I suppose smoking was the clincher.

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
Drugs or cigarettes?

38
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,640
Well, both.

39
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
Well done.

40
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
Proud of you.

41
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,560
So your mum sent you here in the hope that
a little bracing sea air would sort you out?

42
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,480
- Something like that.
- Spectacular mistake.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
But, if you don't drown, we can at least help
you to give up smoking and drug-taking.

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,280
I just have and I feel so much better for it.

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
Cigarette?

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,600
No, thank you.

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
Spliff?

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
Excuse me, everyone.
Could I introduce Carl, my godson?

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Welcome aboard. I'm the Count.
I must be obeyed.

50
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640
It's an honour.

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
Hi, Carl.

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,560
<i>Don't miss Simple Simon's
Super Sunday Smashes. I'm Simon.</i>

53
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,800
That's why I just said that.

54
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,640
Hi, I'm Angus "The Nut" Nutsford.

55
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,760
Hello there.
I'm John, News and Information Gathering.

56
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,240
Hi, I'm Felicity.

57
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
- I didn't think girls were...
- I'm a lesbian.

58
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
Who cooks.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,200
- Of course.
- Have a piece of toast.

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
- Could I have a Mars?
- Don't touch those, I've just arranged them.

61
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you... Do you know what a lesbian is?

62
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,680
- I do.
- Fun times, eh?

63
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
Anyone, toast, toast?

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
I'm Thick Kevin.

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,160
- Your delightful roommate.
- Great. I'm Carl.

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,000
- Cool name.
- Why Thick Kevin?

67
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,440
- I don't...
- It's 'cause he's really, really thick.

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
This is, of course, Dave.

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
Wow.

70
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,600
Big, but very beautiful.

71
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Welcome to the Boat of Love.

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,120
<i>You know,
if God were a DJ, he'd be on this station.</i>

73
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
Let's have a tune, I'm sick of this silence.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,280
And that was the sound of someone
who missed last Sunday's chart show.

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
<i>Don't go mad
and shoot yourself in the head.</i>

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,200
<i>Listen to Simple Simon's show...</i>

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
Why am I queuing up my own records?

78
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,360
While I was swimming,
I passed by a squirrel.

79
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
I just broke the knob off the record player.

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Let's do it right now. I'm busting for a wee.

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,040
A small knob. I like it.

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,520
I said, "Mr Squirrel,
why are you swimming on your back?"

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
Voilà!

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,680
"Well, I swim on my back
to keep my nuts dry. "

85
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm on fire! All right, I'm out.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,760
You're probably still at school,
it's 20 to 3:00.

87
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,320
Or you might be bunking off,
in which case, good on you.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
- Carl?
- Yes.

89
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
- How you doing?
- Quite good, thank you.

90
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,040
- Are you nervous?
- A little bit.

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
- Come over here. Yeah, come over here.
- There?

92
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,880
Come on.

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Welcome. Turn around.

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
Now get the fuck out.

95
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,800
Okay, so the Tuesday night of fun
starts here. We're ready...

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,800
- We're ready. Gather 'round.
- Steam, steam, steam, steam.

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Okay, so the teams are Dave and the Count

98
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,680
versus Young Carl and Thick Kevin.

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
Okay?

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't worry, it's not because
I'm actually thick that I'm called Thick Kevin,

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,240
it's just a nickname.

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,880
That's right. So, who wants to go first?

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
- Wanna guess?
I'll guess, fine.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
All right, who's going? Big Bad Dave.

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
No looking.
30 seconds starting from now!

106
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
Easy. Your president.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,840
- What?
- Your president.

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
- Lyndon Johnson.
- Yes!

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,920
<i>- He wrote Oliver Twist.
- Charles Dickens.</i>

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,440
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,720
Lovely. Lead singer of The Rolling Stones.

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Mick Jagger.
- Yes.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,640
- Is a spy, 007, yes!
- Bond, James Bond!

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
And the actor who plays.

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
"Hello, I'm James Bond. "

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
The actor who plays 007... Yes!
- Sean Connery.

117
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,080
- Quickly, quickly. Time, time, time.
- Hello, I'm a Beatle.

118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,960
- I'm one of the Beatles.
- Time, time, time, no, no, no, no.

119
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
- That one doesn't count.
- That was gonna be good.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,600
That's 6 to 0.
I feel good about this one.

121
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
Forget it now.
- Well, all right.

122
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
Ready to rock.

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay, the thing about Kev
is you gotta think outside the box.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
- Think outside the box.
- He's ready to rock.

125
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,720
Forget about the box.
Thirty seconds from now!

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
Go! You can do it.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,960
It's a type of bird, but it's wearing a hat.

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,840
It's a type of bird, but it's wearing a hat.

129
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,960
Fucking genius.
He's just nervous.

130
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,120
Not so much a hat.

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
Something that's at the top of a coat
and attached to the coat

132
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,560
and covers the head, but is not a hat.

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,960
- A hood?
- Yes, and now first name, type of bird.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,520
- It's a something hood.
- Robin Hood!

135
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,120
Why didn't you just say he lived in
Sherwood Forest and has a bow and arrow?

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
Yeah? What? Who are you talking about?

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
Robin Hood.

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,080
- I didn't know that.
Counting down.

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,440
Right, hang on, no. Tricky one.

140
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,640
It's like he's having a stroke.

141
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
Nice guy.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,080
- Nice guy?
Yes, very nice guy.

143
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,400
- Really nice guy.
Is that it?

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
No. Has lots of friends. Has long hair.

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Ah!

146
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,640
- Jimi Hendrix?
- No, much older.

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,800
- No shoes.
- I know this.

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,200
Nice guy, has long hair,
doesn't have any shoes.

149
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,360
Think about it.

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
- Must be...
- It's like watching a baby drown.

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
Wore a dress.

152
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,880
- Dress?
- Wore a dress!

153
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,520
This had better not be Jesus.

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
- Yes, Jesus!
- Obviously!

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,640
Rock on!

156
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,520
Why didn't you say he was the Son of God?

157
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
Was he?

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,560
Now, there is one final matter to discuss.

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,000
- Pirate radio.
Goodness.

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,960
- In whose department does this fall?
- That would be me, Prime Minister.

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,080
What's the plan, Sir Alistair?
They're very popular.

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
And they're not actually
breaking any law that we know of.

163
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,680
We're going to shut them down
within the year.

164
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,400
They are a sewer of dirty
and irresponsible commercialism

165
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,440
and low morals.

166
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,200
Indeed.

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,320
- Very well. I leave it in your capable hands.
- Thank you very much, Prime Minister.

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,880
Thank you all.

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Full news again in one hour with me,
John Mayford. Till then, this man.

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
This was the deal.

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,520
I asked all of you to demand of me
to do a very foolish thing,

172
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,280
and you sent in ideas in their millions.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,840
But one idea has defeated them all,

174
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,960
so I'm proud to announce I will soon be
the first person to say the "F" word

175
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,880
<i>on rock 'n' roll radio
in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.</i>

176
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,040
But my aim is not to offend, it is to entertain.

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,480
But also, perhaps, to educate a little.

178
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,120
<i>Because if you shoot a bullet, someone dies.
When you drop a bomb, many die.</i>

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,080
If you hit a woman, love dies.

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,840
But if you say the "F" word,
nothing actually happens.

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,280
So here it comes.
Especially for you, the "F" word.

182
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,560
First, though, this very fine piece of music.

183
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
- You can't do this.
- Why not? It's just a word!

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,640
Charming thought,
but here's the simple situation.

185
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,400
The authorities already dislike us.
If you do this they will hate us,

186
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,600
and by hook or by crook,
they'll find a way to close us down.

187
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,200
They can't close us down. We're pirates.
That's why we're sitting out here

188
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
in the middle of the freaking ocean.

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,760
Believe me, they will find a way.
Governments loathe people being free.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
Okay.

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
Okay, I'm thinking about it.

192
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,800
My dear comrades, I have some sad news.

193
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,920
The powers that be have decreed
that the "F" word is a word too far.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,960
But at least for now, even though our
dreams of freedom have died a tragic death,

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,320
the Hollies are still alive.

196
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
Thank you.

197
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
I don't know why you did that.
I was just gonna say "fuck" once.

198
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
You know, one tiny little "fuck. "

199
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,280
There's no such thing as a tiny little "fuck. "

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,480
<i>Yeah there is.
You should ask Angus' girlfriend.</i>

201
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,800
Be that as it may, there's no "fuck" so small
it won't fuck us up.

202
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,600
One day, in a world of dreams,
you'll be able to say "wank"

203
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
or "bollocks" or even "cock" on the radio.
But "fuck," never.

204
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
- Excuse me, my Lordship.
- Yes, Harold?

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
You've left your mike up
in the studio.

206
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,200
So I have.

207
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,680
I do apologise to everyone out there

208
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,160
for the four...
Or was it five "F" words, Quentin?

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,880
The Hollies will continue undisturbed.

210
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm so sorry about that, Quentin,
but you know,

211
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,800
I thought you sounded good.
You have a lovely voice for radio.

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
Fuck off.

213
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,880
That makes it six, Quentin.

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,160
It couldn't have turned out better,
in my opinion.

215
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,600
Right. Good morning, good morning, good
morning, good morning. Please sit down.

216
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
Pirate radio stations.
Good, good, good, good, good.

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,480
Now, I have told the Prime Minister that
we will shut them down within 12 months.

218
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,440
As you will see, sir, they're not in fact
outside of the law at the moment, sir.

219
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,440
Then they soon will be, won't they, Mr...

220
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,920
- Fredericks.
- Fredericks.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
You see, that's the whole point
of being the government.

222
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,360
If you don't like something, you simply
make up a new law that makes it illegal.

223
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
- Speaking of which, Mr...
- Fredericks.

224
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,440
- Fredericks.
- Yes, sir?

225
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,520
I think we might also start working on
legislation to outlaw that haircut of yours.

226
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,960
- You don't like it, sir?
- No one likes it. Apart from blind people.

227
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,800
And I'm sure even they can sense
its profound ugliness as it passes by.

228
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,200
I'll give you a day to deal with the hair,

229
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,680
and a fortnight to deal with the pirates.
Goodbye.

230
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,640
Miss C, as I suspected, totally useless!

231
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,120
- Send me that clever new chap!
- Certainly, sir!

232
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
I have a job for him.
We have some damage to do.

233
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>Good morning, everybody. You're listening
to Simple Simon's Breakfast Show</i>

234
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,480
on 203 metres in the medium waveband.

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,280
<i>You're one of 23 million people
listening to the Boat of Love this morning.</i>

236
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,640
Looking forward to Saturday?

237
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,880
- What's Saturday?
- Saturday! Sensational Saturday!

238
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,560
As you may have noticed, there are,
unfortunubbly, no women on this boat,

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,960
- apart from Felicity...
Hiya!

240
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,280
...who is of the lesbionic tendency.

241
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,120
But every second Saturday, each DJ
is allowed to invite one girl onto the boat.

242
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
So, any idea who'll you'll invite?

243
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,360
God.

244
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,480
Presumably there's a sort of presumption
that there'll be...

245
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
- Sex, of some sort.
- Every time.

246
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah.
Then no.

247
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,680
I've spent my life at all-boys' schools.

248
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,360
The closest I've ever come to a snog

249
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
is when I was once licked on the face
by a horse.

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
- Sounds good, actually.
A horse?

251
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm sorry to hear that, Carl, my son.
I would seriously like to help.

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,600
I will put my mind to it.

253
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,080
- Miss Peacock.
- How are you lined up, eh?

254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,360
- Well, her name is Daphne.
- And she likes the bearded man.

255
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,560
- She does, indeed.
- With a tiny knob.

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
Whatever.

257
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,720
I've got a tiny knob, actually.

258
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
But I rather like it.

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,440
It means I can wear smaller underpants.

260
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,760
Don't know what that means.
I didn't understand any of that.

261
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
What about other...

262
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,080
Who's that guy up there?
I haven't met him yet.

263
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,520
That is Mark.

264
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,360
He's the sexiest man on the planet.
Hardly ever speaks.

265
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,880
Not even when he's broadcasting,
which is interesting.

266
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,920
So that's Midnight Mark.

267
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
Thanks.

268
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,880
Wow.

269
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
Now...

270
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,800
- You not got anyone?
- No. No, not today.

271
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,120
I guess I'm really...
I'm looking for that "one true love" thing.

272
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,040
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah. Big time.

273
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,760
- You dig the dream?
- I dig the dream.

274
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,760
Yeah, it's a good dream.

275
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,120
- Here they come.
- Here they come.

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,720
There they are!

277
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
Wow.

278
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Wowzer.

279
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,480
Oh, my God, it's like a boat of honey.

280
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
I wanna sleep with them all!

281
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,720
- Hi.
- Welcome aboard!

282
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,960
Do a twirl!

283
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
I need a big drink.

284
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,720
I agree. Let's leave.

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
Right, hurry, up the steps.

286
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,640
Do you mind if I call you guys by the same
name? Twins can be very confusing.

287
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
This is actually a very interesting book.

288
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
- Is it?
- Yes, it's...

289
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,880
My father used to collect woodpeckers.

290
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,640
- Really?
- Yeah! No.

291
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,360
No, my father was an architect.
How about you? What did your father do?

292
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,680
Well, he had sex with my mum and then
left without leaving his name or address.

293
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
- No.
- Yeah.

294
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
- No!
- It's cool.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,280
I... You don't miss what you've never had.

296
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
Nothing planned, you guys?

297
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,240
- No, no.
- Well, yes.

298
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,320
Another very quiet afternoon
for me and my sex life.

299
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
The sad room.

300
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,920
Come here.

301
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
I've come to get you
out of your predicament.

302
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,640
What predicament?

303
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,520
The whole sad act. No girl,
unused pencil-sized penis predicament.

304
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
That predicament.

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,480
Walk this way.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Don't walk that way.

307
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,080
- No. Walk woodpecker way.
- Well, I'm just gonna...

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Okay. Okay, it might work.

309
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,000
But one, it's morally wrong.

310
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
- Well, I mean, is it?
- Yes.

311
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,040
And two, it might not work. In which case
I'm gonna be the biggest idiot in the world.

312
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,760
All this is true. But on the other hand,

313
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,320
it could be the best five minutes of your life.

314
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,840
You hear that? That's destiny knocking.

315
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,600
Get in there.

316
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Sorry, girls. Sorry, Mum.

317
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah. The Doctor is hungry.

318
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,080
Come on in, baby.

319
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,400
- What's this?
- Alcohol.

320
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
- You're trying to get me drunk, are you?
- Of course I am.

321
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,680
How you been? Yeah, you're all right.

322
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,280
I need to pull the pin on the love grenade.

323
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,680
Please do.

324
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,840
Boom.

325
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I think...

326
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,160
I think we should turn the lights off.

327
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,520
Do we have to?
I like to see you when I'm with you.

328
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,320
I can't make love in electric light,
it's unnatural.

329
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,120
Trust me, though, yeah? I'm a doctor.

330
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,320
<i>Okay. Un, deux, trois.</i>

331
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,040
Let's do this, yeah?

332
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,840
Come on. Keep your boots on.

333
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,600
Keeping the boots on.

334
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,800
There we go.
Although, not quite good enough.

335
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,360
There. Pitch black.

336
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,880
Hey!

337
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,320
You are a very complex man.
- Thank you.

338
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Will you...
Will you just excuse me for a second?

339
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,280
Where are you going?

340
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I think we should take
some precautionary measures.

341
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,640
Don't worry, I'm on the pill.

342
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,720
I still think I'd like to freshen up,
though.

343
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,840
Okay. Hurry back.
- I will.

344
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
What the hell are you doing?

345
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,720
I just thought it'd be nice
if I brush my teeth first,

346
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
but I didn't have my toothbrush,
so what I did was I borrowed...

347
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,520
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing
still dressed?

348
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,600
- Yes, do you think I should get undressed?
- Yeah.

349
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,760
I can't walk out of there stark-bollock naked
and walk back in fully clothed, can I?

350
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,160
Fine, okay, fine.

351
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
- Think smart.
- Right.

352
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
- You sure it's dark enough out there?
- Yes, it's pitch black.

353
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
The pope could walk in and poke her,
she would never know.

354
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
- I just wish I was a bit bigger.
- Why?

355
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,760
'Cause you're beefy, you know?

356
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,600
Can I come in? I need to wee.
- Yeah, hang on, hang on!

357
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
One second.

358
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,440
In here! Down there. Hurry! Just... Hurry up!

359
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
Come in.

360
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,080
What are you doing in here?

361
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
- Private man things.
- I could hear voices.

362
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Disc jockeys are always practising
our patter.

363
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
Gosh, you're quite chunky, aren't you?

364
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
Am I? I mean, yeah!

365
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
Yeah, I suppose I am.
The girls seem to like it.

366
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,000
That's what I like about you.
You're a nice clean bird.

367
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,920
That's what you think.

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,040
No!

369
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,760
No way. Don't... Don't do that.

370
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,280
Don't dry your hands, I...

371
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,160
I love a girl with...

372
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,840
Wet hands.

373
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
You are strange.

374
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
Do you want to get down to it, then?

375
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
Just give me a second, will you?

376
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,680
I dunno if you can see, but I've got a bit
of nougat lodged in a molar at the back.

377
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,880
- Well, hurry up, lover boy.
- I will, lover girl.

378
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Casanova.

379
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,800
But what about the size thing?
She said you were chunky.

380
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,800
Relax. Just find the right position
and it will all be over before she realises.

381
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
- Just be quick.
- I think you can be pretty sure

382
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,680
I'm gonna be quick.

383
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,560
I could see a lot of myself in you.
Come here.

384
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
It's a very special time.

385
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,360
Trousers.

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
I can do this. I just don't know where...

387
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,880
Hey, look at me. Enjoy it. Enjoy it.

388
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
- I'm not a virgin.
- Okay.

389
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,400
- I'm having second thoughts.
- Carl.

390
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,920
This is your destiny.

391
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,640
Hello, big boy.

392
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,880
No, wrong room! Sorry.

393
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
Come in.

394
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,200
- Sir?
- Yes.

395
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,280
- Very impressive references here.
- Thank you, sir.

396
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Very unusual name.

397
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
Twatt?

398
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,720
And that's with two T's?
Have you heard of pirate radio, Twatt?

399
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,440
- Like Radio Rock, sir?
- Indeed, exactly like Radio Rock.

400
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,400
- Ever listened to it?
- Not often.

401
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm not really a pop person.
I prefer classical music.

402
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
- Well, who doesn't?
- The listeners of Radio Rock, sir?

403
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,160
Precisely.

404
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,800
The drug-takers and the law breakers
and the bottom-bashing fornicators

405
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
of our recently great country.

406
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Well, here's your little task.

407
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,600
I want Rock off the air in 12 months,
and I want you to be my private assassin.

408
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Someone's gone!

409
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,000
No, don't want it!

410
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
All right.

411
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,040
But she did this wonderful thing,

412
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,640
where she put a tiny bit of ketchup...

413
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,320
Hi.

414
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760
Sorry, man, but who are you?

415
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
Bob.

416
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,480
Smooth Bob.

417
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Bob Silver, the Dawn Treader.

418
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,160
I do the early, early, early morning show.

419
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,080
You're Bob.

420
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,960
- Yeah.
- Good old Bob.

421
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,320
How long have you been on the boat, Bob?

422
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Seven months.
Every morning, 3:00 a. m. To 6:00 a. m.

423
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Well, then how come we've never met you?

424
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, you know, I keep myself to myself.

425
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,840
A lot of sleep.

426
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
Fair amount of drugs.

427
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,920
A total immersion in the vinyl, you know?

428
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Gotta listen to the music if you're gonna
give the people what they need.

429
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,720
In their heart and their soul. Yeah?

430
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Better be getting back to the sounds, 'cause

431
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
it's a bit hectic in here.

432
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
So that's Bob?
Good old Bob.

433
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
That's Bob.
- Wry Sir Bob.

434
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,880
What was his name again?

435
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,240
Really?

436
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,880
So, young man, how's it going?

437
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,480
Well, sir, I think I may have had
a little breakthrough.

438
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,840
The pirate stations only exist
because they sell advertising.

439
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,640
Yes, you can listen to our pop music,

440
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,040
but only if you also buy
Findus Frozen Fish Fingers.

441
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,400
Exactly. So what we can do immediately
is make advertising on the stations illegal

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,320
for British companies.

443
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,720
We would cut off the boats' cash
with one fell swoop.

444
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,120
Brilliant.

445
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,680
I like you, Twatt.

446
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,160
Stop blowing the whistle, man,
we were chatting.

447
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,920
I have a very important announcement.
As you may know

448
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,960
there has been a serious squeeze put on our
advertisers by Her Majesty's Government.

449
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,440
This chart, thank you, John,

450
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,760
displays what's been happening to our
advertising revenue in the last few weeks.

451
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
- Ouch.
- So, I've had to stir myself

452
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,160
from my traditional languor

453
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
and do something to make the station
more attractive to new commercial partners.

454
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Two years ago,
something terrible happened,

455
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,360
and we lost the greatest DJ
pirate radio has ever known to America,

456
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,320
ambition, and alcoholic poisoning.

457
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,560
And then something wonderful happened
and we got, in return, from America,

458
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,920
a man who proved more than capable
of filling those enormous shoes.

459
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,760
- Love our Count.
- I do my humble best.

460
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,240
And now, my friends, I have good news.

461
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,960
- Bad news, sir.
- Very good news.

462
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,280
Have you ever heard of Gavin Kavanagh?

463
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,560
No, I have not.

464
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,240
He's possibly the most famous
popular music broadcaster ever.

465
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,240
- Indeed, a strange and mysterious legend.
- And what about him?

466
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,400
- Well, sir, he's decided...
- To return.

467
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,520
No!
- Stop it!

468
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,240
Oh, my...

469
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,040
Three weeks today, Gavin Kavanagh
returns to rock on Radio Rock.

470
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
So?

471
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,080
So, it is more important than ever
to actually close the stations down.

472
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,760
Otherwise the advertisers will simply
flock back and pay their bills from abroad.

473
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,320
Well, what are we going to do, then?

474
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,080
We go, sir, for the jugular.

475
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,520
And this next song is dedicated to
the coolest man in the whole of the world,

476
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,160
and he's about to step onto this boat.

477
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
It is gorgeous Gavin Kavanagh,
and this week he's definitely number one!

478
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
Quentin.

479
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,840
Like the beard.

480
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,960
And you must be the Count.

481
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,600
I am he.

482
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,320
I wonder what that makes me, the king?

483
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,400
- Or the clown?
- Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

484
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,400
- All right, and you are?
- Felicity.

485
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
- Rules changed?
- I'm a lesbian.

486
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,360
- Groovy! Always or mostly?
- Absolutely always.

487
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,320
- So you say.
- No! Stop that.

488
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,480
Now, take me to my microphone.
I need to broadcast.

489
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,160
Let's go!

490
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,760
Are you doing something dirty?

491
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,720
Are you doing something
your parents don't know about?

492
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,520
<i>Are you breaking the law?</i>

493
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,480
Are you breaking the rules?

494
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,080
Open your knees and feel the breeze,

495
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,120
because Gavin's back to stay.

496
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,800
Now it's just you and me,

497
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,720
and I'm looking right up your skirt.

498
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,480
That feels so good.

499
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
That feels wonderful!

500
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
<i>Listen to this.</i>

501
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
This will make you moist.

502
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,840
Watch and learn, kids, watch and learn.

503
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,320
Buddy Holly.

504
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,360
This is Gavin, tweaking the nation's nipples!

505
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,200
So, join me tomorrow,

506
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,320
when I'll be playing definitive rock 'n' roll
here on Radio Rock.

507
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Think of me when you come.

508
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,360
And now it's over to Jolly John.

509
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,480
For some more murders,
rapes and abductions, it's the news.

510
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,080
The news at midday.

511
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,200
In London...

512
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,240
- Twatt, Miss C. How is the jugular going?
- Slowly, sir.

513
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,480
Yes, I hear the arrival of Mr Kavanagh
has been followed

514
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,840
by the finding of a rash of new stations,
for God's sake.

515
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,720
- Yes, sir.
- Sort it out in a fortnight.

516
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,360
Find me a loophole in the law
so that I can make them all illegal

517
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,680
or you are both fired.

518
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,760
And when I say fired, I do not only mean
that you will lose your jobs.

519
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,480
I mean that you will never work again.

520
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,160
You disastrous, pathetic

521
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,920
ugly nobodies.

522
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,120
Jugular, my arse!

523
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,600
How about a little bit more Seekers?

524
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,440
Harold, I've just put another one straight on.
Double Seekers! Two!

525
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
You wanted to see me?

526
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,440
Yes, Carl!

527
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Your birthday is coming
and I haven't got you a present yet.

528
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,520
It's difficult.
What do you give the man who has nothing?

529
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Yeah, it's tricky.

530
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,400
So, after deep thought,
what I've decided is to give you

531
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,160
a nice time.

532
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,880
Tomorrow evening,
I've invited my niece, Marianne, to dinner.

533
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,600
She is the sweetest and prettiest girl
in the world.

534
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,760
<i>It's Midnight Mark here.</i>

535
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520
<i>Hi.</i>

536
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,720
Hello?

537
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,360
<i>Midnight Mark.</i>

538
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,160
Carl. Good evening.

539
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,520
This is Marianne.

540
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,760
Hi.

541
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,880
Hi.

542
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,600
You already said that.

543
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
Yeah.

544
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,720
Could you excuse me for one second?

545
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,960
- Dave. Hi.
- Hi.

546
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,800
Could I borrow a...

547
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,760
A condom?

548
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,320
Sure.

549
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,160
Well, well, well, Young Carl.

550
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,840
Do you know how it works?

551
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,960
Of course I bloody know how it works.

552
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,520
Carl.

553
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
They made me steer the thing myself. Alone.

554
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,000
- And you did?
- Yeah. I must be

555
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,360
- the most inexperienced person...
- Is Quentin around?

556
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,120
No, actually, you just missed him.

557
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,120
Oh, my God. A woman.

558
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,880
And not just a woman.

559
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,080
The most beautiful and succulent woman
in the history of mankind.

560
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,680
Dave, this is Marianne.

561
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,520
Dave, hello! I'm a real fan!

562
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,080
Who isn't?

563
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,760
Well, it's lovely to meet you,
Miraculous Marianne.

564
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,080
<i>Parlez-vous français?</i>

565
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,480
- No.
- No, me neither.

566
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,240
- I can see why you wanted that condom.
- What?

567
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,280
Well, well, night-night.

568
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,440
What did he just say?

569
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,040
- "Night-night"?
- No, before that.

570
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,960
I didn't quite catch it.

571
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,240
Did he say, "I can see
why you wanted the condom"?

572
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,440
I did not hear him say that.

573
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,280
I did.

574
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,400
And the only conclusion
I can draw from that

575
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,920
is that you thought I was going to be
so easy that you borrowed a condom.

576
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,640
No.

577
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,560
Then what other conclusion
can I then draw?

578
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,080
Okay.

579
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,640
It's true. And I'm sorry.

580
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,240
It's just that the first moment I saw you,

581
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,840
I fell in love with you, instantly,

582
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,880
and I thought that, if I got luckier
than any man has ever got,

583
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,400
it would be a tragedy if I didn't have...

584
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,440
A condom.

585
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,120
I can see how that was just sick
and very wrong,

586
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,880
and so I'm gonna take the condom
out of my pocket

587
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,440
and I'm throwing the condom
into the North Sea.

588
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,000
You see, I already adore you.

589
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,720
I hope one day we'll get married
and have children.

590
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,960
Thank you.

591
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,400
Come here.

592
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,040
I think we're going to need that condom.

593
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,600
Dave, you don't have another condom?

594
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Sorry, mate, it was my last.
What happened to the one I gave you?

595
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,040
Long story.

596
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,640
Try Gavin.

597
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,640
Thank you.

598
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,200
Okay. Just one minute. This is my room.
You should stay here, and I'll be back,

599
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,360
- and Kevin, I can see you.
- All right.

600
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
- Evening.
- Good evening.

601
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,360
You don't have any...

602
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,200
No, probably not.

603
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,480
Carry on.

604
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,840
- Thank you, Gavin, I really appreciate it.
- Don't mention it, youngster.

605
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,160
Remember, be gentle, but be firm.
Very firm, indeed.

606
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,120
And when you're done with it, run it
under the tap, rinse it out, use it again.

607
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,120
Where is she?

608
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,200
Marianne?

609
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,560
Baby.

610
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
Oh, no.

611
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,640
Oh, no!

612
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,720
Hey, kid.

613
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,000
Hey, how you doing?

614
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,680
I can see you, Marianne.

615
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
Enter.

616
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,640
Sir. The two weeks are over,

617
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,920
and I'm afraid I haven't really been able
to find you a loophole.

618
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,800
What a shame.

619
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,200
Time for you to move on, then,
like your sad little father.

620
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,040
But what I have done is find you a noose.

621
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,480
I have a report here that says that last week
the distress call of a fishing boat

622
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,640
wasn't heard because its radio waveband
was blocked by Radio Rock.

623
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,400
Men were dying, and they couldn't be saved
because of this rock 'n' roll pornography.

624
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,240
I think, sir, we have our smoking gun.

625
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,160
Very good, indeed.

626
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,720
- Did the fishermen die in the end?
- No, sir.

627
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,640
That's a pity.

628
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,640
I think I may have also discovered a way
of actually getting on the boat

629
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,400
to do some more "intimate" research.

630
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,400
- Well done, Twatt.
- Thank you, sir.

631
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,720
We have their testicles in our hands.

632
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,520
And it feels good.

633
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,560
<i>It's magnificent Monday</i>

634
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,080
<i>and 200 gorgeous competition winners
are heading straight for Radio Rock.</i>

635
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to our Boat of Bliss.

636
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,720
Hello.
- Morning.

637
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,680
- We're not lost.
- Morning.

638
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,200
Just quite a big boat...
- Morning.

639
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,520
And this is the kitchen.

640
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
And this is the food we eat
if the weather's bad

641
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,760
and we can't get it fresh from shore.

642
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,240
Tinned food!

643
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,280
- And this is our cook, Felicity.
Hi!

644
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,080
- She's a lesbian.
- Yes, I am.

645
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,160
Hello. Can I help you?

646
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,280
Yes, hello. Got a bit lost.

647
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,600
More than a bit.

648
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,240
In order to get here,
you have to open a really quite heavy door

649
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,960
with the words "No Entry" on it.

650
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,560
Well, I didn't see that,
so it must have been left open.

651
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,160
You look suspiciously square
to be a fan of this boat's output.

652
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,600
- No, no, no, I'm a real fan.
- I hope so.

653
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,720
Because if word gets out
that you're here to spy on us,

654
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,880
I think you may have trouble
hanging on to your testicles.

655
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,760
Are you threatening me?

656
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,120
Do you know what, I think I am.

657
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,040
Because I've got pretty good instincts
and you look like a twat to me.

658
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,720
Get out of here.

659
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,680
Everyone leaves in 15 minutes!

660
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,520
Welcome back.
I hope you've all had a tremendous time.

661
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,560
The only slightly odd thing
is there seem to be about

662
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,480
half as many of you as there were earlier.

663
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,880
If you give us a moment, we will sort out
this strange and mysterious situation.

664
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,440
- Ladies.
- Hi, Quentin. Busy day.

665
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,000
So I see.
But I rather fear now is the time to move on.

666
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,200
You can all come back to my room,
if you like.

667
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,840
- Girl at the back?
- No.

668
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,200
Give it up, Nutsford.

669
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,320
So, what did you find out?

670
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,240
The boat itself is in very bad condition.

671
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,440
Good!

672
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,520
Which means if they ever try to get away
or even move, they won't get far.

673
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,680
Bravo, mission accomplished.

674
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,400
So tell me, Twatt, what's the plan?

675
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,360
I think we should work
to get public opinion on our side.

676
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,160
Then, January the 1st,
we make pirate radio totally illegal

677
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,440
on the grounds that they are endangering
the lives of the brave men and women

678
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,400
of the nation's shipping community,
upon whom the economy

679
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,520
and fish and chip shops
of the country depend.

680
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,520
And if they try to defy the law,
we take them out.

681
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,880
Splendid.

682
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,080
I think we can call it
the Marine Offences Act.

683
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,640
The Marine Offences Act. I like it.

684
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,360
And I think the Queen will like it, too.

685
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,640
- We have them on the ropes.
- God, I love ropes.

686
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,160
You must come over to dinner sometime.
Meet the family.

687
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,240
And that was for Erica from Wolverhampton.

688
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,080
<i>Yes, it's mail time.</i>

689
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,320
Hey, guys.

690
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Hey, Simon, what can we do for you?

691
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,200
Well, Carl, my mate,

692
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,280
my best mate, I've got some news.

693
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,400
I don't know why I'm singing. I can't even...
My words are just coming out in tune.

694
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,080
I'm so happy. If I were the Count right now,

695
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:05,200
I would definitely be using the "F" word
to describe the level of this good news.

696
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,160
- Hold me! Hold me!
- For what?

697
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
I'm getting married!

698
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,880
To a woman!

699
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,640
- You're fucking doing fucking what?
- I'm marrying.

700
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,840
- And give her one for the Nutster!
- I won't.

701
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,200
What's the lovely lady's name?

702
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,760
- Elenore.
- Elenore.

703
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,920
Yeah, she's an American.

704
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,040
Well, I hope you all appreciate
what this means?

705
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,720
From next Saturday, there will, for the first
time, be a woman living on the boat.

706
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,400
No offence meant.

707
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,520
None taken.
I'm actually quite excited about it.

708
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,960
Hands off, you lesbian. Watch out!

709
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,400
Eye on you.

710
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,760
But Elenore will, of course,
be totally exclusive to her lucky husband.

711
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,400
Here, I hope you gentlemen can take it.

712
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,520
For my eyes only.

713
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,920
May I just say,
now that Quentin has departed,

714
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,320
one word which I believe is the only word
in the world that now matters?

715
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,120
And that word is...

716
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,880
Matrimony.

717
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,760
Stag!

718
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,280
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

719
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,720
- Stag, stag, stag!
- Stag, stag, stag!

720
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,760
Fantastic!

721
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,800
It's a stag.

722
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,120
I thought you were having a seizure.
He's okay. He's fine.

723
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,400
So how long
have you guys known each other?

724
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,360
Two weeks.
Yeah, it's the old proverbial thunderbolt.

725
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,560
There I was, just minding my own business,
having a quiet drink.

726
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,920
Over trots this blonde bombshell.

727
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,760
Before I knew it, there was quite a lot of...

728
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,480
Yeah!

729
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,280
Lot of kissing.

730
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,280
- And then?
- No,

731
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm afraid we're both big believers
in the whole

732
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,680
"not before the big night" thing.

733
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,520
- That is sick.
- It's not sick.

734
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,400
- Why?
- I just hope that the boat is solid.

735
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,800
The sexual energy
that will be unleashed that night

736
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,080
will blow a hole in her blooming side.

737
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,920
I know how you feel.

738
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,200
It's gonna be like Niagara Falls
under my sheets.

739
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,880
- Yeah, my sheets, too.
- What?

740
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,360
- Where are we going, Count?
- We are going

741
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,320
exactly where we should be going.

742
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,120
Pub!

743
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Pub!

744
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,080
Club!

745
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,160
No, no, no, no!

746
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,480
Stop, stop, stop. Don't do it.
Stop, stop, stop

747
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
I love you.

748
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,560
I'm getting married!

749
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,360
I think I might have had
a bit too much to drink last night.

750
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,040
- What about you?
No, I'm in good shape.

751
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,320
In fact, I find alcohol
rather sharpens my mind.

752
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,880
- Really?
- Yes.

753
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,400
- And I've been thinking.
- Dangerous.

754
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,000
It's a bit queer that your mum sent you here
to get on the straight and narrow,

755
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,080
when this is obviously the worst
possible place in the world to do that.

756
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,760
There's sex and drugs and alcohol.

757
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,440
- Without the sex.
- My theory is that you're here

758
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,760
because it's exactly the right time
for a young man like you

759
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,960
to get to know his dad.

760
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,680
And?

761
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,520
I therefore think that your dad
is on this boat.

762
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,440
And since he's definitely not me,

763
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,920
I think he's probably Quentin.

764
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,960
Sometimes, just sometimes,

765
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,120
I think I should be called Clever Kevin.

766
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,400
What do you say to that?

767
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,520
And top news of the day.
At 2:45 precisely this afternoon,

768
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,280
Sir Simon Swafford, king of the charts,

769
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,200
marries the prettiest girl who ever lived.

770
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,800
I just want you to know,
I want to assure listeners

771
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,160
that this doesn't mean
that I have any less love for you.

772
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,920
I'll still be here every morning.
The only difference will be, I'll be happy.

773
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,400
Oh, my God. Here she comes.

774
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,280
- Big day.
- Big day!

775
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,360
I shouldn't look.

776
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,720
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God, apparently,

777
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
which is scary,

778
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,080
to witness the wedding of this man and this

779
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,720
total goddess.

780
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,440
Jesus Christ alone
knows why she's marrying him.

781
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,240
- Good one.
- But love is,

782
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,680
as the Everly Brothers so wisely observed,
strange.

783
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,520
And the bride is blushing now
as the groom is gazing into her eyes.

784
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,800
You can almost see Cupid
fluttering his wings above their heads.

785
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,200
No, that was a seagull.

786
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,720
Shut up, Nutsford.

787
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,840
Best man, have you got the rings?

788
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,240
I have.

789
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,280
Thanks, mate.

790
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,320
There you are.

791
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,400
How lovely.

792
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,320
I now declare you man and stunning wife.

793
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,920
So sweet.

794
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,800
You may now kiss the bride, poor girl.

795
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,480
Yes, the full sweep over.

796
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,240
No, take it. God.

797
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,280
You have it.

798
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,600
Where's those bridesmaids?

799
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,920
<i>It's Nutty Nutsford here,
the morning after the night before.</i>

800
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,200
- Hey.
- Hey!

801
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,080
So how did it go?

802
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,920
Lt...

803
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,560
I think it will get better. You know, it was...

804
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,440
She was tired.

805
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,320
I was a little overexcited, it was...
If I'm honest, it was a bit quick sticks.

806
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,280
But we don't need to blow it all
on one night, do we? Do we?

807
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,480
No. We've all the time in the world.
Round two.

808
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,560
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

809
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,080
- Hey!
- Hey, babe.

810
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,920
You look like a unicorn.

811
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,240
In a negligee.

812
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,200
- How is Mrs Swafford this morning?
- Good. Good, very good.

813
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,880
I've brought you some tea.

814
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,880
- No?
- I don't like tea.

815
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,760
I'll drink it myself.

816
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,520
Simon, I've got some news.

817
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,360
No. Don't tell me...

818
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,600
You're pregnant already, aren't you?

819
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,760
I knew this was gonna happen.
The Swaffords have always had strong stuff.

820
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,520
No, it's not that.

821
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,680
Not that I don't want babies. I do.

822
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,320
I want a dozen.
You'll be in bits by the time I'm done,

823
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,360
but, you know, I thought
that we could have a few more years

824
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,400
of reckless shagging
before we settle into Baby Boulevard.

825
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,720
Simon, I'm so in love.

826
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,520
Of course you are.

827
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,520
Gavin is so fantastic.

828
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,680
Isn't he?
Isn't he just the greatest, the coolest guy?

829
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,240
Yes, he is.
I guess that's why I'm in love with him.

830
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,720
Koala bear, when you said that
you were in love with him, there might be...

831
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,560
Translation. What do you mean by that?

832
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,400
Well, I...

833
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,040
I met him about a week before I met you

834
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,880
and I fell in love with him.

835
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,080
But he said the only way that I could be
on the boat was if we got married.

836
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,400
And he wouldn't do that,
for obvious reasons.

837
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,800
So I suggested
that I could just marry another DJ,

838
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
and that way I could still be on the boat.

839
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,320
He said that was a mad idea.

840
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,880
But then I met you.

841
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,240
You know, I saw you sitting all alone in that
pub and I just leapt at the opportunity and...

842
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,600
Well, now, here I am.

843
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,680
And if it's okay with you,
I'll be moving in with Gavin tonight.

844
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,920
Thanks for being so understanding.

845
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,200
But I don't understand.

846
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:26,200
But I just explained.
See, I met Gavin and we fell in love and...

847
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,800
No, I get that. I understood all...
I get the ins and outs of it.

848
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,880
What I don't understand
is how you could be so cruel.

849
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,920
I mean, we're just married, if you read the...

850
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,400
Yesterday.

851
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,720
And we're supposed to spend
the rest of our lives together.

852
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,560
We will, in a way. We will, we will. It's just...

853
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,200
I'll be having sex with Gavin
instead of you every night, and...

854
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,600
But we'll still be friends.

855
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,920
If you need me, I'll be right next door.

856
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,920
Okay?

857
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,600
Having sex?

858
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,800
Hopefully, yes.

859
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,440
You might hear us.

860
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,600
That would be nice.

861
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,320
Official sources were today sad to announce

862
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
the separation of Simon Swafford
and his wife, Elenore,

863
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,600
after 17 hours of marriage.

864
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,880
It is understood the split is due
to musical differences.

865
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,320
<i>No, no, I can't believe</i>

866
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:09,040
<i>You're leaving me</i>

867
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,800
<i>Stay with me, baby</i>

868
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,800
<i>Please, stay with me, baby</i>

869
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,240
<i>Stay with me, baby</i>

870
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,360
<i>Here's the guy
who plays all the hits.</i>

871
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:47,080
<i>It's, it's, it's Simple Simon Swafford.</i>

872
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,920
And the time is now 7:09 in the a. m.,

873
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,640
<i>and you're listening to
Simple Simon Swafford Show</i>

874
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,800
on Radio Rock,
203 metres on the medium waveband.

875
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,920
And remember, folks,
it ain't simple being cool,

876
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,080
but it's cool being simple.

877
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
<i>Radio Rock.</i>

878
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,200
- Well, what do you have to say, bastard?
- Come on, be fair. I didn't ask her to do it.

879
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,760
I said to her, it's absolutely not on
and now she's left,

880
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,680
she's gone, she's left the boat,
she's not coming back.

881
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,600
I honestly can't see what I've done wrong.

882
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,280
What can I say?

883
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,240
It's the dark side of rock 'n' roll.

884
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,040
Can you tell me one thing?

885
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,200
Before she left this morning, did you...
You didn't...

886
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,480
You know?

887
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,840
Just one little pop.

888
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,200
I thought it was the least I could do after all
the trouble the lovely girl had gone to.

889
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,840
Simon, wait.

890
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,200
- Can't really blame him, can we?
- Yeah, you can.

891
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,560
Mister, you ever heard of the Vietnam War?

892
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,680
- I have.
- Well,

893
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,000
that holocaust is simply
a playground skirmish

894
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,880
next to what you're about to experience.

895
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,280
I'm declaring war.

896
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,080
W- A-R. Gonna tear you apart.

897
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,640
<i>My dear listeners, you may have
noticed a certain cooling of the relationship</i>

898
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,720
<i>between His Royal Highness,
the Count of Cool, and a guy called Gavin.</i>

899
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,720
<i>Well, I'm eager to show the world
that he is a coward.</i>

900
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,080
<i>So I'm suggesting something
that's pretty big where I come from,</i>

901
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,000
<i>and it's a game called "Chicken. "</i>

902
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,400
<i>The man who climbs furthest is the victor.</i>

903
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,160
<i>May the best man win.</i>

904
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,960
<i>And the biggest chicken lose.</i>

905
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,400
<i>Are we ready?</i>

906
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,800
<i>Then let the ascent commence.</i>

907
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,160
Come on, Count.
Come on. Up you go.

908
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,480
<i>Climb for America, sir.</i>

909
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,080
- Hope she's worth it.
- She definitely was.

910
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,280
Fuck.

911
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,800
- Come on, Count.
- Come on, Count.

912
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,120
For God's sake.
- Help him!

913
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,520
Okay.

914
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,440
Okay.

915
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,320
It's... It's getting pretty high now.

916
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,880
I suppose there might be an argument
that it's time for a...

917
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,880
A moment of reflection.

918
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,760
Spoken like a five-star chicken.

919
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,280
- What are they doing?
- Just trying to help you out.

920
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,880
<i>Come on, guys, don't be stupid.</i>

921
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,800
<i>Enough is enough,
you've proved your point.</i>

922
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,200
We should do something!

923
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,080
For God's sakes, stop!

924
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,800
All he did was have sex
with someone's wife.

925
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,440
Sorry, Simon, don't take it personal.

926
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,560
<i>If you fall, you will die.</i>

927
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,120
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

928
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,400
Well,

929
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,360
changed your mind, then?

930
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,240
- About what?
- About me being a chicken.

931
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,400
Why do you ask?

932
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,800
Well, we've reached the top.

933
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,680
And...

934
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,400
It's the top.

935
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,960
But it's not the end.

936
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,840
Isn't it?

937
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,840
No, sir.

938
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,400
- Christ.
- Fuck.

939
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,200
<i>Step away from the edge, you silly bastards.
This is madness.</i>
