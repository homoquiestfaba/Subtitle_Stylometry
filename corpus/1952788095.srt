Oh, I can be scared
As long as I'm with you

1205
01:18:07,797 --> 01:18:10,925

Through cartoons, movies

01:18:55,578 --> 01:18:56,602
And tons of DVDs

1216
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:00,340
As old school goes, we're genuine
We've been kicking it since 1969

01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,448
But Mystery Inc. is far from through

1218
01:19:02,619 --> 01:19:05,611
Because there's always more adventures
Starring me Scooby-Doo
