1
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,655
<i>Morning traffic is heavy
here in Los Angeles.</i>

2
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,990
Good morning, Kenneth.
You're on deck early.

3
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:14,705
I finished the VP 2310
instruction manual, sir.

4
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,415
Why, look at that.
Ahead of deadline.

5
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,915
You should have e-mailed it
to the print shop.

6
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,160
I know, but I'm ready for another
assignment, sir.

7
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,005
This is our biggest job yet, put us in the loop
for government contracts...

8
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:30,295
the big time, lots of cost overruns.

9
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
- What is it?
- It's materials for a user manual

10
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,970
for a federal data-entry program.

11
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,930
Bureaucratic bozos spent
millions on the software.

12
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,455
Now no one can figure out
how to use it.

13
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,425
Dense.

14
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,060
Very complex.

15
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,820
When's the deadline?

16
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,095
3 weeks from now.

17
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:52,098
That's one week
to complete each volume.

18
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,330
It's all due at the end of the month.

19
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,240
Not much time for a project this size.

20
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,100
Well, the slackers out there
haven't got enough grit to pull it off.

21
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:06,212
Think you can handle it?

22
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:02,810
Think you can handle it?

23
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,210
Well, I, uh... I better get started right away.

24
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,340
Hold on. I got something else for you.

25
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,470
Meet your new word processor
and layout assistant.

26
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,430
Hi. I'm Lisa belmer.
Nice to meet you.

27
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,550
This is Kenneth,
best tech writer we've got.

28
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,380
May I talk to you alone
for a second, sir?

29
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,540
Excuse me.

30
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,415
Sir, I'd really prefer
to work alone on this.

31
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,380
You can't do it solo.
Deadline's too tight.

32
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,915
You write the copy.

33
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,250
Let her do the grunt work.

34
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,010
Sir, I really think
she'll slow me down.

35
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,288
I mean, what does she
know about publishing?

36
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,885
Well, she used to do those kid magazines
they do on their computers.

37
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,090
But didn't we have a deal? I...

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,960
Finish the manual by the end of the month,
and you get your bonus.

39
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,365
Make it work.

40
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,950
Yes, sir.

41
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,320
<i>It's a pretty tough commute
for those heading home tonight.</i>

42
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,460
<i>Southbound i-5...</i>

43
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,475
I found that on my desk.

44
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,625
Oh, she wants it, Ken.
She wants it bad.

45
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,490
- She was made for it.
- You know her?

46
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,685
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Oh, yeah, she's a wild one.

47
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,760
I could introduce you...
If you want her.

48
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,390
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Oh, yeah, she's a wild one.

49
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,830
Lets you do anything
you want to her.

50
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,195
Anything.

51
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,105
So, do you want her?

52
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,235
Do you want to fuck her?

53
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,030
You chump! She's plastic

54
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,025
I told you he couldn't tell.

55
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,830
I mean, he's plastic himself.

56
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,915
Oh, yeah, right, Jason.
You fell for it, too.

57
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,210
It's not even a real girl.
It's a deluxe sex doll.

58
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,925
I saw it on this website.

59
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,525
See? you design it yourself.

60
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,695
You pick the parts
all anatomically accurate,

61
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:43,095
made from medical grade materials,
photo-realistic.

62
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,600
It's too creepy.

63
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,640
Can't be real. I bet it's a joke.

64
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,035
It just lays there.
ใช่

65
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:51,005
I mean, you'd think it would plug in,
move or something, like a hot box.

66
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,335
Well, that's the creepy part.

67
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,110
It's a doll. It just...

68
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,280
- It just lays there.
- Yeah.

69
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,560
You do all the work,
just like real life.

70
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,980
It's got silicone rubber skin,
ceramic teeth, and real human hair.

71
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:05,985
Whatever happened to sugar and spice
and everything nice?

72
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,055
Who needs that when you've got

73
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,225
"soft openings to accommodate
your every pleasure"?

74
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:12,525
Hey, Kenneth, even you
could get lucky with her.

75
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,795
It's even got a spring-loaded arm
for hand jobs.

76
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,965
What kind of weirdo
is gonna spend $10,000 on a sex doll?

77
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,720
Hey, you don't have to take a sex doll

78
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,605
to go and see "The English Patient".

79
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,245
Um, heads up. Novak.

80
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,365
You have something for me?

81
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:02,510
Uh...

82
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,415
I heard you're really fast. I thought
I might get a head start on the new pages.

83
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Thanks.

84
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,955
Oh, that's it? What a relief.

85
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,625
I thought you were gonna bury me.

86
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,625
It's very dense.
I have to organize.

87
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,065
Oh, I'm not complaining.

88
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm still trying to figure out
that clunky word-processor program.

89
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,730
Just can't seem to make
that computer work.

90
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,170
You're the star technical writer.

91
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,405
Maybe you could explain it to me or...

92
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
Uh...

93
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:42,940
Never mind.
I'll...See you tomorrow.

94
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,950
Wait!

95
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,740
Thanks a lot.

96
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:38,535
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm Lisa. I'm new here.

97
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:42,500
And I just wanted
to introduce myself.

98
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,635
Dotson. Sheremy here doesn't believe me
about the sex doll.

99
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,200
Go ahead.
Show him the picture.

100
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,675
Marvels of modern science, my boy.

101
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,070
It was here this morning.
Where is it?

102
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,270
<i>Sheremy, where's my stuff?</i>

103
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,250
<i>It was right here.</i>

104
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,580
What's wrong with you?
This is all you got?

105
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,545
You're behind
schedule already.

106
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,050
You used to be on time,
like clockwork.

107
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,300
The temp girl isn't setting any
speed records either.

108
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,180
I'll catch up this weekend.

109
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,680
It's just a very
complicated program, sir.

110
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,595
Kenneth, if you can't handle it,
I'll get someone else who can.

111
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,165
What you need to do
to get your head on straigh

112
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:43,395
Do it. Fast.

113
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:01,580
<i>Oh...Hello</i>

114
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,015
<i>My name is Nikki.</i>

115
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,750
<i>I want to fully embody your desire.</i>

116
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,320
<i>What kind of girl
do you dream about?</i>

117
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:10,645
<i>Full-figured?</i>

118
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,960
Too cheap.

119
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,435
<i>Exotic?</i>

120
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,610
Too scary.

121
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,305
<i>Willowy?</i>

122
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,150
Yes. like that.

123
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,855
<i>I want to be pretty for you.</i>

124
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,695
<i>What color eyes do you like?</i>

125
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,865
Green.

126
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,000
<i>What kind of mouth
do you want to kiss?</i>

127
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,940
<i>Like this?</i>

128
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,475
<i>Do you like my breasts?</i>

129
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,280
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

130
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,615
<i>Please give me arms to hold you.
Now</i>

131
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,150
<i>my legs...</i>

132
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,670
<i>Mr. Kenneth Winslow?</i>

133
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,370
Yeah.

134
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,415
<i>This is a telebanking
associate from Concord Savings.</i>

135
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,675
<i>I'm calling to verify
an overdraft to your account--</i>

136
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,815
<i>an electronic debit of $10,750</i>

137
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,750
<i>to Modern Leisure Appliances</i>

138
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,085
<i>Your overdraft protection covers
your account until the end of the month.</i>

139
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,955
<i>At that time,
the balance must be paid in full.</i>

140
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,060
Ok. well, uh...
That should be fine.

141
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,445
I'm working on a big project,
and I have a bonus coming, so--

142
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:58,890
<i>thank you for using Concord savings.</i>

143
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,610
What is in the box?

144
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,670
It's a refrigerator.

145
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,590
Kind of small for a refrigerator.

146
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,760
"Modern Leisure Appliances."
Never heard of them.

147
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,725
Be careful. It's new paint.

148
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,855
- What's in the crate?
- A new refrigerator.

149
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,240
Oh. We're about ready for a new fridge.
Let's take a look.

150
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:06,020
We'll have to unpack it
to get it through the door.

151
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,865
Good idea. I'll get the tools.

152
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,545
Hey, listen. Watch yourself.

153
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,440
Living next-door
to the manager...

154
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,390
You never know these days...

155
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,240
About your neighbors...

156
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,920
มีบางอย่างแปลกๆกับผู้ชายคนนั้น

157
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,360
Just let me know
if he causes any trouble.

158
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:36,400
Let's open the baby up.

159
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,875
I'm calling because I'm not
satisfied with the, uh...

160
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,935
Product.

161
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,745
Yes, I do still have
the original packaging.

162
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,770
Yes, it has... been used,
but...

163
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:28,390
I understand.

164

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,670
<i>Fill me with your erotic imagination.</i>

<i>Make me like someone you want,</i>

00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,010
<i>maybe like someone you already know.</i>

170
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,205
Oh. hey, uh...I still haven't finished...
the other pages. You know, it's...

171
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:06,350
<i>What kind of music does she like?</i>

172
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,125

<i>What makes her happy?
What makes her hot?</i>

175
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,590
You're the star technical writer.
Maybe you could

176
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,030
explain it to me or...

177
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,260
Right here? In the typing pool?

178
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,995
It is after hours.

179
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,830
What if someone sees us?

180
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,050
Well...if you think it will help.

181
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:34,915
- Where's Lisa?
- Lisa's way behind in her work.

182
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,580
She got in a row with a supervisor.

183
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,715
Now she's in the head,
crying her eyes out.

184
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,850
I...i've got to let her go.

185
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,420
I have a system with Lisa.
Look. volume one it's already finished.

186
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:51,205
- She just needs to typeset it.
- Too much drama. I'll get you another typist.

187
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,695
Sir, I really like working with Lisa.

188
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,700
Volume one.
You can't argue with results.

189
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:08,130
Where are you going?
You can't leave now. We're just getting started.

190
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,230
I can't get anything to work.
I can't get anyone to help.

191
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,850
Everyone hates me
because I'm a temp,

192
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,505
as if I want their
stupid jobs anyways.

193
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,460
I tried to catch up, you know.

194
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,590
The supervisor wouldn't let me stay late,

195
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,700
said I might steal office supplies.

196
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,795
Can you... Can you believe it?

197
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:31,435
Well...maybe I could
show you a few things

198
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,340
after hours,
if you think it would help.

199
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:36,705
Oh, I don't know.

200
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,810
I can't go back there, you know.

201
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:41,545
Everyone is so hateful.

202
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,220
I started out in the typing pool.

203
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,055
I know what it's like down here.

204
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,680
All right.

205
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,865
Run macro after format.

206
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,550
You know, I did desktop publishing,
"'zines and stuff,"

207
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,000
Which is why I thought
I'd be good here.

208
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:11,755
- This is so different.
- What are 'zines?

209
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,130
Like a magazine.

210
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,540
You write about yourself,
your hobbies, anything.

211
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,885
It's kind of embarrassing.

212
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,155
But 'zines were the rage in high school.

213
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,440
I don't know.

214
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:29,430
It seems sort of naive
and self-implorive now.

215
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,710
I'm sorry I had that meltdown today.
It seems kind of funny now, right?

216
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,035
All that angst over instruction manuals
no one even reads.

217
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,585
What do you mean?

218
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,190
Well, think about it.

219
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,145
I mean, all over the world,
there are vcrs blinking 12 A.M.

220
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,825
One of the first things
people throw away.

221
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:58,415
Yeah. uh...
Macro "l" to justify.

222
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:04,130
And function 6 to repaginate.

223
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,165
Done.

224
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Then e-mail the completed
document to print shop.

225
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,330
It's so easy when you explain it.

226
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,810
Everything's easy if you
just read the instructions.

227
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,550
I've been watching you with the new girl.

228
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,060
Sorry, sir. You startled me.

229
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:42,415
- What exactly are your intentions?
- Intentions?

230
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,165
I see preferential treatment
over senior typists

231
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:49,155
in exchange for after-hours fraternizing
in company offices.

232
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,900
Careful, Kenneth.

233
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,005
Even a temp can sue this company
for sexual harassment.

234
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,020
But I'm not harassing. I'm--

235
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:02,045
Hate to give you a citation.
You have a spotless record.

236
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,190
I've always considered you
the model employee.

237
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,575
Home Carpentry Instruction Manual

238
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,620
- Where did you find this jacket?
- Oh, some thrift store.

239
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:28,095
It creeps me out,
shopping at those places.

240
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,830
I could be wearing dead people's clothes.

241
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,000
The first thing I'm gonna do when I get a new job
I'm gonna get some new clothes,

242
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,445
And not just new to me, but really new.

243
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:49,390
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.

244
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,775
I couldn't help
but notice your ensemble.

245
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,600
It's a very good look for you.

246
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,900
No. it's not too daring at all.

247
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,200
It's... very professional.

248
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,295
I, uh...
I was actually wondering if, uh...

249
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:21,090
You'd...like to go to a movie
with me or something.

250
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,185
{\an8}"The English Patient"

251
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,830
I never realized how empty my life was
till I met you.

252
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:56,125
Now I don't know
how I ever lived without you.

253
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:00,295
I'm so glad we found each other.

254
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:22,950
Print it.

255
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,990
One down, 2 to go.
You kids make a great team.

256
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,570
Lisa, just toss that temp badge
and join us full-time.

257
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,065
- You mean I'm hired? I have a job?
- Welcome aboard, my dear.

258
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:39,220
Kimberly will set up your paperwork,
your parking card...

259
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,430
- Thank you.
- Your insurance forms, your...

260
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,455
Come on.

261
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,580
Kenneth Winslow.

262
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,555
Hello.?

263
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,670
Nikki, is that you?

264
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:26,755
<i>Kenneth, on deck.</i>

265
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,575
- Hey, Ken, here you go.
Volume one. Good work.
- Thank you.

266
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,700
You're the best copy
writer I've got, Ken.

267
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:37,315
I need you in the bullpen,

268
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,655
and seeing how you turned this job around,
I owe you better.

269
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,375
Congratulations.
I'm promoting you to editor.

270
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:48,800
- What about the manual?
- Well, you still got to finish 2 volumes,

271
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:52,550
but you can work in your new office
instead of in the bullpen.

272
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:34,800
Come in.

273
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:41,765
Congratulations.
I heard about your promotion.

274
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:45,940
Yeah. I can't really start editing, though,
until I finish the manual.

275
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:47,995
Well, now we both have something
to celebrate.

276
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,100
You doing anything special?

277
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,825
I hadn't really thought about it.
Why? Are you?

278
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,600
- You know.
- I do?

279
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,270
I told you.

280
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,955
When I got a real job,
I am getting new clothes.

281
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,240
Well... new to you or really new?

282
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:08,670
A girl I know shops at this place.

283
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:21,805
It's a very good look for you.
It's very professional.

284
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,770
Clothes. New job.

285
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:31,190
New me. I'll take it.

286
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,840
Hey, honey. Uh...

287
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:15,410
Sorry I'm late.
I, uh...Got home a...

288
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,815
Of course I appreciate
all you've done for me.

289
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:24,700
Well, I got home as soon as I could.

290
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,465
I... I didn't know you were so jealous.

291
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,380
Ken, are you ok?
I tried to catch you downstairs,

292
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,163
but I couldn't keep up in these heels.
I...

293
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:22,195
It's you, isn't it?

294
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:25,530
Please, leave me alone.

295
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,400
What do you want from me? I...

296
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:37,865
Can I come in?

297
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:40,865
- You look kind of stressed.
- Do I?

298
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:45,605
Yeah. you've been working too hard.

299
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:52,430
- I think you need to take some time off.
- Yeah. I need to finish volume 2.

300
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:59,210
It's for volume 2.

301
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,210
After all you've done for me,
I wanted to help you for a change.

302
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,500
Wow. it's clear. It's simple.

303
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,505
You're better than most
of our staff writers.

304
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,630
I just tried to imagine
how you would write it

305
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:26,480
I mean, it needs some editing, but...

306
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,345
So edit.
That's your new job, right?

307
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,870
Well, I've...

308
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,425
ขอฉันทำเล่ม 2 ให้เสร็จ

309
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,650
You can edit my pages on Monday,
and we'll still be on schedule.

310
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,640
Oh...i don't know.

311
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,815
Come on. Stay home this weekend.
Relax.

312
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,560
Do something special.

313
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,060
I, uh... need to talk to you
about something.

314
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,745
I think...

315
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,695
Maybe we should slow down a bit,

316
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:31,280
Give each other some breathing room.

317
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,625
Maybe...

318
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,340
Even...

319
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,530
See other people.

320
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,185
You're wrong.

321
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,820
Lisa's not like that.

322
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,640
I mean, you make it sound so cheap.

323
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,820
She thinks I'm special.
She understands me. You...

324
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,900
Why would you do that?

325
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,505
Please, please. Ok, listen.
I'll do anything you say.

326
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,330
Just please don't tell her
about us, ok?

327
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,970
Let's stay up.

328
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:46,750
<i>Modern Leisure Appliance technical support.</i>

329
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,530
<i>May I help you?</i>

330
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,103
There's something wrong
with the doll you sold me.

331
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,090
It's out of control.
It's telling me to do these terrible things.

332
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,945
- Please, just tell me how to turn it off.
<i>- Uh, sir...</i>

333
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:02,470
Yes, dear, I'm coming.

334
00:45:44,015 --> 00:45:46,620
Kenneth, what are you doing here?

335
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,820
You're supposed
to be relaxing this weekend.

336
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,435
What are you holding?

337
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:56,560
Chinese food.

338
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,950
Well, when I first came here,
I felt totally out of place, but...

339
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:01,605
now it's all going great.

340
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:06,390
- But...then there's something else?
- Well, just getting used to the grind,

341
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,520
you know. Growing up. Nothing special.

342
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,490
Tell me. We're the only ones here.

343
00:46:15,195 --> 00:46:18,210
Work is so...Cold, you know,

344
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,200
Impersonal compared to school...

345
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,910
Especially art school.

346
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,195
It's like we don't even
really matter as people. We're just...

347
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,190
Tools, robots.

348
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,135
I feel that way all the time.

349
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:37,510
I could disappear,
and no one would even notice,

350
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:40,645
as long as Novak met his deadline.

351
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:43,250
No one really cares.

352
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,155
I care.

353
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:50,820
I know.

354
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,565
I'm glad.

355
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:31,940
You're insane.

356
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,570
No! you don't know what I want!
I want Lisa!

357
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,435
That's horrible. Shut up!

358
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,935
Shut up! Shut up!

359
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:57,080
I told you,
it's over between us.

360
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:23,845
A couple of weeks ago,
she was ready to jump ship.

361
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,160
Think she's got what it takes
to make a tech writer?

362
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,110
She's very good, and I've been
training her after hours and weekends.

363
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,345
She has a real talent for tech writing.

364
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,415
- 2 down. One more to go.
- Carry on.

365
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,040
- Come right over here
- Ok.

366
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,540
I have ADSL on my Internet.

367
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,690
- So if you ever want to use that, just come on over.
- โอเคค่ะ

368
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,750
Oh, yeah?

369
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Yeah. I think there's,
like, apple Martinis and stuff.

370
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:07,780
Hey. uh...

371
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,030
<i>What's up with him?</i>

372
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,320
We're ahead of schedule.
So I was wondering

373
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,340
if you might like
to have dinner tonight.

374
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,030
Yeah. sure. That...That...
That would be great.

375
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:25,105
Yeah?

376
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,265
The Chinese food place
right around the corner...

377
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,070
- it's still open if you...
- You always eat Chinese food?

378
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,480
No. I'm...I thought you liked Chinese food.

379
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,995
No, no, no. I do. I do.

380
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,695
Just, you know, not every day.
You need variety.

381
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:46,450
Yeah. I, uh...
I don't know much about food.

382
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,180
Oh. oh, I see.

383
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,520
So you're a virgin

384
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,715
Well, relax. I am an experienced foodie.

385
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,795
I will take care of you. Let's see...

386
00:49:56,685 --> 00:50:01,010
Let's do something exotic.
How about Indian food? My treat.

387
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:05,345
Sure. I want to try everything.

388
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:44,210
Would you like to come inside?

389
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:47,295
Yeah.

390
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,940
I...didn't have time to clean up.

391
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,200
- I wasn't expecting company.
- It's all right.

392
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:06,115
- Drink?
- Sure.

393
00:51:32,505 --> 00:51:34,590
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

394
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,005
Cheers.

395
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,335
What's in your mouth?

396
00:52:44,545 --> 00:52:46,395
My tongue ring.
You never noticed.

397
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:50,710
No.

398
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:07,675
That's my guardian angel.

399
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,860
You did this to me! You!

400
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:47,790
Why do you keep following me?
Why won't you let me go?

401
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,875
It is over between us!
Over!

402
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,640
Let me go, please.

403
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Please. Let me go.

404
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,930
Bitch!

405
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:36,800
<i>I told you to leave me alone!</i>

406
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,890
It doesn't feel very good,
does it? Huh?

407
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,730
I'm gonna make you like Lisa.

408
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,445
And a tattoo on your chest.

409
00:56:01,615 --> 00:56:03,215
<i>How that feel?</i>

410
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,500
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

411
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:38,080
I just wanted to apologize
for the other night.

412
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,920
Let's just drop it.

413
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,970
This girl Nikki
I used to see a long time ago...

414
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,075
She stalked and attacked me.

415
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:53,865
Last night just...

416
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,100
Brought back memories,

417
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:57,305
and I was too ashamed to tell you.

418
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,510
I'm...i'm sorry, Kenny.
I had no idea.

419
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,270
I just...Nikki's gone for good.

420
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,780
I just don't want to lose you.

421
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,290
Come on.

422
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,480
Are the indicate functions
in the category menu or the select menu?

423
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,635
That's a data-entry question.
Volume one...

424
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,890
- I can't even remember.
- I'll look it up.

425
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,650
Volume one seems like such a long time ago.

426
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,150
So much has happened
since we started this project.

427
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,735
I know.

428
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:11,280
Whoa, pardon me.

429
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,450
I was just going to tell you how pleased I am
with your work on the manual.

430
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:19,075
- Thank you, Mr. novak.
- Is there anything else?

431
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:21,440
Get back to work.

432
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,300
{\an8}"All my love, Nikki"?

433
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,180
What...what is this?

434
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:55,685
We...we're wearing the same clothes,

435
01:02:55,745 --> 01:02:59,145
Kenneth, and the same hair.

436
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,730
You...you wanted me to be like
your ex-girlfriend?

437
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,980
The stalker?

438
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,300
No.

439
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,325
All along, you just wanted me
to be like Nikki.

440
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,465
You never cared about me.
You were just using me?

441
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,550
All the help here at work,
it was just a game?

442
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,330
- That's not...
- How do you explain this, huh?

443
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:24,990
What's your story of this...

444
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,320
You wanted me to be like...
A rubber sex doll?

445
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:44,575
What kind of a person are you?

446
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,165
Please don't do this to me.

447
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:48,295
I'm sorry. Please.
I'll do anything you say.

448
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,550
You stay away from me.

449
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:52,135
Lisa...

450
01:03:53,845 --> 01:03:55,839
What the hell is going on?

451
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,920
It looks bad, you being
her immediate superior.

452
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I've got to protect the company
from any harassment claims.

453
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:06,480
That's a demerit.
It's on your permanent record.

454
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:10,440
Any further contact with miss Belmer
will be grounds for termination.

455
01:04:10,645 --> 01:04:12,575
But I need her help to finish the manual.

456
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,130
Move on, sailor.

457
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,525
Find a new girl.

458
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:25,455
<i>Thank you. Please stay on line
as we process your order.</i>

459
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:30,665
<i>Transaction denied.
Credit limit exceeded.</i>

460
01:04:43,595 --> 01:04:45,705
<i>Customer service.
How may I help you?</i>

461
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:47,725
Hello. Modern Leisure Appliances ?

462
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,850
Hi. I'm calling from
Accurate Technical Publishing.

463
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,445
We write instruction manuals,
and as an introduction,

464
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:56,675
We'd like to revise your current manual,

465
01:04:56,765 --> 01:04:58,510
Free of charge.

466
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,690
I notice your current manual doesn't cover
certain operating problems, certain complications.

467
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,050
certain complications.

468
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:11,435
แน่นอน ผมต้องการ...

469
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:16,340
- We'll need a sample model for resear...
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>

470
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,490
I know it's just an oversight,
but your rent is due.

471
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,800
I have to charge you a late fee
if you don't pay soon.

472
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,005
<i>This is a message for Mr. Kenneth Winslow
from Concord savings.</i>

473
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:59,155
<i>Your overdraft is now due.</i>

474
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:03,810
<i>This is Steve from the print shop.
I'm still waiting on those files.</i>

475
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,300
<i>Kenneth, I've got too much riding on this project
for you to screw it up.</i>

476
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,350
<i>Watch it. It's your job.</i>

477
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,840
I usually don't ask,
but I was wondering

478
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,175
if you could advance me the bonus
you promised.

479
01:06:45,385 --> 01:06:47,260
Bonus?

480
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,475
These pages are unusable.
They're incoherent.

481
01:06:52,685 --> 01:06:55,285
For the last week, Lisa
has been rewriting your work.

482
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,435
I can't carry you anymore.

483
01:06:56,645 --> 01:07:01,025
But you promised me
my usual rate and a bonus.

484
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,705
Kenneth...

485
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,815
You're fired.

486
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:28,760
- We need to talk. I need you. It's...
- You shouldn't be here.

487
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,420
At least speak to Novak.
Get me my old job back.

488
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,540
Anything! Even the typing pool!

489
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:39,605
You're not gonna help me,
after everything I've done for you?

490
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,220
Unbelievably Lifelike

491
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,330
Discreet shipping and delivery

492
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,710
Modern Leisure Appliances

493
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,780
Honey, can you get that?

494
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,055
Doris!

495
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,395
This better be important. I'm busy.

496
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:06,360
<i>- It's radley, the manager downstairs.</i>
- Yeah. what do you want?

497
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:12,170
I don't know exactly,
but I saw something very suspicious.

498
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:15,535
<i>I don't know if it's
a murder or a sex doll.</i>

499
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,680
Hey, I'm off-duty, ok?
If this is for real, call 911.

500
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,375
If this is some pervy joke,
I'll bust you for making a false report.

501
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,465
Never mind. It's probably nothing.

502
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,605
Weirdo.

503
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,210
How's your head?

504
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:13,485
Lucky I wrote that first-aid manual.

505
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,340
What...what do you
want from me?

506
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:25,395
I just think
we need to spend some time together,

507
01:10:25,605 --> 01:10:27,270
Just to work things out.

508
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,040
What about Mr. novak's manual?

509
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,580
He's probably looking for me right now.

510
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,120
Everything's on schedule.

511
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,120
It's easy to write
now that we're back together.

512
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,300
I can just e-mail it to the print shop
under your account.

513
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,530
It's like you said,
no one will even miss you.

514
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,750
Come here.

515
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,560
Relationships are a 2-way street.

516
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:09,815
I'm doing all the work,
and you're not even trying!

517
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:28,165
I think you need to take some time off to relax,
just think about things maybe.

518
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:56,530
Maybe he'll go away.
It's gonna be fine.

519
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,715
Hello?

520
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:23,905
Anyone home?

521
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,395
Who is there?

522
01:12:35,108 --> 01:12:36,983
Oh, my god.

523
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,815
Hurry. he's somewhere
in the apartment.

524
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:46,995
Calm down. I'll call the police.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

525
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,655
You shouldn't be here.

526
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,600
Sorry.

527
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,620
I didn't mean to hit you like that.

528
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,175
Nikki, is that you?

529
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:46,430
I made such a terrible mess of everything.
I miss you so much.

530
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:49,550
I just want to make things
right between us.

531
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:52,770
Is there any way
that we can just start over?

532
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:54,835
What should I do?
Ask me anything.

533
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,575
Ok.

534
01:15:17,255 --> 01:15:20,175
You know, Nikki and I
thought we were all alone,

535
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,675
until we found others who were
just like us on the Internet.

536
01:15:25,485 --> 01:15:29,655
They taught me all about
bone plastination,

537
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:32,410
how to preserve your body for Nikki.

538
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,140
You know, everything's easy
if you just read the instructions.

539
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,960
Nikki is really...

540
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:42,020
The only one...

541
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,349
That understands me.

542
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,010
You know, it's not enough

543
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,030
just to talk to her.

544
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,230
I need to be with her, hold her.

545
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:59,480
So I'm gonna give her your body.

546
01:16:10,325 --> 01:16:14,285
Nikki? Uh, nothing.
Excuse me.

547
01:16:14,495 --> 01:16:15,790
Nikki...

548
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:19,765
Honey...

549
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,420
You know she means nothing to me.

550
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,585
We...we were just talking.

551
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:29,920
Lower calf incisions Embalming Tools

552
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,555
I e-mailed it to the print shop.
They know what you did.

553
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,110
Don't you understand?

554
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,475
They're gonna call the cops.
They'll be here any minute.

555
01:16:45,495 --> 01:16:48,835
You have to stop! Just stop!

556
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,230
Stop!

557
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,570
Nikki warned me
about girls like you.

558
01:16:58,288 --> 01:17:02,458
Nikki is not alive.
She's just a doll. She isn't real!

559
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,835
She's not alive!

560
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,990
She's not real. She's not real.

561
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,195
Listen to me...

562
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,390
Just because she's not alive
doesn't mean she isn't real.

563
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,940
Accurate Technical Publishing

564
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:32,755
Yeah, yeah, put it in Betty's file.

565
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:35,675
Knock it off. Shape up.

566
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:39,030
You jokers could take
some pointers from Lisa belmer.

567
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,675
What? the cute girl?

568
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,320
- I thought she quit.
- Quit?

569
01:18:43,025 --> 01:18:45,685
She finished the manual...
Right on schedule.

570
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,900
- Where is she?
- We haven't seen her all week.

571
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,520
All week? Well,
where did these come from?

572
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:22,160
The owner's totally freaked.

573
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,060
Last week, somebody tossed
a mannequin in the same dumpster.

574
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:30,075
Like a...Some kind of rehearsal.
This time, it's a real body.

575
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,795
It's a small world after all.

576
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,635
- You know the corpse?
- The manager of my apartment building.

577
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,755
Wow.

578
01:20:40,275 --> 01:20:41,785
Maybe the neighbors saw something.

579
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,455
No, they're a bunch of degenerates.

580
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:48,300
Hold it. I know the guy
who lives next door.

581
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,605
He's, like, a regular Joe.

582
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,245
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

583
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,780
<i>Kenneth winslow, this is detective Martin Quinley
with the Los Angeles police department.</i>

584
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,495
<i>Do you remember me?
We're neighbors</i>

585
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,480
<i>Anyway, we were talking just a few weeks ago
when you got that new refrigerator. How's it working?</i>

586
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,960
Well, you know that oddball
apartment manager.

587
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,730
<i>Well, he got himself killed,</i>

588
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,715
<i>and since you live next door,
I figured I'd call</i>

589
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,550
<i>and see if you noticed anything unusual.</i>

590
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,300
<i>I had my suspicions about that guy.
He didn't seem right.</i>

591
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,260
<i>So, better be careful
until we get thissorted out.</i>

592
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:39,820
<i>Thanks for your help.
And have a nice day.</i>

593
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:41,330
He's probably at work.

594
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:45,660
Maybe we should check out
the body's apartment. May be some clues.

595
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,250
Yeah. why not? It's on my way home.
I'll surprise the missus.

596
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,540
You had lunch yet?

597
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,500
I have to empty a few major arteries

598
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:59,570
to let you out and pour Nikki in.

599
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,620
She hasn't been here.

600
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,290
Maybe she e-mailed her work
directly to the print shop.

601
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:36,540
This embalming fluid
will end your suffering

602
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:40,085
and preserve
your beauty for Nikki.

603
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:14,495
Relationships come and go,
but plastination is forever.

604
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,180
She sent the first file Tuesday night.

605
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,590
- She sent a new file yesterday.
- What file?

606
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,265
Forget it. That thing's
giving me a headache.

607
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,105
Besides, radley's already dead.
What's the hurry?

608
01:23:56,415 --> 01:23:59,505
What do you mean, 2 whole days
before I can report a missing person?

609
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,080
No one's seen her all week.

610
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,505
- Here's that new file.
- Hold it.

611
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:07,050
Jesus Christ.

612
01:24:10,805 --> 01:24:13,320
Screw them. Screw the cops.

613
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:16,015
I don't need them.
I can take care of myself.

614
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,445
Killing... killing
is too good for you.

615
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,470
I'm gonna show them
what you really are.

616
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,670
I'm gonna lock you up in that box

617
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,725
and deliver you to the police myself.

618
01:24:51,885 --> 01:24:55,220
You knew what you were doing to me!
You studied it.

619
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,185
Planned it all out, huh?
Everything you did to me!

620
01:25:00,435 --> 01:25:02,730
Now it's your turn!

621
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:06,070
Die, you sick fuck! Die!

622
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,330
Looks like we got here just in time.

623
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,605
You ok, buddy?

624
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:47,730
Kenneth.

625
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,640
Back already?
What about your medical leave?

626
01:25:50,665 --> 01:25:52,340
I just wanted to get back to work, sir.

627
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,590
It's horrible what happened...

628
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,100
Lisa holding you captive
in your own apartment,

629
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,375
e-mailing her work
so she could stay and torture you.

630
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,500
She always seemed like such a...

631
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:08,190
Nice girl. A little high-strung, though.

632
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,870
Well, there's no way that
the company could have known.

633
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:15,070
- We're as much the victim here as anybody.
- Of course.

634
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:19,450
Uh...

635
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:23,020
I was going to mail this to you,
but since you're here...

636
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,290
A bonus.

637
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,400
Just like I promised.

638
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,315
Welcome back, sailor.

639
01:26:55,285 --> 01:26:57,735
Nikki is a very lucky girl.

640
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,310
Well, you're always
buying flowers for her.

641
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,380
She's very lucky to have a guy like you.

642
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,625
Someone who really knows
how to treat a girl,

643
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,480
how to make her feel special.

644
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,450
That's real romantic.
