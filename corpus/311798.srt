90,,,

26
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,273
Burt. Shut that
bloody thing up.

27
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,469
Do you know what time
it is? Burt!

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,082
Burt! You stupid old bastard!

29
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,979
What do you think
you're doing?

30
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,982
Sorry George,
what did you say?

31
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,712
Do you know what time it is?

32
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,491
I'm sorry, I've got a heck
of a lot to get done today.

33
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,786
And you know what they say.
"The early bird catches the worm".

34
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,661
Well, if you do this again,
one more time, I'm calling the cops.

35
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,568
And how about
mowing your lawns?

36
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,765
It's a bloody disgrace
to the neighborhood.

37
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,604
Oh, alright.

38
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,346
Hi, kid.

39
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,999
Here we are, the...

40
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,532
perfect recipe...

41
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,234
two of Chevy...

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,742
one of Ford.

43
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,846
I think those '36 Chevy pistons...

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,557
must have a touch of titanium
or something in them.

45
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,524
They come up real good,
you know.

46
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,220
Hey the kettle's boiling.

47
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,465
Make yourself useful,
make some tea.

48
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,039
Can we have a biscuit too?

49
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,098
- What?
- Can I have a Gingernut?

50
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,538
Yeah, you know where they are,
help yourself.

51
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,944
Now you stay over there,
stay there.

52
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,355
- Right.
- What are you doing for Christmas, Burt?

53
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,428
Christmas? I don't know.
Why?

54
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,757
Are you angling
for a present or something?

55
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,861
- No, I wondered if you were going away.
- No...

56
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,799
no time for Christmas, lad.
Got a lot of work to do.

57
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,135
I only managed twenty seven
test runs this year.

58
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,304
You know, twenty four on the beach
and three on the road.

59
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,173
All illegal like.

60
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,510
I was going a bit over the speed limit,
I'll have to admit.

61
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,155
- How fast were you going?
- I don't know, I haven't a clue.

62
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,189
That's why I have to get up
to Bonneville.

63
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,159
Found out how fast she will go.

64
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,610
Now, there you go.

65
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,342
Got to get the piston out
of the mould...

66
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,546
and Bob's your uncle.

67
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,114
Right, this is...

68
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,223
the last part
of the operation now.

69
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,720
To chill the metal.

70
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,991
It heat treats it.
Right, watch yourself.

71
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,060
That's where I got the water
for the kettle from.

72
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:48,137
Well, you know, it gives the tea
a nice tang of titanium, doesn't it?

73
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,305
Now this bloke,
he once asked me...

74
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,437
"How do you heat treat your pistons?"
And I said: "I don't, mate"...

75
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,507
I just, you know, bung them
in cold water and Bob's your uncle".

76
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,348
And he said:
"Well, that's the heat treatment"...

77
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,481
and he just laughed and
shook his head and walked away like.

78
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,386
Well, look this could be
the perfect piston.

79
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,225
It blooming well ought to be,
I've made hundreds of them.

80
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,830
Look at them all up there,
all blown to smithereens.

81
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,300
- You made all those?
- Yeah, I did. Look perfect.

82
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,706
Beautiful, no inclusions see?

83
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,441
Now Tommy, does your mother have
a carving knife I could borrow?

84
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,844
Carving knife? Yeah?

85
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,844
Yeah.
I need a good sharp knife.

86
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,622
Hang on.

87
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,655
- Thomas, what are you up to?
- Nothing, Mum.

88
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,056
Can I have some bread
and peanut butter?

89
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,860
Ok, but make sure you put everything
away when you've finished.

90
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,398
Sorry about that.

91
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,446
Tom.

92
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,144
- Don't forget the wood.
- No, Mum.

93
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,013
Right.

94
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,153
I hope to get as much...

95
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,754
rubber off as possible.

96
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,820
It has to be perfectly bald,
like that, you see.

97
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,823
- Why's that?
- Well, at high speed...

98
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,262
the centrifugal force...

99
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,763
expands the tyre and...

100
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,944
it rubs against
the frame of the bike.

101
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,770
Have to be careful not to cut
through the cords though.

102
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,646
- Why do you pee on your lemon tree?
- What?

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,320
Why do you pee on your
lemon tree?

104
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,691
- Who says I do that?
- Mum says she sees you...

105
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,160
every morning and
she goes on and on about it.

106
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,691
Does she?

107
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,834
Well, it's good for it. You shouldn't
waste anything in this world, sonny.

108
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,170
- Well, I'd better be off home.
- Alright then.

109
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,603
Mum gets a bit cross if
I stay over here too long.

110
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,809
She does.

111
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,383
- Are you finished with the knife?
- Not yet, I'll drop it by later.

112
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,678
No, don't do that,
I'll pick it up after school tomorrow.

113
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,147
Alright.

114
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,389
- Bye.
- Cheerio.

115
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,129
- Burt Munro.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,501
I believe you have
my carving knife.

117
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,774
- Oh yes.
- And my sharpener.

118
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,739
Hang on, here we are.

119
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,613
Well, thanks a lot, love.

120
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,261
G'day Frank. How are you?

121
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,990
Oh not bad, could be better,
could be worse.

122
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,124
I see your front tyre's going
a bit flat on you there, Burt.

123
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,700
Yeah, well, the good news is,
it's only flat on the bottom.

124
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,005
I'll see you tomorrow night
for the fun and games.

125
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:09,973
It'll be a good one.

126
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,369
Hello, Fran.

127
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,616
- Give us the lot will you? The usual.
- One pension check. Coming up.

128
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,351
Fran...

129
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,515
I want to ask you a question,
the answer to which is...

130
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,286
a definite yes.

131
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,022
- Alright, Fran?
- Alright.

132
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,822
Yes.

133
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,027
What is the question, Burt?

134
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,729
Would you feel inclined to,
you know, accompany...

135
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,540
an impeccable young gentleman
to a local do tomorrow night?

136
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,709
You're asking me on a date,
Burt Munro?

137
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,080
Well, yeah, I suppose
I am actually, aren't I?

138
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,043
- Would you?
- You're on.

139
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,922
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Burt.

140
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,361
That's disgusting.

141
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,764
It is, isn't it?

142
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,730
All dressed up
for the do tonight...

143
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,566
and I couldn't get
my best shoes on...

144
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,164
because my toe nails had grown
like oyster shells.

145
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,170
Alright...

146
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,077
this should do the trick.

147
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,945
There, look at that.

148
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,477
Little twinkle toes.

149
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,424
- Thanks, Burt.
- Right on.

150
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,733
- Evening, Burt.
- Thank you...

151
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,164
- this is Fran.
- Hello, Fran.

152
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,906
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,040
- Hello, Duncan.
- Burt.

154
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,780
Just going to say hello and be back
in a second, love, alright?

155
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,075
- How are you?
- Bike going well?

156
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,546
Yeah, not too bad.

157
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,081
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Thanks a lot, mate.

158
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,413
This is a bit of
a surprise, isn't it?

159
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,659
Would you like to buy
a raffle ticket or two?

160
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,663
- What's it for?
- Porky the Pig plus two dozen beers.

161
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,593
We're raising money to send
Burt to the USA. Our mate, Burt.

162
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,638
Hello. Come on and dance.

163
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,540
- What's this? The twist?
- This is the twist. You know the twist?

164
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,703
Come twist with me.

165
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,915
See you can twist.

166
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,816
- That's it, that's it.
- This must be it, the atomic invasion,

167
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,483
Then the air clears
and the dust settles down.

168
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,323
You look outside,
have they leveled the town?

169
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,124
But there, in the yard...

170
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,063
so briskly alive...

171
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,394
stands Burt Munro's trusty...

172
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,828
old Indian Scout '45.

173
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,508
That was a wonderful
tribute to Burt.

174
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,613
Now come on Burt, we want you up
on stage, come on...

175
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,315
come on, up you come.

176
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,320
I hope all of you have bought
a raffle ticket tonight...

177
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,789
because we believe Burt will put
the Southland Motorcycle Club...

178
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,920
on the map,

179
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,199
What's going on out there?

180
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,209
Get out of here.

181
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,180
Oh, dear.

182
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:47,086
Well folks, it looks like
I've cracked it, I've um you know.

183
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,987
You Burt Munro?

184
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,389
- What did he say?
- I said, are you Burt Munro?

185
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,189
Are you looking for old Burt?

186
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,524
I don't know,
anyone seen Burt anywhere?

187
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,494
Anyone seen Burt?

188
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,768
- No, he's...
- You are, you're Burt Munro.

189
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,967
You're the old codger,
rides the Army Indian right?

190
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,473
That old joker.
Burt Munro. Yeah.

191
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,738
Yeah, that's me I think.

192
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,651
Now the, ah, young fella,
the army Indian is a real dog...

193
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,944
what I've got is the...

194
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:20,518
genuine article,
the 190 V twin Scout.

195
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,125
- That's the one with the pedals, right?
- Don't put up with that, Burt,,

196
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:30,592
No, well. Well, I don't know what sort of
push bikes you monkeys came into town on...

197
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,436
but I know my old timer would trash
the backsides of whatever they are.

198
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,301
- I don't think so, granddad.
- No.

199
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,438
Well, why don't you chaps
put your money where your mouth is?

200
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,146
You're on. You old coot.

201
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,049
- Looks like they've chickened out, Burt.
- What?

202
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,648
- Looks like they've chickened out.
- They're here.

203
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,320
They're here.

204
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,094
That's nice of them
to show up isn't it?

205
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,009
A hundred says
the Indian comes last.

206
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,542
Right.

207
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,297
Come on, Burt.

208
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,936
Ready, steady...

209
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,443
go.

210
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,743
Come on, give me a push.

211
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,146
- Come on.
- Come on, Burt.

212
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,922
Give me a push.
Come on, push hard.

213
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,618
Bugger it.

214
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,395
Bugger it.

215
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,497
Come on! Go!

216
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,600
Bugger!

217
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,506
Nice bike, granddad.

218
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,140
Loser.

219
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,729
Thanks, fellas.

220
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,326
- Better luck next time.
- Better luck, Burt.

221
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,734
There you go.

222
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,875
- Well, thanks, love.
- Careful, it's hot.

223
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,241
Well, at least I gave them
a good run for their money.

224
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,311
On the downward leg anyway.

225
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,856
Burt... What's it going to cost
to get over to America?

226
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,323
Sorry, love.
What did you say?

227
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,418
How much is it gonna cost
to get over to America?

228
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,222
I don't know,
about two thousand I'm told.

229
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,757
And how much money
have you got now?

230
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,640
Apart from today's disaster
and the dough from last and you know...

231
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,835
the pension money
I've been saving...

232
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:04,013
I'm about twelve hundred and 75 dollars,
United States dollars, I reckon.

233
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,781
Well, I could lend you some money.

234
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,888
That's very kind of you Fran love, but no.
I couldn't do that love. No, thanks.

235
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,286
Well, there must be
something you can do.

236
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,658
Well, I haven't told anyone
else this, Fran, but...

237
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:22,595
I don't reckon I'll be gonna Bonneville.
I reckon not this year anyway and...

238
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:27,135
you know, seven hundred dollars
is a lot of money to find...

239
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,570
and the boat leaves in five days.

240
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,207
Except I would like to see
how fast she would really go...

241
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,448
before I fall off the perch as it were.
Before I ah, kicked the old bucket.

242
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,365
Hello, Lloyd.

243
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,028
Gidday, Burt.

244
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,291
Shame about the fall.

245
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,401
Well, I'm still
in one piece aren't I?

246
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,872
Good,
what are you having tonight?

247
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,341
Specialty of the house,
pea, pie and pud.

248
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,135
- That's five bob.
- Alright.

249
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,971
Burt? Why don't you take out
a mortgage on your house?

250
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,013
- What house?
- Well, your property.

251
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,949
I mean it's worth something.

252
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,147
Here you are.

253
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,487
Burt Munro,
look at the color of your hands.

254
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,184
- What's the matter with them.
- You're gonna wash those mitts...

255
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,991
before you put them
anywhere near me.

256
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,626
There we are.

257
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,525
Wakee, wakee.

258
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,800
Time to rise...

259
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,270
and shine.

260
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,739
Burt, you're a sweetie.

261
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,306
Got to get out of here before
the neighbors spot me.

262
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,579
Burt, this tastes a bit odd.

263
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,788
It's metallic.

264
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,057
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

265
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,318
Oh, crikey!

266
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,058
What?

267
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,696
I've got a pain in my chest.

268
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,030
He's in the shed, hurry.

269
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,973
Mum, Dad,
something's happened to Burt.

270
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,309
Burt, what's wrong with you?

271
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,782
I'll be alright Tommy,
don't worry about me.

272
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,185
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

273
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,436
What are you all staring at?
Dirty old men need love too.

274
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,580
- Mr. Munro.
- Hello.

275
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,288
So, what's the story, Doc?

276
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,684
- I'm sorry, it's not good news.
- Oh, yeah. Well, fire away.

277
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,060
You've had an attack of angina.

278
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,061
You have arterial sclerosis.

279
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,232
And what's that?

280
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,062
It's a narrowing
of the arteries from the heart.

281
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,305
Oh, dear.

282
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,803
Yeah, I'm afraid there's not too much
we can do for you at your age...

283
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,037
other than suggesting you
take it easy.

284
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,376
Look if you have another attack,
pop one of these under your tongue...

285
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,811
Iet it dissolve
and then swallow the saliva.

286
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,353
The pain should be gone
in thirty seconds.

287
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,318
- Yeah, what do you call these things?
- Trinitrate pills.

288
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,127
Um better known as nitro glycerine.

289
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,761
- The stuff you blow things up with.
- Yes, but in much smaller quantities.

290
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,830
Alright.

291
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,770
Will this have any affect on
me riding my bike?

292
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,233
Unfortunately, I think your
motorcycling days are over.

293
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,508
Like hell they are.

294
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,522
It won't be much longer.

295
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,332
Springfield.

296
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,337
Springfield.
That's where the Indians come from.

297
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,001
- Indians?
- Yeah, the Indians...

298
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,470
from Springfield,
Massachusetts.

299
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,443
The world's greatest
motorcycle.

300
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,044
- Is that so?
- That's right.

301
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,886
- You can come through now.
- Alright, thank you.

302
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,620
Yeah, Springfield.

303
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,855
The plan is for me
to drive up to Timaru and,,,

304
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:24,134
then me and my bike...
will catch a boat to the US of A to...

305
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,569
Los Angeles,
and the boat leaves on Saturday.

306
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,399
And I'll buy a car
in Los Angeles...

307
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,069
and drive up to Utah,
to the Bonneville Salt Flats.

308
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,644
- It's really important you do this trip?
- Sure is mate, you know.

309
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,043
Ever since I was a lad I've been
interested in things that go fast...

310
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,186
you know things
that rolls and go and...

311
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,920
at Bonneville things go real fast.
It's...

312
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,491
this giant dried up lake bed...

313
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,356
and it goes for miles
and miles and it's dead flat...

314
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,401
and you can drive a vehicle just
as fast as it will go and it's.

315
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,661
So it's one of the few places
on earth...

316
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,902
where you can find out just what
you're machine is capable of.

317
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,738
In fact here I'm on the, that's me on the
front of the New Zealand Motorcyclist.

318
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,277
That's the Indian there.

319
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,543
- Very good!
- Yeah, a few years ago.

320
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,477
So I'd best be off soon...

321
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,079
because I don't know how much longer
I've got to live you see.

322
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,488
Yes, I don't think
I heard that last statement.

323
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,720
I said I don't know
how much longer I've got to live.

324
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,284
I heard you the first time.

325
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,254
So... tell me, Burt.

326
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,363
What are you offering
as collateral for this loan?

327
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:34,063
Well, my tools, my bits and pieces, my
trophies and a lot of things like this.

328
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,164
Well, I don't think they'd be
of much interest to the bank...

329
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,437
I think we'd be looking for
something more substantial.

330
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,378
Something like the deed
of title to your property.

331
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,079
- Did you get the money?
- Yep, I'm off on Thursday.

332
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,387
Thursday? That soon?
I wish I could come too.

333
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,487
Oh, maybe next time.

334
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,762
Thomas. It's dinner time.
Come home now.

335
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,125
- Nearly finished, Mrs. Jackson.
- Yeah, Mum, we're almost finished.

336
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,270
See you after dinner, Burt.

337
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,400
Alright, lad.

338
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,176
Hey, not so fast.

339
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,042
I'm the record breaker.

340
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,251
Where are you going?

341
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,651
And that's the...

342
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,353
before I put the...
you know, the streamliner on it.

343
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,658
What's that one?

344
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:41,702
That's a girlfriend of mine
when I first bought the bike.

345
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,433
It was a long time ago that was.

346
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,413
Aren't you scared you'll kill
yourself if you crash?

347
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,612
No...

348
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,713
you...

349
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,345
Iive more in five minutes
on a bike like this...

350
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,181
going flat out than some people
live in a lifetime.

351
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,583
And...

352
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,926
yeah, more in five minutes.
That's my Dad there.

353
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,598
And my mum.

354
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,432
They're all gone.

355
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,672
God, it's gone by so fast!

356
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,441
You know,
danger is the spice of life...

357
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,771
and you've got to take a risk every now
and again haven't you, son?

358
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,175
You know that's
what makes life worthwhile.

359
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:31,083
And you know,
having some nice ladies around...

360
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,653
will you pick out my bike?

361
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,524
- You really don't get scared?
- No, no.

362
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,062
You know...

363
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,193
when I was a boy
about your age...

364
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,503
I had a little twin brother
whose name was Ernie...

365
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,140
and one day our Dad was out
the back cutting down a tree...

366
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,899
and...

367
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,547
suddenly it got hung up, the tree
that is, it got stuck on something and...

368
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,917
Ernie went to go and help.
All of a sudden the tree...

369
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,414
slipped and fell on him
and killed him stone dead.

370
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,796
I always remember that.

371
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:20,002
Anyway, since then I've always tried
never to be scared of anything.

372
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,869
Although I must say before...

373
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,171
a big bike event I do
sometimes get nervous, you know...

374
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,415
if the butterflies
in my stomach were cows...

375
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,652
I'd be able to start
a dairy farm.

376
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,452
That's funny.

377
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,720
When they took you off in the ambulance
to the hospital. What happened?

378
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,656
I don't know, just a touch
of indigestion I think.

379
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,489
Yeah, that's all it was. There's nothing
wrong with me, don't you worry about me.

380
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,363
And anyway at my age...

381
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,162
any day above ground
and vertical is a good day.

382
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,832
Listen, you take care
of this until I get back alright?

383
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,411
- What happens if you don't come back?
- We'll talk about that then shan't we.

384
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,484
- Hey, Burt?
- Yeah.

385
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,452
Don't forget
to mow your lawns will you?

386
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,715
- What?
- Don't forget to mow your lawns.

387
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,620
My Dad goes on and on about it.

388
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,916
He does, does he?

389
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,186
He says it lowers the property
values of the neighborhood.

390
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,824
Well, oh dear,
we can't have that can we?

391
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,447
What are you doing?

392
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,024
Hello, son.
I'm just getting rid of the grass.

393
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,594
Burt, what the hell
are you doing this time?

394
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,028
Oh, like you said George
I'm getting rid of the grass...

395
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,098
being a good neighbor
before I leave tomorrow.

396
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,840
Tom, Tom!
Get back inside now!

397
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,803
Now!

398
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,607
Honestly, Burt!

399
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,547
- What are they doing here?
- It might be the fire, Burt.

400
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,497
Right, the tyre goes in first.

401
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,493
That's it.

402
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,499
That's it, Jeff. You've got it.

403
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,705
This goes in here.

404
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,770
Pills...

405
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,974
Iicense, passport.

406
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,445
Right, let's see,
I've got everything?

407
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,873
Spectacles, testicles,
watch and wallet.

408
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,451
What are you laughing at?

409
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,014
I'm on my way.

410
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,656
- Dad says to call us collect.
- What?

411
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,282
Dad says to call us collect.

412
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,785
- That's nice of him.
- Tell us how you get on.

413
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,495
Thank you.

414
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,197
That's our phone number.

415
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,967
- Do you think you'll break the record?
- Well, I hope so.

416
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,772
Dad doesn't think
you can do it.

417
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,341
Is that what he said?

418
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,574
He said everyone thinks that.

419
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,507
Well...

420
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,042
Except me.

421
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,855
You're a good boy, Tom.

422
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,925
I'll tell you something, son.

423
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,066
If you don't follow through on your
dreams, you might as well be a vegetable.

424
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,564
What type of vegetable?

425
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,301
I don't know...

426
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,939
a cabbage.

427
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,203
Yeah...

428
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,705
a cabbage,

429
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,706
There you are.
Don't lose it, will you?

430
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,751
- I promise I'll look after it.
- Right.

431
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,879
So keep an eye on the place
for me won't you, Tom.

432
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,424
And...

433
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,925
don't forget
to feed the fowls.

434
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,427
- That's my job.
- Yeah.

435
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,630
And...

436
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,929
you can give
the eggs to Mum and...

437
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,691
what else is there?

438
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,502
Oh, yes...

439
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,370
you can pee on my lemon tree
for me if you like, while I'm away.

440
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,378
And there's nothing wrong
with peeing on your lemon tree...

441
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,279
as Confucius used to say, it's the best
natural fertilizer in the world.

442
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,984
- Who's Confucius?
- He's some bloke who lives up in Dunedin.

443
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,144
Thanks for you help, chaps.

444
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,879
- Good luck, Burt.
- Thanks, Jeff.

445
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,584
- You show them over there in the States.
- I will.

446
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,793
Take it easy, Burt.

447
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,488
That's not one of the things
I'm planning on doing, George.

448
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,995
Cheerio, love.

449
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,087
Good luck.

450
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,461
Cheerio, my friend.

451
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,597
If you don't go when you wanna go
when you do go, you'll find you're gone.

452
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,261
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Burt.

453
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,932
Bye, Burt.

454
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,771
- Good luck.
- Cheerio.

455
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,339
See ya, Burt.

456
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,822
Look at that!

457
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,593
Well, Fran,
I'm finally on my way.

458
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,544
I thought some more
of the blokes from the club...

459
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,875
would have dropped
by to see me off.

460
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,915
Well, they probably had
to work today.

461
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,811
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

462
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,254
Yeah, young Tom tells me...

463
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,187
that no one thinks
I can do it.

464
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,195
- Do you think I can do it, Fran?
- I don't know, Burt.

465
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,591
I don't think it really matters
one way or the other.

466
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,232
You know, I read something once,
years ago.

467
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,442
I learnt it off by heart.

468
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,841
It was Theodore Roosevelt
said it...

469
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,814
it's not
the critic that counts...

470
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,148
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles...

471
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:18,225
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

472
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,594
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena.

473
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,946
Wind your window down!
Down.

474
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,477
What?

475
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,348
Some beer money.

476
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,577
- What?
- Some beer money.

477
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,044
I don't drink.

478
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,446
Good luck.

479
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,986
- You go well.
- Thanks, mate.

480
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,759
Show them Kiwi's can fly.

481
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,853
Yeah, I'll bring you back
the Statue of Liberty.

482
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,828
Good on you mate,
thanks a lot.

483
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,975
Hey, not so fast!

484
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,580
Crikey!

485
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,655
Take it easy, mate!

486
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,727
I thought it was a goner.

487
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,399
Better get going.

488
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,666
Yeah, alright...

489
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,968
take care of the old jalopy,
won't you?

490
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,442
- You look after yourself.
- I will.

491
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,208
You've got your pills
and everything, right?

492
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,113
Yeah, yeah, right as rain.

493
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,990
- You come back in one piece.
- I will, cheerio.

494
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,497
Where's the Captain?

495
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,968
Down below.

496
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,900
- Down the gangway there.
- Thanks.

497
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,473
There we are.

498
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,741
I'm looking for the Captain.

499
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,371
That's me.

500
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,615
My name's Burt Munro.

501
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,149
I'm supposed to do a job to work
my passage to Los Angeles.

502
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,857
- Yeah, well, I hope you can cook.
- Cook?

503
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,961
- I'll give it a go.
- There's the galley.

504
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,495
Crikey!

505
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,336
Who does the dishes, mate?

506
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,063
You.

507
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,044
Smells good.

508
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,940
What do you have
for us today, Burt?

509
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,978
It's good Kiwi tucker.

510
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,144
Don't let Burt see you
doing that.

511
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,184
Here, don't spoil it
with all that sauce.

512
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,420
- Sorry, Burt.
- Stone the crows!

513
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,160
Are you going to watch
the movie, Burt?

514
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,896
- What's that?
- Are you going to watch the movie?

515
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,337
- What's it called?
- Broken Barrier.

516
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,878
- It's supposed to be good.
- Is Jane Russell in it?

517
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,476
There's a spare seat
over here, Burt.

518
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,287
Smoke?

519
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,989
- No. Not for me, mate.
- You don't smoke Burt?

520
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,391
No, I don't
and that's why people say to me...

521
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,493
how do you keep going
at your age, Burt...

522
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,327
and I say,
well because I don't smoke...

523
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,163
so I'm telling you young monkeys,
don't smoke.

524
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,600
You can laugh,
but my Dad said...

525
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,965
why contaminate your lungs
with tobacco smoke?

526
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,335
The only thing you accomplish with
smoking is destroying your lungs...

527
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,902
- and shortening your life.
- Kill the lights.

528
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,839
Is Jane Russell in this?

529
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,450
Go well, Burt.

530
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,813
- Thanks, mate.
- Not for this.

531
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,155
- Good luck to you, Burt.
- Thanks.

532
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,264
Remember what I said.
Don't smoke.

533
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,001
I'm trying.

534
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,668
Cheerio, mates. See ya.

535
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,638
Welcome to the United States.
Customs to the left.

536
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,300
Thank you, good to be here.

537
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:27,835
G'day.

538
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,343
G'day.

539
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,088
Please, stand behind the yellow line
until you are called, sir.

540
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,178
What's that?

541
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,791
- Behind the yellow line.
- Yellow line?

542
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,036
G'day.

543
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,571
Passport and customs declaration,
please sir.

544
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,238
There you are.

545
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,843
How long do you intend
to stay in the United States?

546
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:10,213
However long it takes me to get
to Bonneville and back.

547
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,354
And the purpose of your visit?

548
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,824
To set a land speed record
on my Indian.

549
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:17,859
Indian?

550
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,422
Mr. Munro...

551
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,688
- So this is your first time to America?
- Yes, sir.

552
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,662
You gave some rather odd answers
to the Officer...

553
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,732
so we just have a few further
questions we'd like to ask you.

554
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,500
- Well, fire away.
- Well, let's go over again what you said.

555
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,605
Now what exactly do you intend to do
here in the United States?

556
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,743
Well, set a land speed record.

557
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,941
- And how do you intend to do that, sir?
- On my motorcycle.

558
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,448
It's in the hold of the ship
at the moment and...

559
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:48,385
they're going to unload it tomorrow.
It's an Indian, a 190 Indian Scout...

560
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,818
modified somewhat.

561
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,728
You know what?

562
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,594
- I think I've read about your bike.
- Yeah?

563
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,893
Yeah, it was in Popular Mechanics,
a couple of years ago.

564
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,694
That's right, that's me.

565
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,031
A Leslie Hobbs from Christchurch
sent that story.

566
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,038
What was it?
Fastest motorcycle in Australia?

567
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,108
Yeah, and in New Zealand.

568
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,608
Well, I guess you're legitimate,
Mr. Munro.

569
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,580
It sounds like we should be very
honored to have you here in America.

570
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,288
- Well, thank you.
- We're going to give you six months...

571
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,525
that should be time enough
to get the job done.

572
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,027
- Welcome to the USA.
- Thank you very much.

573
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,890
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

574
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,696
- Gears in the trunk.
- What?

575
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,236
Bags in the back.

576
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,174
Bag, back!

577
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,278
Don't worry about me,
I'll do it myself.

578
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,042
Strewth!

579
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,392
Sit in the back, in the back!

580
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,666
- What?
- You, in the back!

581
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:08,066
Tell you something, mate,
you don't want to get old around here.

582
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,233
Ta ra.

583
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,539
- Where to?
- What?

584
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,112
- Where to?
- Hollywood.

585
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,550
Yeah, I want to go to Hollywood,
I want to see the film stars.

586
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,214
Okay, we go to Hollywood.

587
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,179
Where in Hollywood?

588
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,359
A motel on Sunset Boulevard...

589
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,893
I hear that's a pretty great street.

590
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,134
I don't know who you talking to lately.
Which motel?

591
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,527
I don't know...

592
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,963
a recommended one.

593
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,671
Come on man, what do you think
I am, an encyclopedia?

594
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,604
Drop me somewhere
and I'll sort it out myself.

595
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,047
Must have a bit
electricity bill here.

596
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,589
Firestone...

597
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,652
Shell.

598
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,360
It's all about cars, isn't it?
I've never seen so many cars.

599
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,430
- You say something, man?
- I said I've never seen so many cars.

600
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,070
Got to get around somehow.

601
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,007
Look, there's a bowling alley.
Do you bowl?

602
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,153
What's he honking his horn about?

603
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,894
Jesus!
Crikey, did you see that?

604
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,988
That blokes backing into that
geaser's car.

605
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,457
He's crazy, he's nuts.

606
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,894
He did it again.

607
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,639
Don't stare, there's a lot of
crazy people in this town.

608
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,705
I've never seen anything
like that before.

609
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,914
- This should do...
- What's the damage?

610
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,056
US$8, plus bag...

611
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,256
- US$9.
- What?

612
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,460
Did you just say
what I thought you said?

613
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,759
- Are you deaf?
- What?

614
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,301
- Are you deaf?
- Yeah, I am a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.

615
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,304
- How much did you say it was?
- US$9.

616
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,910
No, I don't want to buy the cab, mate.
I just want to pay the fare, that's all.

617
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,605
- Where you from?
- What?

618
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,873
- You a British?
- No, you must be joking...

619
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,381
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from New Zealand.

620
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,017
Well, this is America.

621
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,789
And the fare, right there on the meter,
US$9.

622
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,783
Open your wallet
and let the moths out.

623
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,359
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

624
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,624
There you go, US$9.

625
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,697
- No, don't forget the tip.
- What?

626
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,198
Yes, we tip in America.

627
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,334
Ten percent.

628
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,167
- How much?
- Ten percent.

629
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,642
Oh yeah, there you go, ten cents.

630
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,775
Excuse me, sir.

631
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,045
- You look like a generous man, sir.
- What?

632
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,086
- You look like a generous man.
- Oh do I?

633
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,657
Yes you do. Would you like to buy
a flower to give to someone special?

634
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,920
Well,
sorry I don't have any cash.

635
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,357
Don't worry,
the money goes to a good cause.

636
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,227
It's for an organization
that helps needy people.

637
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,436
Oh alright, well, how much is it?

638
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,037
- Just give what you can afford.
- Alright, well.

639
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,967
They all look the same to me.
They're all green.

640
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,740
- Yes, that's why we call them green backs.
- That looks like a one.

641
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,378
- Look there's one.
- No, that's a ten.

642
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,245
- Thanks, you have a good day.
- No, that's a ten.

643
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,348
Hey come on miss, that's a ten.

644
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,980
I didn't want to pay that much.

645
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,686
Hey, come back.

646
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,094
- Hey baby.
- What do you want?

647
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,660
- You wanna go?
- Go where?

648
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,231
- Go inside.
- I'm going inside.

649
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,866
I'll take you around the world.

650
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,900
I've just come from halfway
around the world.

651
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,667
15 bucks, baby.

652
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:04,968
15 bucks.

653
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,005
No, sorry, go away.

654
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,116
Hello.

655
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,452
- I need a room.
- A room will cost you five bucks an hour.

656
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,619
I'm planning on staying
a wee bit longer than that.

657
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,425
- How long?
- I don't know, a couple of days I guess.

658
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,659
- Double occupancy?
- What?

659
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,265
Double occupancy?

660
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,936
No, just me, myself and I.

661
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,869
Will it cost a lot because
I can't afford a lot.

662
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,303
- You a member of Triple A?
- What?

663
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,945
- Are you a Triple A member?
- Never heard of them.

664
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,409
Never heard of Triple A?

665
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,881
No Miss Brittle Britches,
I have not heard of Triple A.

666
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,456
Okay, let's just say
you are a member doll.

667
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,424
- Alright.
- That'll save you ten percent.

668
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,695
How does bucks a night sound?

669
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,188
That much? Is that cheap?

670
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,697
Honey, that's cheaper than cheap.

671
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,871
- What's your name?
- Tina Washington.

672
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,334
Well, Tina Washington,

673
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,968
I want you to have this,
it might cheer you up a bit.

674
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,404
Get some of that muck
off your pluck.

675
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,211
Well, thank you.

676
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,079
That's the first nice thing
that's happened round here all week.

677
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,482
You're welcome.

678
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,788
My name's Burt Munro.
From New Zealand.

679
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,379
I'm from down under.

680
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,716
Well, hello, Burt Munro
from New Zealand down under.

681
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,086
I tell you,
I've had a heck of a night.

682
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,422
Welcome to Hollyweird.

683
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,715
Hello?

684
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,213
Anybody home?

685
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,346
- Hello, Tina.
- Good morning, Burt.

686
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,091
You still here?

687
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,291
That's why you were
so crabby last night.

688
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,861
Don't you ever get any sleep?

689
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,564
I work a night shift.

690
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,334
I'm out of here as soon as James
turns up and he's late.

691
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,664
Yeah, could you phone
this number for me?

692
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,374
Yeah, it's a shipping company
and they've got a big box of mine...

693
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,907
and I want to know how
to arrange to get it.

694
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,276
No, you talk to them,
they'll never get my accent.

695
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,020
Okay, what do you want me
to ask them? One moment please.

696
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,785
Ask them when a Burt Munro's box
containing the motorcycle...

697
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,951
will be ready for pick up.

698
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,285
Hello, I'm calling
for Mr. Burt Munro.

699
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,160
Yes, he'd like to know when the box
containing his motorcycle...

700
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,326
- will be available for pick up.
- What ship?

701
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,234
- What ship?
- Rangatira from New Zealand.

702
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,631
The Rangatira from New Zealand.

703
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,468
- It's arrived,
- So he can claim it?

704
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,944
Tomorrow from the Long Beach
customs holding area.

705
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,112
Okay, thank you, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

706
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:33,972
That was pretty fast.

707
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,818
You're late.

708
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,387
I can't stand another minute in
this place. Let me buy you breakfast.

709
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,090
Well, this is great.

710
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,263
You know, I've never seen
a menu with photographs before.

711
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,025
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- What?

712
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,066
- Are you ready?
- Oh yes...

713
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,969
I think the Double Delight,
that's for me.

714
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,474
- How would you like your eggs?
- What?

715
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,270
How would you like your eggs?

716
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,310
Well, I'd like them cooked.

717
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,151
Sunny side up? Over easy?

718
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,785
- I don't know, whatever you recommend.
- Over easy's best.

719
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,115
Alright, eggs over easy.

720
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,619
Make that two.

721
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,555
Over easy.
I must remember that.

722
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,561
Yeah, I like this American
breakfast thing.

723
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,301
It's good.

724
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:31,373
So my girl, where's the best place
for me to get a used car?

725
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,904
The Valley.

726
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,411
After breakfast I could
take you there.

727
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:36,479
Oh Well, thank you.

728
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,174
And I'm not a girl.

729
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,375
I'm a boy.

730
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,790
I thought there was something
a little odd about you.

731
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,728
But hey,
you're still a sweetheart.

732
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:57,531
Yep.

733
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,943
Thanks a million, Tina.

734
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,251
Hey,
there are stacks of cars here.

735
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,248
- I'll be back in the motel later on.
- Bye.

736
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,648
Bye.

737
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,194
How may I help you, sir?

738
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:32,366
Yeah, I want to buy a car,
a cheap car, a very cheap car.

739
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,630
Well, you've come
to the right place, amigo.

740
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:39,304
In fact, if you can find cars like this
any cheaper, they're probably stolen.

741
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,909
My name's Burt, Burt Munro
from New Zealand. Nice to meet you.

742
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,737
I'm Fernando from El Salvador,
nice to meet you, Mr. Munro.

743
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,409
- You can call me Burt.
- Alright, Mr. Burt.

744
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,251
So how much were you looking
to spend here Mr. Burt?

745
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,516
Not a lot Fernando...

746
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,418
I haven't got much left after
the cab ride I took yesterday.

747
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,559
You want US$399 for this?

748
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,191
It sounds a bit sick.

749
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,989
Well, what would you offer me?

750
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,335
Listen, I'll give you US$00
if you'll do me a favor.

751
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,004
Through in the use
of your workshop...

752
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,674
and some of that junk
I see lying around...

753
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,039
I've got to knock up
a trailer...

754
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,574
to drag my bike over
to Bonneville.

755
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,818
That's not a favor,
US$35 is a favor.

756
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,212
No, US$5.

757
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,850
You're a tough customer, Mr. Burt,
but I like you...

758
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:31,423
I'm going to give it to you for US$50
and you can use the workshop...

759
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,894
but only at night
and keep the noise down.

760
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:34,555
What about tonight?

761
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,522
Yeah, yeah, tonight's ok.

762
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:40,360
Stop the car, let's get
this thing running properly.

763
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,615
There that sounds better.

764
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,615
- Let me drive.
- Okay, come on.

765
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,224
She's singing
like a bird now.

766
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,754
Oh, she's a good old girl,
isn't she?

767
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,462
There we are, alright.

768
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,602
- You make a left here, Mr. Burt.
- Alright.

769
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,504
The buggers are in the wrong lane.

770
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,180
Stop the car, stop the car.

771
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,418
Turn, turn, this way.

772
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,878
Stop, stop the car.

773
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,986
Keep your shirt on.

774
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:41,461
- Scoot over, you stupid old bastard.
- Thought I was back in New Zealand...

775
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,022
we drive on the other side
of the road over there.

776
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,735
Yeah? You're going to get
us all killed.

777
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,069
Well, you're not in New Zealand,
you're in America.

778
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,904
- I know it.
- We drive on the right side of the road.

779
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,513
Burt.
Let me give you some advice.

780
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,321
When you're driving,
not only here in America...

781
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,122
but anywhere's around the world...

782
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,593
the driver should always
be in the centre of the road.

783
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,661
In the centre.
If you're not in the centre...

784
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,330
you're on the wrong side of the road.
Okay?

785
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,049
You want this right here?

786
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,346
That's it.

787
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:39,947
Yeah, good.

788
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,515
Got it.

789
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,821
It's 3 am in the morning.

790
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,961
Yeah, time flies
when you're having fun, doesn't it?

791
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,033
You know, when I told you that
you could use the workshop at night...

792
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,035
I didn't mean all night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

793
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,265
You take yourself off home
and I'll have a snooze...

794
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,899
in the back of the car
and you know, mate...

795
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,440
I'll lock up the place
before I go to sleep.

796
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,038
Seems to me a whole lot of effort
to sell a lousy US$50 motorcar.

797
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,482
Okay, Mr. Burt, you pull the door down.
Have a good night.

798
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:14,386
Fernando.
Where do I take a leak around here?

799
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,784
- Leak?
- Yeah, a pee...

800
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,052
trouble with the old prostrate,
you know.

801
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,627
Yeah, go straight through those doors,
there's a door there that says Caballero...

802
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,065
Alright.

803
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,059
Well, I'll see you in the morning,
early okay?

804
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,330
Good night.

805
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:29,901
Where were we?

806
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,735
Burt?

807
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,571
Good morning, Mr. Burt.

808
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,383
- So did you get it all finished?
- Yeah.

809
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:48,715
All I need to do is find a couple
of wheels and I'll be ready to roll.

810
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,960
Well, you know, I have some wheels
in the back you can have...

811
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,155
- if you just do me a favor.
- Say the word.

812
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,125
Crank her now, Fernando.

813
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,261
Good.

814
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:03,930
- Burt?
- Yeah?

815
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,365
You're a god damned genius.

816
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,506
Thank you.

817
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,801
Hey listen, why you gotta go?

818
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,774
Why don't you stick around here a while?
I'll pay you well.

819
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,242
Sorry, mate, I've got to get
to Bonneville by the 3rd...

820
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:17,316
that's when speed week starts and
you know, gotta hit the road.

821
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,613
- Well, you've always got a job here.
- Thanks mate, I'll see ya.

822
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,652
- Best of luck to you.
- Ta ra.

823
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,727
This guy is really good.

824
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,805
Hello, love.

825
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,838
I was worried about you.

826
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,137
Housekeeping said you didn't
sleep in your bed all night.

827
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,939
Do I get a discount for that?

828
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,505
I doubt it.

829
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,051
I need you to show me on a map
how to get to Long Beach...

830
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,020
- so I can pick up my bike today.
- I'm finished here in 15 minutes.

831
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,088
I'll come with you.

832
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,694
Not a bad set of wheels
for 50 bucks eh?

833
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,025
- You sure it'll make it to Utah?
- Yeah.

834
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,431
This old girl will get you
to New Zealand and back.

835
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:07,995
Here...

836
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,170
- hop in my fair, lady.
- Thank you.

837
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,277
The bloke who sold me this car,
he gave me a good tip...

838
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,643
he said always remember
that the driver, that's me...

839
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,316
should be on the centre
of the road.

840
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,976
- Look out, look out!
- Alright.

841
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,950
In New Zealand we always drive
on the other side of the street.

842
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,183
- You do?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

843
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,023
Do you want me to drive?

844
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,291
No, it's alright,
I have to get used to it, haven't I?

845
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,230
This should be customs
right here.

846
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,326
Right.

847
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,574
- Hello.
- May I help you, sir?

848
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,612
Yeah, my name's Burt Munro and
I've come to pick up my motorcycle...

849
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:56,443
I came into port two days ago
from New Zealand...

850
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,689
and on a freighter
called Rangatira...

851
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,424
and I was told to come here
to clear it through customs.

852
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,784
- Mr. Munro.
- Yeah, Munro...

853
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,495
M U N R O.

854
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,494
- Wait here a moment, sir.
- Thank you.

855
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,667
Mr. Munro is here
for that damaged shipment.

856
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,879
- Mr. Moonro.
- Munro.

857
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,547
- Come with me please, to the storage area.
- Is there a problem?

858
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,641
Your consignment
has suffered some damage.

859
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,647
Oh, no.

860
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,520
Why the heck did I bother to paint
these arrows on the side of it then?

861
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,883
That's the way it was
delivered here unfortunately.

862
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,292
Well, what happened to it?

863
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,427
My information is that
ten tons of fertilizer...

864
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,295
was inadvertently
loaded on top of your box...

865
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,925
while it was in the hold. If I was
you I'd sue the shipping company.

866
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,368
Sue? I haven't got time to waste
my bloomin' life suing anybody.

867
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,600
Get some of your blokes to pull...

868
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,006
this right side up so
we can get into the motorcycle...

869
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,375
and see what damage
has been done.

870
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,781
Alright, fellows,
let's get it unwrapped.

871
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,017
The tail looks alright.

872
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,957
No damage so far.

873
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,424
Oh no damage at all.

874
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,732
Good.

875
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,867
- Lucky it was packed so well.
- Yes, it's a blimmin' miracle.

876
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:25,700
Well, the old Indian lives
to fight another day.

877
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,340
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

878
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,919
I don't know what I would have done
without you today...

879
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,613
you're the real salt of the earth,
you know?

880
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,785
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to come home for dinner tonight?

881
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,552
- I can't, love.
- I could cook you a meal.

882
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,287
I've got to get this show on the road,
get out of Dodge as they say.

883
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,023
Okay, my good friend
from Kiwi land.

884
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,267
- You stay in touch, won't you?
- I will.

885
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,133
Here's my phone number.

886
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,130
- Call me and tell me how you're doing.
- I will. Can I call collect?

887
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,966
You can try.

888
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,347
- It's a good job I think you're a woman.
- I am a woman.

889
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,018
Yeah, right. Ta ra love, see ya.

890
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,348
- Morning.
- Morning.

891
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,343
Fill her up, would you please?

892
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,750
Regular or Ethol?

893
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,320
Who's Ethol?

894
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,557
Alright...

895
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,488
I'll take Ethol.

896
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,532
- Hello, young fella.
- Hello.

897
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,237
- Is this a rocket ship?
- What?

898
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,996
Is this a rocket ship?

899
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:05,800
I hope so.

900
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:46,540
Oh Gosh.

901
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,981
What's happened to you?

902
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,918
Oh well.

903
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,125
Let's have a look at ya.

904
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:23,782
Got ya!

905
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,649
Come on!

906
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,163
I thought we were going
to make it you and me...

907
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,765
and now look what's happened.

908
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,791
- Hello, mate.
- Got a problem?

909
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,893
Yeah. Am I glad to see you.

910
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:45,065
Yeah, I've lost a wheel, help me get
my rig back on the road, will you?

911
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,701
Okay, I'll see.

912
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,429
My name's Burt, Burt Munro.

913
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,564
Jake.

914
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,501
- You Indian?
- Yes.

915
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:57,503
Well, this here could be
the world's fastest Indian.

916
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,240
Well, at least until just now.

917
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,073
She's a bit heavy mind you.

918
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,875
So let's take it easy,
one, two, three.

919
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,280
Right.
You live around here, Jake?

920
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,200
What do you want to ride
that contraption for?

921
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,277
That's a good question.

922
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:35,114
Well, I guess the reward
is in the doing of it.

923
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,055
Jake, I'm dying for a pee.
Where do I go?

924
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,223
There's a little building
right there.

925
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,825
I've got a touch of prostrate
trouble now.

926
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,720
I have similar problems.

927
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,363
I thought you blokes would have...

928
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,366
some magic cures
for that sort of thing.

929
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,932
Well, we have.

930
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,802
One old remedy is ground up
dog balls...

931
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,338
- but I prefer prostrate trouble.
- Yeah, I bet you do, mate.

932
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,040
I got you!

933
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,941
Jake, gotta get going,
gotta hit the road.

934
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,746
- Burt, I have something for you.
- What's that then?

935
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,788
What's this?

936
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,284
- For good luck.
- Oh yeah?

937
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:22,089
I've never worn jewellery before.
Thanks, mate.

938
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,562
I've got something for you too,
hang on about.

939
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,393
Right...

940
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,063
Iet's see.

941
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,644
I've got this, it's a spare one,
I made it myself.

942
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,039
- What do I do with this?
- You got a hacksaw?

943
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,648
Just slice the top of it,
through where the gudgeon pin goes...

944
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,082
and it'll make a great ash tray.

945
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,120
Not that I approve of smoking,
mind you.

946
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,222
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot, mate. So long.

947
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,555
- Sorry we couldn't fix your trailer.
- That's alright, I'll get there somehow.

948
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,252
Burt?

949
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,789
What?

950
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,427
For the prostrate.

951
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,628
Use with water,
plenty of water.

952
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,097
It tastes bad. Really bad.

953
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,836
Dogs balls huh?

954
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,501
Well, thanks a lot mate.
See ya.

955
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,201
Hello.

956
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,337
Anyone home?

957
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,580
Hello.

958
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,912
Hello, there.

959
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,086
I've got a spot of bother
with my trailer, lost a wheel.

960
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,860
- You're not from around these parts.
- No, I'm from down there.

961
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,063
- What?
- I'm from down under...

962
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,525
The other side of the world,
New Zealand.

963
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,500
Southern most city
in the British Empire.

964
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,270
Called Invercargill.

965
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,770
One of the most beautiful
cities on Earth.

966
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,932
Name's Burt Munro.

967
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,541
Burt? Ada.

968
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,039
- What?
- Ada.

969
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:53,774
There she is.

970
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,618
We got some problems here,
yes sirree.

971
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,558
I tell you what you need to do.

972
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,222
Cannibalize the stuffed axel
out of that old Ford right there.

973
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,329
Lucky for you
I've got some welding gear.

974
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,595
- We'll get a new wheel on there pronto.
- Good.

975
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,473
That's got it.

976
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,512
When you are...

977
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,709
finished there...

978
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,820
I've got something that
I want to show you.

979
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,645
Yeah, what's that?

980
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,158
Never you mind.

981
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,122
You just get that wheel on
there right.

982
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,034
Why'd you bring me out here?

983
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,643
I want to show you this.

984
01:06:58,514 --> 01:06:59,446
What?

985
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,674
Right here.

986
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:11,521
I laid my old boy to rest
twelve years ago next week.

987
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,318
I sure miss him.

988
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,587
I sure do miss the old boy.

989
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,291
He did his level best.

990
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:20,897
He did.

991
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,396
I always figured a man's
like a blade of grass...

992
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,197
he grows up in the spring,
strong and healthy and green...

993
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:31,071
and then he reaches middle age
and he ripens as it were and...

994
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,206
in the autumn they,
like a blade of grass...

995
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,715
he finishes just fades away
and he never comes back.

996
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,346
Just like a blade of grass.

997
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,354
I think when you're dead,
you're dead.

998
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,691
I've always thought that,
since I grew up.

999
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,158
Is that your philosophy?

1000
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,832
Well, I don't know,
yeah, I suppose it is...

1001
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:56,768
when you get to my age these
thoughts cross your mind sometimes.

1002
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,602
Jump!

1003
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,674
Jump!

1004
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,610
Sideways, you fool,
sideways!

1005
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,077
My God, man, haven't you ever
seen a snake before?

1006
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,942
No, we don't get snakes
in New Zealand.

1007
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,111
Good God,
I ought to move there.

1008
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,714
- Where's he going?
- Damn rattlers!

1009
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,291
- Any more around here? Oh, God.
- Fancy this?

1010
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:23,088
You come all this way
to bite the dust up at Boot Hill?

1011
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,267
That would be a laugh,
wouldn't it?

1012
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,968
Be a laugh.

1013
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,364
There you go, there you go.

1014
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,965
Oh, my God!

1015
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,479
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

1016
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,150
I don't know, I've no idea.

1017
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:48,889
I don't know.

1018
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,205
I had a strange dream
last night.

1019
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,279
I dreamt about my late...

1020
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:19,053
twin brother, Ernie.

1021
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,392
I thought he was in the room here
looking down on us.

1022
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:30,124
I guess it's all
that fun and games...

1023
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,167
at the graveyard.

1024
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,499
I suppose.

1025
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:37,772
Oh, well.

1026
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:42,542
Getting old ain't for the faint
of heart I'll tell you that.

1027
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,203
Oh, God. What have you done
to my back, Ada?

1028
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,417
I am getting old.

1029
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,790
Come on old girl, make me a cup of tea,
I've got to hit the road.

1030
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,824
Ada, come on, you haven't died
in our sleep, have you, old girl?

1031
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,087
- Make me a cup of tea.
- Come here, lover boy.

1032
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,256
I'll make it myself.

1033
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,029
Thanks.

1034
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:14,133
Now Burt, you promise me you're going
to pop in on your way back...

1035
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,276
because I can always use
another little cuddle.

1036
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,711
Yeah, that's what I said, Ada,
that's what I intend to do.

1037
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:23,110
There's many good tune played on
an old Banjo as they say.

1038
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:27,114
- And what we don't use, we lose.
- Well, that's what they say.

1039
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,318
See ya. Ta ra, darling.

1040
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,589
And you have good luck
with your Indian.

1041
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,693
You should say
break a leg.

1042
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,491
See ya.

1043
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,653
Gidday.

1044
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,645
Boy is it hot out there.

1045
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,254
I bet the birds fly backwards
around here...

1046
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,727
to keep the dust out
of their eyes.

1047
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,524
- What can I get you?
- I'd like a cup of tea, please.

1048
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,631
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah, best drink...

1049
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,569
for quenching the thirst
when the weather's hot.

1050
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,473
We haven't seen a cup of tea
in here ever.

1051
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,610
We got Coors, we got Schlitz
or Miller or Coke and whiskey.

1052
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,007
Well, I'll have coke then.

1053
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,079
You know smoking's bad for you,
don't you?

1054
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,655
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1055
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,191
Personally I don't smoke
and I don't drink.

1056
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,657
I had the right education
from my dad on that one.

1057
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:46,765
He was like King James the first,
great anti-smoking man.

1058
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,002
Sounds like you're on a one
man crusade there grandpa.

1059
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,637
Yeah, well, you're born with one
pair of lungs so why destroy...

1060
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,267
them with that muck?

1061
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,939
Where are you from?
Where's your home town?

1062
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,348
- You English?
- Heavens no...

1063
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:03,414
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from Invercargill in New Zealand.

1064
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,877
- Where?
- Invercargill.

1065
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,852
L- N-V-E-R-C-A-R-G-l-L-L.

1066
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:13,993
I spell it with one L
sometimes to save ink.

1067
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:21,229
- Got any of those critters over there?
- Oh yes, much bigger though...

1068
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,903
we breed them down there
on big farms...

1069
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,409
and we cut off their antlers and
send them over to Hong Kong and they...

1070
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,104
grind the antlers into dust
and they eat that stuff...

1071
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,141
must be some sort of aphrodisiac
or something.

1072
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,681
Puts lead in your pencil.

1073
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,014
You could do with some
of that, Leroy.

1074
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,584
Your girlfriend?

1075
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,150
Wife.

1076
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,296
Oh, dear!

1077
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,502
You alright?

1078
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,609
Did you decide to leave Jackie
a tip after all?

1079
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,914
Look sir, if you're not feeling well
you should drop in to the hospital...

1080
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,178
in the next town.

1081
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:45,347
Alright.

1082
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,082
Roll down your window.

1083
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,486
What?

1084
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,261
What's the problem?

1085
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,399
You're parked illegally.

1086
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,839
- You're a danger to the passing traffic.
- Am I?

1087
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,032
- Let's see your driver's license.
- Yeah, alright.

1088
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,771
Here you are.

1089
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,979
- Where are you from?
- From New Zealand.

1090
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:58,157
That's the land of the
long white cloud. Aotearoa.

1091
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,151
Home of the kiwi bird.

1092
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:03,556
Well, I don't care if you're from Mars,
you cannot stop here.

1093
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:04,896
Alright.

1094
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:08,698
You cannot stop on the side of this road,
you're parked illegally.

1095
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:13,298
Okay, well, sorry, I was having
a bit of a heart attack and...

1096
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,676
well recovering
from one anyway.

1097
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,344
Yeah, well, next time,
how about we stop at a proper rest area.

1098
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,012
Yeah, alright, okay.

1099
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,410
Name's Burt Munro.
Sorry about that.

1100
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,292
Oil's OK.

1101
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,052
- Thank you.
- That's alright, sir.

1102
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,655
Excuse me.

1103
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,293
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1104
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,732
Listen, I was wondering
if I could catch a ride?

1105
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,905
My car, she just broke down and I'm
really trying to get to Salt Lake City.

1106
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,070
I'm only going as far as Wendover,
that's where I'm stopping.

1107
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,368
Well, anything would be
better than nothing.

1108
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:53,471
- Ain't that the truth? Hop in, mate.
- Hey, thank you.

1109
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,909
I'm going to go see
my girlfriend...

1110
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,415
she just moved from LA
to Salt Lake, so.

1111
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,549
I'm home on leave from 'Nam.

1112
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:05,258
- What?
- Vietnam?

1113
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,619
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,823
Hey, what is that you've
got strapped on back there?

1115
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,395
That, young fellow,
is an Indian.

1116
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:15,992
Motorcycle.

1117
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,002
So what are you doing
in Vietnam?

1118
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,007
I'm involved
in operation ranch hand.

1119
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,710
Oh, what's that?
Farming or something?

1120
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,013
No, not exactly,
we just started this program...

1121
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:31,044
we are spraying the jungle
from the air with herbicides...

1122
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,484
so the enemy, the Vietcong,
don't have any place to hide.

1123
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:39,087
Agent Orange we call this stuff,
it comes in these big old orange drums.

1124
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,926
How is it working out?

1125
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:48,162
Well, I'm home on two months leave
and I've got to get my arse back there.

1126
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,430
We should have this war done in 6 months
or so, that's what they keep telling us.

1127
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,075
Can't wait to get my arse out of there
to tell you the truth.

1128
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:58,836
Yeah, I remember
the Great War in 1914...

1129
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:03,481
I was about your age and
that's what they kept telling everyone.

1130
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,287
Soon be over.

1131
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:09,648
0 million dead and four years later
it was still going on.

1132
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,260
Not as bad
as the big flu epidemic though.

1133
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,931
Killed 1 million, that did.
Maybe more.

1134
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,766
Every day,
when I left to go to work...

1135
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:23,167
my mum would spray some formalin
on my shirt...

1136
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,866
and maybe that's why
I didn't catch it.

1137
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:30,137
Or maybe I was just lucky.
You never know.

1138
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,312
- Knock on wood.
- Yep.

1139
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,247
You know,
life's a funny thing...

1140
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,515
you never know
what's around the corner, do you?

1141
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,425
Your shaving brush.

1142
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,689
Has had it's day.

1143
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,926
It won't achieve.

1144
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,423
The Modern way.

1145
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,995
Burma Shave.

1146
01:17:56,905 --> 01:18:00,102
"She doesn't kiss ya
like she used to?

1147
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,603
Has she seen
some smoother rooster?

1148
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,137
Burma Shave.

1149
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,742
These signs we dedicate...

1150
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,511
to men...

1151
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,584
who've had no date of late.

1152
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,624
Burma Shave".

1153
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:20,123
Yeah, that's us.
Well, you anyway.

1154
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,192
Look at that.

1155
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,830
That's a cowboy and a half.

1156
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,534
I was thinking I'd come out
to the Salt with you.

1157
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,578
I'd like to be there
the first time you see it...

1158
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,341
it's only a couple of miles
up the road so.

1159
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,279
Yeah, alright then,
that sounds good.

1160
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,107
Looks like there's a lot of people
in town for speed week, huh?

1161
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,716
Yeah, looks like it.

1162
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:51,854
This is it, Burt.
We're gonna take a left right up here.

1163
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,638
Bonneville...

1164
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,731
I mean I can't believe it.

1165
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,239
I mean I'm here, I've made it.

1166
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,907
I've made it.

1167
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,875
You know, all my life
I wanted to do something big.

1168
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,414
Something better and bigger
than all the other jokers.

1169
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,841
This is it, Bonneville.

1170
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,784
This is the place
where big things happen.

1171
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,992
Do you realize, Rusty, the fastest
man has ever gone on land is here?

1172
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,958
Right here, where we are now.

1173
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,972
Malcolm Campbell did it here,
with a Bluebird.

1174
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,968
First guy to go
over 300 mile an hour...

1175
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:19,069
and then later his son, Donald Campbell
was here with Proteus.

1176
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:23,013
He crashed at 350 mile an hour
and lived to tell the tale.

1177
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,353
John Cobb was here.

1178
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,390
First guy
to go over 400 mile an hour.

1179
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,461
All the great attempts.

1180
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,725
George Easton with Thunderbolt and...

1181
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:40,224
Mickey Thompson
with Challenger.

1182
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:46,334
I'm telling you, Rusty,
this place is holy ground, mate.

1183
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:48,903
Holy ground.

1184
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,471
And I made it here.

1185
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:22,936
Well, Burt.

1186
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:24,704
Thanks a million.

1187
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,311
I'll be looking for you
in the record books.

1188
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,814
You take care out there in Vietnam,
won't you?

1189
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:29,782
I'll be trying.

1190
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:31,546
- Okay, mate.
- Drive safe.

1191
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,377
- See ya
- See ya.

1192
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:52,355
God.

1193
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,893
Jesus.

1194
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,289
- Gidday.
- Hey, there.

1195
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,131
- It's going to be a great day.
- Yeah.

1196
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,136
Still... no wind.

1197
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,498
Lovely day for a run.

1198
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,003
SaIt's in good shape.

1199
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:11,703
Yeah. Firm and dry.

1200
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,308
Dead flat. No soft patches.

1201
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,543
Not like the beach.

1202
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,516
I can do it here.

1203
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:21,279
Yep.

1204
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:24,187
This week.
It's what we're here for.

1205
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:30,021
Wow, is that yours?

1206
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:31,962
Yep.

1207
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,595
Gosh, she's a beauty.

1208
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,628
I bet she goes fast.

1209
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,939
- That yours?
- Yeah, that's an old Indian.

1210
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,471
My name's Munro, Burt Munro.

1211
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:46,578
- From down under, New Zealand.
- A long way from home.

1212
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,339
Jim Moffatt, San Jose,
California.

1213
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,246
- Nice to meet you, Burt.
- Good to meet you, Jim.

1214
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,282
Let's get to the start, line,

1215
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:58,219
The race is about to start,
and all the racers are excited,

1216
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:02,528
This car is driven by Jim Moffatt,
San Jose, California.

1217
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,289
The other pilots are...

1218
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,245
- Come on, guys, 15 minutes.
- Come on.

1219
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,406
Come on, let's go.

1220
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,016
- Morning.
- Hello, Burt Munro.

1221
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,658
- Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

1222
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,095
- Are you checked in?
- No, not yet.

1223
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:41,866
Well, you've got to remove the shell
before we do the tech inspection.

1224
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,367
- Where do I check in?
- It's just over there.

1225
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,470
- Thanks, fellas.
- Okay.

1226
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,069
I gotta see this.

1227
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:54,006
Hello, I've come to check in.
Munro, Burt Munro.

1228
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,907
Registration number?

1229
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:57,844
What?

1230
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,986
Registration number.
I don't see your number here.

1231
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,054
No, it's number 35.

1232
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:08,159
It's on the side of my motorcycle
over there, that's my lucky number.

1233
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,760
Have you registered?

1234
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,798
No, that's what
I've come over for.

1235
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,166
These two blokes sent me over here,
Mike and someone else.

1236
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,837
Sir, registration closed
last month.

1237
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:22,440
If you haven't registered,
I'm sorry, you just can't run.

1238
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,075
I can't run?

1239
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,679
Well, how was I supposed to know
I should have pre-registered?

1240
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,880
I've come a heck of a long way
to ride my bike.

1241
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,014
I'm not going anywhere
until I've done just that.

1242
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,025
I've come all the way from New Zealand,
you know. It's a long way.

1243
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,021
Look, mister,
we don't make the rules.

1244
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:44,697
An event like this doesn't just happen
in one day, rules are rules.

1245
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,666
Entries closed July 31st.

1246
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:50,431
Well, crikey, I live in Invercargill,
it's half way round the bloody earth.

1247
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,667
How was I supposed to know these things?
I didn't know all this stuff.

1248
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:54,969
Sir, it's not our problem.

1249
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,670
I thought I could just turn up here
and have my bike timed.

1250
01:26:57,745 --> 01:27:00,270
- You don't have to call me...
- Well, you thought wrong.

1251
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,049
Jim Moffatt!

1252
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,824
It's Burt, Burt Munro.
Can you come over here, mate?

1253
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,959
I'll be right back.

1254
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,424
I need a bit of help.

1255
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,225
Hey, Burt. What's up?

1256
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:25,232
Well, I have these blokes telling
me I can't run my bike...

1257
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,531
because I'm not pre-registered.

1258
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:30,300
- You didn't register?
- No, I didn't know anything about it.

1259
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,845
You know how it is Jim,
rules are rules.

1260
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:36,240
- You should have registered months ago.
- I didn't know.

1261
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:40,243
I'll have a talk with these guys later,
see if I can change their minds.

1262
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,854
- Your blood's worth bottling.
- I don't know about that.

1263
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,059
Look,
we can talk about this later.

1264
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,856
Maybe you can let him go
through tech inspection.

1265
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:51,495
Get that out of the way?
Just in case we can let him ride.

1266
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,164
You're asking a lot.

1267
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,427
Alright.

1268
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:01,999
- Okay.
- Alright.

1269
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,369
- Make me proud.
- Thanks a lot.

1270
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:06,739
You give me a bit
of a fright there.

1271
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:14,421
You know these don't look
like high speed tyres.

1272
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,281
Well, they are high speed tyres.

1273
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,390
Look at these hairline cracks,
these tyres have got to be 5 years old.

1274
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,490
- What happened to the tread?
- What?

1275
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,698
I said,
what happened to the tread?

1276
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,165
Well, I cut it off,
that's what happened to the tread...

1277
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:27,598
I cut it off with a carving knife...

1278
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:30,035
otherwise it wouldn't be
a high speed tyre, would it?

1279
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:31,870
What are you talking about?

1280
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:35,102
Well, you've got to keep the weight in
otherwise when you get to a high speed...

1281
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:37,406
the centrifugal force will
the tread right off, wouldn't it?

1282
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:41,647
I run them on 65 pounds of air and
that tyre's safe up to 300 miles an hour.

1283
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,248
I guarantee it. These are high
speed tyres and I made them.

1284
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,384
Well, you're going to have
to replace them.

1285
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,246
The suspension here is
a leaf spring...

1286
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,716
I mean can we pass that?

1287
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:52,993
Geez, last leaf spring on a motorcycle
must have been in the 190s.

1288
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,591
Well, it is 4 years old.

1289
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:58,764
- These brakes look completely inadequate.
- Well, I'm planning on going, not stopping.

1290
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,801
Well, the brakes were old
fashioned 40 years ago.

1291
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,266
Is this a hinge of a gate post?

1292
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,598
No, that's from an old kitchen door.

1293
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:12,172
Let me just ask you what is this?

1294
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,348
It's a cork, what does it look like?
It's a cork from a brandy bottle.

1295
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:19,985
You know, the thing is it's all about
weight. The less weight, the faster you go.

1296
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:21,180
And where's your chute?

1297
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,287
- What?
- Where's your parachute?

1298
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,289
I'm not planning on bailing out.

1299
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:27,759
No wait,
you've got to have a safety chute.

1300
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,228
Well, I can't afford one.

1301
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,925
These forks, if they give out we've
got ourselves some real problems.

1302
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,430
I think I'd have a bit of
a problem that way, wouldn't I?

1303
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,693
- Where's your fire suit?
- What?

1304
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,370
Where's your fire suit?

1305
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,737
Good heavens, man,
I don't intend to burst into flames.

1306
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:43,169
Always wear me old suit pants
for good luck.

1307
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,303
If they were good enough
to get married in...

1308
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,610
they're good enough to ride
this old girl in and no...

1309
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,941
I tuck the legs of my pants
into my socks like this...

1310
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:53,312
stop them getting caught
in the chain and Bob's your uncle.

1311
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,019
You've got your suit pants,
what are you gonna wear on top?

1312
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:56,784
What?

1313
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:59,826
You've got your suit pants,
what do you intend to wear on top?

1314
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:04,428
Yes, a black woolen shirt, New Zealand
wool, water resistant, fire resistant...

1315
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:06,226
and me bash hat.

1316
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:08,367
Bash hat?

1317
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,002
Yeah, crash helmet.

1318
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,370
You're crazy, you've got to wear
at least a leather jacket on top.

1319
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:16,672
You put the bike down on the salt,
it's like coarse sand paper...

1320
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,075
it's going to rub
your head right off.

1321
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,841
I couldn't get into the shell...

1322
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:22,940
with anything bulkier than the shirt on
my back. It's a very tight fit in there.

1323
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:24,343
Straight out of the ark.

1324
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,388
- What did you say?
- Straight out of the ark.

1325
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:30,453
Don't be so cheeky.
What's your name, young man?

1326
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,957
McFarlane. Mike McFarlane.

1327
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,253
I knew a McFarlane, he used to sell
milking machines in Timaru.

1328
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:38,863
You must be related to him
because he was a total prick.

1329
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:42,159
Look here, you don't even have
a fire extinguisher installed.

1330
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:46,966
Mike McFarlane used to give me milking
machine parts to make my sprockets with.

1331
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,098
How old are you?

1332
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:49,837
I don't know,
he was about 35 when I knew him.

1333
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,237
No how old are you?

1334
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:54,748
His brother owned a general store
down in a place called Bulls...

1335
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:57,610
- that's a town in New Zealand.
- Sir, your machine is not safe.

1336
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:00,819
I've been doing this for 43 years
and I'm still here to tell the tale.

1337
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:04,115
Time's change, we started taking
airplanes instead of riding horseback.

1338
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:06,189
- Horse power?
- Horse back. Horse back.

1339
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:07,589
Horse back, yeah.
I got you, yeah.

1340
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:09,893
You're too old.

1341
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:13,198
Bollocks. I may have this saggy skin
on the outside...

1342
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:14,632
but on the inside
I'm still 18 years old...

1343
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,870
and I'll give you a run for your money,
young fella.

1344
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:19,963
You need some help?

1345
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,366
Hello.

1346
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,377
Rollie Free, Marty Dickerson,
we're a couple of bike fans.

1347
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,581
- Burt Munro from Kiwi land.
- Pleasure, Burt.

1348
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,816
You got me good there.

1349
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:34,419
Where are you staying?

1350
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,657
That's my salubrious
accommodation...

1351
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,885
I usually sleep at night
in the back seat.

1352
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,821
Salubrious you say Munro, huh?

1353
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,726
We've been hearing a lot about you.

1354
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,090
Sounds like you're cutting
your finances mighty fine.

1355
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,867
Yeah, you could say that again.

1356
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,228
We'll we're up at the Western Ridge,
why don't you drop by...

1357
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:52,506
it looks as though you could
use a good shower...

1358
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:55,599
and everybody's staying there and
I bet that there's a spare bed there too.

1359
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:58,277
Thanks a lot, you yanks
are classic you know that?

1360
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,378
You don't catch me that easily.

1361
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:07,684
Hey, Burt.

1362
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:09,114
Hello.

1363
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,192
The front forks could
go at any time...

1364
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:15,558
the suspension is right out
of the 190s.

1365
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,060
Got hairline cracks all
over his tyres...

1366
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:21,066
he's got no fire extinguisher,
no safety chute.

1367
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:24,668
I told you, if it's a time problem, the
old guy's welcome to use some of my time.

1368
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,169
It's not a time problem,
it's a bike problem.

1369
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:28,874
Well, I think we ought
to let him run.

1370
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:31,444
He came all the way from
New Zealand to do this.

1371
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:34,146
Jim, have you had a good look
at his machine?

1372
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:36,146
All I know is the man's
the genuine article.

1373
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,385
Yeah, but the bike is
the genuine dinosaur.

1374
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:41,519
Look, we carry the cans
for the decisions around here.

1375
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,557
And if he kills himself and there's
about a 100 to 1 that he will.

1376
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,287
Are gonna have a hell
of a lot of trouble on our hands.

1377
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:52,094
Yeah, sounds like we're a bunch
of chicken shits if you want my opinion.

1378
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,896
His bike didn't even come close
to passing tech inspection, Jim.

1379
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,374
Burt.

1380
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:08,680
Hello, Jim. Come in.

1381
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,113
Rollie Free said
I could find you here.

1382
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:14,119
Rollie Free, he's the best,
he's a real gentleman.

1383
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,788
He set me up in this place
for nothing.

1384
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,353
What are you doing?

1385
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:25,263
Well, the soft shoe polish
fills in the cracks makes the tyres...

1386
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:27,660
Iook spick and span,
good as new.

1387
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,436
Cheaper than new ones anyway.

1388
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:30,830
I didn't see that.

1389
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:35,542
Well? Can I run?

1390
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:39,640
I'm sorry, Burt.

1391
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,912
Who the heck
do they think they are?

1392
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:53,282
Crikey Jim, you know, I'm not trying
to run a mile in four minutes...

1393
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:56,191
all I've got to do is sit there
and open up the throttle...

1394
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,698
I mean, after all
it's my ruddy life, isn't it?

1395
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,225
Can't you do anything?

1396
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:06,865
I mean, I just want to try and get her
to go over 00 just once that's all...

1397
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,874
once I've cracked 00
I'll be quite happy...

1398
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,468
to piss off back home to New Zealand
and Bob's your uncle.

1399
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:16,105
You're a well respected man around here,
can you talk to them?

1400
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,543
I tried.

1401
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:21,321
You've got as much chance
of writing yourself off as I have...

1402
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:24,153
you know that.
Just talk to them again.

1403
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:27,654
I know they'll listen to you, mate.

1404
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:32,827
Okay Burt, I'll try.
See you tomorrow.

1405
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:34,225
Okay.

1406
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:41,067
I mean I'm half the age of some
of those characters out there.

1407
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:48,380
What's that?

1408
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,378
That's just indigestion.

1409
01:34:56,123 --> 01:35:00,958
Everyone wants us old buggers
to curl up in some quiet corner and die.

1410
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:05,728
Well, Burt Munro's not ready to finish
yet, I'll tell you that, mate.

1411
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,769
I'll give it a shot
but I'm not promising anything.

1412
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,370
Thanks, mate.
Thanks a lot.

1413
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:21,681
The famous Challenger One,,,

1414
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,387
What is he doing?

1415
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:36,060
- Didn't Jim tell him?
- He says he did.

1416
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:39,327
- Well, then what's he doing here?
- Why won't you let him run?

1417
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,924
Hey, he's too old
and his bike's too old.

1418
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,363
He's come half way round the world
to ride that cycle.

1419
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:45,865
Yeah, come on.

1420
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:50,143
- Wendy, if he was to kill himself.
- So? It's his life.

1421
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:52,773
Keep an eye out
for those officials.

1422
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,440
You sure you want to do this?
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

1423
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:58,177
Hurry up. If we're going to do
this thing you've got to hurry.

1424
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,219
Alright, let's go,
here's your helmet.

1425
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:03,551
Here's your goggles.

1426
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,789
- Come on, Burt. We've got to go.
- Yeah, right.

1427
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:07,450
Come on, put them on.

1428
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,459
Go, go, come on.

1429
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,067
Okay, let's go, push.

1430
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,107
Push, go fast.

1431
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,534
Hey, you can't. Hey...

1432
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,270
- you can't do that.
- Come on, come on!

1433
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,141
Hang on!

1434
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,512
Hey, where are you going with that?

1435
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,762
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1436
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,790
What the hell are you doing, Burt?
What the hell are you doing?

1437
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:47,996
Just getting her warmed up, Bob.

1438
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,535
Didn't look like you were
getting her warmed up.

1439
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,068
Jesus, he was going to take
the thing for a freakin' run.

1440
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,197
Bob.

1441
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:54,263
Oh, boy.

1442
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:59,972
That is the most determined man
I have ever seen in my entire life.

1443
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,581
I kind of feel sorry
for the old cooty.

1444
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:05,651
Coming all this way.

1445
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:08,312
Isn't there some way
we can accommodate him?

1446
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:10,447
I mean there can't be
much risk there...

1447
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:13,391
his bike will be
lucky if it does 70.

1448
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:16,993
What do you say? What if we bend
the rules this once, huh?

1449
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,467
Jesus!

1450
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:25,262
Bob and I had a little chat...

1451
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:28,805
and we're thinking we're gonna
organize a handling run for you.

1452
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:32,440
- You are? What?
- A handling run.

1453
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,178
All the officials,
we're gonna get into our vehicles and...

1454
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:36,375
- You're joking, huh?
- No, I'm not.

1455
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,441
We're going to follow
along behind you...

1456
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,453
and we're going to see
if you're okay to ride this beast.

1457
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,579
Of course I'm okay to ride it.

1458
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:44,749
First thing tomorrow morning, alright?
Bright and early.

1459
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:48,091
Well, thanks fellas.

1460
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:51,155
Hey. My luck's in then.

1461
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,764
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1462
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,269
Don't hurt yourself.

1463
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:12,147
Okay, everyone listen up.
This is what we're gonna do.

1464
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,919
Burt, you're gonna get rolling...

1465
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:18,852
ride slowly along. We'll all jump in
our vehicles, follow you down the track.

1466
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:21,291
- See if you can handle this thing.
- I'll handle her alright.

1467
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,223
Alright. Everybody got that?

1468
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:26,022
Okay, everybody,
let's get in the cars.

1469
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:52,087
Hope that old man doesn't make
a fool of himself.

1470
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,390
Here we go.

1471
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,927
I'm ready, let's go.

1472
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:02,433
Push it!

1473
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,337
Faster, boys.

1474
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:07,667
Go, Burt!

1475
01:39:32,232 --> 01:39:33,324
Sixty.

1476
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:35,425
Sixty-five, seventy.

1477
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:38,265
That a boy, Burt.

1478
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:39,471
Seventy-five.

1479
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:42,971
There he goes up to eighty,
eighty, eighty five.

1480
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:48,479
Ninety.

1481
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:58,516
Ninety-five,
look at that thing go.

1482
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,965
- Holy smoke.
- He's leaving them behind!

1483
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:14,068
What the hell is
that old guy up to?

1484
01:40:14,174 --> 01:40:15,869
Nobody told him
he could give it everything.

1485
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,442
I guess that solves the question
of whether or not he can handle it.

1486
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,873
We were doing ninety-five
and he left us in the dust.

1487
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:22,480
Look at him go!

1488
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:23,876
That a boy, go, Burt.

1489
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:05,155
Hold her firm.

1490
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:06,483
Hold her firm.

1491
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,785
Got it? Don't let it go.

1492
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:11,630
That was a disaster!

1493
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:15,601
- Hey, Burt. How'd it go.
- Not good.

1494
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,630
So, what's the verdict?

1495
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:24,877
When you opened up there in top
gear you sure left us in the dust.

1496
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,536
I couldn't even get her out
of second gear, Earl.

1497
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:31,715
The plugs were oiling up, I had to feed
her more juice up the revs a little.

1498
01:41:31,952 --> 01:41:35,012
Well, I guess we'll see if you're
telling us the truth, Munro.

1499
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,916
Are you telling me I can officially run
on the track and have it timed?

1500
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:41,751
That's what I'm saying, Burt.

1501
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,726
You'll never know what
this means to me, Otto.

1502
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:49,800
5 years I've lived for this day,
5 years.

1503
01:41:50,237 --> 01:41:53,866
Sometimes you've got to bend the rules
a little, today's one of those days.

1504
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:57,434
- Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

1505
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:06,045
- What did they say?
- What happened?

1506
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,449
They said I could run.

1507
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:11,584
That's great!

1508
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,593
- So why the long face then?
- Well, I don't know...

1509
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:18,028
it's just starting to sink in
and I've got a problem a big problem.

1510
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:21,699
As soon as I go over a hundred and
ten it starts to wobble like heck...

1511
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,269
a bad speed wobble.

1512
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:26,806
Well, it did look like you were
about as stable as my last wife.

1513
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:31,137
I've got a theory
and I think I'm right.

1514
01:42:31,245 --> 01:42:34,009
I need about twenty car batteries.

1515
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,012
Twenty?

1516
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:38,009
Is it ok to steel
these batteries, Burt?

1517
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:40,048
We're not steeling them Marty,
we're souveniring them.

1518
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,951
Careful of that acid there.

1519
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:44,014
What do we do
with them now?

1520
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,888
Well, we're going to talk someone
into lending us a painter's blow torch.

1521
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:48,560
A painter's blow torch?

1522
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,489
What are we going to do
with all this metal, Burt?

1523
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:58,994
Well, when this cools down,
we'll have ourselves a lead brick.

1524
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:03,140
- What do you do with a lead brick?
- Place it in the front of the motorcycle.

1525
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:05,837
- And that's your plan?
- Yeah.

1526
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:11,440
Well, you must get the center
of pressure behind the center of gravity...

1527
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:14,521
and if you don't get it right
then she'll start to fish tail...

1528
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:17,523
- when you get her wound up.
- What do you mean by fish tail?

1529
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:21,123
Well, like a fish's behind you know.
It'll start doing that.

1530
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:23,696
And that's what happened today
when I had the handling run.

1531
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:27,559
And so in a panic I lifted my head up
from behind the screen...

1532
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:31,599
and suddenly the bike started
to go straight and...

1533
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:36,172
I knew I'd solved the problem somehow
by sticking my head up into the wind.

1534
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,801
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

1535
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:41,137
Well, I'll show you.
Let me have that.

1536
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:44,111
What are you doing?

1537
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:47,843
Lmagine the cigar
is my streamliner.

1538
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:49,582
Don't poke holes in the cigar.

1539
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:53,018
Now if I hold it in the middle
and blow on it. Like so.

1540
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:56,592
See how unstable it is?

1541
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,058
Now if I...

1542
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:01,061
- shift the...
- Not again!

1543
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:03,893
Center of pressure here.
And blow on it.

1544
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:10,276
See it's much more stable.

1545
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:14,674
Just the center of pressure
is behind the center of gravity...

1546
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:17,781
and that's what I'm trying to fix
with the lead brick you see.

1547
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:19,575
You're quite clever,
did you know that, Burt?

1548
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:23,413
Now all I need to do is to test
my theory before I run on the salt...

1549
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:24,420
and I was thinking of,
you know...

1550
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:28,052
crossing over the state line
from here in Utah to Nevada...

1551
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,389
where there's no speed limit and running
with a lead brick in the front of it.

1552
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,116
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1553
01:45:24,551 --> 01:45:26,519
Do you know how fast you were
going back there?

1554
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:27,947
Yeah, about...

1555
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:30,854
150, 160 miles an hour.

1556
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:35,887
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1557
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:38,592
How's he going to talk
his way out of this one?

1558
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:42,558
He sure got his arse
in a sling this time, don't he?

1559
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:46,566
So what's the situation with this thing?
You don't have any license plates on it.

1560
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,071
- It's registered in New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

1561
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:52,473
Yeah, that's where I come from.

1562
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,441
Alright, you mean to tell me...

1563
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,179
that this contraption of yours
is registered for the road?

1564
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:04,451
- Yeah, in New Zealand.
- New Zealand, right.

1565
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:08,290
Well, how about taking it easy
here in Nevada?

1566
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:10,529
Just because we don't have
a speed limit don't mean...

1567
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:14,089
- we want people killing themselves.
- No, sounds fair enough to me.

1568
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:18,004
- Right, you have a good day then.
- I will, thank you.

1569
01:46:18,071 --> 01:46:19,265
Burt, everything OK?

1570
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:24,775
Well, fellows, we're going to have
to give the lead brick...

1571
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,846
the old Spanish archer.

1572
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:30,207
- Spanish archer?
- Yeah, the big elbow, you know.

1573
01:46:31,084 --> 01:46:32,949
The lead brick has got to go.

1574
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:35,584
Who's stupid idea was that anyway?

1575
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:36,619
It was yours.

1576
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:41,490
Yeah. Well, I'm just going to have
to ride her, the way she is.

1577
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:43,193
What about that speed wobble?

1578
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:46,796
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I get there.

1579
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,725
- I've got another problem too.
- Yeah, what now?

1580
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:52,504
Well, when I get her going...

1581
01:46:52,773 --> 01:46:56,368
there's an enormous amount of heat
comes off the exhaust pipe...

1582
01:46:56,676 --> 01:46:59,941
and I hope
it doesn't cook my leg.

1583
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:04,910
Maybe you can wrap some asbestos cloth
around it, that should fix it right.

1584
01:47:04,985 --> 01:47:06,213
That's a good idea.

1585
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,354
So you got any more problems
you want to tell us about?

1586
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,482
Yes, yes, my old ticker.

1587
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,793
- You've got a bad heart?
- Yes, I have.

1588
01:47:18,832 --> 01:47:20,732
I've got a little surprise
for you.

1589
01:47:21,301 --> 01:47:24,134
- What?
- Close your eyes and give me your hand.

1590
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,796
- What?
- Just close your eyes. Come on.

1591
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:29,541
- What for?
- Because I said so, mister, come on.

1592
01:47:32,412 --> 01:47:33,777
Keep walking.

1593
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,509
Wendy, you're not going to make
a fool of an old man I hope.

1594
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:39,141
I'd never do that, Burt.

1595
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:40,511
Never.

1596
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:42,186
Never. Okay. Okay.

1597
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:43,921
Now turn around.

1598
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:45,852
Alright.

1599
01:47:45,926 --> 01:47:47,757
Now, hold your hands out.

1600
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:49,953
Put that in your pocket.

1601
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:51,155
Alright.

1602
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:52,490
There we go good.

1603
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,290
You can open them.

1604
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,179
What are you all staring at?

1605
01:48:14,054 --> 01:48:16,022
- What is this?
- Burt...

1606
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,987
we've unanimously voted you here on
the Salt planes, sportsman of the year...

1607
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,559
because we figured nobody has
ever traveled as far as you have...

1608
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,892
to be here for speed week...

1609
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:28,695
so normally we would present
a trophy or something like that...

1610
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:31,904
but considering your case
we thought a few extra dollars...

1611
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:34,770
would be more appreciated
so we past the hat around.

1612
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:39,874
My goodness!

1613
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,508
There are no words.

1614
01:48:58,298 --> 01:48:59,856
Well, thank you all.

1615
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:02,758
Thank you all very much.

1616
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:06,870
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

1617
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:11,376
Oh dear, it's quite
overwhelming you know...

1618
01:49:11,678 --> 01:49:14,146
it's 5 years dream
to come here.

1619
01:49:17,183 --> 01:49:22,052
I should try
to justify you, your respect and...

1620
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:28,126
you know the original speed
of my old bike was 54 miles an hour.

1621
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:35,397
And today I'm hoping to,
you know, improve it a little.

1622
01:49:45,645 --> 01:49:48,876
The cars are at the start, line now,
The next one is the 86,,,

1623
01:49:49,215 --> 01:49:52,548
On the bucket seat
the pilot is ready to be pushed out,

1624
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:03,990
Next competitor is Burt, Munro,

1625
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:07,766
All the way from Invercargill,
New Zealand,

1626
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:12,267
Burt, Munro 's entry
was approved just yesterday,

1627
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,272
Burt, where'd you get this stuff?

1628
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:24,509
- What?
- I say, where'd you get this stuff?

1629
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:28,584
I tore an old electric blanket apart
and got the asbestos cloth out of it.

1630
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:31,147
You got those heart pills?

1631
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,488
- Are you okay?
- Better take one, yeah.

1632
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,193
They're almost ready.

1633
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,887
Guys, come on, let's go.

1634
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:40,398
You know the bottle says
that they may cause drowsiness...

1635
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:42,799
- do not operate machinery.
- I know that.

1636
01:50:43,436 --> 01:50:45,199
Well, you're not supposed
to take two of them anyway.

1637
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,599
One for me
and one for the old girl.

1638
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:49,306
Nitroglycerine.

1639
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,099
Should make it go faster.

1640
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:53,178
Have some of this, love.

1641
01:50:57,217 --> 01:50:58,309
There you go.

1642
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:07,485
- Yeah, we're almost there.
- Alright, here we go.

1643
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:09,593
- Hold her still.
- Your goggles.

1644
01:51:09,696 --> 01:51:10,594
- What?
- Goggles.

1645
01:51:10,697 --> 01:51:12,961
- Put your goggles on.
- I know, calm down.

1646
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:21,502
I can't get my leg in because
of the asbestos cloth on it.

1647
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:30,913
Let me take it off.

1648
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:34,745
- What about your leg in that heat?
- Screw it, I've got a spare one.

1649
01:51:36,956 --> 01:51:38,446
Right, Burt.

1650
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:40,055
Get those goggles.

1651
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:43,595
- Ready?
- Alright, you know the way.

1652
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:44,761
Make sure you come back.

1653
01:51:45,031 --> 01:51:46,225
Come on, let's go!

1654
01:51:46,466 --> 01:51:47,626
Right, push!

1655
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,431
Come on, fellas. Push faster!

1656
01:51:52,605 --> 01:51:53,799
Keep running.

1657
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:59,073
Keep it straight, buddy.

1658
01:52:00,747 --> 01:52:03,011
Bring it in, Burt. Come on.
Go, go, go...

1659
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:04,509
Let's go, Burt!

1660
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,357
Come on, Burt!

1661
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:13,549
You can do it, Burt.

1662
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:16,057
He's got no parachute,
he's got no brakes.

1663
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,447
158.647.

1664
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:41,384
Mile one,
158.647 miles per hour.

1665
01:52:41,654 --> 01:52:42,882
Go, Burt!

1666
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:45,020
- Go on!
- Go, Burt!

1667
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:47,550
- Make us proud, honey!
- Burt!

1668
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:04,542
167.91.

1669
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:08,406
Mile two,
167.91 miles per hour.

1670
01:53:08,648 --> 01:53:11,139
Break it, Burt.
Come on! Go, go, go!

1671
01:53:11,317 --> 01:53:12,249
Come on, Burt.

1672
01:53:22,428 --> 01:53:26,296
Mile three,
171,371 miles per hour,

1673
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:27,999
Come on, come on, come on!

1674
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:42,911
Mile four,

Back to whatever planet he came from

01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:32,004
Tom, can you get that,

1697
01:57:37,383 --> 01:57:38,543

Good to see ya.

1726
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:03,359
You're growing up a bit, huh?

1727
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:05,995
I looked after your lemon tree
just like you told me.

1728
01:59:06,105 --> 01:59:07,367
You did, yeah.

1729
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:08,834
It's doing well isn't it?

1730
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:10,568
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1731
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:13,835
- I fed the chickens.
- You did?

1732
01:59:14,113 --> 01:59:16,013

- I knew you would.
- How fast did you go?

1737
01:59:24,924 --> 01:59:28,223
Mighty fast. In one of my runs
I did over 00 miles an hour.

1738
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:31,395
What would happen if you opened
your mouth at that speed?

1739
01:59:31,697 --> 01:59:33,961
Well, you'd blow the backside
out of your pants I reckon.

1740
01:59:36,202 --> 01:59:37,396
Right, let's see.

1741
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,839

Back in my shed,
