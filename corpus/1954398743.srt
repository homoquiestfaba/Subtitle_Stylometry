[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

Hello!

down, sit down, sit down.

10
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,567
Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that.

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Uh, that's very sweet of you.

13
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,067
[Man] Love you!

14
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,133
I'm at the end of the tour right now.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,933
I'm very happy to be on tour
because I now have a child.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Ah, so...

17
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,633
any time out of home is good for me.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,100
Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant
after knowing her for two months.

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,167
So...

20
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,900
[Audience cheering]

21
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,267
And she's a nice girl, and
I love her in a way, sure.

23
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:21,367
My problem with my girlfriend is,

24
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:24,200
she's very sweet, but she's
shit at telling stories,

25
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,767
and I'm awesome at telling stories,

26
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,200
so it really bothers me when she talks.

27
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,467
And I don't know if that'll
be a problem in the future,

28
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:35,500
but it's a problem now and I
don't see it getting better.

29
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:36,700
Um...

30
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll give you an example, right?

31
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:39,833
I was in the car,

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,400
and my son Hank was
asleep in the back seat,

33
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,233
and we're driving along, and
on the radio comes Madonna,

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
and my girlfriend just
slips into conversation,

35
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,333
"Oh, I used to party with Madonna."

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,333
And I went, "You fucking what, when?"

37
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,600
And she went, "I used
to party with Madonna."

38
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, I should fill you
in a little bit on this.

39
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,033
My girlfriend used to be
a model in Miami, right?

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,267
I'm not bragging. I
didn't get the model years.

41
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,167
I didn't get those years.

42
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,867
I've seen the photos. Very impressive.

43
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:07,967
Um...

44
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,400
So, I said, "So you used
to party with Madonna.

45
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:14,700
Madonna used to have big parties
and invite models over, right?"

46
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,067
And she went, "No, no, it would
just be me and a few other people."

47
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:21,067
I go, "You need to elaborate
on this story right now."

48
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:26,033
And she goes, "Oh, okay, I used to
date the center for the Miami Heat."

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,800
As soon as you hear that
the mother of your child

50
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,833
used to date an NBA center,

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,700
even if this guy's even
slightly in proportion...

52
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,567
a lot of things flood through your head.

53
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,900
First thing is, "That's why
your cunt's so fucked up."

54
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,067
That's a big one.

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,000
"That's why our child came
out while you were walking.

56
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,567
I understand."

57
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,067
So she said, "I used to date
the center for the Miami Heat.

58
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,533
His best friend was Dennis Rodman.
Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna,

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
and we used to go over to Madonna's house."

60
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,367
And she goes, "This one time,

61
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,600
the four of us were
over at Madonna's house,

62
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:09,867
and we were all fucked up on drugs,
and one thing led to another..."

63
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:13,267
And then I went, "Shut the fuck up!"

64
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,133
And she went, "What?"

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,967
I said, "I know what 'one
thing led to another' means!

66
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,133
You all started fucking each other!"

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,667
And she went, "We did. We
started..." "Just shut up!"

68
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:29,833
And she goes, "What do you care for?"
I said, "You're the mother of my child!

69
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,467
I don't wanna picture you being
fucked by a 7'2" NBA player

70
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,500
while you're licking out
Madonna's muscular vagina

71
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,767
and Dennis Rodman is in the corner
stroking his tattooed cock, going..."

72
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,133
[Moaning]

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,667
And she goes, "Oh, you're being silly.

74
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,733
What do you care for?

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,833
You've partied way more
than I have in my life."

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,200
And I went, "That is not true.

77
00:03:57,267 --> 00:04:00,667
I've gotten wasted way more than you have,

78
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:03,700
but I have, in no way,
partied way more than you have.

79
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,267
Often, I get wasted just by myself.

80
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,800
I wouldn't call it a party."

81
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,033
For most of my career, I was
a struggling comedian, right?

82
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,433
And this is how struggling
comedians party, right?

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,367
It's 5:00 a.m., Monday, right?

84
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,400
We're in a one-bedroom apartment.

85
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,367
Seven of us are standing
around a coffee table,

86
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,167
trying to stretch out two grams of coke.

87
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,800
One of us is at the end of the
table giving conspiracy theories...

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,067
and the rest of us are talking
about where women might be.

89
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:42,433
One of us has come up with a plan.

90
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,033
The plan goes like this,

91
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
"Well...

92
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,600
nurses will be finishing their shift soon.

93
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,733
Maybe if we just stand
out the front of the ER,

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,267
they'll appreciate seven funny guys."

95
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,500
[Chuckles]

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,900
I don't... You know, I've
never partied like a model.

97
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,867
I have partied twice in my life. Twice.

98
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,933
Like, really partied.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,367
I've had good nights out,
but I've really partied twice.

100
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,433
If you really party,

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,667
and most people never experience
this, it's an amazing thing.

102
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,800
It happens in Vegas. It
can only happen in Vegas,

103
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,133
and it's gotta involve celebrity, right?

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm not famous,

105
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,033
but the people around me were super famous,

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,500
and I was at this party in the
night club, and they took me in.

107
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,900
And then there's the night club,

108
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,667
but then there's the real
night club out the back,

109
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,333
which is, like, the size of this
stage. It's only a little room.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
And you go back there and you can just...

111
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,667
They encourage you to
take drugs in the open,

112
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,767
and you're just doing
it off a key, [Sniffs]

113
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,867
and they're going, "No, dude.
Use the table. Don't use your..."

114
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,700
And I go, "Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um..."

115
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,467
And it's confusing at first,

116
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:52,733
and then their security will drag women
off that other night club into your room.

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,533
Just bring 'em in like, "Huh?"

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,867
And you can do this. You can go...

119
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,300
"Uh..."

120
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,400
Like that.

121
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:01,900
And they'll drag these women away.

122
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,267
It is the best thing you'll
ever do with your life.

123
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,633
When you party that hard as a
man, there's a lot of remorse

124
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,133
'cause you have to tip
everyone a lot of money.

125
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,800
You wake up in the morning
with a terrible hangover,

126
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:16,133
and you go to your friends.
You go, "Oh, my God.

127
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,367
We partied so hard last
night. I spent $5,000."

128
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,167
When a hot girl parties that hard,
she wakes up in the morning and goes,

129
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,233
"Oh, my God.

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,333
We partied so hard last
night. I made $5,000."

131
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,233
And that's a vastly
different emotion that...

132
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,867
I don't think women
will never... Yeah, okay.

133
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,933
This is the thing.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,167
In America, at the moment, they're
trying to raise the minimum wage

135
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,333
to, I don't know, $16 an
hour or something like that,

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,467
and whenever they bring up this argument,

137
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,500
they always go, "And still to this day,

138
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,567
women only earn 70% of what
men earn in the workplace."

139
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,267
And of course, that's disgusting.

140
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,633
How dare women earn so much?

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,567
Like...

142
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:04,200
a lot of things that I say tonight will
be jokes that I don't actually mean,

143
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:07,467
but this is something I'm
really passionate about.

144
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:14,233
Women do not deserve to earn as
much money as men in the workplace.

145
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,767
I'm sorry. I...

146
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,533
[Audience whooping]

147
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,733
I'm not being a
misogynistic bastard, right?

148
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm not saying that
women don't work as hard.

149
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,167
I'm sure they do.

150
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm not saying they don't do as good a job.

151
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,567
What I'm saying is

152
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,733
they don't deserve to
earn as much money as men.

153
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:35,933
Right?

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,700
Men need that extra 30%
to buy meals and drinks

155
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,700
and Jim Jefferies
tickets and all that shit!

156
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,900
[Audience cheering]

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Now...

158
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm sure there's women in
this room that are saying,

159
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,900
"Oh, I pay for my drinks.
I bought my own ticket."

160
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,067
And don't think we don't
appreciate the uglies,

161
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,633
'cause we do.

162
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,400
Right? We do.

163
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,333
But there's little things in
society that you can't change.

164
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,300
Men have extra expenses
that you'll never understand.

165
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,300
There's holidays that are just for women.

166
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,067
Like Valentine's Day is just for women.

167
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,300
They say it's for romantics.

168
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,267
They say it's for couples
or something like that.

169
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,933
It's just for women.

170

There's no man who gets
excited by Valentine's Day.

Valentine's Day is a mathematical

182

what I'll get for Mother's Day."

Day is to a new mum, you know?

her a cappuccino machine

would have wanted her to have...

I'm not a bastard. I wrote
a card. I'm right-handed.

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,567
He's a good little boy.

338
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,533
No, he's a great little
fella. I really like him.

339
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Um...

340
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,467
My girlfriend super loves him,
though. It's fucking creepy.

341
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,700
And...

342
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm glad I have a son.
That worked out good for me.

343
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,900
I wouldn't be a good father to a
girl. It wouldn't be good for me.

344
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,600
Nothing weird. Wouldn't fuck it. I...

345
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,167
I just don't get along with
women. You know how it is.

346
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,833
I don't want them in my house, and...

347
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,167
So...

348
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,367
Because you dream, see...

349
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,267
For example, okay? When Hank was born...

350
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,767
the couple over the road, within
two weeks of Hank being born,

351
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,000
had a baby girl,

352
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:07,233
and rightly or wrongly, the first
thing that went through my head was...

353
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,200
"Aw, that's great.

354
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,600
I hope Hank fucks that one day."

355
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,633
That's what I think... 'Cause
that's what I think about my son.

356
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,200
I hope when he's of age,
he just fucks everything.

357
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,067
I don't care if my son is gay or straight.

358
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,733
All I care about is, when he is of age,

359
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,267
that he gets every bit of fucking
pussy or cock that he desires.

360
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,000
That is my dream for my son!

361
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,700
[Audience cheering]

362
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:39,000
But never in the history
of fathers and daughters,

363
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,567
has a father held his baby girl and gone,

364
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:45,333
"Oh, I hope you have a lot of
cocks through you in your life.

365
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,167
I hope you're never shy of a cock.

366
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:50,267
I hope you pass out at parties
and all the boys are queuing up."

367
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,000
Right, you know...

368
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,667
And it's not just me.

369
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,667
Women treat baby girls and
baby boys differently as well.

370
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,500
My girlfriend goes to
the gym every morning.

371
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:03,367
I go there very occasionally,
and when you go to the gym,

372
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,633
there's a little daycare
crèche thing in the gym

373
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,867
where you can hand your child off,

374
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,733
and inside that daycare, there's,
like, three women in their 50s.

375
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,100
They're very nice ladies, and you
hand your kid off and he plays.

376
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,133
Then when you finish your
workout, you come and get him.

377
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,167
And there's a woman that works
there who just loves my son.

378
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,233
She sees all the other
kids, but she loves Hank,

379
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
and Hank fucking loves her,

380
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,067
and the two of them light
up when they see each other.

381
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,167
And it's super cute,

382
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:26,967
I bring Hank up the stairs,
and he starts going, "Uh, uh!"

383
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,600
Trying to reach at her, all right?

384
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,400
And she does this, she goes,
"Everyone, my boyfriend's here.

385
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,333
Here's my boyfriend. Give
him here. He's my boyfriend."

386
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,433
And then she kisses him, and she goes,

387
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,067
♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses
My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪

388
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,267
It's fucking adorable.

389
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,967
But I tried doing that with a baby girl...

390
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:56,100
Let's say you go to the
gym and there's a daycare,

391
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,400
and me and a couple of my
mates are working there.

392
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,433
"Hey, everyone...

393
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,300
me girlfriend's here.

394
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,300
Give her here. Give her
here. She's my girlfriend.

395
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,967
My girlfriend gives me
kisses. You know that, right?

396
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,300
She's always giving me kisses.

397
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,633
Enjoy your workout. Don't
worry about a thing."

398
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,633
[Applause]

399
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,467
[Cheering]

400
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,600
So...

401
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,400
Also...

402
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:42,933
it's just easier to bring up
a son than it is a daughter.

403
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's just little things.

404
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,600
Even when they're babies, it's just easier.

405
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,867
There's a wiping technique
when you're wiping a baby's ass.

406
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,100
I don't know if you have children,
but this is how you do it.

407
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,133
The baby lays on its back.
You put their feet together.

408
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,433
You lift the feet up, and
then you go in and wipe.

409
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,467
With a boy, you can wipe like that.

410
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,667
Up and down, side to side,
whatever the fuck you want, right?

411
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,533
With a girl, you gotta
wipe downward and away.

412
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,267
Downward and away.

413
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:11,767
It's very important that
you wipe away from the cunt.

414
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,800
Very important.

415
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:16,833
'Cause it turns out that women of all ages

416
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,867
hate having shit in their cunts.

417
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,667
They do. They fucking hate it.

418
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,833
Boys don't give a shit. Fucking...

419
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,900
My son will have shit all
over his dick and balls,

420
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,600
and I'll be cleaning it
off under the foreskin,

421
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,867
and he'll be laughing like
it's the best day ever.

422
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,900
Even at my age now,

423
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,767
I find it funny if I have shit on my dick.

424
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,633
If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass,

425
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,767
I pull out, I've got shit on my dick,

426
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,400
I'll ring me mate Jason
up and go, "Hey, Jason...

427
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:58,200
It's happened again.
I got shit on my dick."

428
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,667
And he'll tell me a similar story
about when he had shit on his dick,

429
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,267
and we'll laugh and laugh and laugh.

430
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,667
But never in the history of women

431
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,533
has there been a woman with shit
in her cunt and she's thought,

432
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,800
"Oh, I can't wait to
call Karen." [Chuckles]

433
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,400
[Laughs]

434
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,667
When you...

435
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,100
When my girlfriend got pregnant...

436
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,867
When you meet...

437
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:30,667
When you haven't got a child,
couples who have children

438
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,567
are always bragging about how
cool it is to have children.

439
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:35,633
Whenever you meet couples with
children they're always like,

440
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,100
"It is the most fulfilling thing
I've ever done with my life.

441
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,333
My heart grows larger
and larger every day."

442
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,867
And then the second that
my girlfriend got pregnant,

443
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,967
those same people went like this,

444
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,367
"You're never gonna sleep
again! [Laughs maniacally]

445
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,700
Forget about it. It's over.
You're not gonna sleep."

446
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,600
They're constantly telling
you you're not gonna sleep.

447
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,600
Raising a baby is not that hard.

448
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,467
I'll tell you what, it's
easier than a coke habit.

449
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,167
I had a coke habit for
seven-and-a-half fucking years!

450
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:10,400
At least it's not me who
wakes up crying anymore!

451
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,400
I can sleep through other people crying.

452
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:16,567
I've had girlfriends.

453
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,600
That's like white noise
to me. I find it soothing.

454
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,533
See, me and my girlfriend,
just two months, we went,

455
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,167
"Fuck it! Let's have a
kid." Fucking did it, right?

456
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,500
These other people, man...

457
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,100
You know these couples, and
they date from high school,

458
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,033
and then they go out for a bit longer,

459
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,033
and then after being together
for like, seven years, they go,

460
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
"We're getting engaged. You
wanna come to the party?"

461
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,300
And you wanna say, "No, you're
really boring and we hate you."

462
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,333
But you go, "Oh, okay, great.
You're still together, are you?

463
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
You fucked one person,
have you? Oh, how exciting."

464
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,567
And...

465
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,867
And then what they do is they
don't have a kid right away

466
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,033
because they're still not ready.

467
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,867
"We have to see how our
careers are going and shit."

468
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,767
And what they do is they get a dog,

469
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,733
and then they act like the
fucking dog's their baby.

470
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,333
They refer to it as their fucking baby.

471
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,233
They send you a Christmas
card of them holding the dog...

472
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,933
and it says, "From our family to yours."

473
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:17,467
And then you have a barbecue, and
you invite them, the humans, right?

474
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,533
Then they come over.

475
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,367
This fucking dog runs in,
jumping over everything,

476
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,233
and you're like, "What
the fuck is this shit?"

477
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,967
And they're like, "We had to bring
him. We bring our baby everywhere."

478
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,700
And you go, "Well, your baby
is biting my actual baby.

479
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,533
Can you control..."

480
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,533
And then, eventually, they
decide they're gonna have a kid

481
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,800
'cause they've learned
so much from the dog,

482
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,300
and then they bring the kid back,

483
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,433
and the dog runs up, like,
"What's happening? A new person."

484
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,367
And they're like, "Fuck off.
We don't love you anymore.

485
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,900
We're going."

486
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,033
And they think they've
learnt something from the dog,

487
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,633
and they haven't learnt anything.

488
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,433
What happens if your
girlfriend's away on work

489
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
and the dog dies?

490
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:58,167
You go off, you buy another dog

491
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:01,600
that looks similar to the original dog...

492
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,267
try to pass it off as the same dog.

493
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,000
What happens if your
girlfriend's away on work

494
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:10,300
and the baby dies?

495
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,967
Very hard...

496
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:21,733
to get a baby that looks exactly the same
in the short period of time that you have.

497
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,100
Easier if you're black or Asian.

498
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,767
[Audience cheering]

499
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,500
Boston, no!

500
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,400
No! No!

501
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,867
Shut up!

502
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:40,267
I will not put up with
racism at my shows, okay?

503
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:43,267
I'm not saying 'cause they look the same.

504
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm saying 'cause they're
easier to purchase.

If Angelina Jolie and Madonna
have taught us anything...

508
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,500
it is that you can buy
black and Asian people.

509
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,567
I'm yet to see a black celebrity couple

Bring him over. Come on."

I'm gonna talk about something now that
sort of splits the crowd a little bit.

514

Uh...

517

Don't get excited because
the other people have guns.

518
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,400
The anti-gun people are
like, "Yeah! Do it, Jim!"

519
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:33,400
No, let's just... [Shushes]

520
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,433
Now, before I start saying
this, I wanna say this, right?

521
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,000
I believe in your right
as Americans to have guns.

522
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,200
I'm not trying to stop
you from having guns.

523
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,333
All I'm saying is this is my
personal belief on the opinion.

524
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,867
My opinion on the... Oh, it doesn't matter.

525
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,500
I don't like guns, right?

526
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,433
I'm gonna say some things
that are just facts, right?

527
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,000
In Australia, we had guns,
right? Right up until 1996.

528
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,533
In 1996, Australia had the
biggest massacre on Earth.

529
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
It still hasn't been beaten.

530
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,767
And...

531
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:04,967
Now, after that, they banned the guns.

532
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:08,767
Now, in the 10 years before Port
Arthur, there was 10 massacres.

533
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:12,833
Since the gun ban in 1996, there
hasn't been a single massacre since.

534
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,933
I don't know how or
why this happened, uh...

535
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,700
Maybe it was a coincidence, right?

536
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:23,900
Now, please understand that I
understand that Australia and America

537
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:27,467
are two vastly different cultures
with different people, right? I get it.

538
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,333
In Australia, we had the
biggest massacre on Earth,

539
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,067
and the Australian government
went, "That's it! No more guns!"

540
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,267
And we all went,

541
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,567
"Yeah, all right, then. That
seems fair enough, really."

542
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,467
Now, in America, you had
the Sandy Hook massacre

543
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,400
where little, tiny children died,

544
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,033
and your government went,

545
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,467
"Maybe...

546
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,867
we'll get rid of the big guns?"

547
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,833
And 50% of you went, "Fuck
you! Don't take my guns!"

[Whooping]

549
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:08,200
So, here's where it gets confusing, right?

550
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,433
Now, as I said, I am all for
your Second Amendment rights.

551
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,200
I think you should be able to have
guns. It's in your constitution.

552
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:18,600
What I am not for is
bullshit arguments and lies.

553
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,867
There is one argument and one
argument alone for having a gun,

554
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,167
and this is the argument...

555
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,700
"Fuck off. I like guns."

556
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,367
It's not the best argument,
but it's all you've got.

557
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,733
And there's nothing wrong with it.
There's nothing wrong with saying,

"I like something. Don't
take it away from me."

559
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,900
But don't give me this other
bullshit. The main one is,

560

[In American accent] "I
need it for protection.

561
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:45,200
I need to protect me. I
need to protect my family."

562
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,633
Really? Is that why they're
called "assault rifles"?

563
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,300
Is it?

I've never heard of these fucking
"protection rifles" you speak of.

Protection? What the fuck
are you talking about?

You have a gun in your house,

you're 80% more likely to
use that gun on yourself,

than to shoot someone else.

that'd never happen to me."

00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:23,367
Second reason. Second reason.

671
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:25,667
Second reason, and this is the big one,

672
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,233
I'm foreign...

673
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,033
and that's pissing the
fuck out of you right now,

674
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,233
and your brain is on a loop and
you can't fucking turn it off,

675
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,667
and it's just going around in
a circle, and you're just going,

676
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:40,533
"If you don't like it, go home!
If you don't like it, go home!"

677
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,600
And my answer to that is, "No."

678
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:51,400
I came here legally. I pay my taxes.
I'll say whatever the fuck I want.

679
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:55,933
Your First Amendment means that I can
say the Second Amendment sucks dicks.

680
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,467
And...

681
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,667
unless you're an American Indian,
you're a fucking immigrant as well,

682
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,133
so fuck off.

683
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,933
People get so precious about it.

684
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,167
I understand that to Americans,
your constitution is very important.

685
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,567
I respect it,

686
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:16,433
but please understand that
every country has one as well.

687
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,033
It's no more special than
any other constitution.

688
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,000
We have one in Australia.

689
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,733
I don't know what it says.

690
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,867
I've never seen it.

691
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:27,633
If there's a problem, we'll check
it, but everything's going fine.

692
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,400
And don't get me wrong.

693
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,533
I get that the constitution
is important to you.

694
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,033
I have had... Fucking, I get it, right?

695
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,467
I've had people come up to me in my face

696
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,000
and scream at me in car parks as
I'm leaving the theater, going,

697
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:45,200
[In American accent] "You cannot
change the Second Amendment!"

698
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:47,400
And I'm like, "Yes, you can.

699
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,633
It's called an 'amendment.'"

700
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,833
If you can't change something
that's called an "amendment",

701
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,233
see, many of you need a thesaurus
more than you need a constitution.

702
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,467
And if you don't know what a thesaurus is,

703
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:10,500
get a dictionary and work your way forward.

704
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,833
Don't think your
constitution is set in stone.

705
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,333
You've changed things before.

706
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,533
You used to have
prohibition in there, right?

707
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,400
And then people were like, "Hey,
who likes getting fucked up?

708
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:26,433
Yeah, I like getting fucked
up, too. Let's get that one out.

709
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,300
Let's get that one out."

710
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,167
You used to have this other
thing in America called, uh...

711
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,867
slavery!

712
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:38,667
And then Lincoln came along and
went, "That's it. No more slaves!"

713
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,167
And 50% of you went, "Fuck
you! Don't take my slaves!"

714
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,900
And the same bullshit arguments
came out that you have with guns.

715
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,967
"Why should I have my slaves taken off me?

716
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,633
I'm a responsible slave owner.

717
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,267
I'm trained in how to use my slaves safely.

718
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,933
Just because that guy mistreated his slaves

719
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,200
doesn't mean that my rights
should be taken away from me.

720
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:05,667
I...

721
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:11,533
I use my slaves to protect my family!

722
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,367
I keep my slaves locked in a safe!"

723
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,700
That's the thing.

724
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:26,000
"Why should I have my guns taken
off me? I've done nothing wrong."

725
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:27,633
Look, I agree with you.

726
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,533
If you're a responsible gun owner
and you don't fuck around with them,

727
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,767
then you should be allowed
your guns. You really should.

728
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,500
But that's not how society works.

729
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,167
We have to play to the
1% that are such fuckwits

730
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,833
they ruin it for the rest of us.

731
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,100
We have to walk as slow
as our slowest person

732
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,433
to keep society fucking moving, right?

733
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,933
I take drugs like a
fucking champion, right?

734
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,600
[Audience cheering]

735
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,200
We should all be allowed
to take fucking drugs,

736
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:54,900
but we can't, can we?

737
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:57,800
Because Sarah took drugs and
she stabbed her fucking kids.

738
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,200
Oh!

739
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:02,033
"Oh, thanks, Sarah. You
fucked it up for everyone."

740
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,267
Right?

741
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,367
Everyone should be
allowed to drive their car

742
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,467
as fast as they can do it, right?

743
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:10,967
But we can't because Jonathan
got drunk and ran over a family.

744
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,467
"Thanks, Jonathan!

745
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:17,400
Now I have to drive at
30, you fucking idiot!"

746
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,900
See, that's the thing. "Why
should I have my guns taken off me,

747
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm responsible, just
because that guy's crazy?"

748
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,533
Who's to say you're not crazy?

749
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,533
That's the thing about crazy people.

750
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,433
They don't know they're crazy.

751
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,733
That's what makes them crazy.

752
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,167
The only thing you know
for sure on this Earth is,

753
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:44,067
"I think, therefore I am."
You know that you exist.

754
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:48,300
Anything past that is open
to interpretation, right?

755
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,733
You know you exist and that's it.

756
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,500
Right now, I think I'm in
Boston talking to 1,200 people.

757
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:54,800
That's what I think I'm doing,

758
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:58,133
but there is a good to fair
chance that I'm in a mental home,

759
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,233

[Slurring speech] "I hate
guns. I hate guns. I hate guns."

761
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,733
[Audience applauding]

762
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:16,533
See, one of the better arguments is,

763
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,700
"Well, if you take the guns away, then
only the criminals will have guns."

764
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,700
Not true.

765
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,400
When they banned the guns
in Australia, it worked.

766
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,400
When they banned them in
Britain, it worked, okay?

767
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:29,033
The Bushmaster gun that the
kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook

768
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,200
costs, like, $1,000 American
and you can buy it in Walmart.

769
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,933
It'll be delivered to
your house. That's it, man.

770
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,533
1,000 bucks, right?

771
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,767
That same gun in Australia on
the black market costs $34,000.

772
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,200
Now if you have $34,000,

773
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,600
you don't need to be a criminal.

774
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,600
You've got $34,000.

775
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,400
You're a great little saver. Keep going.

776
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,500
So that covers the criminals,

777
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:02,033
but that doesn't cover the people
who wanna murder your family,

778
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
that are coming after you and your family.

779
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:05,667
It kind of does.

780
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:08,200
The people who do the massacres,
it covers them 'cause they go...

781
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:11,733
The kid at Colorado who
thought he was The Joker,

782
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,833
let's say that he had some social issues.

783
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:19,867
The kid at Sandy Hook
was Asperger's as fuck.

784
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,567
Right?

785
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:26,833
I don't know if you know a
lot about the black market,

786
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
but you can't just rock
up at the docks going,

787
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,100
[Slurring speech] "Guns!

Who wants to sell me a gun?"

789
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:46,533
Now, I'm gonna wrap this up. We
won't talk about it anymore. Now...

790
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:51,033
See, the one thing that
I do really agree with

791
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,200
with the right to bear arms,

792
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:55,467
I really agree with... That
the real reason it was written

793
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:58,633
was so that you could form a militia to
fight against a tyrannical government.

794
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,533
In case the government
became a bunch of cunts,

795
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,700
you could all get your guns and fight back,

796
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,033
and that's why it was written.

797
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,600
- [Audience cheering]
- Yeah!

798
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:11,233
And that made a hell of a lot of
sense when it was just muskets.

799
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,767
But you do know the government
has drones, right? You get that?

800
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:19,400
You're bringing guns to a drone fight!

801
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:24,033
If we went back to muskets, I'm all for it!

802
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,567
Keep the Second Amendment.
If we all have muskets...

803
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:28,467
Muskets are awesome!

804
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:32,267
Every cunt should be carrying
a musket with him at all times.

805
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,333
You know what's good about the musket?

806
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,133
It gives you a lot of time to calm down.

807
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:43,600
Someone calls your wife fat, and
you're like, "Fuck you, buddy!

808
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:03,500
Ah, you're not a bad
guy. You're all right."

809
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,300
Now...

810
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,800
after the show, we're gonna go out,

811
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,967
have a big party around
Boston, see how it goes.

812
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,433
I'm not allowed to go
to strip clubs anymore.

813
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,600
My girlfriend has said that's a no...

814
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,233
'cause I don't behave myself in there,
so I'm not allowed to go to them anymore.

815
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,467
'Cause strip clubs aren't
what women think they are.

816
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:36,300
[Stammers] It used to be like...

817
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,700
Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club,

818
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,633
it's all about girls being as dirty and
as horrible to each other as possible.

819
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,000
That's what men want to see.

820
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,200
Women, when they go to
their Magic Mike clubs

821
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:47,567
or whatever the fuck they are...

822
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:51,567
women wanna see a guy, "Hey,
ladies. He's a fireman."

823
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:54,833
And he comes out with
his hose and like that...

824
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,300
And whenever a stripper
takes their clothes off,

825
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,533
they've still got the fireman's
hat on or a tool belt on

826
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,600
or policeman's gun on a holster, right?

827
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:07,667
Because even when a man's naked, a
woman wants to know that he has a job.

828
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:17,967
When men watch strippers,
we want them to have a job,

829
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,033
and that job's stripping.

830
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,500
We want to just look at that girl
dancing and have a hand full of money,

831
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,367
and just go...

832
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:28,933
"You can't take care of your kids."

833
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,367
It's...

834
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:37,233
And when men get private
dances in these strip clubs,

835
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,900
I don't know...

836
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,600
I don't know if women actually
know what goes on in those rooms,

837
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,400
but basically, it's dry humping.

838
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,033
There's no dancing.

839
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,433
The girl gets in front.
She gets where your cock is,

840
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,167
pushes it to one side
and then she rubs on it...

841
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,633
and then she stands over and
puts her cunt right in your face,

842
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,133
and you go...

843
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,800
That's what a private "dance" is, right?

844
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:02,767
I don't know if there's private
dancing in female strip clubs.

845
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,567
[Stammering] I can't
imagine that there would be.

846
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:09,567
I don't imagine a woman
getting out of a back room

847
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,367
and going up to her friend and going...

848
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:13,400
She goes, "How was it?"
And she goes, "Well...

849
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,700
he just sat me down and then
he grabbed my genitals...

850
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,367
and then he dragged his
scrotum over my forehead.

851
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,267
I got to go to the ATM."

852
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,067
So Legit got canceled.

853
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:41,867
[Audience booing]

854
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:42,933
Yeah.

855
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:46,200
I know. I know it.

856
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,333
Who would've thought it would've struggled

857
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,667
on that great FXX channel
that everyone knew about?

858
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,733
The first season is on Netflix.

859
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,500
This special is being recorded for Netflix.

860
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:01,400
So you can go watch it there
if you're watching the special.

861
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,667
It was...

862
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:06,733
I'm very proud of it.

863
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,500
We had two great seasons
of really good television,

864
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,567
and if people didn't...

865
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,667
Now...

866
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:19,233
The whole TV show is based
around one standup routine

867
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,567
that I used to do about having
a friend with muscular dystrophy

868
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:24,933
that I took to a brothel,
which is a true story.

869
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,100
And so, when we cast a character
with muscular dystrophy who...

870
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:29,300
In the end, we used DJ Qualls,

871
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:34,367
and DJ Qualls is the skinny white
guy out of the movie Road Trip.

872
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:37,100
He's the skinny white guy out
of the movie Hustle & Flow,

873
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,667
and he's the white guy out
of the movie Hustle & Flow.

874
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,533
Now...

875
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,233
the great thing about DJ is...

876
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,167
he already looks disabled.

877
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:55,700
He has that "latter stages
of AIDS" thing going on.

878
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,333
It's great for casting. Anyway, but...

879
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,833
I didn't want DJ to begin with.

880
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,233
I wanted a person with muscular
dystrophy to make it look authentic,

881
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,333
and the Actors' Union of America
said, "You cannot do that."

882
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,667
Because basically the problem is
people with muscular dystrophy, I think,

883
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,733
are only allowed to work for two
hours a day before they get too tired.

884
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,767
And I said, "All right, what
other disabilities and diseases

885
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,967
are allowed to work longer?"

886
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
And they sent me a list.

887
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,167
And on this list, I said, "Can you
get rid of all the contagious ones?

888
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:36,067
And what have we got left?"

889
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:40,967
So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood,

890
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,300
and I'll be honest with you,

891
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,567
not that many of them.

892
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,467
I don't know why.

893
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:50,667
Maybe they're just lazy.
They don't wanna work.

894
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:54,033
Maybe they give up on
their dreams rather quickly.

895
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,333
And none of them were very good, either.

896
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,800
Everyone we saw, none
of them were very good

897
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:00,533
'cause acting is all about
what you do with your hands.

898
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,067
None of them knew what to
do with their hands, and...

899
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,400
they all came in.

900
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:07,967
Until this one guy came in.

901
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,133
I had seen a lot of people that day.

902
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,833
This guy was the most disabled
person I'd ever seen in my life.

903
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,900
He was like...

904
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,867
Think of the most disabled person
you've seen, then double it.

905
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:19,600
...really super disabled.

906
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,967
He was shaped like a pretzel.

907
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:25,200
He was being carried in
by this big Russian nurse,

908
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,400
carried him in.

909
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:29,433
He made that great disabled
sound of... [Groans]

910
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,800
That one.

911
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,600
I just loved him.

912
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,400
Anyway...

913
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:39,567
so he comes in for the audition...

914
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:43,367
and I'm sitting there, and
we're doing the lines together,

915
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:45,567
and at first, I didn't know if
he was mentally all there either,

916
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,133
so I was being a little bit patronizing.

917
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,500
I was going, "Thank you
so much for coming in."

918
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,667
And then we did the dialog together,
and I didn't have to worry about a thing.

919
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:57,767
This kid was funny. He was
smart. His timing was impeccable.

920
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,600
I thought he was just great,
and I helped him out of the room,

921
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:02,833
and I come back to the director and I said,

922
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,333
"That's our guy. That's who we gotta pick."

923
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,433
And he agreed,

924
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,200
but we had to see everyone else
who was still in the waiting room.

925
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:10,367
So the next bloke wheels himself in.

926
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:13,433
Now, obviously, he's just a
paraplegic if he's wheeling himself in,

927
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,867
which means the waist down,

928
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,267
and that didn't really suit me because...

929
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:21,900
paraplegics can get themselves
to a hooker without my assistance.

930
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,933
But I thought...

931
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,233
"If he's a good enough actor,
maybe he can quad-up for the role."

932
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,633
So he comes in...

933
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:35,033
He comes in, I shake his hand,

934
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,333
and his leg slightly
comes out at the same time.

935
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,000
And I went, "Whoa!

936
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,167
What's going on there, kicky?"

937
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:47,633
And he goes...

938
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,433
"Oh, you got me!

939
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,567
I'm not disabled."

940
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:56,167
And I said, "You're fucking what now?"

941
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,667
And he goes, "I'm not disabled.

942
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:00,633
I just really wanted the role,
so I rented a wheelchair."

943
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,733
And I said, "Just shut up.

944
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,233
So let me... This is how your
day has mapped-out thus far.

945
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,800
You woke up this morning. You drove
to the wheelchair rental place.

946
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:15,200
You rented a wheelchair.
You carried it out, I assume.

947
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:18,433
You put it in the trunk of
your car. You drove here.

948
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,700
You got the wheelchair out.

949
00:49:19,767 --> 00:49:24,733
You carried it up three flights of stairs.

950
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:27,067
You went to the waiting room.

951
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:31,467
You put it down next to
the severely disabled man

952
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:33,833
and his nurse.

953
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,200
Then you sat in it and
practiced your lines."

954
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:38,567
And he went...

955
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:39,833
"Yeah."

956
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,500
And I said, "You're a
fucking asshole, mate.

957
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,467
Get the fuck out of here."

958
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,933
And I kicked him out.

959
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,133
And later on that day, I'm sitting
there with all the headshots

960
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,733
of all the different actors I'm gonna
call to tell them they've got parts,

961
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,100
and I'm holding this
disabled guy's headshot,

962
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,867
and I just think, "I'm
gonna call this guy up.

963
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:01,800
I'm gonna change his life. This
is an awesome moment, right?"

964
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:05,267
And I'm looking at it, and he looks
super handsome in his headshot.

965
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,667
He looked really like...

966
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,233
And I thought, "This has gotta
be the greatest photographer

967
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,200
with the fastest shutter
in camera history."

968
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:17,867
The shutter on his camera
has gotta be like...

969
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:18,967
[Mimicking camera shutter]

970
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Like...

971
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,767
[Audience applauding]

972
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:34,667
And then I read the guy's biography...

973
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,500
and then it dawned on me.

974
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,467
"This guy's not disabled either!

975
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:44,367
I hated the other fucker
for renting a wheelchair!

976
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:47,067
This cunt rented a nurse!"

977
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,867
Do you wanna know the
level of fucking psychosis

978
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:55,200
you have to go through
to rent a fucking nurse?

979
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,567
I'm all for a method actor.

980
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:04,000
Get into character three hours before,
but once you finish the audition,

981
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:07,233
stand up and go, "Ta-da!"

982
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,100
And we would have gone,
"That was very good."

983
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:15,033
But I'll tell you what you don't do.

984
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,433
Don't make me carry you to your car!

985
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,800
I carried him down three
flights of stairs going,

986
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:26,433
"You did very good."

987
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,433
He's like, "Thank you, Jim." [Laughing]

988
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,733
[Chuckles]

989
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:42,933
I was, uh...

990
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,267
I go to a therapist...

991
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,767
'cause I get depressed.

992
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,200
So I got a therapist every now and again.

993
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:51,033
I literally had one of those
moments with my therapist

994
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,933
where she was saying words like,

995
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,700
"I'm gonna say a word and you say the
first thing that comes in your mind."

996
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,367
Like just out of the movies, right?

997
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:00,533
And she went, "Red," and I went, "Blue."

998
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,233
And then she went,
"Cooking," and I went, "Food,"

999
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,133
and all that type of stuff.
We went like this forever.

1000
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,500
And then she went...

1001
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:08,200
For the last question, she went,

1002
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:10,233
"And what's your favorite
thing in the world?"

1003
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,033
And I went...

1004
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,267
"Coming on a girl's face."

1005
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,000
Now...

1006
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,900
Now, I could've said things like...

1007
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,400
"Ice cream" is a good answer.

1008
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:29,000
"Hank" would've been an excellent answer.

1009
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,033
But I said, "Coming on a girl's face."

1010
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,133
And I've had six months
to think about my answer,

1011
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,867
and I stand by it.

1012
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:48,767
- I...
- [Cheering]

1013
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,700
I'm not proud of it.

1014
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,067
I hate myself for thinking it.

1015
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:56,233
It's such a horrible thing
to do to another human.

1016
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,767
When a girl's on her
knees and you... It's so...

1017
00:52:58,833 --> 00:52:59,933
And as an atheist,

1018
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,567
I believe in Darwin and all
the things that he wrote,

1019
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:05,133
but he never had a bit
where he explained that.

1020
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,867
There was never a bit in
his book where he went,

1021
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:10,433
"When a caveman loves a cavewoman,

1022
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,233
he'll ejaculate on her face
so that flies won't come near."

1023
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,067
There was never that...

1024
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,200
never that moment.

1025
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,567
But, by golly, if it's not fun.

1026
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,200
I find it... To...

1027
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:29,600
Look, to all the girls who take a
load on their face from time to time,

1028
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,267
may I say, "Bravo!"

1029
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,567
Don't...

1030
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:36,867
don't think what you do...

1031
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,133
has gone unnoticed.

1032
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,400
We notice. We appreciate your work.

1033
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,733
I think you deserve a parade of some kind.

1034
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,367
During Memorial Day,
after the Vietnam vets,

1035
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,200
before the First Gulf War guys,

1036
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,267
we could bring in,

1037
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,500
"And here's the women who
take a load on their face."

1038
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:54,900
And you could march out,

1039
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:59,333
and married men would stand there
going, "God bless you, ladies."

1040
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
[Audience cheering]

1041
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,333
I enjoy your acting that you do.

1042
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,067
The standard tongue out
and the... Like that...

1043
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:13,333
I don't know why, but I enjoy...

1044
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,367
I know it's a lie. I
know you're not excited,

1045
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:20,433
but I still appreciate
the effort is what I enjoy.

1046
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,333
I love the look because it's such
a, "Oh, jeez, I'm excited, too.

1047
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:28,767
When this come hits my face, there's
a good chance I'll also orgasm.

1048
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,533
Anything could happen in this crazy world."

1049
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,533
But this is what redeems us as
men. This is what redeems us.

1050
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,233
Just know that the second the
come shoots out of our cock

1051
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,400
and hits your face,

1052
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:45,967
our bodies flood with remorse.

1053
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,933
The next 20 seconds is the
nicest we will ever be to you.

1054
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,567
[Men whooping]

1055
00:54:57,633 --> 00:55:01,400
I go from being an animal
to the sweetest guy on Earth.

1056
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:04,433
I'm like, "You fucking slut...

1057
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,600
Oh, I love you. Ah...

1058
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,467
Uh, all right. No, no, no.
Put your tongue back in. Um...

1059
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,767
Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut.

1060
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,100
Uh...

1061
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,000
All right, I'm going to get
a towel. I'll get a towel.

1062
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,067
I'll get you a towel.

1063
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:22,100
All right.

1064
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:24,100
You're a wonderful mother to our child."

1065
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,300
[Laughs]

1066
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:30,767
[Audience cheering]

1067
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:37,200
See... this is what kills me.

1068
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,100
My son will one day watch this DVD.

1069
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:45,067
And I'm the guy who's meant
to teach him right from wrong,

1070
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,467
and I'm there wiping come
off his mother's face.

1071
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:53,700
I think I did something illegal
with my son the other day.

1072
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,067
I think it might be illegal.
Tell me if this is illegal.

1073
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,567
All right?

1074
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,767
I'm in the shower.

1075
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,367
My girlfriend goes off
to the gym in the morning,

1076
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:02,833
and when she came back,
I was in the shower,

1077
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,033
and Hank ran up,

1078
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,533
and he started banging on the glass door
of the shower like, "Argh!" Like that.

1079
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,133
And I went... [Vocalizing]

1080
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,467
And I saw his little face
and I went, "Hello, Hankie."

1081
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:15,033
And then in the condensation,
I drew a little bowtie on him...

1082
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,867
and a little suit...

1083
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,800
and then I gave him a
voice bubble that said,

1084
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:25,067
"I love my daddy. Love, Hank."

1085
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,967
But I did it so I could read it.

1086
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:31,233
Well, of course he could
read the "K," and...

1087
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
then I stepped out.

1088
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:37,167
I stepped out of the bathroom and I went,

1089
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:38,567
"G'day, Hankie!"

1090
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,067
And he slapped my cock and he ran off.

1091
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,433
Now, is that illegal?

1092
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,533
I don't know.

1093
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,267
Is it illegal because, A,
a child touched my cock,

1094
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:57,700
or because, B, I found it really
funny and I've been telling everyone.

1095
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:02,767
And I can't get angry at him

1096
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,600
because his whole life,

1097
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:07,433
he's been lying on mats
with things dangling over.

1098
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,100
He's been training for
this his entire life.

1099
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,000
I think I've, uh...

1100
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:22,533
I think I've become American,

1101
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,433
more American than I am Australian lately,

1102
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,833
and there was a moment where I tipped over

1103
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,600
where I went, "Oh, I think
like an American person now."

1104
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,633
And I'm happy to do it. I just...
I'll tell you what happened.

1105
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,633
I was flying around... I was
doing a tour of Australia,

1106
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,567
and I was flying
domestically around Australia,

1107
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:41,300
and I'm so used to airports and
stuff here in America that...

1108
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,467
Okay, what happens is, when you go...
I was flying Sydney to Melbourne.

1109
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,000
When you fly domestically in Australia,

1110
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,400
you go up to the machine, put your name in,

1111
00:57:48,467 --> 00:57:51,033
prints your ticket out,
it prints your bag thing,

1112
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,000
you put the bag thing on your bag yourself,

1113
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:54,300
and then there's a
conveyor belt underneath.

1114
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,967
You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off.

1115
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:00,833
You don't speak to anyone.

1116
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,633
Then I go up to the gate bit, and
the lady's going, "Tickets, please."

1117
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,833
And I'm holding my ID out
like a fucking simpleton.

1118
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:16,467
'Cause I get through airports quick,
man. I'm like, "Fucking there you go."

1119
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:18,633
And she went, "Put your ID
away. I don't need to see that."

1120
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,667
And I went...

1121
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:22,967
"I think you do."

1122
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,267
And she went, "I don't... Why
would I need to see your ID?"

1123
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,133
And I said, "I might be a terrorist."

1124
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,733
And she went, "Would showing me your
ID stop you from blowing the plane up?"

1125
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,700
"No, I'd probably still blow the plane up."

1126
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:48,167
So then I get up to the
TSA conveyor belt thing,

1127
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,300
and I'm so good at the airports.

1128
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:52,367
I'm already taking my shoes
off as I'm walking, right?

1129
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,067
And all the Australians behind
me assume that I'm American,

1130
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:56,800
and they're losing their fucking shit.

1131
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:01,200
They're like, "Oh, for fuck's
sake! One of these cunts, eh?"

1132
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:04,700
And the TSA guy goes,

1133
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:08,800
"Hey, mate, what are you
taking your shoes off for?"

1134
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:09,867
And I went...

1135
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:12,733
[Shouting] "I don't know!

1136
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,567
Maybe they're bombs?"

1137
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:26,800
And he went...

1138
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,000
"But they're not, are they?"

1139
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,333
I put me shoes back on.

1140
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,300
I get my laptop out.
Everyone's going mental.

1141
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,833
And the TSA guy says,

1142
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,500
very politely, but
extraordinarily sarcastically,

1143
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:44,533
he goes, "Jeez, mate.
That's a nice computer.

1144
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,267
Why are you showing it to everyone?"

1145
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,400
"It might also be a bomb."

1146
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,367
And then the guy said

1147
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,433
the most Australian thing I've ever
heard come out of anyone's mouth ever.

1148
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
He went...

1149
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:13,300
"Oh, come on, mate. You
wouldn't have two bombs."

1150
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:14,833
[Audience laughing]

1151
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,767
[Chuckles]

1152
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,067
I'm not even quite sure what that means,
but it does make some type of sense.

1153
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,433
All right.

1154
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,800
Oscar Pistorius.

1155
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,567
If you haven't been following
the case, you're missing out.

1156
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:41,000
This is the greatest
thing since OJ Simpson.

1157
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:43,667
You're fucking missing out, mate.

1158
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:45,667
If you don't know who Oscar
Pistorius is, let me fill you in.

1159
01:00:45,733 --> 01:00:48,500
Oscar Pistorius is a legless
man from South Africa,

1160
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:49,800
known as the Blade Runner.

1161
01:00:49,867 --> 01:00:51,367
He ran in two Olympics,

1162
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:53,800
the disabled and the
able-bodied Olympics in one year.

1163
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,733
No one has ever done that.

1164
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,033
He's an inspiration to
hundreds and millions

1165
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,767
of disabled and able-bodied people alike,

1166
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:03,433
and on Valentine's Day last year,

1167
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,567
he shot and killed the
hottest girl on Earth...

1168
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,700
and that's when he became
an inspiration to me...

1169
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:17,200
'cause hot girls have been getting away
with too much shit for too fucking long.

1170
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:20,800
Let that be a lesson to
all you hot girls out there.

1171
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:23,300
You can't just say
whatever the fuck you want

1172
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:25,433
whenever you fucking want.

1173
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,833
[Mock tearfully] People
have feelings, you cunts.

1174
01:01:29,767 --> 01:01:34,467
Now, there's a lot of rumors going
around on what happened on that day.

1175
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:37,600
One of the theories is that
they found in her phone...

1176
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:38,933
He went through her phone,

1177
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,700
and on her phone, he
found some text messages

1178
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,433
from a South African rugby
player on Valentine's Day, right?

1179
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,333
Now, I don't know if you've
ever been to South Africa,

1180
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,433
but in South Africa, rugby is
more popular than legless running.

1181
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:56,200
It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket.

1182
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:59,133
Legless running's their second
sport. You wouldn't have thought that.

1183
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:03,200
Anyway...

1184
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:08,200
I'm going to reenact what
I believe happened that day.

1185
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:11,567
To do that, I will now be
doing a South African accent.

1186
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:14,500
Now I know, many of you can't
tell the difference between

1187
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:17,500
my accent and a South African accent.

1188
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,867
Here's the difference.

1189
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:22,867
Picture my accent, but I'm
punching a black person.

1190
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:29,433
What I'm trying to say is South
Africans are horrible people.

1191
01:02:32,067 --> 01:02:33,067
So...

1192
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,833
she's coming out of the shower.

1193
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,767
She's been drying her hair. She's
listening to Rodriguez or something.

1194
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,167
She comes out.

1195
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,467
He's laying on the bed.

1196
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:45,900
He looks up at her, he's
holding the phone, and he goes,

1197
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:48,200
[In South African accent]
"What the fuck is this?

1198
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:50,467
I've been through your phone.

1199
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,533
You have been texting a rugby player."

1200
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,133
And she's like, "Oh!

1201
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,633
Fuck you!

1202
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,233
Who the fuck do you think you are?"

1203
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,267
"Who am I?

1204
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:12,533
I'm Oscar Pistorius, the greatest
legless runner that has ever been.

1205
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,300
That's who the fuck I am."

1206
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:19,167
"Well, I would rather
be with a rugby player.

1207
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:22,500
At least he is a whole man, not
a three-quarter man like you."

1208
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:24,767
- [Audience exclaiming]
- I know.

1209
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,033
[Audience laughing]

1210
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,167
"Oh! Fuck you!"

1211
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,533
"No! Fuck you! I'm leaving you!"

1212
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,200
And then she storms out of the room,

1213
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:41,167
and then he was like...

1214
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,700
"You fucking bitch! [Grunts]

1215
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,900
I hate you!

1216
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,300
[Grunting]

1217
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:59,500
You will rue the day...

1218
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:03,600
that you left Oscar
Pistorius, the Blade Runner!

1219
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,833
Don't go anywhere!

1220
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:07,633
[Grunting]

1221
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,467
I hate you!"

1222
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:31,967
That's where he keeps his legs.

1223
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:33,733
All right.

1224
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:36,800
Then he put the blades on.

1225
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:40,633
"Oh, you're in trouble, missy. I tell you.

1226
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,533
I go to my gun safe."

1227
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:49,233
She locked herself in the bathroom.

1228
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,633
He shot her through the bathroom door.

1229
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,200
Seems like overkill, doesn't it?

1230
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:56,500
Bathrooms only have
little tiny locks on them,

1231
01:04:56,567 --> 01:05:00,500
but Oscar's one of the few men on Earth
that couldn't kick the door in, right?

1232
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,833
He was wearing the blades, so...

1233
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,400
Boing! Ah!

1234
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,600
So...

1235
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:20,567
I think Oscar will probably go to prison.

1236
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:25,033
Now...

1237
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,533
in South Africa, one in
four people have AIDS.

1238
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:32,233
I assume it may even be worse
in the prison population.

1239
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,033
Now, can I say this? Look...

1240
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,667
I've never raped a man.

1241
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:42,900
I hate that I have to put "a man"
in that sentence, but whatever.

1242
01:05:48,533 --> 01:05:51,933
I've never raped a man, but...

1243
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,633
if I was going to rape a man,
it would be a legless Olympian...

1244
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:01,567
'cause in prison, it's all about
getting one up on other people,

1245
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:03,300
and making people think
you're tough and all that.

1246
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:04,833
Like, "You want to fucking rape me?

1247
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,200
I just raped an Olympian, bitch.
Is that what you fucking want?"

1248
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:11,000
There'd be a wonderful moment...

1249
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,267
when you're in the showers

1250
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:15,233
and he was crawling away like
the end of a Terminator movie.

1251
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,800
[Chuckling]

1252
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,967
You know what I like about that joke?

1253
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,433
So often when you tell a joke,

1254
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,400
the rapist is the villain in the story,

1255
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,733
but not in that one.

1256
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,567
Not in that one.

1257
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:36,400
He's the hero.

1258
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,467
All right, we have to get going soon.

1259
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:44,200
Before I leave,

1260
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:47,467
- I thank you very much for coming.
- [Audience groaning]

1261
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:50,833
No, I said, "soon," not "over."

1262
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,633
It's just soon, you cunts, so calm down.

1263
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,700
[Chuckles]

1264
01:06:58,433 --> 01:06:59,700
[Man whistles]

1265
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:00,933
I always...

1266
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,933
I always find that weird when
someone, like, whistles like that.

1267
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,667
What do they think is going to happen?

1268
01:07:05,733 --> 01:07:08,933
Like, I'm going to go,
"Fucking you know me, mate.

1269
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,967
I was enjoying claps and cheers,

1270
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:16,233
but what I needed was a
high-pitched squeal noise.

1271
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:22,433
Thank God you came along
to pick up my spirits."

1272
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,567
[Man] Love you!

1273
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:25,333
All right, final story.

1274
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,400
Now, I was in South Africa again.

1275
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:30,467
Jeez, I don't think I'll
be working in South Africa

1276
01:07:30,533 --> 01:07:32,167
after this special comes out.

1277
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:36,700
I used to do, like, one tour
in South Africa every year,

1278
01:07:36,767 --> 01:07:40,067
and I just don't know if
I'll be invited this time.

1279
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,667
They'll be like, [In South African
accent] "We don't like him. He's no good."

1280
01:07:44,733 --> 01:07:46,367
Anyway, so, I'm in South Africa,

1281
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:48,400
and I had to fly back from
Cape Town to Los Angeles,

1282
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:51,367
which is, like, a 26-hour flight.
You've to go up to London and go across.

1283
01:07:51,433 --> 01:07:52,667
Cunt of a trip.

1284
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:53,800
Um...

1285
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:55,600
But it was all right 'cause
I had a business class ticket,

1286
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,667
so I didn't give a fuck.

1287
01:07:57,733 --> 01:08:01,533
And when I travel economy,
I try to dress up nice

1288
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
'cause I like to look good

1289
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:05,167
in case someone recognizes
me and I might get an upgrade.

1290
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:07,533
But when I've already got
a business class ticket,

1291
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,233
I try to look like a bag of shit...

1292
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,833
'cause it's important to me that

1293
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,433
everyone else in business
class doesn't want me there

1294
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,600
and they're annoyed by my presence.

1295
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,667
So...

1296
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,233
I'm wearing a white T-shirt

1297
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,767
that's got brown stains on
it with a hole in the side.

1298
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:29,933
I'm wearing these small shorts
with just one testicle hanging out.

1299
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:37,367
So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up
to the business thing with the thing,

1300
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:38,733
and I go, "Hello," and the lady goes,

1301
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,500
[In South African accent] "Oh,
Mr. Jefferies, I'm so sorry,

1302
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,100
but you have been downgraded."

1303
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,967
I said, "You what now?"

1304
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:51,100
She goes, "Business class is
full. You have been downgraded."

1305
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,833
And I said, "I understand
that business class is full.

1306
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,733
I bought one of the
tickets that made it full."

1307
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:02,067
And she went, "I'm sorry,
sir. There's nothing I can do."

1308
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:04,533
And then I just went, "Are
you fucking kidding me?"

1309
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,533
Now, you know when you're dealing
with customer service people,

1310
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,800
and they want you to swear,
'cause as soon as you swear,

1311
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:10,567
they don't have to engage with you anymore.

1312
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:14,133
They can act like they're the first
adult never to hear a swear word,

1313
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,667
and they can get really offended, right?

1314
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:19,000
So I went, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

1315
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:22,967
And she went, "Please do
not speak to me that way!

1316
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,500
I have done nothing wrong!"

1317
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:27,133
And I said, "Are you,
a white South African,

1318
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,833
telling me you've done nothing wrong?"

1319
01:09:34,733 --> 01:09:36,467
Anyway...

1320
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,467
tensions rose.

1321
01:09:41,533 --> 01:09:45,733
The manager comes over. Big fat
cunt called Simon Fulcher, right?

1322
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,833
He walks over and goes,

1323
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,633
[In South African accent] "What
is wrong here? What is wrong?"

1324
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,500
And I said, "I bought
a business class ticket

1325
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,567
and I want a business class ticket."

1326
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:57,767
And he goes, "What do you want me
to do? Make a new chair for you?

1327
01:09:57,833 --> 01:10:00,767
There are no more seats.
I can't do anything."

1328
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,467
He goes, "I'll tell you what I can do.

1329
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:05,533
Go up to the executive
lounge. Have some peanuts.

1330
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,667
Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez,

1331
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:12,833
and if something opens up, we will
move you back up to business class.

1332
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,900
So I thought, "There's nothing I can do."

1333
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,133
So I walk off with my ticket. I'm
walking through the airport like,

1334
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,867
"Fucking British Airways,
bunch of fucking cunts." Right?

1335
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:21,833
I get up to the counter.

1336
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,733
And the woman behind the
counter said, "Tickets, please."

1337
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,367
And I hand over my ticket and she goes,

1338
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,567
[In South African accent] "I'm sorry, sir,

1339
01:10:26,633 --> 01:10:29,167
but this is for business
class passengers only.

1340
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:32,367
Your ticket says 'economy'
on it." And I said...

1341
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,733
[Inhales sharply]

1342
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,467
"I bought a business class ticket,
but you people have downgraded..."

1343
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:42,967
And as I was doing my little speech,
she looked past me and went, "Next."

1344
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,800
[Audience exclaiming]

1345
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:51,200
"Listen here, you fucking cunt."

1346
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:52,433
[Audience laughing]

1347
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,167
All right?

1348
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:57,900
Now, you say "cunt" in any foreign country,

1349
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:00,667
people lose their fucking shit.

1350
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,400
Security came from everywhere.

1351
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,567
I was going, "Don't you
fucking come near me, cunt!"

1352
01:11:06,633 --> 01:11:08,800
And I said, "I want to speak
to Simon Fulcher," like I'm...

1353
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:09,867
And they go, "All right."

1354
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,300
They ring the manager
up, and then they go...

1355
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,733
He goes, "Is it the pale Australian
man?" And the guy went, "Yes."

1356
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,933
He goes, "We've had problems
with him. Let him through." Right?

1357
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:22,500
So I go through. I'm sitting
there, I'm eating my peanuts.

1358
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,100
And I'm just angry now, going,

1359
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:27,233
"Fucking British Airways.
Fucking cunts, fucking..."

1360
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,467
Like that.

1361
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:31,233
And in walks in a group of
Americans, about 30 of them.

1362
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,667
You know the type, right? They all...

1363
01:11:34,867 --> 01:11:36,667
And whenever I see Americans abroad...

1364
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:38,767
I'll do my impersonation
of any American abroad.

1365
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:42,000
When Americans are abroad, you're
just pointing out shit you see.

1366
01:11:42,067 --> 01:11:43,067
You're just walking around going,

1367
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:44,133
[In American accent] "Oh, this is great!

1368
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,500
Look at that. That's a
chair right there. Okay.

1369
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:50,600
Oh, what's that over there?
Okay. Wonderful. Great."

1370
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:51,833
Right?

1371
01:11:53,733 --> 01:11:55,233
And this group walked in,

1372
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,700
and one of the women in the
group went like this, she went,

1373
01:11:57,767 --> 01:11:59,333
[In American accent] "Did anyone else see

1374
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,300
that Australian guy speaking
to that lady out there?

1375
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,267
Some people have no class."

1376
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,200
And I put my head around
the pylon, and I went,

1377
01:12:10,267 --> 01:12:12,533
"You can fuck off and all!

1378
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,967
You don't know what I've been
through! I've been downgraded!"

1379
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:23,167
And as I said that,

1380
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:26,100
18 other people who were given
the same lie that I was given,

1381
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,667
that they were going to be the next
people promoted up to business class,

1382
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:29,733
the penny dropped.

1383
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,000
None of us are getting promoted.

1384
01:12:31,067 --> 01:12:34,533
They all lied to us, and we
formed an angry militia in seconds.

1385
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,433
It was like a scene out of Braveheart,

1386
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,833
and they all stood up and
went, "Fucking downgraded!"

1387
01:12:42,033 --> 01:12:44,100
And the woman in the group was doing this,

1388
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:47,367
"Don't speak to me that way. Who
the hell do you think you are?"

1389
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:51,567
And all the men in the group were like,
"Hey, why don't you shut the fuck up?

1390
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:53,933
Just shut the fuck up."

1391
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,167
♪ It doesn't matter These
people seem very angry, so ♪

1392
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:03,833
And a guy breaks from the group
and he tries to calm everyone down.

1393
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,467
And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes,
you can seem a little insincere.

1394
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:08,900
And he came up and he went,

1395
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,167
[In American accent] "Hey. Hey.

1396
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,233
Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply]

1397
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:19,133
Downgraded, yeah.

1398
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,133
That really grinds my
gears, I tell you that.

1399
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,933
Yeah, I would write a
strongly-worded letter.

1400
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,100
I really would."

1401
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:30,800
And then I thought, at
least this guy's being nice,

1402
01:13:30,867 --> 01:13:32,300
and I said, "Look, mate,
don't worry about it.

1403
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,200
It's not like it's your fault."

1404
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:36,433
And I said, "Why are you
in such a big group anyway?"

1405
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,733
And he goes, "Oh, we're
in Neil Diamond's band.

1406
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,433
That's Neil Diamond's backup singer
you just called a cunt there."

1407
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:45,567
And as he said that,

1408
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:50,567
Neil Diamond walked around the
corner like a fucking superhero...

1409
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:56,967
and I reacted like he was
one. I went, "Neil Diamond!"

1410
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:00,900
And Neil Diamond went,

1411
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:03,800
[In husky voice] "Hey, what's going on?"

1412
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:05,267
And then, for a second there,

1413
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:09,300
there was a bit of my brain that thought
maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems.

1414
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:12,800
And I went, "Neil!

1415
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:17,433
Me and all these people,
we've been downgraded!"

1416
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,700
And Neil went, "Oh! Oh, right.
Uh, well, maybe that's our fault.

1417
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:26,333
We decided to come back a day early."

1418
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,733
"You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!"

1419
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:42,200
And then a fight breaks out amongst the
Neil Diamond band and the downgraded.

1420
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:46,767
Punches are thrown. Not by me.

1421
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:51,133
I don't know if you have the Internet,
but I'm not much of a fighter.

1422
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,433
I'm an excellent scurrier-awayer.

1423
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,533
I get down.

1424
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,700
"Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!"

1425
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:04,667
Anyway, the airport police came.

1426
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:10,567
Three people were arrested
from the downgraded...

1427
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,400
but three people were arrested
from the Neil Diamond band,

1428
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:20,733
and that meant that three seats
opened up in business class.

1429
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,233
[Audience cheering]

1430
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,400
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much. Good night. Appreciate it.

1431
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:29,167
[Audience cheering]

1432
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,133
[Upbeat music playing]

1433
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,433
Thank you.

1434
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,167
Go home. Let's have a drink. Bye.
