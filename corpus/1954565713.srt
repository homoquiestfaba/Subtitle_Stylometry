1
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,003
<i>In truth,
they're bastard stepchildren...</i>

2
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,106
<i>wisdom and hindsight.</i>

3
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:45,377
<i>There's a problem with wisdom:
You only get it after you need it.</i>

4
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,106
<i>It doesn't help you right now.
It only teaches you enough</i>

5
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,306
<i>to help you the next time.</i>

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,556
<i>I'm talking about the kind of
wisdom that comes from experience.</i>

7
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,360
<i>The kind that tells you if your wife
pushes you to take the night shift,</i>

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,693
<i>there's probably a reason.</i>

9
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,304
<i>And then there's hindsight.
It's like looking in the rearview mirror.</i>

10
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,808
<i>You can't see what you're going
through until you've driven past it.</i>

11
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,478
<i>Hindsight, like, "Ah, what do you
mean I've had too much to drink?</i>

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,044
<i>I'll be fine."</i>

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,485
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.
They don't help you with today,</i>

14
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,454
<i>only with tomorrow.</i>

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,392
<i>But tomorrow is a day away.</i>
<i>And today, well...</i>

16
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,926
<i>Today's a shitstorm I
might not live through.</i>

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,465
<i>So let me take you
back to the beginning.</i>

18
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,967
<i>'Cause the only way to get
any wisdom out of my story</i>

19
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,401
<i>is to look at it in hindsight.</i>

20
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,273
Well, you're legit now, hero.

21
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,744
If you make it through poker night,
it's all downhill from there.

22
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,413
And, considering you're a...

23
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,249
wet-nose, son of a bitch
political appointee...

24
00:01:56,495 --> 00:02:00,254
you did okay. The boys seem
to think you got potential.

25
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,990
Glad to hear you approve, Lieutenant.

26
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,361
I never said I approve, shithead.

27
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,962
And don't fuck up, all right?
And don't ever make us look bad.

28
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,133
And get rid of that piece of shit eyesore.
You're gonna be a detective,

29
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,738
- you gotta start driving like one.
- First thing tomorrow.

30
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,644
- Hey, thanks, Lieutenant.
- Fuck you.

31
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:38,592
<i>10-16. 10-16. Domestic disturbance.</i>

32
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,628
<i>413 East Morris.
Any units in area respond.</i>

33
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,635
Dispatch, Unit 4334 is 10-76.

34
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,843
<i>There's nothing out
this time of night...</i>

35
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,845
<i>except for trouble,</i>

36
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:01,015
<i>and there's no reason
to go looking for it.</i>

37
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,816
<i>But it wasn't as if there was anything
waiting for me at home anymore.</i>

38
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,561
Hey!

39
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,598
<i>That was it. The first sign.</i>

40
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,368
<i>I could've seen it coming if my
brain was working, but it wasn't.</i>

41
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,270
<i>Doesn't matter how often I replay it.</i>

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,371
- Hello?
- <i>I never get it right.</i>

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,007
Fucker.

44
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,876
Go! Run!

45
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,338
No.

46
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,540
Not again. Please.

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,340
You said...

48
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,821
<i>Mistake one: Taking the call.</i>

49
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>I wasn't doing anyone any favors.</i>

50
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,194
<i>Mistake two:
Had a few two many at the game.</i>

51
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:24,867
<i>Wasn't really in any shape to go out,
and response is slow, not thinking clearly.</i>

52
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,288
<i>Mistake number three:</i>

53
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,903
<i>It's an empty street somewhere
between service towers,</i>

54
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,538
<i>but I had a radio in the car.</i>

55
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,875
<i>Just decided to go forward
without calling for backup.</i>

56
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,644
<i>And number four...</i>

57
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,845
Go! Run!

58
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,146
<i>Amy.</i>

59
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,548
Shit!

60
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,144
<i>- She was a mistake in more ways than one.</i>
- Amy?

61
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,949
Where am I? Who are you?

62
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,026
<i>It is now day three, and still no word</i>

63
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:32,900
<i>on the whereabouts of Detective
Stan Jeter, missing since Sunday.</i>

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,204
<i>His car was found here by the lake,</i>
<i>but there are no signs of any struggle.</i>

65
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,240
<i>For the past two days,
search crews have dredged the waterway.</i>

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,577
<i>Lieutenant Calabrese, tell us what
you've heard about Detective Jeter.</i>

67
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,847
<i>We're not gonna give
up till we find him.</i>

68
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,440
<i>Anybody seen or heard anything,
please contact the station.</i>

69
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,187
<i>Channel 9 viewers might
remember Stan Jeter...</i>

70
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:57,358
<i>as the heroic officer who single-handedly
brought down Terence Alby.</i>

71
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,561
Let me out of here, you son of a bitch.

72
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:05,244
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.
You know I'm a cop, right? You...

73
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:08,770
You hurt a cop and they're coming
after you, man. And no mercy.

74
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,806
Well, you let me out right now,
we can sort this out and...

75
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,107
Everything happens for
a reason, Detective.

76
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,211
Remember that.

77
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,683
Also remember...

78
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,116
people see what they want you to see.

79
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,154
They're looking for you at the river.

80
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,326
Not here.

81
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,695
In a week,

82
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,865
no one will be looking for you at all.

83
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,862
No one will remember you at all.

84
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:43,034
In fact,

85
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,607
you're already being forgotten.

86
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,260
What the fuck is that?

87
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,085
<i>Three days.</i>

88
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,154
<i>God, help me.</i>

89
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,258
<i>Three days in this room.
Three days lost.</i>

90
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,694
<i>- Three days since poker night.</i>
- Come on.

91
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,031
Look who's here. Guest of honor.

92
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,435
How often do we get a fuckin'
genuine hero in our midst, boys?

93
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,671
- Yeah. All right.
- What'd you bring?

94
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,007
Come on. Come on. Listen.
Just get your stuff and listen.

95
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,376
- I'm telling... I'm in the middle of a story.
- Sorry.

96
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,845
All right, so... Where was I?

97
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,282
- You lost me at "Once upon a time."
- I got it. I got it. Okay.

98
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,218
Okay. So I spend, like, the next two years...
I'm following this guy, right.

99
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:35,055
Wherever he goes, I go.
Goes to a family reunion, "Hello."

100
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,624
I mean, he's in a hotel
room banging some whore,

101
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,928
I'm in the room next door, you know, with a
glass against the wall, you know, listening.

102
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,663
- That's a little creepy.
- So...

103
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,934
I mean, this guy takes a piss, I'm so close,
I get tinkled on my shoes, you know.

104
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,103
And still nothing. We get <i>nothing.</i>

105
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,673
And I can tell that the guys upstairs
are getting sick and tired of this shit.

106
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,276
'Cause every time I go in they
give me the "fuck you" eyes...

107
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,148
when I'm handing my card for overtime.
But I don't care 'cause I know.

108
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,419
I know in my gut that this is the
motherfucker that capped Franklin and Meyers.

109
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,691
And I know I'll never sleep another night
in my life as long as he's still out there.

110
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,424
And then the day comes.

111
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,497
<i>Then they tell me, we're done.</i>

112
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>Case is retired. No more overtime.</i>

113
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,503
<i>We've had two years. Finito.</i>

114
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,837
- Really?
- Thank you.

115
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,339
- That was our best?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,840
- That's the best?
- <i>Fuck them.</i>

117
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,710
<i>I go apeshit. I'm-I'm destroying shit.</i>

118
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,776
<i>I'm throwing shit.</i>

119
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>So there I am. I'm driving home.</i>

120
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,951
<i>I'm furious.</i>

121
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,455
<i>I'm driving by Spike's, and that
bastard's truck is sitting there.</i>

122
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,758
<i>He's, you know,
inside having a beer or whatever,</i>

123
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,060
<i>and my two friends are
dead in a ditch somewhere,</i>

124
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,163
<i>and only that asshole
knows where they're at.</i>

125
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,133
<i>And I sit there... staring.</i>

126
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,602
<i>And I'm trying to come up with a plan.</i>

127
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,736
So, it comes to me.

128
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,628
Did you go in there and
beat the shit out of him?

129
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,783
You take him outside,
then you beat the shit out of him.

130
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,464
Nah, you idiots. You take him outside.
You have him beat the shit out of himself.

131
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,746
Don't they teach you kids
nothing in the academy anymore?

132
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,549
All right, no. You see this?

133
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,687
I'm trying to tell a story, and all
these guys care about is a cheap laugh.

134
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,888
Hey, let's just remember there are
two dead cops in here. All right?

135
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,292
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

136
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,662
- Hi, I'd like... whiskey double.
- All right.

137
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,864
And... You know what?

138
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,270
Double for my friend here.

139
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,703
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

140
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,738
What are you so happy about?

141
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,006
I am celebrating the
greatest day of my life.

142
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,042
Tell me about it.

143
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,047
All right.

144
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,451
I'm a cop, right?

145
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,792
I've been spending the last couple years,
every day of my life,

146
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,128
searching for the bodies of
these two buddies of mine...

147
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,866
that got killed by some
heartless bastard, right?

148
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,401
Nothing.

149
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,400
Then this morning I found the bodies.

150
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,507
They were out in the woods,
not even that far from here.

151
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,544
I can finally take a vacation.

152
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,782
Hey, give him one more.

153
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,920
And keep the change.

154
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,098
Take care, my friend.

155
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,332
<i>I couldn't have waited more than
10 minutes, and here he comes,</i>

156
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,601
<i>he's looking around, he's all nervous.</i>

157
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,104
<i>He gets into his truck,
and he creeps off.</i>

158
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,272
<i>And I creep off right behind him.</i>

159
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,805
<i>And then this idiot goes right
into the middle of the woods.</i>

160
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,673
<i>He walks right to a clearing.</i>

161
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,541
<i>Starts stomping around like
he's been missing something.</i>

162
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,558
<i>And after a while, he finally decides that
we must have made a mistake,</i>

163
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,234
<i>and he leaves.</i>

164
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,619
<i>I get on the horn to the chief.</i>

165
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,527
Hey, Captain. This is Cunningham.
I found them.

166
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:11,898
The next day we dug those two up.
That prick's serving double life now.

167
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,670
See, that's what it's all about.

168
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,806
That comes from years of being
on the job. You can't teach that.

169
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,909
Whole point of poker night, young buck.

170
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:28,682
You listen, you learn,
you go and you do likewise.

171
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,251
And you always use your best weapon,

172
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,488
and that's your brain.
You always trust your heart.

173
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,892
Yeah, thanks for that, Confucius.
Getting all teary over here.

174
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,494
Are we gonna play cards or are
we just gonna shoot the shit?

175
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,396
That's what we're here for.

176
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,232
All right. Time for you to lose money.

177
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,244
- Hey.
- Hey?

178
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,213
I'm not happy about you being here.

179
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,615
If I had a say, you wouldn't
be getting this promotion.

180
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,918
- Listen, Maxwell...
- Am I wearing a fucking dress?

181
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,364
Don't interrupt me.

182
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,923
You knew my rules. You broke my rules.

183
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,917
If this all goes wrong,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

184
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,679
Girls doing okay here?

185
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,938
Fine.

186
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,970
Just need a few more of these
in me, I'll be right as rain.

187
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,137
You hear anything, Floyd?

188
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,608
No. But I got my cell.

189
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,913
You know my wife threw me out?

190
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,316
She says I'm driving her crazy.
Short fucking trip.

191
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,887
Wanna play some cards?

192
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,500
- You know how I like taking your money?
- I know you like taking my money.

193
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,333
- I love taking your money.
- I brought extra.

194
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,302
Good. I'm a little short.

195
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,792
- Hey, can I borrow 20 before we start?
- Of course.

196
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,432
Sit down.

197
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,200
Come on in, gentlemen.

198
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,099
So, this is how it works, kid.

199
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,671
You against us.

200
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,540
We win a hand, we tell you a story.

201
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,644
And, you ought to listen up 'cause these
stories are worth a year of street experience.

202
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,747
So, put yourself in our shoes,

203
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,818
you, think like we think,

204
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:15,086
and then one day when you
find yourself in a bad spot,

205
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,658
you'll remember what we taught you.

206
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,726
Hopefully, you'll make it out alive.

207
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,700
We were there making mistakes.

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,904
You listen, you learn. Maybe you
don't have to make the same ones.

209
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,341
We ain't good for much
else except these stories.

210
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,344
It's all we got left to
contribute to you young kids.

211
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,380
Speak for yourself,
Calabrese, old bitch.

212
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,717
I'm still out there kicking
ass and breaking balls.

213
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:47,053
I seen you, Calabrese. I could limp
faster than you with Bernard on my back.

214
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:51,958
- I could take a shit faster than you.
- Hey. Hey. Fuck all you all, motherfuckers.

215
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,999
You grumpy-ass motherf...
I'll kick all your fucking asses,

216
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,199
right here and right fucking now.

217
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:01,201
- Shit. Come on. Sit down, Calabrese.
- All right. I'll sit down.

218
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:04,037
You're supposed to get wisdom as you
get older, not leak it out when you piss.

219
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:08,241
<i>About 10 years ago, the chief made a decision
to start bringing in some heavy hitters.</i>

220
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,044
<i>We're a small town,
but crime was rising.</i>

221
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,648
<i>He figured you bring in some big
city vets about ready to retire...</i>

222
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,217
<i>and give them a couple years
here training the rookies,</i>

223
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,953
<i>they might just be able to
stay ahead of the curve.</i>

224
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,922
<i>He brought in some of the best.</i>

225
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,623
<i>Jason Cunningham.</i>

226
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,994
<i>This guy survived the Richmond drug
wars and took down over 300 collars.</i>

227
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,830
<i>Incorruptible and unsociable.</i>

228
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,466
<i>A.J. Bernard, one of Memphis's finest.</i>

229
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,270
<i>A.J. solved over 45 homicides,
retired here seven years ago.</i>

230
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,040
<i>Been one of the poker squad ever since.</i>

231
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,377
<i>Byron Davis, Chicago PD.
Toughest cop I ever met.</i>

232
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,881
<i>Had an accident four years ago
and headed for greener pastures.</i>

233
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,418
<i>Floyd Maxwell,
15 years on the front lines.</i>

234
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,154
<i>Doesn't say much,
but when he does, listen.</i>

235
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,223
<i>They call him "the Hawk,"
and the Hawk was watching me.</i>

236
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,293
<i>The lieutenant, Mike Calabrese.</i>

237
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,862
<i>Maybe the most beloved
senior officer ever.</i>

238
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,099
<i>Always looking out for his men.
Always there to lend a hand.</i>

239
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,069
<i>Last year he saved my life.</i>

240
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,802
Through the, gravel pit up where the...

241
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,840
Shot fired. Shit.

242
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,265
Get your head out of your ass, Jeter!

243
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:41,668
Thank you. Stay close.

244
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,903
Lieutenant. I want to say thank you.

245
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,810
You saved my fucking life.

246
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,412
No, you did. Y-You...

247
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,215
I would be dead and un-un-under
the ground if it wasn't for...

248
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:59,283
Get the fuck out of here with
this sympathetic bullshit.

249
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,188
Crying in your beer.

250
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,523
Somebody want to get
this fucking guy a dress?

251
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,866
You don't say thank you to me.

252
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,635
You do better.

253
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:22,776
You come onto the
scene ready for action.

254
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,712
You pay attention. You learn.

255
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,948
And the next time you
help out the new guy.

256
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,342
You save <i>his</i> life.

257
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,109
That's all the thanks I need.

258
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,698
Hey, boys, get this.

259
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,401
This drunk fuck wants
to buy us all a round.

260
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,870
- Hey!
- Go figure.

261
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,540
So, nurse!

262
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,176
- Here we go.
- How did I get so lucky?

263
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,678
- Five card draw. Straight up.
- Oh, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

264
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,813
- Here it comes.
- Jesus Christ.

265
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,248
Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding.

266
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:07,420
We haven't even started yet and
you're asking a question? Hey, hey.

267
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,489
That is not how this works.

268
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,194
We ask the questions, we do
the talking, you do the listening.

269
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,831
Okay, but I'm serious.
I have a question. Just one.

270
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:22,101
Jesus Christ, ask the fucking question before
our pensions run out, for Christ's sake.

271
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,177
What if I win?

272
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,513
Listen. Ten years of playing poker night,
rookie's never won, never will.

273
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,484
Okay, but if I do. Say I get that,
that one great hand. What then?

274
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,853
Hey, look here.
If you win, all bets are off.

275
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,455
All right? You tell the stories
and we start learning.

276
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,190
And we'd be pretty bad cheaters
if we're dealing you good cards.

277
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,330
All right. First lesson.

278
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,233
I wasn't looking at your card.
I saw you peeking.

279
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,768
It's an easy one.
It's about perspective.

280
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,907
We deal with three percent of
the population 97% of the time.

281
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:05,278
And now everyone in the
world is not a lowlife, lying,

282
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,015
backstabbing, ass-covering
son of a bitch.

283
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,026
But.

284
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,026
But it's mostly who we
deal with on a daily basis.

285
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,089
And they all think they're
smarter than you.

286
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,091
So here's your lesson.

287
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,027
- They're not.
- Except for the ones who actually are.

288
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,805
We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend they don't exist.

289
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:29,754
<i>But sometimes they do exist.</i>
<i>The monsters from your nightmares.</i>

290
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,905
<i>They're real, and you can't wake up.</i>

291
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,047
There you are. So tell me, Detective.
How old are you?

292
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,752
Twenty-five? Twenty-six?

293
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,488
Take a little from column A

294
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,416
to fix column B.

295
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,699
- Am I right?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

296
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,869
I can make us a deal. Okay?
I-I-I got connections.

297
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,137
- A deal?
- Yeah.

298
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,636
Okay.

299
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,977
I was just like you once.

300
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,949
<i>Just a normal guy with a normal life...</i>

301
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,726
<i>who went to a normal job</i>

302
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:22,283
<i>day after day after day.</i>

303
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,359
<i>I was a forecaster, Stan.</i>

304
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,529
<i>Predicting behavior
and regulating change.</i>

305
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,534
<i>Just another one of the
worker bees buzzing around.</i>

306
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,771
<i>I just never seemed to make ends meet.</i>

307
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:43,543
<i>I got to the point where I just
couldn't take it anymore, Stan.</i>

308
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,380
<i>I wasn't going to be just
another one of those sheeple...</i>

309
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,383
<i>marching to the beat of
someone else's drum.</i>

310
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,190
<i>So I decided, right then and there,</i>

311
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,989
<i>I was going to change my life.</i>

312
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,162
<i>But in order to do that, Stan,</i>

313
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,362
<i>I needed goals.</i>

314
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,835
<i>It took me a while to
be honest with myself.</i>

315
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,305
<i>I had to look into my
inner recesses, Stan.</i>

316
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,375
<i>I had to look deep,</i>

317
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,109
<i>and then I found them.</i>

318
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,716
<i>Two to be exact.</i>

319
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,086
<i>Making the rules was easy.</i>

320
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:44,010
<i>Crossing the line is what
separates the men from the boys.</i>

321
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,005
<i>But I was diligent.</i>

322
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,442
<i>I was a hard worker.</i>

323
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,735
Well, Stan, we're gonna have
to pick this up at another time.

324
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,671
- Just wait a second. Okay?
- What?

325
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,140
- Don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

326
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,210
No, you don't have to
do that. You don't...

327
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,446
- Don't have to...
- Sorry, Stan. Rule number one calls.

328
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,900
Oh, God, no. Amy!

329
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:52,238
Hey, stop! Just leave her alone!

330
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,572
Hey!

331
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,149
- Hey, kid, how you doing?
- Hey.

332
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,492
- You don't look so good.
- No. I'm fine.

333
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,329
It's the night shift, you know,
kicking my ass.

334
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,596
Anything to do with this?

335
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,999
Let's talk.

336
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,931
Hi, Daddy.

337
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:35,560
No, it's okay now.

338
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,919
A nice officer is here to take him away.

339
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,221
Yep. Just like you taught me.

340
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,990
He won't be looking in any
girls' windows anytime soon.

341
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,559
Nicely done.

342
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,361
Jeter.

343
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,834
Where'd you go?

344
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:59,045
- I'm sorry.
- Look, Stan. Just between us.

345
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,342
You're a good cop. Could be a great cop.

346
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,075
So,

347
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,782
what's the deal with Amy?

348
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,585
Oh, come on, Lieutenant.

349
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,288
- I mean, she's just a kid.
- All right.

350
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,390
I just wanted to hear it
straight from you is all.

351
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,185
Hear what?

352
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,185
That there's nothing going
on between the two of you.

353
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,255
I don't know anything, Lieutenant.
I'm telling you the truth.

354
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:28,733
Something's going on. I know she's
been calling here, asking for you.

355
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,612
- Jeter.
- <i>Hi, Officer Jeter?</i>

356
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,911
<i>This is Amy.</i>

357
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,553
Hi, Amy. Listen, you can't call me here.

358
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,389
<i>I know. I know. I was just thinking.</i>

359
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,692
<i>Maybe you could take
me on a drive along?</i>

360
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:57,362
<i>You know, give me a firsthand peek
into the world of law enforcement.</i>

361
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,299
Yeah, I don't think your dad
would be too happy about that.

362
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,002
<i>Come on. You're not afraid
of my dad, are you?</i>

363
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,938
<i>Besides, I can do what I want.
I'm an adult.</i>

364
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,940
Almost an adult.

365
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,971
<i>Oh, come on, Stan. It'll be fun.
Besides, if you don't pick me up,</i>

366
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:14,447
<i>who knows what kind of
trouble I might get in.</i>

367
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:17,948
<i>Someone's gonna call
the cops either way.</i>

368
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,086
I don't know.

369
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:01,260
Oh, me too. I just like
the spirit, you know?

370
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,666
Like, everyone's happy and
there's lights. It's pretty.

371
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,034
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,936
- Yeah.
- And...

373
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,767
I need to know.

374
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,542
I don't want any stinking trouble,
not on this department, not on you.

375
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,511
You got me?

376
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,681
I'm telling you the truth, Lieutenant.

377
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,748
I never saw her.

378
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,912
Don't let it hit the fan, Jeter.

379
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:10,127
You're a hero cop, you're gonna
make detective next week.

380
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,964
Don't give 'em any dirt.

381
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,941
Stan?

382
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,807
Stan, can you hear me?

383
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,945
Yeah!

384
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,714
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you okay?

385
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,683
Please. We have to get out of here.

386
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,752
- How long have you been here?
- The whole time.

387
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:36,555
- How did he get you?
- I got a call.

388
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,324
<i>He said you were in trouble.</i>

389
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:41,327
- Are you?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's go. Get in.

390
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,829
Listen. I don't just get
in the car with strangers.

391
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,865
All right. Look, you see this blood?

392
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:50,336
He doesn't have much more time.
Okay? He's asking for you. Let's go.

393
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,239
<i>Wait. Wait a minute.
He knows that I know you?</i>

394
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:57,677
<i>But you found me, Stan.
They must know where we are, right?</i>

395
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:00,713
No, I got a call on the radio.

396
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,916
A domestic. Five miles up the road.
My phone didn't work.

397
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,054
But I've been gone for two weeks.
Aren't there any leads at all?

398
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,656
No, they...

399
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,494
- They thought I might be involved.
- Please, Stan, you have to stop him.

400
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,861
He comes in here...

401
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,451
I know this is hard. Okay, I do.

402
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,887
I'm gonna try to think of a way out.
Can you get free?

403
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:45,457
No. No, I tried. I tried everything.

404
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:47,524
I can't.

405
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,595
If we're gonna get out,
we've got to get out when he's gone.

406
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,567
- Wait. He's gone?
- Yeah, he... he's gone.

407
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,003
He leaves sometimes.
He leaves... I can hear his car leave.

408
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,940
All right. I need you
to listen carefully.

409
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,677
You tell me if you hear anything.
I need to know if he comes back, okay?

410
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,910
Okay.

411
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,183
All right. You deal, gimpy.

412
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,953
Watch it, tough guy. I'm gonna
shove my gimp cane up your ass.

413
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,921
- Yeah. You'd have to catch me first.
- I've never been on your back.

414
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,591
Excuse me.

415
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,360
Hello?

416
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:27,266
Yeah, any news? Okay.

417
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,525
It's in the study.
Yeah, I can come back if...

418
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,985
Okay. All right, thanks. Bye.

419
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,243
It's all gonna be okay. Don't worry.

420
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,078
What's the game?

421
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,911
Texas Hold'em.

422
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,482
All right, so listen up.

423
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:47,854
You got to try to put yourself in
our shoes. Try to picture the story.

424
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,689
What would you do? What would you think?

425
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,124
Her name was Misty.

426
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,727
<i>If you can't think it, you can't see it.</i>

427
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,262
If you can't see it, you can't learn.

428
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,902
Do you see it?

429
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:06,270
- Oh, yeah.
- Then walk the scene.

430
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,777
Officers. Hey, where's our vic?

431
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,078
- In there.
- That way.

432
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,815
Jim, you got an extra pair of gloves?

433
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,315
- There you go.
- As usual.

434
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,931
<i>This is the big one.</i>

435
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,666
<i>Murder.</i>

436
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,975
<i>You look at the body
for a real long time.</i>

437
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,910
Till it's burned into your head.

438
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,847
Without you, whoever did this gets away.

439
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,748
You're responsible for avenging her.

440
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,185
You're doing God's work now.

441
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:01,358
<i>The place was a mess. DNA everywhere.</i>

442
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,783
<i>This guy was the Old Faithful of sperm.</i>

443
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:10,670
<i>We had the evidence.
Now we needed the match.</i>

444
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,640
<i>So the investigation started,
but it never stopped.</i>

445
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,943
<i>Started with family, friends,
boyfriends, coworkers.</i>

446
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,778
<i>I lost track at 100 guys.</i>

447
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,305
<i>One year stretched into three. Nothing.</i>

448
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,088
<i>Her parents kept calling me,
wanting updates.</i>

449
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:33,158
<i>There was nothing to tell.
But I was gonna catch this guy.</i>

450
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,968
<i>I wasn't gonna let this one go.</i>
<i>I promised them I wouldn't quit.</i>

451
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:42,768
<i>Eight years later, a handyman
gets called for a broken furnace.</i>

452
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,003
<i>Something's blocking a vent.</i>

453
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,240
And boom. Guess what pops out.

454
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,875
<i>Panties.</i>

455
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,177
Loads of fucking panties.

456
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,682
<i>So here's how it works.</i>
<i>Those panties had sperm all over them.</i>

457
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,085
<i>The sperm on the panties matched
the sperm all over Misty's house.</i>

458
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,923
<i>Whoever juked on the panties was
the same person who killed Misty.</i>

459
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,491
<i>The house the panties were found in...</i>

460
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,094
<i>was a rental property about
three blocks away from Misty.</i>

461
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:14,300
<i>Going back eight years, we found out
who lived there. A wannabe actor.</i>

462
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,436
<i>But the closest he ever got to the
film business was working here.</i>

463
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,579
<i>All I needed was a swab.</i>
<i>But the way he was looking at me...</i>

464
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,783
<i>He must have been waiting his
whole life for me to show up.</i>

465
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:35,622
<i>He must have lived his life in fear that
someday, somehow his secret would out.</i>

466
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,688
<i>And he wasn't going
down without a fight.</i>

467
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:44,194
Hey! Freeze! I said stop!

468
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,436
Hey, stop!

469
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,043
Hey!

470
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,710
Stop! Stop!

471
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,343
Sorry!

472
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,798
Hey, police! Move.

473
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,704
Jesus.

474
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,774
Fuck.

475
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,161
Hey!

476
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,792
Hey, stop!

477
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,510
Stay down!

478
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,219
Shit.

479
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,203
Hey, get out of the car!

480
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,211
<i>That was it for me.</i>

481
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,946
<i>Last run. Never walk
without a cane again.</i>

482
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:48,320
<i>But I wasn't done fighting. I'd been
chasing this guy for eight years.</i>

483
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,820
<i>I wasn't gonna lose him now.</i>

484
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,427
<i>And that's how you get 'em.</i>

485
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,664
Same as I got you bastards.

486
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,400
Son of a bitch.

487
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,869
The race doesn't always
go to the swiftest.

488
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,171
You take your time.
You build your case. And you...

489
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,108
Never, ever give up.

490
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,377
- Go fuck yourself.
- Look, it's true.

491
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,279
Fuckin' bumper sticker.

492
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,049
Why does Davis solve all
his cases with panties?

493
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,951
Why do all yours get solved by
naked sweaty boy informants?

494
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,421
- I stick with what I know.
- Reminds me of Maxwell's story.

495
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:26,225
Okay. We're gonna just play cards,
thank you very much.

496
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,692
- Oh, no. Come on. Tell that story.
- Come on.

497
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,503
Come on.

498
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,975
<i>This is it.</i>

499
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,033
<i>The big moment.</i>

500
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,558
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

501
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,094
<i>Make it happen.</i>

502
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,661
<i>Don't give up.</i>

503
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,185
Shit.

504
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,283
Fuck. Shit.

505
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,688
Fuck.

506
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,932
Fuck. Fuck.

507
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:50,379
Amy?

508
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,111
Stan!

509
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,548
- Amy?
- Can you hear me?

510
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,650
- Amy!
- Stan!

511
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,450
Follow my voice.

512
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:02,952
Stan!

513
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,024
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah. I can hear you. Follow my voice.

514
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,130
Where are you?

515
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,401
I'm over here! I'm in here!

516
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,170
Stan?

517
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,388
- Amy?
- Stan!

518
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:48,732
Please. Oh, my God.

519
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,037
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Yeah, yeah.

520
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,404
- What happened?
- Hold on. Stop.

521
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,330
The giant thing...

522
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:04,182
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

523
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,351
You gotta get me out. You gotta get me
out of here. You gotta get me out...

524
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,088
Listen to me, okay?
I can't pull these chains out.

525
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,624
I need to find some tools. I need to
call the police and get 'em over here.

526
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,426
- I'm gonna go upstairs for a second.
- No, no, no.

527
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,128
You can't leave me.
He's gonna come back. He's...

528
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,929
If I don't get something to break you out,
he's going to kill us both.

529
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,803
Okay?

530
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,293
- Okay.
- I'll be back. I promise.

531
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,273
You fucking...

532
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,997
Shit.

533
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,420
Fuck.

534
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,115
<i>I had my chance.</i>

535
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:31,056
<i>I had my chance, and I took it.</i>
<i>No one could fault me for that.</i>

536
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,893
<i>But I knew it would be a cold day
before I would get that chance again.</i>

537
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,497
<i>Now I had more important
things on my mind than escape.</i>

538
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,631
<i>I just needed to concentrate
on staying alive.</i>

539
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:51,989
Stan!

540
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,201
Game is called Chase the Queen.

541
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,002
Which I'm sure you're all used to doing.

542
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:25,176
The queen and anything
comes after is wild.

543
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,479
Two down, one up,

544
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:30,649
two up, one down, one up.

545
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:32,851
Hand of crap.

546
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,320
Queens and wilds.
I can't keep track of this shit.

547
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,857
Hey, Bernard. Why don't you just start
your story, okay? So I can go take a piss.

548
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:42,460
- It was 1979.
- Holy shit.

549
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,295
In '79 I was still in diapers.

550
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,389
Back then, they didn't give you guns,
right? You just had a club.

551
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:50,602
You hit the bad guy over the head
and then drag him back to your cave?

552
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,738
'79... I was still married
to my first wife.

553
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,772
Oh, yeah, Cleopatra.

554
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:00,009
It was 1979.

555
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,248
We had a double murder.

556
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,450
Gruesome double murder.

557
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,353
No witnesses, one suspect.

558
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,221
The son.

559
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,988
Shawn.

560
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,728
Just give me a call.

561
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,504
If you go anywhere,
give me a call, let me know.

562
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,973
- Oh, okay. I will.
- You feel that?

563
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,775
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

564
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,811
- Feel what?
- Something's not right.

565
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,379
- That's all.
- Thanks, sir.

566
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,081
It's not what they say.

567
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,816
It's what they don't say.
Okay, so what should I do?

568
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:43,221
Help him find the words.

569
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,657
Hey, kid! Hey.

570
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,392
- Y-Yeah?
- Hold up. Hey, come here.

571
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,128
Okay.

572
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,097
Just wanted to ask you
a couple more questions.

573
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,567
I told the detective everything I know.
He's said I could go.

574
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,802
- It's in the eyes.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

575
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,639
I know, I just thought we might
walk it over one more time.

576
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,044
It'll just take a few minutes.

577
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:06,811
Sure, I guess. I mean,
should I have a lawyer or something?

578
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,179
There it is.

579
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,782
Well, I guess if I had something to hide,
sure, I'd want a lawyer.

580
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,221
But if you've done nothing wrong.

581
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,521
That's up to you.
You think you need a lawyer?

582
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:19,924
N-N-No. I-I guess not.

583
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,495
- All right. Well, then let's go.
- Go?

584
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,362
Take him on the drive.

585
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,538
The drive? Oh, my God. Not the drive.

586
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:37,008
Jones had the cup of coffee.
Douglas had the crying corner.

587
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,677
A.J. Bernard? Long drive.

588
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,146
Well, he needs a long drive.

589
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:44,249
If the drive was any shorter,
he wouldn't figure a goddamn thing out.

590
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,949
- It's... It's true.
- It was 1979.

591
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,820
Silence was a part of it.

592
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,760
But it could also gives
you time to think.

593
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,530
Time to get inside their heads a bit.

594
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,463
Figure out what happened.

595
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,972
Wait. Why are we here?

596
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,342
You said... You said we were
going to my Grandma's house.

597
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,878
Just want to walk it through with
you again, like you told us bit by bit.

598
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,117
I just want to go.

599
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:21,853
I know, just once more.

600
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,556
Please.

601
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:26,522
Fine.

602
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,065
Here's the thing.

603
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,034
Killers all have a reason.

604
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:39,168
If you know the reason,
you're halfway home.

605
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,641
<i>They just want you to understand them.</i>

606
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,321
<i>They did those things with a purpose.</i>

607
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,948
<i>You understand the reason...</i>

608
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,215
- Go on.
- You found your guy.

609
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,423
Take me back there, Shawn.
What'd you see?

610
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,018
<i>Here's the thing about this job.</i>

611
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,786
<i>There is no bottom.</i>
<i>Just when you think you've seen it all,</i>

612
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,425
<i>the bottom falls out.</i>

613
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,461
There is no worst.
Just new levels of hell.

614
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,431
What happened?

615
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,004
Shawn?

616
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:48,540
Tell me what happened.

617
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,376
I... I came in,
and someone was beating them.

618
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,815
Who? Who was it, Shawn?

619
00:46:56,915 --> 00:47:00,016
They were good people.
Who would want to kill your mom and dad?

620
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,021
No, they weren't what you think.

621
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,556
What am I supposed to think?
You told me they were good parents.

622
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,560
Now why would someone
kill these good people?

623
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,063
- Y-You didn't know them. They...
- They what?

624
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:15,200
Open it! Open the door right now!

625
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,166
<i>They yell at you? They beat you?</i>

626
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:23,584
<i>Mommy hold you a bit too close?</i>

627
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,510
Yeah. They did it all.

628
00:47:39,885 --> 00:47:41,292
What were you gonna do about it, Shawn?

629
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,295
Were you gonna let them get
away with treating you like that?

630
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:47,632
I can see why you did what
you had to do, Shawn.

631
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,001
This couldn't go on like this forever.

632
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,403
- Now tell me what happened.
- Tell me, Shawn.

633
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:53,585
Tell me what happened.

634
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,007
No!

635
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:17,262
I killed them! It was me. I killed them.

636
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,731
You don't always get what you want.

637
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:24,402
I got a broken jaw and 18 stitches.
But I got the confession.

638
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,303
Sometimes you pay a price for justice.

639
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,443
How you doing, buddy? Come here.

640
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,314
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.

641
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,149
- <i>In my line of work...</i>
- You all right?

642
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,018
- <i>I see things.</i>
- Who did this to you?

643
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,353
- You ain't got nothing on me, motherfucker!
- Calm down, man!

644
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:45,102
- I'm fuckin' doing it!
- No, no, no!

645
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:46,222
<i>Bad things.</i>

646
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,458
<i>Things that shouldn't be seen.</i>

647
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,200
Food.

648
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,804
<i>When you're faced with this every day,</i>
<i>you find ways to deal with it.</i>

649
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,837
<i>It might not be the best ways.</i>

650
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:08,012
<i>At the academy, we were
told that we work for God.</i>

651
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,415
<i>That we are the last line of defense</i>

652
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:12,840
<i>to protect the world from
the tyranny of evil men.</i>

653
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,050
<i>And I remember thinking
that sounded stupid.</i>

654
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:20,091
<i>I don't now.</i>
<i>Now I know what evil looks like.</i>

655
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:23,592
<i>I've seen it up close and personal.</i>

656
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,431
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

657
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:29,133
What the hell did you do to me?

658
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,134
<i>And I can never look at
things the same again.</i>

659
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,851
Do you know...

660
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:50,588
how many tubes of
Krazy Glue it takes to...

661
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,921
hold a man to a wall?

662
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:56,853
Would you believe 34?

663
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,038
A lot more than I thought too.

664
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:04,467
Please, just tell me what you want.
I'll do everything I can.

665
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,772
Shut up.

666
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:13,109
- Please, there must be something you need.
- Now you were close. So close.

667
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:17,081
The next time you try to escape,
it's gonna hurt.

668
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,685
Really hurt. Oh, you don't believe me?

669
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,159
Here.

670
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,433
- See what I mean?
- You're sick!

671
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,235
- Thank you.
- Leave him alone!

672
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,746
So touching.

673
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,614
She really likes you.

674
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:53,449
Too bad she's jailbait.

675
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,489
Just... Just let her go, okay?

676
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,655
It's me you want, right?

677
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,326
We have more in common
than I thought, Detective.

678
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,709
Although...

679
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,332
I think she's too old for me.

680
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:16,138
Why are you doing this? Why?
Where's this going?

681
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,973
Don't try and be smart.

682
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:30,388
I'm always five moves ahead of you.

683
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:34,590
You see what I want you to see.
You know what I want you to know.

684
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,729
While you're playing catch up,

685
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,864
I'm already planning next month.

686
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,269
Hey, wait... wait a second.
What about your family?

687
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,741
Why did you kill them?

688
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,908
You're so transparent.

689
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,178
But sure. Why not?

690
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,917
Where were we?

691
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:05,389
<i>Oh, yes, my new goals.</i>

692
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,492
<i>If you really want to kill people...</i>

693
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:11,696
<i>and you really want to get away with it,</i>
<i>then you need to do a little research.</i>

694
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:16,167
<i>Now where do you go to
learn sick things like that?</i>

695
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,068
<i>The Discovery Channel of course.</i>

696
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,606
<i>The have a whole channel
just devoted to murder.</i>

697
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:25,710
<i>It was like watching TV
to get a PhD in murder.</i>

698
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,080
<i>And the Internet. A world of
debauchery right at your fingertips.</i>

699
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,717
<i>Everything you ever wanted to know
about anything sick and twisted,</i>

700
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,752
<i>available at a keystroke.</i>

701
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:39,957
<i>Night after night I was learning more.</i>
<i>Arguing. Sharing knowledge.</i>

702
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:43,628
<i>It was like being a member in
the most exclusive club ever.</i>

703
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:48,731
<i>I was liberated. I didn't feel
alone for the first time in my life.</i>

704
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,934
<i>But...</i>

705
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,437
<i>I needed something more.</i>

706
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,365
<i>Someone to share with, to learn from,</i>

707
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,547
<i>to help me sharpen my skills.</i>

708
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,553
<i>I needed a mentor.</i>

709
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,195
<i>It was everything I ever
hoped for and more.</i>

710
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:23,099
<i>Someone who got me, understood me,</i>
<i>where I was coming from.</i>

711
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,972
<i>He helped me be the man I am today.</i>

712
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:29,705
<i>To be all I could be.</i>

713
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:40,195
<i>But there comes a time
when you have to grow up.</i>

714
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:45,257
<i>There comes a time when you kill
your parents, and you leave the house.</i>

715
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:48,359
- What a dipshit.
- <i>That time came,</i>

716
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,595
<i>and that's when I knew I was ready.</i>

717
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:53,529
<i>Ready to be on my own again.</i>

718
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:56,532
What happened to your mentor?

719
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,069
And you call yourself a detective?

720
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,174
Enough about me. Let's talk about you.

721
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,856
I see potential in you, Detective.

722
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,424
You're a lot like me.

723
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,824
Trapped.

724
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:26,717
Well, you saw what I
had to do to break free.

725
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:28,797
And I want you to do the same.

726
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:31,533
Please.

727
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,905
Just let me go.

728
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,205
Let yourself go.

729
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,809
Free yourself.

730
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,582
I want you to think
about something, Detective.

731
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,519
Why you?

732
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,925
Out of everyone.

733
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,161
Why you?

734
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,198
Do you think you have what
it takes to go up against me?

735
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,035
You think you're smart enough?
I don't think so.

736
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:08,670
I think you fall short. Way short.

737
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,010
Game's almost over, Detective.

738
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,436
You know, I've been thinking.

739
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,507
You know, what's going on here is...

740
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,062
it's not right.

741
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:52,416
I used you to catch the detective
and now that I have him,

742
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:56,619
I don't really need you anymore.

743
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:03,158
I have a sickness, and...

744
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:08,797
I see that now.
And I can't keep doing this.

745
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,939
So what I want is for
you to call your family...

746
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,242
and tell them that you're all right,

747
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:22,244
and tell them to come get you. Okay?

748
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,680
What?

749
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,084
Oh, but...

750
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,221
All right.

751
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,676
All right. So.

752
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:57,880
Here.

753
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,883
Daddy?

754
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:36,287
Can you hear me? Yes, I'm alive.

755
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:39,254
He wants you to come get me.
He said he's gonna let me...

756
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:44,993
No.

757
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,170
Dad.

758
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,558
Hello, Amy's dad?

759
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,113
How are you today?

760
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,883
- I wouldn't talk like that if I were you.
- Stop!

761
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,575
- You do realize I have your daughter, right?
- Daddy! Don't listen to him.

762
00:58:08,675 --> 00:58:12,223
- Don't listen to him! Da... Get off!
- Yeah, that was her.

763
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:15,326
All right. So this is gonna be simple.
You're gonna take $10,000.

764
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:17,995
You're gonna get in your car and
you're gonna drive up River Road.

765
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:21,932
You're gonna drive 5.2 miles, and you're gonna
head up to the house there. You got it?

766
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:24,034
3:00 pm. And no cops.

767
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,069
And I mean no cops or your daughter
comes back dead and pregnant.

768
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,310
That's it for me, boyos. Cash me out.

769
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,179
What are you talking about? It's 11:30.

770
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,515
Yeah, you're not going anywhere
till we hear our favorite story.

771
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:39,617
- Give me a fucking break.
- No, no, no.

772
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:44,470
You're gonna stay right here
and tell us a sexy little story.

773
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:48,125
- I get all tingly just thinking about it.
- I bet you are.

774
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:53,616
Floyd. Come on. I'm out of Viagra.
The little woman's been begging for it.

775
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:55,065
I need you, bro.

776
00:58:57,748 --> 00:59:00,838
You guys are assholes.
Thirty-five years on the fucking job,

777
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,741
highly-decorated detective,
you think I only got one story?

778
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,710
I got a million. Here, there's one.

779
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,746
- I had this guy...
- No!

780
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,148
No! Nope. Come on. Tell it, Floyd.

781
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:11,982
- We want <i>the</i> story.
- You want <i>the</i> story?

782
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,150
- Yeah, <i>the</i> story.
- Yeah!

783
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,185
For your own fucking
perverse pleasure...

784
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,620
- All right.
- Thank you.

785
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,654
I will indulge you...

786
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:22,056
in a tale of fine police work.

787
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:25,896
And whatnot.

788
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:29,266
It was a little ways back.
I had a little less gray in my hair.

789
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:33,137
I might have been wearing a
Members Only jacket, I'm not sure.

790
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:36,038
Bottom line is, there were three bodies.

791
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,443
One in the water.

792
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,383
<i>One in the woods.</i>

793
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,756
One in the Dumpster.

794
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,793
<i>Now this was a big deal at the time...</i>

795
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:59,229
<i>because this was the first
serial killer in the area, right?</i>

796
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,132
<i>Each of the victims was
killed in a different place.</i>

797
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,466
<i>But all of them were
missing their pinkies.</i>

798
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:10,004
<i>So we called this guy "the pinky thief."</i>

799
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,743
<i>All the victims though,
they were hustlers, right?</i>

800
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:15,744
<i>Guys selling themselves out
to the highest bidder.</i>

801
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:21,318
<i>But the one common thing was,
each of 'em was afraid of the same guy.</i>

802
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:22,953
<i>This asshole named Nate Munson.</i>

803
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:26,256
<i>He's some bullshit photographer, right?</i>
<i>He would lure 'em into his world,</i>

804
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,159
<i>you know, with the promise
of glamour pictures, right?</i>

805
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:32,260
<i>'Cause they're all aspiring models,
fucking actors and whatnot.</i>

806
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,965
<i>So we liked this guy
for all these killings.</i>

807
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,762
Oh, such a nice night.

808
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,114
He would lead them into the woods

809
01:00:48,214 --> 01:00:52,099
to his own little personal lovers'
lane place that he'd staked out.

810
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:57,221
Oh, watch your step.
It's slippery on this moss.

811
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:01,392
We thought he killed them there,
then disposed of the bodies later.

812
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,194
I don't see anything here
that says that this is our guy.

813
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,230
- This is our guy.
<i>- We know this is our guy.</i>

814
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,333
- I know it is. I can feel it.
<i>- But each scene is too clean.</i>

815
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:13,203
<i>We can't bring him in without evidence.</i>
<i>He'll take a fucking walk.</i>

816
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,997
But if we're right,
and he kills someone else,

817
01:01:16,097 --> 01:01:17,240
we're gonna catch hell in the press

818
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,560
when they find out that we knew
about the guy and he went on killing.

819
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,646
So there's only one
way to do this right.

820
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,948
<i>Someone had to go undercover.</i>

821
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,682
I drew the short straw.

822
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,123
<i>They wired me up,</i>

823
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,527
<i>and the go word is,
"You're making me hot."</i>

824
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:38,696
- <i>"You're making me hot."</i>
- Wow.

825
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,929
<i>Poor choice of words.</i>

826
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,868
<i>It comes from upstairs.</i>

827
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:48,272
<i>They make the unfortunate
fucking tactical decision...</i>

828
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,441
<i>to link us up with some local SWAT team.</i>

829
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,909
<i>These guys were fucking
world-class bozos, right?</i>

830
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,715
<i>Shit-bird number one.</i>
<i>Shit-bird number two.</i>

831
01:01:57,815 --> 01:02:00,250
<i>Shit-bird number three.</i>

832
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,020
Here, that's you.
Sniper two, Johnson, there.

833
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,363
Snipers had me triangulated,
ready to put this fuck in the ground

834
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:07,873
first sign of craziness.

835
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:09,560
- Nice.
- Whoa, hey.

836
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,497
The guy's fucking feeling me
up and I'm thinking to myself,

837
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:16,633
this better be the fucking guy,
all right? You know?

838
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,671
Because if this guy's just
in it for the fucking sex,

839
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:22,339
he's never gonna see a jail cell...

840
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:25,140
'cause I'm gonna take him
out right there on the spot.

841
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,779
<i>So after a while he
starts getting rough.</i>

842
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,445
Handcuffs.

843
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,922
Oh, hey. Hey.

844
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,891
- What is that?
- Who's in charge now?

845
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,493
What are you doing?

846
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,529
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

847
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:48,497
Yeah.

848
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,235
Yes. You're kinky. You're fuckin' kinky.

849
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,850
Come on.

850
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:56,429
Now you're fucking...

851
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,882
- You're making me hot. You're making me hot.
- Why don't we get... Why don't we...

852
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,614
You're making me hot.

853
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,591
Yeah, you're making me hot!

854
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,493
You're... You're making me...

855
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,562
Oh, shit!

856
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:19,962
Hey, you're making me hot!

857
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:29,072
<i>Shit-bird number one has been
on the phone with his wife.</i>

858
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,440
<i>They're having a fight.</i>

859
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,719
<i>Shit-bird number two catches
some kids smoking pot.</i>

860
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:41,182
<i>Shit-bird number three ate Mexican for
lunch and he's got the fucking runs.</i>

861
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,987
You're ma... You're making me hot!
Hey, hey. You're making me hot.

862
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,226
So at this point,

863
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,796
Munson moves behind me, and I
know he's gonna cut my finger off.

864
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:56,633
I realize that I'm on my own, right?
There's gonna be no back up.

865
01:03:56,733 --> 01:04:00,304
So I do the one sensible
thing that any man would do.

866
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,737
Hey, hey, hey, hey. W-W-Wait.
Come here. Come here.

867
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,473
I asked for a kiss.

868
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,647
Give me a kiss.

869
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,724
- Turns you on?
- Yeah. Fuck it. Come here.

870
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:24,693
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on. Oh, yeah.

871
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,069
- He's down.
- Move!

872
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,507
Hey, where the fuck were you?

873
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,207
Fuckin' piece of shit.

874
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,746
- Come on!
- <i>Bottom line.</i>

875
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:46,717
If you're in the shit,
you're all you got,

876
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:48,566
you make your fucking play.

877
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,453
You're right. It's a lesson, kid.

878
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,926
And if all else fails... Ask for a kiss!

879
01:05:32,227 --> 01:05:33,463
Don't move, motherfucker.

880
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,096
- Okay. Okay.
- Right there.

881
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,366
Get your fucking hands up.

882
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:43,106
Okay, okay.

883
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,509
- Get 'em up. Where's my daughter?
- What do...

884
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,444
- Where is she?
- What do you mean your daughter?

885
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,377
I don't know what you're talking about.

886
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:55,118
Don't fuck with me or I will smoke you.
You tell me where she is now.

887
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:58,889
Okay, don't. I don't know
what's going on here, man.

888
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,857
I... You know, I was
just walking my dog,

889
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,294
and I saw you at the house and I just
came to tell you that nobody's home, okay?

890
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,798
- They're away. They're away.
- Don't give me that.

891
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:10,834
You called me on my cell phone,
you piece of shit.

892
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:14,371
- Where is she?
- Don't. Please. Just listen, okay?

893
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,258
I don't know what's going on here.
I don't know what you're talking about.

894
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,609
But please don't kill me, okay?
Don't... Don't kill me. I got kids too.

895
01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:27,115
You fuck...

896
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,685
Please.

897
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,088
Please.

898
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:38,995
Oh, shit. Shit. Fuck.

899
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:43,331
I'm sorry. Put your hand down.
Put your hand... Stand up.

900
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:47,938
- You all right?
- Yeah.

901
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:50,640
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it's...

902
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,043
I'm sorry.

903
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,677
- Fuck.
- Are you okay? I mean...

904
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,584
You should really call the cops
or something. They can help.

905
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,943
I am the cops.

906
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,624
It's okay.

907
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,801
Hey, you know, I'm sure
everything's gonna turn out fine.

908
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:19,702
You know.

909
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,604
I hope you find your kid.

910
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,977
Thanks. Look, I'm sorry
about that back there.

911
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,910
Yeah.

912
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,947
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.

913
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,484
No problem.

914
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:39,847
Come on.

915
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:02,072
- Stan. Stan, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

916
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:06,207
- Stan! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

917
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:11,613
- Is he here? Have you been down?
- No, he left. He left. He called my dad.

918
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,787
What are you doing?

919
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,644
Stan, what's going on in there?

920
01:10:05,316 --> 01:10:06,564
What did he do to you?

921
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,472
No. No.

922
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:12,073
Get behind the bed. Get...

923
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,910
Sit.

924
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:36,064
You move, you die. All right?

925
01:10:51,572 --> 01:10:52,596
Shit.

926
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,118
Amy!

927
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:04,992
I had a rough day at work today.

928
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,032
I could use something to relax me.

929
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,938
I bet you know just what it is.

930
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:33,454
No, don't! Stop!

931
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,892
Stop it!

932
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,458
No!

933
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,562
No! Don't!

934
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,320
That was dumb, Detective.

935
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,228
Oh, no.

936
01:12:29,277 --> 01:12:31,199
Oh, no.

937
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,283
You fucker!

938
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,860
What's wrong?

939
01:12:56,065 --> 01:12:57,885
It's not that bad.

940
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:01,474
Shit!

941
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,653
You're gonna pay for that.

942
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:22,298
<i>I've pulled my gun three
times in the line of duty,</i>

943
01:13:23,451 --> 01:13:25,423
<i>with mixed results.</i>

944
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:27,969
<i>One.</i>

945
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,239
<i>Two.</i>

946
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,415
<i>The third is really the
story of my career.</i>

947
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,583
<i>It all starts with a call.</i>

948
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:44,521
<i>And a strange one this time,
a guy named Fisher.</i>

949
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:46,956
<i>He works at this trailer
storage facility.</i>

950
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:51,194
<i>Now it seems last month his phone
bill goes up 700%. No clue why.</i>

951
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:54,866
It's not 3,700 cents.
It's 3,700 fuckin' dollars!

952
01:13:54,966 --> 01:13:57,074
- Okay.
- It's a fucking phone bill!

953
01:13:57,174 --> 01:13:59,369
It's not a fucking mortgage payment,
for Christ's sake!

954
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:02,939
<i>And all of a sudden, he's billed for seven
lines and hundreds of international calls.</i>

955
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,307
<i>First, he thinks it's Johnson,</i>

956
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:07,343
<i>a manager who works there,
runnin' up some phone sex numbers.</i>

957
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,481
<i>But the calls are there whether Johnson
is or not. Phone company won't help him.</i>

958
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:14,684
<i>They say they have invoices,
invoices with his signature,</i>

959
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:19,556
<i>and the signature looked good.</i>
<i>It matched. Fisher swears it's not his.</i>

960
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,557
<i>I told him I'd look around.</i>

961
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:25,595
<i>Might be some kids tying into the
line somewhere and messing around.</i>

962
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:28,565
<i>Anyway, it beats sitting in the car.</i>

963
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:31,601
<i>Quiet night. It's nice out.</i>

964
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,569
<i>Good night for a walk.</i>

965
01:14:34,026 --> 01:14:35,492
<i>Full moon.</i>

966
01:14:35,592 --> 01:14:37,841
<i>And something struck me.
I don't know what.</i>

967
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:41,578
<i>But I wondered what things would look like
from the top of those cars looking down.</i>

968
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:44,178
<i>I just decided to go for a climb.</i>

969
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,418
<i>I've replayed that night
thousands of times.</i>

970
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:52,535
<i>It was the turning point in my career.
And the truth was...</i>

971
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,934
<i>it was all luck.</i>

972
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,033
<i>Some people work to get where they are.</i>

973
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,373
- <i>Some people marry into it.</i>
- Fuck.

974
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:14,108
<i>And I got here by climbing up a bunch
of train cars to look at the moon.</i>

975
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,781
Jesus!

976
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:09,966
<i>I can't describe what I saw that night.</i>

977
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,670
<i>I would never have thought the
things there were even possible.</i>

978
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,124
<i>When I close my eyes,
the pictures are still there,</i>

979
01:16:17,224 --> 01:16:19,224
<i>haunting me.</i>

980
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,187
Fuck.

981
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,617
This is good. Real good.

982
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:03,318
Police! Freeze!

983
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,031
<i>Terrence Alby.</i>

984
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,867
<i>I had just shot Terrence Alby.</i>

985
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:21,437
<i>Never had fired a gun
at a person until then.</i>

986
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,206
<i>And I killed him.</i>

987
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:26,709
<i>They called me a hero.
They made me a detective.</i>

988
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:29,312
<i>But I really had nothing to do with it.</i>

989
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:32,813
<i>I was just lucky.
I wanted to see the moon.</i>

990
01:17:35,383 --> 01:17:37,420
<i>Three times I pulled my gun.</i>

991
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,222
<i>But I had never, ever,
shot and killed an innocent man.</i>

992
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:46,127
<i>Until today.</i>

993
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:23,597
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

994
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:30,271
Don't get up, you lazy fucking bastard.

995
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:36,476
If you wanted to lose weight,
you should've just quit drinking.

996
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,283
All right. You're gonna be fine.

997
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,750
Let's just get some back up and
get you the fuck out of here.

998
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:48,022
Goddamn it. I knew something was wrong.

999
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,157
Fucking guy.

1000
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,163
Can I help you?

1001
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:57,800
Yeah, Detective Calabrese, Warsaw PD.

1002
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,737
we're going door-to-door
in the neighborhood.

1003
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:05,241
Well, it's not much of a neighborhood.
The next house is three miles.

1004
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:06,507
You okay there?

1005
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:12,148
Oh, yeah. I just have a cold.
Still contagious.

1006
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:18,154
We... We had a detective go missing
a couple of weeks ago. Jeter?

1007
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:21,357
Yeah, yeah.
I've been following the story.

1008
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:22,658
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1009
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:26,229
He was working in the area, on call.

1010
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,135
Well, I haven't seen anything here.

1011
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:36,472
No cars? No suspicious people?

1012
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,941
Nobody coming to the
door you didn't know?

1013
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,474
You mean, besides you?

1014
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:46,649
Yeah, well, thanks for
your time, Mister...

1015
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,618
James.

1016
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:50,918
You mind if I come in?

1017
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,354
Why?

1018
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,359
- Just a routine check.
- You got a routine warrant?

1019
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,228
Do I need to get one?

1020
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,367
Nope.

1021
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:14,010
Hey, do you have a partner
in that car outside?

1022
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,860
Why?

1023
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,713
Well, I was gonna put on a pot of coffee.
Wanted to know how many cups to make.

1024
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,618
Nope. Just me.

1025
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,688
Please, come in.

1026
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:43,239
We got a 911 call about a week ago.

1027
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:47,641
- 911. Please state your emergency.
<i>- When the operator picked up the call,</i>

1028
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,380
<i>- there was nobody there.</i>
- Hello?

1029
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,684
- So is that unusual?
- Not really.

1030
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,454
But... when she went to end the call,
she missed the button.

1031
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:04,190
She was... deeply immersed in an
article about the Kardashians.

1032
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:11,734
Anyway, she didn't realize that
the call was still connected.

1033
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:15,938
Hello? Sir?

1034
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,722
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- <i>So what happened?</i>

1035
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:24,678
Well, finally the call ended.

1036
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,215
But not the story.

1037
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,720
No, not the story.

1038
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:39,862
We traced the call.
I mean, it was a partial trace.

1039
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:42,898
Strangely enough, that call was made
from somewhere in this neighborhood.

1040
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:47,136
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

1041
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:53,080
And then, cops came out
here about a week ago,

1042
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:57,244
do a little follow-up work.
One of 'em never came back.

1043
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:01,884
So that's two down, somewhere out here.

1044
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:03,679
Yeah.

1045
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,655
Jeter, somewhere out here.

1046
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:15,829
And... that call from
somewhere out here.

1047
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:22,575
And then another cop goes missing
from somewhere out here.

1048
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,572
There's just so many questions.

1049
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,912
Anyway, I figured I should
probably check it out and...

1050
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:48,364
Goddamn cell phones.
You can never get a fucking signal.

1051
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,097
Is he dead?

1052
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:53,335
Who?

1053
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,606
The man. Is he dead?

1054
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,709
<i>No, no. No, he's still alive.</i>

1055
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:02,111
<i>But I tagged him pretty good.
He's not going anywhere.</i>

1056
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,925
- What did you use?
- Fuck!

1057
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,417
What?

1058
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:11,020
- I used my .45.
- No. To keep him there. What did you use?

1059
01:23:11,475 --> 01:23:12,519
Handcuffs.

1060
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:28,361
<i>Never, ever, in my wildest dreams.</i>

1061
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:32,008
<i>This is not how it's supposed to happen.
I-If I would have said something.</i>

1062
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:36,312
<i>Anything. I knew in my heart the cuffs
weren't enough. I was just too slow.</i>

1063
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:38,178
<i>Too damn slow.</i>

1064
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,783
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

1065
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:53,362
- Shit!
- You bastard!

1066
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:54,663
Fuck!

1067
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,597
You... No!

1068
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,501
Do it!

1069
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,414
Fellas, read 'em and weep.

1070
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:14,316
- Oh, fuck me.
- Goddamn it.

1071
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,286
Full house. Aces wild. You called it.

1072
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:21,121
Hang on, hang on. We ain't
seen what the kid's got yet.

1073
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:23,490
You mind, kid?

1074
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,529
Deuce.

1075
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:32,866
Another deuce.

1076
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,870
No help there.

1077
01:24:38,772 --> 01:24:39,973
Oh, shit.

1078
01:24:42,076 --> 01:24:43,946
The plot thickens.

1079
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,248
And...

1080
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,564
No!

1081
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:53,289
- Come on!
- Oh, man! Damn!

1082
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:56,492
- Kid beat you with four twos.
- Twos? What the fuck? Who was dealing?

1083
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,792
Holy shit.

1084
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,794
You know what this means?

1085
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,367
What?

1086
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,805
You get to ask the questions, kid.

1087
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:13,042
This is insane.

1088
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,410
You're dead, for Christ sakes.

1089
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,883
- You too, Maxwell.
- Yeah, they're both dead.

1090
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,619
What we want to know is,
did they die for nothing?

1091
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:24,986
No, you don't know.

1092
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,491
You weren't trapped in this
fucking room for weeks.

1093
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,846
You sit there and-and
you smoke your cigarette

1094
01:25:31,946 --> 01:25:35,429
and you tell me these stories,
but how the fuck are those gonna help me?

1095
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:41,203
I have done everything I can. I can't
get out if I'm stuck to the fucking wall!

1096
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:45,708
Take it one step at a time, Jeter.

1097
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,608
One step.

1098
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,813
You gotta rescue my daughter.

1099
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:55,549
You put this motherfucker in the ground.
Put a stake in his fucking heart.

1100
01:25:57,351 --> 01:25:59,722
Whatever you do, do not give up.

1101
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:03,559
Hey, you are in a fight.
So fucking fight.

1102
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,729
I just... I just gotta...
I just want this to stop.

1103
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:08,697
Come on, kid. Figure it out.
You got all the clues.

1104
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:10,366
You just got to string them together.

1105
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:12,701
What the fuck are you
talking about, clues?

1106
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:16,138
The guy, he comes in here and drugs
me and beats the shit out of me.

1107
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:18,105
Think about it.

1108
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:22,111
He grabbed Amy to get to you.

1109
01:26:22,211 --> 01:26:25,412
She disappeared two weeks
before you did. He had a plan.

1110
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,318
<i>This place, middle of nowhere.</i>

1111
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:34,456
<i>The rooms in the basement... that took
a lot of work. It's no random accident.</i>

1112
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,694
<i>Come on. He set this up for you.
You're the one he wants.</i>

1113
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:40,162
Just stop it. Please, just...
Just stop it.

1114
01:26:40,262 --> 01:26:42,531
He could have killed you right away.
But he didn't, all right?

1115
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:45,568
So think about it.
Why did he let you live?

1116
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,903
He's trying to tell you something.

1117
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,573
- He wants you to figure it out.
- I can't do this.

1118
01:26:50,673 --> 01:26:52,406
Yes, you can!

1119
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,544
Now you think about it.

1120
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:58,780
What's the key? He said you
already knew what it was.

1121
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,582
How am I supposed to find the key
when I don't know who this guy is?

1122
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:13,160
- The mentor.
- There you go.

1123
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:42,544
<i>I had no idea who he was.</i>

1124
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,279
<i>Without the mask, he was simply no one.</i>

1125
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,261
Now tell me. Tell me why this? Why me?

1126
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,530
What? Because of Alby?
Because I killed your mentor?

1127
01:30:02,358 --> 01:30:06,009
Very good, Detective.
I knew if I spelled it out for you,

1128
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:08,303
you'd catch on eventually.

1129
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,806
Just took longer than I anticipated.

1130
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,440
Yeah, but why all this, you sick fuck?

1131
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:17,978
Because in that train
car was my life's work.

1132
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,585
<i>I did it all for him. To please him.</i>

1133
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,554
<i>I was shipping that
car out the next day.</i>

1134
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:30,325
<i>Moving on to California where they really
appreciate people in my profession.</i>

1135
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:35,264
<i>I wanted him to see it before I left.</i>
<i>To show him that I was a man.</i>

1136
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:37,533
<i>You robbed me of that.</i>

1137
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:41,637
<i>All my crimes, wiped away,
assigned to a corpse.</i>

1138
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:44,104
<i>The corpse of a man I
surpassed in every way.</i>

1139
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,110
<i>I had a rough time after that.</i>

1140
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:51,246
<i>I couldn't get out of bed.
I wouldn't take my calls.</i>

1141
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:52,746
Go away!

1142
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,952
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

1143
01:30:57,052 --> 01:31:02,424
<i>My friends, they took me out,
tried to introduce me to girls.</i>

1144
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:04,894
He's in the back, right there.

1145
01:31:05,394 --> 01:31:07,396
He sure is nice.

1146
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:10,035
- Is your mom around?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

1147
01:31:10,135 --> 01:31:10,995
No?

1148
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,001
<i>And then it comes to me.</i>

1149
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:18,140
<i>I needed to go back to the beginning.</i>

1150
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,576
<i>When things were
more simple, more clearer.</i>

1151
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,345
<i>My goal statement.</i>

1152
01:31:32,518 --> 01:31:34,620
<i>Now let me think.</i>

1153
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,826
<i>Who stands in my way? Oh, yeah.</i>

1154
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,100
<i>Detective Stan Jeter.</i>

1155
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,204
<i>The man who stole my
greatest moment of triumph.</i>

1156
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:51,705
<i>Now that man had to pay.</i>

1157
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:06,155
Well, bravo, Detective.

1158
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:08,888
You have all the answers.

1159
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,727
Too bad you don't have much time left.

1160
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:13,395
What are you talking about?

1161
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:16,863
You didn't think I could take care
of this all by myself, did you?

1162
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:23,469
Oh, no. Too many loose ends for one man.

1163
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,012
I have my own apprentice now.

1164
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:34,280
And he should be here any minute.

1165
01:32:44,335 --> 01:32:45,325
Amy?

1166
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,363
Amy, can you hear me?

1167
01:32:54,301 --> 01:32:57,303
Amy. Amy. Oh, Amy.

1168
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:00,273
Oh, shit.

1169
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:09,797
Amy, wake up. Amy. Amy, wake up.

1170
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:12,820
Come on.

1171
01:33:13,722 --> 01:33:16,766
- Okay.
- We're getting out of here.

1172
01:34:02,477 --> 01:34:04,100
<i>Stop it!</i>

1173
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,879
<i>No! Stop!</i>

1174
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:12,745
I'm in here!

1175
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:23,225
No surrender! Let's move in!

1176
01:34:23,425 --> 01:34:25,927
- Police, I need help!
- Drop the weapon!

1177
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,930
Guys, I said I need help!

1178
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,133
Somebody help! Keep Amy breathing!

1179
01:34:31,233 --> 01:34:33,900
- Drop your weapon!
- No, he's in the basement!

1180
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,924
<i>So that was my story.</i>

1181
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:58,794
<i>Wish I could say it had a happy ending.</i>

1182
01:34:58,894 --> 01:35:01,396
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>

1183
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,633
<i>In the end, I don't
know if they mean shit.</i>

1184
01:35:04,733 --> 01:35:06,968
<i>Because he was right.</i>

1185
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:10,136
<i>People see what they want to see.</i>

1186
01:35:14,074 --> 01:35:16,478
- So that's it?
- Pretty much.

1187
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:18,580
Hard to argue with that
much physical evidence.

1188
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,017
Three dead cops, two killed
with bullets from my gun.

1189
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,150
Kind of hard to talk your
way out of that one.

1190
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:32,859
And the kiddy porn thing.
Juries don't really like that.

1191
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:38,867
Hey, what's he doing?

1192
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:41,734
But you claim you're innocent.

1193
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,440
And this mysterious kidnapper?

1194
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:49,211
The guy who supposedly kept you
in the basement the whole time?

1195
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:50,910
What about him?

1196
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:00,873
He was gone.

1197
01:36:01,273 --> 01:36:05,632
And how would you respond to
those who say you made him up?

1198
01:36:06,027 --> 01:36:09,464
Well, it doesn't really
matter much now, does it?

1199
01:36:09,664 --> 01:36:11,132
Amy Maxwell?

1200
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:13,969
Coma, three months.

1201
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:15,704
Time's up.

1202
01:36:16,004 --> 01:36:18,137
- I have a few more questions.
- Time's up.

1203
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,814
<i>He was still out there.</i>

1204
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,083
<i>And no one knew him better than me.</i>

1205
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:31,351
<i>How he operates, what he's capable of.</i>

1206
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,857
<i>I wasn't done, not by a long shot.</i>

1207
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,226
<i>One day, I'll be free.</i>

1208
01:36:38,326 --> 01:36:41,461
<i>And then I'm gonna do to
him what he did to me.</i>

1209
01:36:48,669 --> 01:36:50,336
<i>And then it all changed.</i>

1210
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,579
<i>Amy was awake.</i>

1211
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:00,442
<i>And talking.</i>

1212
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:05,854
<i>The evidence against me took on
a new light, and it didn't hold up.</i>

1213
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:08,557
<i>Now getting free was just the beginning.</i>

1214
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:11,660
<i>I thought back to all that I
learned that first night of poker.</i>

1215
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,596
<i>Then, they were just stories,
but now they were my guides.</i>

1216
01:37:14,696 --> 01:37:18,166
<i>A map that would lead me to
the end of my journey, to him.</i>

1217
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,969
<i>I was using my brain
and following my heart.</i>

1218
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,904
<i>Lots of false leads and wrong turns,</i>

1219
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:26,441
<i>but I knew I was getting closer,
patiently moving forward.</i>

1220
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,277
<i>I knew this guy better than anyone else.</i>

1221
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:31,379
<i>I knew how he thought,
what he was looking for.</i>

1222
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:34,914
<i>I knew his reasons. And that
meant I could catch him.</i>

1223
01:37:52,065 --> 01:37:55,568
And I heard this little girl screaming.
So I went over to see what was happening.

1224
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:00,506
- How does that look?
- Oh, yeah, that was def...

1225
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:41,850
So... So, that's it. He got him?

1226
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,586
He's a cop. That's what he does.

1227
01:38:44,886 --> 01:38:47,355
One shot, right through the heart.

1228
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:49,324
And I say, rot in peace.

1229
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:53,094
We lost two of our best to that bastard.

1230
01:38:53,194 --> 01:38:55,628
There's only one choice there.

1231
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:58,266
That's your captain.

1232
01:38:58,366 --> 01:39:02,203
Pride of the department.
He got two fucking parades for that.

1233
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:05,738
Got more balls than he does brains, man.

1234
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,076
Hey, that's my kind of cop.

1235
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:09,878
Who's your kind of cop?

1236
01:39:09,978 --> 01:39:11,112
- Hey!
- Not you.

1237
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:13,348
Finally. Come on, you're late. Sit down.

1238
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,418
- What, you don't wear a watch?
- There it is.

1239
01:39:16,518 --> 01:39:19,020
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get the game on.

1240
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,219
Go. Salud.

1241
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:25,961
They always like this, Captain?

1242
01:39:26,361 --> 01:39:28,063
Always. I told you it
was gonna be like this.

1243
01:39:28,163 --> 01:39:30,131
Don't listen to a word he tells you.

1244
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:33,001
This guy was crapping his pants
worse than you his first night.

1245
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:35,236
Couldn't play cards.
Couldn't tell stories.

1246
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:38,014
Same then as he is now. Uno, baby.

1247
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,176
Stop jawing. Start dealing.
Let's play some fucking cards.

1248
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:43,078
You done bitching?

1249
01:39:43,178 --> 01:39:46,748
All right. Here we go.
Five card stud, no wilds.

1250
01:39:48,455 --> 01:39:50,652
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>

1251
01:39:50,752 --> 01:39:53,521
<i>In the end, that was the
purpose of poker night.</i>

1252
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:56,396
<i>To teach the next guy a
lesson from your mistakes.</i>

1253
01:40:09,369 --> 01:40:14,109
<i>We deal with three percent of
the population 97% of the time.</i>

1254
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:17,510
<i>And they all think they're
smarter than you. They're not.</i>

1255
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:25,284
<i>Except for the ones who actually are.</i>

1256
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:31,194
<i>We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend they don't exist.</i>

1257
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:33,893
<i>There are some lessons...</i>

1258
01:40:33,895 --> 01:40:36,295
<i>you just have to learn on your own.</i>
