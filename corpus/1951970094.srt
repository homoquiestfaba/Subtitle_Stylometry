00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
THAT THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONNA
BLOW UP ANYWAY, SO WE SHOULD
JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

469
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:40,334
THAT'S CRAZY.
I KNOW.

470
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,467
THIS WRITER IN NEW YORK
THAT HARVEY SENT HIS POEMS TO...

471
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,334
SAID THAT HARVEY WAS AN
EXAMPLE OF A COMPLETE PRIMITIVE.

472
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,767
I COULD'VE TOLD HIM THAT.

473
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:54,467
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
SET THE MISSILES OFF.

474
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:57,968
<i>KENNEDY AND KHRUSHCHEV</i>
<i>ARE PROBABLY WORKING THIS</i>
<i>WHOLE THING OUT RIGHT NOW.</i>

475
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:02,868
<i>IT'S ON THIS HIGH LEVEL.</i>
<i>[Sherry] IT MAKES MORE SENSE</i>
<i>WHEN YOU EXPLAIN IT, STAN.</i>

476
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:07,133
WE'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME
ON SATURDAY.
ONE THING I THOUGHT WE MIGHT DO,

477
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,234
THEY'RE SHOWING THIS MOVIE
AT THE STRAND WHERE THIS GUY --
THAT SOUNDS NICE, STAN.

478
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,133
BUT IN MALLORY SQUARE
THEY'RE HAVING A SPECIAL
EXHIBIT ON CORAL,

479
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,367
LITTLE ANIMALS AND THINGS
PEOPLE MAKE OUT OF IT.

480
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,367
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
OKAY.

481
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:23,501
SO, I'LL SEE YOU THERE
ABOUT 1:00.
ALL RIGHT.

482
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:28,300
<i>* AH-OOH</i>
<i>WAIT AND SEE *</i>

483
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:32,133
<i>* MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND</i>
<i>YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE *</i>

484
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,534
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>

485
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,801
[Sigh]
HI.

486
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:51,367
HELLO.
UH,
MY NAME'S GENE.

487
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:55,000
I SAW YOU IN THAT
AIR RAID DRILL YESTERDAY.

488
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,234
YEAH, THE WHOLE WORLD DID.

489
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,734
WHAT DID THEY DO
TO YOU?
DETENTION FOR A WEEK.

490
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,834
WOW!

491
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,968
THEY PUT GANDHI AWAY
FOR A YEAR.

492
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:12,534
I DON'T KNOW
THAT MANY PEOPLE HERE.
UH-HUH.

493
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:22,400
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS
BY THE TETHERBALL, ARE YOU?

494
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,767
NO, I JUST
MET THEM.

495
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,934
I MEAN, I JUST
MOVED HERE THIS YEAR.

496
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,868
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE.
YOU HAVEN'T MISSED MUCH.

497
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,501
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE
SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT HERE.

498
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:38,634
[Sigh]
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST
WONDERFUL PLACE ON EARTH.

499
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:44,000
THE BEAUTIFUL CORAL REEF!
THE BEAUTIFUL HIBISCUS FLOWER!
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

500
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:47,534
IF IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL PLACE,
HOW COME THE NEGRO KIDS HAVE
TO GO TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL?

501
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:51,200
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS THEY DO THAT --

502
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:54,100
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE,

503
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,601
NEITHER ARE THE RUSSIANS.

504
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,000
IF THEY'RE NOT REAL,
JUST GO AHEAD AND KILL THEM,
SEND IN THE NAVY.

505
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:05,000
MY DAD DOESN'T WANT
TO KILL ANYONE.

506
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,667
WHO'S YOUR DAD?
HE'S ON ONE OF
THOSE SHIPS...

507
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,534
OVER BY CUBA.

508
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:19,534
[Sigh]
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T --
THAT'S OKAY.

509
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,033
YOU MUST BE
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

510
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,801
WELL, I HOPE
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

511
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:31,501
THANKS.

512
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,634
** [Humming]

513
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,601
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

514
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:46,100
I'M NOT MAD.
I JUST WANNA KNOW YOUR NAME.

515
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:50,000
STAN.
STAN, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE ME SOME ANSWERS.

516
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,701
IF YOU DON'T, THEN I'M
GONNA HAVE TO HURT YA!

517
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,767
WHAT'S THAT
GONNA SOLVE?

518
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,167
IT'S NOT GONNA SOLVE
ANYTHING,

519
00:34:57,234 --> 00:35:00,868
JUST MORE PAIN.

520
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:04,334
ANSWERS?
ABOUT YOURSELF AND SHERRY.
YOU GOIN' OUT WITH HER?

521
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,601
WELL, WE WERE GONNA LOOK
AT SOME CORAL ON SATURDAY.

522
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,834
CORAL?

523
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:15,701
SHE LIKES CORAL.

524
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,934
ALL THOSE LITTLE ANIMALS
GIVIN' UP THEIR BODIES TO MAKE
SOMETHIN' PINK FOR SHERRY.

525
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,901
[Sigh]

526
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:25,300
YOU CAN'T DO IT, STAN.

527
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,667
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITH HER.

528
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,501
AND YOU CAN'T TELL HER
WE HAD THIS LITTLE TALK...

529
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:33,968
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT
THINGS LIKE THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN,

530
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,300
IT'S CRAZY, YOU KNOW?

531
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,167
WELL, UH, MAYBE IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO HAPPEN.

532
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:44,267
NO, STAN, IT DOES.

533
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,634
IT'S LIKE I ONCE WROTE
IN A POEM:

534
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,901
DESTINY...

535
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:58,934
IT'S LIKE A CRAZY RIVER...

536
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,634
WHERE YOU SEE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S BOATS...

537
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:08,467
THAT THEY HAVE
GOING BY ON IT.

538
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,033
BUT TOMORROW,

539
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,334
TOMORROW'S A KNIFE.

540
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,934
TOMORROW'S A BIG KNIFE.

541
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,167
YOU GET IT?
UH... SORT OF.

542
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:25,634
IT'S ABSTRACT, STAN.

543
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,534
[Sigh]

544
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,133
MR. WOOLSEY?
HELLO, SON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

545
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,467
COMIN' TO THE SHOW
SATURDAY?
SURE.

546
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,701
I WAS HERE THE OTHER NIGHT
WHEN YOU GOT HERE.
UH-HUH.

547
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,834
YOU KNOW THOSE TWO GUYS
WHO WERE YELLING AT YOU
ABOUT YOUR MOVIE?

548
00:36:55,901 --> 00:37:00,834
OH, YEAH. WE GET SOME OF
THOSE PEOPLE IN EVERY TOWN.

549
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:04,934
SOMETIMES IT'S A CHURCH GROUP,
SOMETIMES THE P.T.A.

550
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,901
THEY MEAN WELL, BUT --
ONE OF THOSE GUYS
WAS HERB DENNING.

551
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:11,901
HE WAS IN
"THE BRAIN LEECHES."

552
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:17,100
HE PLAYED THE THIRD MAN
AT LUNCH COUNTER.
MMM.

553
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,234
JUST CRUISE IT
AROUND TOWN FOR A FEW HOURS:

554
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,234
SCHOOLS, NAVY BASE.

555
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,734
YOU SEE, SON,

556
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,167
HERB TURNED AGAINST ME.

557
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:33,934
OKAY, HE DIDN'T TURN AGAINST ME.
HE'S STILL WORKING FOR ME.

558
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,133
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
GENE LOOMIS.

559
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,234
YOU'RE VERY OBSERVANT, GENE.
THAT'S A GOOD HABIT.

560
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,267
HI, HOW YA DOIN'?
SATURDAY NIGHT, RIGHT HERE.

561
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:43,067
BIG SHOW.
DON'T MISS IT.

562
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:47,767
HERB'S AN INTERESTING GUY.
HE USED TO BE KIND OF, UH,

563
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,634
WELL, DISHONEST:
SHAKEDOWN ARTIST, STRONG ARM.

564
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:55,467
SOMEONE SENT HIM TO COLLECT
MONEY FROM ME JUST WHEN
I NEEDED AN INEXPENSIVE ACTOR.

565
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,267
ISN'T IT FUN
TO KNOW THESE THINGS
ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE STARS?

566
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,534
<i>HE'S PRETTY GOOD.</i>
BOB'S EVEN BETTER.
THAT OTHER GUY?

567
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:05,167
BUT HE GOT HIMSELF ON THE
STUPID BLACKLIST. THAT'S
WHY HE'S WORKIN' FOR ME.

568
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:09,367
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD.
IT'S JUST HARD TO GET PEOPLE
AROUND HERE STIRRED UP.

569
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:11,667
COULD BE THIS
BOMB BUSINESS.

570
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:14,767
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYONE
THOSE GUYS WORK FOR YOU.

571
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,868
YOU WANT A PASS
FOR THE SHOW SATURDAY?
I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE.

572
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:20,267
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
TO HELP YOU OUT.

573
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:22,767
YOU MUST HAVE
A LOT TO DO.
[Sigh]

574
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:26,601
OKAY, YOU'RE WITH THE SHOW
FOR AN HOUR.
<i>THERE YOU ARE.</i>

575
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,968
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
IT'S A SECRET.
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

576
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,968
I ALREADY AM.
RIGHT!

577
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:34,167
<i>THESE ARE A LITTLE SURPRISE</i>
<i>FOR THE AUDIENCE RIGGED</i>
<i>TO THE SEAT CUSHION.</i>

578
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:37,033
FEEL THAT.
[Electrical Currents
Crackling]

579
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,434
AAH!
GIVING IT TO THE PEOPLE
RIGHT WHERE THEY NEED IT MOST.

580
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,167
COOL.
<i>MR. WOOLSEY,</i>

581
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:45,300
THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
THAT'S GOING ON.

582
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,968
IF YOU START
VIBRATING THE THEATER
AND SCARING PEOPLE --

583
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:52,801
WHAT IS THAT?
CONELRAD, THE
CIVIL DEFENSE CHANNEL.

584
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:55,534
THEY'RE TIED STRAIGHT IN TO
THE DISTANT EARLY WARNING.
IF THERE'S AN ATTACK,

585
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,400
THEY WILL BROADCAST ON THIS
WAVELENGTH A FULL 90 SECONDS
BEFORE WE HAVE LOCAL SIRENS.

586
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:03,534
I REALLY WISH YOU'D --
ANYWAY, YOU SEE
WHAT I'M SAYING.

587
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,400
THE COUNTRY IS ON RED ALERT.
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SCARED.

588
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:10,634
EXACTLY!
WHAT A PERFECT TIME TO OPEN
A NEW HORROR MOVIE.

589
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:13,400
THINK OF IT, MY FRIEND.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE...

590
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:17,133
LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER
WAITING FOR GOD'S
OTHER SHOE TO DROP,

591
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,167
NEVER KNOWING IF EACH KISS,
EACH SUNSET,

592
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,667
<i>[Crunch]</i>
EACH MALTED MILK BALL
MIGHT BE THEIR LAST.

593
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:26,801
PLEASE.

594
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,234
WE'RE HALFWAY HOME.

595
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,434
WE'LL FILL THIS PLACE.
WHAT'S CAPACITY HERE?

596
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:36,367
FIVE HUNDRED DOWN HERE AND
A HUNDRED IN THE BALCONY.
THAT'S ALL FOR THE BALCONY?

597
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:40,200
SAFETY RESTRICTIONS,
TERMITES, THE TROPICS.
WHATEVER, WE'LL FILL IT.

598
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,467
THE YOKELS
ARE ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

599
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:45,133
MR. WOOLSEY,
PEOPLE IN KEY WEST
ARE NOT YOKELS.

600
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,567
THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH IT.

601
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:52,334
I'M GLAD
YOU SPOKE UP.

602
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,367
WHAT A JERK!
OH, I KINDA LIKE HIM.

603
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,868
YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND
A HARDWARE STORE?
YEAH, I'LL SHOW YA.

604
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,434
I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY'D
RECOGNIZE HERB.

605
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,467
YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE
SITTIN' IN MONSTER MOVIES?
A LOT, YEAH.

606
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:11,567
SOMEBODY LIKE HERB
OR VINCENT PRICE,

607
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:14,868
IT'S LIKE
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.
THAT'S A STRANGE GROUP.

608
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:18,234
WHAT ARE YOUR
REAL FRIENDS LIKE?
I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY.

609
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,033
MY DAD'S IN THE NAVY,
SO WE MOVE ALL THE TIME.

610
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,167
OH, MAN! FIVE HUNDRED
NEW KIDS A YEAR?
THAT'S SCARY.

611
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:29,234
ONE TIME WE MOVED.
THIS WAS TO THE BIG TOWN,
HATFIELD, MISSOURI.

612
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,567
I WAS PETRIFIED
OF THOSE GUYS.

613
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:35,367
REALLY?
OH, YEAH.

614
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,934
BUT SEE, NOW I GET
MY REVENGE.

615
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,234
I GET TO SCARE EVERYBODY ELSE,
BUT IT'S FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.

616
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,100
PEOPLE GO LIKE THIS
AT THE SCARY PARTS.

617
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,534
THEY'RE NOT GETTIN' THE
WHOLE BENEFIT. YOU GOTTA
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

618
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:51,334
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT?
OKAY, LIKE, UH...

619
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,968
A ZILLION YEARS AGO
A GUY'S LIVIN' IN A CAVE.

620
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:57,000
HE GOES OUT ONE DAY. BAM!
HE GETS CHASED BY A MAMMOTH.

621
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,400
HE'S SCARED TO DEATH
BUT HE GETS AWAY.

622
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,634
WHEN IT'S ALL OVER WITH,
HE FEELS GREAT.

623
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:04,000
YEAH, 'CAUSE
HE'S STILL LIVING.
BUT HE KNOWS HE IS,

624
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:06,000
AND HE FEELS IT.

625
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:10,267
SO HE GOES HOME,
BACK TO THE CAVE,
FIRST THING HE DOES,

626
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,767
HE DOES A DRAWING
OF THE MAMMOTH.

627
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,767
AND HE THINKS...

628
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,734

00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:35,234
THE FIRST MONSTER MOVIE.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I STILL DO IT.

634
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,501
MAKE THE TEETH
AS BIG AS YOU WANT,
THEN KILL IT OFF.

00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:19,267
AND THEIR HEARTS ARE GOING
LIKE TRAPPED ANIMALS

SOME OF IT'S

BACK HERE BEHIND THE SCREEN.

778
