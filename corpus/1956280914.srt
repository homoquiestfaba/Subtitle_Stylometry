[sighs] All right, kid.

179
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,415
Just you and me now.

180
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,587
[music playing]

181
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:56,364
Give me a swizzle.

182
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,333
You know, Dill, there's an Indian
woman up by Mace's boatyard

183
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:02,736
who says she can
adjust people's luck.

184
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,603
She got that Argentinian couple
a baby.

185
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,873
Well,
I don't need a baby, Jack.

186
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,675
You need something, man.

187
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:11,078
Yeah, I need a drink.
I thought we'd established that.

188
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,583
Percentages are not science.
You can't tell the future from the past.

189
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:20,087
You need instinct.
And I hear you just lost that.

190
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:24,793
Duke was in here
about half an hour ago.

191
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,130
Says he's available
for the morning shift.

192
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,297
Hmm.

193
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,467
Doctor Bob was in here drinking.
Said he heard about the knife.

194
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,704
Said maybe you should go and see him,
talk to him about your state of mind.

195
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:40,340
Was that before or after
his third tequila?

196
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,178
Yeah, you and I joke about that,
but some of the guys are concerned.

197
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,516
- [sighs]
- There's money in fishing swordfish at night.

198
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:51,853
No asshole tourists on board.
Lionel pays for grunts and flatfish, too.

199
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,523
I fish tuna.

200
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,558
You fish for one tuna, man.

201
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,094
And that's a tuna
that's only in your head.

202
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,237
I'll get that.

203
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,142
[gulps]

204
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,215
Good to see you, John.

205
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,551
I'll have
a sparkling water, too.

206
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,454
Ice and lemon?

207
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,489
Why not?

208
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,560
So...

209
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:33,629
what do you say?

210
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,533
I say
I'm not called John anymore.

211
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,302
Fate's funny, huh?

212
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:43,539
Okay, Karen, I don't believe
in coincidence.

213
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,273
Neither do I.

214
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,179
Welcome to Plymouth, ma'am.

215
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,213
[exhales]

216
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,217
Do you have a place here?
Maybe we can go to dinner?

217
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,854
Only place is the Rope,
and you're in it.

218
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,287
I'd like to talk to you
someplace private.

219
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,525
I'd like to know what the fuck you're
doing out here on the edge of nowhere.

220
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:09,231
I came to tell you you
were right and I was wrong.

221
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,804
[laughs]

222
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:19,375
Fuck.

223
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,813
I hear you have a boat.

224
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:25,948
[door closes]

225
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,484
[Karen] You own this boat?

226
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:31,788
[Dill] Well, me and the bank.
We take turns.

227
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,793
This is about as private
as it gets.

228
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,662
How did you find me
and what do you want?

229
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,031
Back in the real world,
they got this thing called Facebook.

230
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,734
- You ever heard of it?
- No.

231
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,802
Well, when I decided
to track you down,

232
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,572
I reached out to some
of the guys from school.

233
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,675
You remember Dotey?
The relentless one?

234
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,545
Well, she put together a class
reunion a couple of years ago.

235
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:57,881
The only two who didn't show
were you and me.

236
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,483
Nobody knew where you were.

237
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,656
Everybody knew about Iraq
and the medals.

238
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,926
So, little Greg
had gone fishing on this boat

239
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:14,965
on some island in the middle of
nowhere and he had caught a fish,

240
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,632
and had his photo taken with it.

241
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,771
And he said that there was this guy in
the shot who looked just like John Mason.

242
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,507
Only he said
the guy was calling himself...

243
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,009
Baker Dill.

244
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,011
Was it a big fish?

245
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,712
Excuse me?

246
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,281
If he had his photo taken,
it must have been a big fish.

247
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:35,686
So I tracked down the photo.

248
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,819
Couldn't tell if it was you
standing there or not,

249
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,257
but the name gave it away,
Baker Dill.

250
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,594
Dillon Baker was the only
teacher you respected at Morgan.

251
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:44,828
He taught math, right?

252
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:48,432
You still haven't told me
what you want.

253
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,001
I figured if you were using an
assumed name, you were on the run.

254
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,806
I'm just waiting on some things back
home to lose their significance.

255
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,909
I thought you being
outside the law would be okay.

256
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:00,744
In fact, it would be good.

257
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,348
'Cause like I say...

258
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,852
you were right and I was wrong.

259
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:10,955
About Frank.

260
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:15,960
He got richer and bigger

261
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,863
and drunker and angrier.

262
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,396
Hands turned to fists.

263
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:22,733
So get a divorce.

264
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,402
Except I guess you can't.

265
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:26,971
No, I can't.

266
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:33,377
He's even more connected than he was.
Cubans out of Miami.

267
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,745
If I tried to leave,
he'd find a hole for me

268
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:39,383
in one of his construction sites.
That's the truth.

269
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,085
[grunts]

270
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:45,056
I didn't come here
thinking you might forgive me.

271
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:47,391
Look, he's violent
with you, right?

272
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,533
Different kinds.

273
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,166
[breathes heavily]

274
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:58,736
He's refined it lately.

275
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:02,106
And how's my son
with that, Karen?

276
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,744
How's my son
with this refinement?

277
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,950
He hides away.

278
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:14,884
- [Frank] I swear to fucking God.
- [Karen] It's my fault. It's my fault.

279
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,019
<i>He gets scared when we fight.</i>

280
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,654
- [Frank] Fucking come back here, you bitch.
- [Karen] I'm sorry. Daddy...

281
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,056
<i>He plays games.</i>

282
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,891
- [typing]
- [indistinct shouting continues]

283
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:25,864
[Karen] <i>He has his computer,</i>
<i>plays for hours and hours.</i>

284
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:28,497
School says he's got...

285
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,167
[sniffles]
...a unique ability...

286
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,702
[crying] ...but he just
seems kind of broken down.

287
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,640
[Frank] I take that little fucking
prick in. Don't make me come in there.

288
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:40,045
John...

289
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:44,149
saving Patrick
is the reason I'm here.

290
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:46,551
I'm in hell now, John.

291
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:52,624
[sniffles]

292
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:55,493
This can be just business.

293
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,900
You need money.
Me and Patrick need a way out.

294
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,136
My husband is joining me here
the day after tomorrow.

295
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:09,607
I told him that I would
charter a boat for fishing tuna.

296
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,880
I want you to take him out on your
boat, let him get drunk...

297
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,852
then drop him in the ocean
for the sharks.

298
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:26,792
In return, I will give you
ten million dollars cash.

299
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:31,931
[laughs]

300
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:36,001
Listen, before the moon goes
down, I got fish to catch.

301
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,868
I need you
the fuck off my boat.

302
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,136
Ten million dollars, John.

303
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,873
[Dill]
Get the fuck off my boat.

304
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,714
I'm at the American Hotel.

305
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:54,753
- [engine starts]
- Mr. Dill! Mr. Baker Dill! Can I speak to you a moment?

306
00:23:56,021 --> 00:24:00,592
Mr. Dill! I just need...
[panting] ...a few minutes of your time.

307
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,699
Ma'am. Do you know
the captain of that boat?

308
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,679
[music playing on radio]

309
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,089
[music stops]

310
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,158
Hey, Constance.

311
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:34,928
What are you doing up here?

312
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:36,696
Looking for my damn cat.

313
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,699
Uh-huh. Front pocket.

314
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:43,301
[Constance] I'm allowed inside?

315
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,771
[Dill] If you wipe your feet.

316
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:46,639
- [cat meows]
- Thank you, ma'am.

317
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:54,345
I hear
you got lucky last night.

318
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:58,116
Yeah, sure did. Three swordfish
over 50 pound. Eight hundred bucks.

319
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,787
Plus I cut out the cheeks for breakfast.
You want some?

320
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:04,856
They say she looks like
some kind of model.

321
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:06,059
[Dill] Who?

322
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,830
Consuela said the lady said her
husband's coming here to catch tuna.

323
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,698
[Dill] Doesn't anyone around here
do any work they're paid to do?

324
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,069
- [Constance] Is that why she came to see you?
- [Dill] Yep.

325
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:17,771
Are you going
to take him out?

326
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:19,473
Nope.

327
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,008
- [Constance] Where are you going?
- To take a shower.

328
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:47,299
[Frank] <i>You're selfish, you fucking bitch.
You always have to go in.</i>

329
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:50,837
[Patrick] <i>Dad,
there's something I need you to do.</i>

330
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,907
[Frank] <i>Don't you fucking dare.
You show me no fucking gratitude.</i>

331
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,441
[Karen screams]

332
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,843
[gasps]

333
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:05,313
[panting]

334
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,251
Patrick?

335
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:49,357
Is that you?

336
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:04,940
[vehicle approaching]

337
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:35,338
[bell rings]

338
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:46,949
[sighs]

339
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:54,890
- [door opens]
- [screams]

340
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:57,093
Frank! Oh, God!

341
00:28:57,994 --> 00:28:59,462
- [stammers]
- [laughs]

342
00:29:00,062 --> 00:29:01,929
Rolled in a day early, baby.

343
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,767
But there... [panting]
...there were no flights today.

344
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,536
I rented a Learjet.

345
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,039
I had to come and get you.

346
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,175
Let's get this fucking show
on the road, huh?

347
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:14,977
Mmm.

348
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,247
I paid a fucking jet
for this, so let's...

349
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,449
let's lose the robe.

350
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:24,120
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Turn around.

351
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,356
Nice and slow.

352
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:32,094
[inhales]

353
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,398
Oh, yeah.

354
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,270
Okay.

355
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,185
What's this? Huh?

356
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,986
Just a little scratch.

357
00:29:58,988 --> 00:29:59,922
Ooh.

358
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,891
A little scratch, huh?

359
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,127
Playing with a cat maybe?

360
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:06,896
I don't know.

361
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,966
Hmm. You don't know.

362
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,503
[inhales] Okay.

363
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,355
Man of the moment.
Your ears burning?

364
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,523
I've come to settle up, Lois.

365
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,591
Well, if you want my opinion,
I didn't think she was so special.

366
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,426
- [chuckles]
- Parading right there on the quay

367
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,964
with some big hat and shades
like it's 90 degrees.

368
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:46,970
I owe you for 20 spoons, hooks,
and 1,000 yards of line. That's $25.

369
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,572
And her husband. Man.

370
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:52,142
Her husband arrived on a jet
decorated like a cake.

371
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,443
Consuela says he came early
to surprise her.

372
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:58,516
Gave Carlos 150 for finding
champagne at 10:00 a.m.

373
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:02,487
A dozen regular sevens and a couple
of feathers as well, will you?

374
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,389
- Going after swordfish again?
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,058
Guess you gotta pay the bills
now that Duke's gone.

376
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:12,361
Poor old Duke. He's got himself
some day work up at the boatyard.

377
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:13,431
Poor old Duke.

378
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:16,465
You shouldn't have blamed
his wife for your bad luck.

379
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,670
I don't. I blame your damn hooks.
Two cedars.

380
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,572
- For tuna?
- What else?

381
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:25,142
Swordfish at night, tuna in the day.
When are you gonna sleep?

382
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,543
When I've bought my boat
from the bank.

383
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:29,514
Nine dollars.

384
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,317
Then I'm gonna sail away to somewhere
where nobody knows your business.

385
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,918
[scoffs]

386
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,355
What name are you gonna
use there?

387
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:42,560
Consuela says the big guy beat
her with his hands and his belt.

388
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,130
Hour and a half.

389
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,100
She didn't make a sound.

390
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:53,171
Miami is some strange place,
right?

391
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:55,640
Yep.

392
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,943
Oh, there was some skinny guy
from Fontaine looking for you.

393
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,345
He left you his card.

394
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,321
Captain.

395
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:13,422
My wife says you're being
a little difficult.

396
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,727
Well, as I explained
to your wife last night,

397
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:18,527
I don't have
a first mate right now.

398
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:20,666
And by law, I'm not allowed
to take tourists out alone.

399
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,265
The law, huh?
Funny you should say that.

400
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:24,801
'Cause I ain't seen
any law around here

401
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:27,369
that'd cost more than
ten bucks since I left Miami.

402
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,238
I can't afford
to lose my license.

403
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,307
Well, take the cock
out of your mouth.

404
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,679
Four years in a line I won the
Bermuda Yellow Fin Tournament.

405
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:37,547
Fifty-four, 70, 73,
and a 56 pounds.

406
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:40,517
Well, your proficiency
does not alter the regulations.

407
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,656
My proficiency. Jesus,
he talks like a fucking college professor.

408
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,359
Huh? [laughs]

409
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,365
My wife, my beautiful wife,
she arranged this trip.

410
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:56,235
She sat up on the fucking
Internet night after night,

411
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:00,303
typing away to find the perfect
boat to make this trip perfect,

412
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,242
because she wants it to be
perfect, perfect for me.

413
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:08,113
Now, myself, well, I'd say a son of a
bitch runs a bucket same as any other,

414
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:09,715
and I'd fly
to some other island.

415
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,552
But I don't got time.
I only got two days.

416
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:18,657
So, let's be here at 7:00, just me,
you, and the motherfucking tuna.

417
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:21,995
I already told you,
it's not worth the risk.

418
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:23,662
I'm not gonna do it.

419
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:25,797
Please think about it,
Mr. Dill.

420
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,165
[Frank] It's okay, honey.

421
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:30,769
Every man has his price.

422
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,138
Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
I'm gonna be here.

423
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,541
So should you.

424
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,348
[Reid Miller] Mr. Dill!

425
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,554
- [engine starts]
- Damn it. Damn it. Mr. Dill!

426
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,263
There's something wrong.

427
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:02,769
There appears to be a 20-second
discrepancy in my allotted schedule.

428
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:11,509
[Lionel] Two nights in a row.
The moon change your luck?

429
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,411
[Dill] I'd say 110 pounds.

430
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:16,382
Hmm. And they're billfish, huh?
Say $800?

431
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:20,818
Yesterday when you came in
with the swordfish,

432
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,490
I thought, at last,
Baker Dill has seen sense.

433
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:28,194
But I hear from Lois
you bought new cedars.

434
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,165
So even though you're
making money on night fish,

435
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,201
you're still going out after
that fish that's in your head.

436
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,902
You do know
it's just in your head, right?

437
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:41,274
Well, hell, yeah.
That's why I gotta get him out of there.

438
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:45,111
Oh, and yesterday,
there was some skinny guy out of Fontaine.

439
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:48,214
Got here right after you left.

440
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
- [cat meows]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

441
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:57,891
What are you doing all the way down
here, kitty cat, huh?

442
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,527
I'll take you home,
collect my reward.

443
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,899
[Constance moaning]

444
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:17,845
In a hurry today?

445
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,814
Ah. I need to be
on the ocean before 10:00.

446
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,319
So tell me the truth, Dill.
You knew her before, right?

447
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,322
I hear she needs
to be saved.

448
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,255
Yeah?

449
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,460
He gets drunk, beats her up.

450
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,166
You don't treat me badly.
We just lean on each other a little.

451
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:43,202
I give you cash
when the fish don't bite...

452
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:45,906
and you find my cat
when they do.

453
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:49,410
Catch the cat for Constance.

454
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,348
Okay, Dill, say fate
gave you the choice.

455
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:58,352
You can get the lady or you can
catch that tuna that's in your head.

456
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:00,487
Which one would you choose?

457
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:04,224
Oh.

458
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:16,735
[announcer on radio] <i>Another
beautiful day on Plymouth Island.</i>

459
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:21,506
<i>Tuna, albacore, swords, ready to catch.
Clear blue sky.</i>

460
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:24,944
<i>One little thing, if you have a boat,
and, man, of course you have a boat,</i>

461
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:29,249
<i>maybe, just maybe, that rare
thing, storm is coming.</i>

462
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:32,051
Dill, the rich guy
is aboard your boat

463
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,953
already strapped
into the shotgun chair,

464
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:36,455
drinking champagne
from a bucket of bait ice.

465
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,423
Yeah, well, unstrap him.

466
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:40,592
And they say he drew 10,000
in cash from the Mercantile.

467
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:42,594
I guess you want
a piece of the action, huh?

468
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:45,297
You listen to me.
Consuela heard the guy say to his wife

469
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:48,435
that he was going to offer you
the whole ten grand,

470
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,670
that he was going to do it
to prove a point,

471
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,537
to prove that some little
fucking guy can't say no.

472
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:53,775
Yeah? So what?

473
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,744
So I need the money.
You need the money.

474
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,682
We take him out, let him fish.
I'll take two, you take eight.

475
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:05,451
The <i>Sereni</i> needs an overhaul. My granddaughter
needs money for the next semester.

476
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,522
Why would I
take you out, Duke, huh?

477
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,456
You're bad luck.

478
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,794
No, no. Constance told me
the real reason you fired me.

479
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,630
Pity is worse
than a fist in the face.

480
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:20,333
I'm not begging you, Baker
Dill, I'm just telling you.

481
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:24,439
When life offers you an opportunity
like this, you have to take it.

482
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:36,584
Okay.

483
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:41,056
But you stay close to me today, Duke.
You hear me?

484
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,459
I need you to deliver me
from temptation.

485
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,596
Temptation?
What temptation?

486
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:49,898
You don't need to know.

487
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:56,038
[speak Creole]

488
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,009
[Karen] John?

489
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,878
My husband's offering $10,000.

490
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,948
Ah, this is Plymouth.
I already know.

491
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:08,083
You gonna take him?

492
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:10,418
Yep.

493
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:13,521
I'm gonna take him out.
That's it.

494
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,590
My first mate Duke
will be on board with me.

495
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:18,526
[bird caws]

496
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,929
We will...

497
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,765
fish until the sun sets
and then return.

498
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,501
All three of us.

499
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,639
Then we'll go back and Patrick
will hear the key in the door.

500
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:36,045
And then on it goes and on.
The three of us.

501
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:40,082
I know you think about him all the time.
I know you do, Dill.

502
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:42,051
You talk to him...

503
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,088
about catching
a particular fish.

504
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,962
He hears you
through his computer screen.

505
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,030
[Duke] Captain?

506
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,834
The gentleman has brought
hard liquor aboard.

507
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:00,970
That's against the rules, right?

508
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:03,806
It's okay, Duke.
The rules have changed.

509
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:09,778
It's true.

510
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,515
<i>He hears you
every time you talk to him.</i>

511
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,518
You are connected.

512
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:19,688
John?

513
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:53,723
[bird caws]

514
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,524
[Duke] Take a look, Dill.

515
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,160
Yeah, I saw him earlier.

516
00:39:58,094 --> 00:39:59,896
He was circling
right over the harbor.

517
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:04,198
A frigate?
Frigate don't fly over land.

518
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,002
I know.
It's the damnedest thing.

519
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:08,972
Like the son of a bitch
was coming to collect me.

520
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:13,710
Frigate don't fly over land, Dill.
You must have been mistaken.

521
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,212
There's some weird stuff
going on right now.

522
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,897
How do you guys live in a town
with only one fucking bar?

523
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:35,799
The Rope's not so bad.

524
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,802
It used to be called
the Hope and Anchor.

525
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,006
Then old Jack decided there wasn't
much hope to be had in Plymouth,

526
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:45,775
so he changed "hope" to "rope."

527
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,746
Lots of rope in Plymouth. Enough to
hang yourself. Isn't that right, Dill?

528
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:54,316
Is that right? Maybe we should
throw out some bait, huh?

529
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,153
Come on,
let's fucking chum the waters.

530
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,891
What do you guys
do for girls in this town?

531
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,962
You, what do you do?

532
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:06,596
Not much.

533
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,868
Not much, no?
What about you, Dull?

534
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,771
It's kind of a small island.

535
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,574
The guy at the hotel says in the poor part
of town, down by the commercial harbor,

536
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,178
you got little girls who take it
right in the ass for ten bucks a pop.

537
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,580
Right?

538
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,051
You know anything about that?

539
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,121
I wouldn't know
anything about that, sir.

540
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,622
Yeah.

541
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,922
Well, I'm gonna
fucking head up there tonight

542
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,093
and grab myself
some of that ten-dollar ass.

543
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,266
You don't have kids,
do you, Mr. Zariakas?

544
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,902
No.

545
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,807
My wife's got this son
from a previous fuck-up, though.

546
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,143
Creepy little fuck.

547
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,178
Open the door.

548
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,446
- [knocking]
- Patrick, open the door. Come on, I just wanna talk.

549
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:58,115
You know, I try.
I really fucking do.

550
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,285
I say, "Come on, kid,
let's go outside.

551
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,055
Let's toss a football around.
Let's play some football like men."

552
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,357
But he just sits there
staring at his computer screen

553
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,161
like he's staring out a window all day
fucking long with the curtains closed.

554
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,829
Get out here.
Have a fucking talk to me like a man.

555
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,966
- [knocking]
- <i>He's got a maths teacher who thinks he's a genius.</i>

556
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,003
That fucking genius can't
even screw a bell on a bike.

557
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,670
- Goddamn it!
- [banging on door]

558
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,275
You open the door,
you little prick.

559
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,743
One day I grab him, I throw him off
his chair, I wanna see what he's doing.

560
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,680
[grunting]

561
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,084
You know, I'm thinking whatever,
porn, ninjas, stealing cars.

562
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,719
You know what this little
fucking retard's doing?

563
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,123
Catching fish.

564
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,359
He's got this whole world.

565
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:45,931
And there's this guy on a boat
and he's catching fish.

566
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,972
I said, "How the fuck can you do the same thing
all day long?" And you know what he said to me?

567
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,677
If I didn't catch fish
all day...

568
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,846
If I didn't catch fish
all day...

569
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,316
If I didn't catch fish all day,
I'd find a way to kill you.

570
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,288
<i>I swear to fucking God,
that's what he said to me.</i>

571
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:15,127
Creepy little fuck.
I'll find a fucking hole for him one day.

572
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,764
Why would your son
wanna kill you, Mr. Zariakas?

573
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,167
How the fuck would I know?

574
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,672
What the fuck
is it to you, Dull?

575
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,773
Huh? Maybe you can give me
the name of that street

576
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,677
those little
harbor red-asses are on.

577
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,712
The guy at the hotel said
there's only one cop in town

578
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,181
and he's gone away
for the weekend,

579
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:39,352
so I can do whatever the fuck I want.
[chuckles]

580
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:46,425
Yeah, there's no law
in Plymouth right now.

581
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,636
Hey, give me that fucking rod.
Come on.

582
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,836
[grunting]

583
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:00,870
- All right, come on, give it here.
- No, no, no, it's just a shark.

584
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,774
I don't give a fuck.

585
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,875
- Give the rod to me.
- Nah, I'm gonna cut him loose and let him ride.

586
00:44:04,877 --> 00:44:06,877
It's a shark.
You said you wanted tuna.

587
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:09,182
- Give me the fucking rod. Come on, clip me in.
- Duke, get the bucket.

588
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:11,448
What are we looking at?

589
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,484
Four-hundred-and-fifty-pound
great white.

590
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,853
Enough to give you a buzz maybe, huh?
That's what you want, right?

591
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,790
I can do that.
Come on, plug me in, baby.

592
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:21,093
- We gotta attach the reel...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

593
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fuck!

594
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:29,769
Yeah, you... Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey,
give me a hand, man. Jesus Christ.

595
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:38,377
[boat approaching]

596
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:09,474
[laughs] Hey, baby! You see what
Daddy caught? A big fucking shark.

597
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:12,912
Now, honey, I swear tomorrow,
I'm gonna get you a big fat tuna.

598
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:18,017
Or some fucking heads are gonna roll.
Come on, a kiss for Daddy? Huh?

599
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:21,052
You going out again tomorrow?

600
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,820
Yeah, baby, I got to.
I gotta show these boys.

601
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:24,389
They're all set up
for fucking sharks.

602
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,059
Tomorrow I show 'em
how to catch tuna.

603
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:29,229
Hey, school for you tomorrow,
Captain Dull.

604
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:30,962
You're the boss.

605
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:32,466
Fuckin'-A, I'm the boss.

606
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm gonna wash my hands, okay?
You pay the guy.

607
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:38,205
Watch his eyes pop out of
his fucking head. [laughs]

608
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:50,384
So, tomorrow.

609
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:55,220
Pay me another ten,
we do the same thing again tomorrow.

610
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,055
- John...
- We fish, we come back.

611
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:59,858
You spent one day with him.
I have had ten years.

612
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,261
Karen, you got the money.

613
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,363
Go to Europe. Go anywhere. Just keep
that fucking animal away from my son.

614
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:07,801
And have him hunt us?
Him? Come on.

615
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:12,272
Honey, fucking blood
everywhere here! [laughs]

616
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:16,877
John, the ten million is dirty money.
It's in cash. It's yours.

617
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:26,820
Okay, John, you want the truth? Your son
wants you to do it. This is his idea.

618
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:31,058
You're his father.
He needs you to do this.

619
00:46:32,427 --> 00:46:33,827
He wants justice.

620
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,864
[Frank] Baby, come on,
let's go up the hotel and get a cocktail.

621
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,202
Early to bed for you, boys.
School tomorrow.

622
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:44,037
Tuna. T-U-N-A.

623
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:51,479
Talk to me about temptation.

624
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:08,863
[Duke] I know you, Dill.

625
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:13,134
The way you looked at him.
The way you looked at her.

626
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:15,536
You knew her before.

627
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:21,175
Yeah. More than that.
What happened?

628
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:25,246
I went away to war.

629
00:47:27,048 --> 00:47:28,383
War fucked me up.

630
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:33,454
I came back
and she was with him.

631
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,595
Except I didn't
really ever come back.

632
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:46,435
What about that kid
he was talking about?

633
00:47:47,603 --> 00:47:49,969
You know, Duke,
you remember when I hired you,

634
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:52,240
I made rules
about discussing the past.

635
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:56,077
I'm not talking about the past.
I'm talking about today, on deck.

636
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:59,415
I've spent so long on boats with
you, I can hear you thinking.

637
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:02,484
So that kid "from a
previous fuck-up" is yours?

638
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:10,091
And how much did she offer you
to kill her husband?

639
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:17,666
[laughs]

640
00:48:23,038 --> 00:48:24,339
Who's crazy now, huh?

641
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,041
Dill, even if
that bastard deserves it,

642
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:30,777
even if Lieutenant Gonzalez
won't raise a finger,

643
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:33,580
there's right and wrong,
heaven and hell.

644
00:48:33,582 --> 00:48:36,149
You know, Duke,
you made two grand today.

645
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:38,954
I think it's best you go find
some place safe to put it.

646
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:41,321
- What about tomorrow?
- What about tomorrow?

647
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:44,226
This will blow over by morning.
You know it.

648
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:49,665
Am I hired to come along or are
you going out with him alone?

649
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:51,665
I'll sleep on it.

650
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,368
I doubt you'll sleep.

651
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:01,276
There is a God, Dill.
And you're a good man.

652
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:05,981
Catch the fish in your head.
That is the rule.

653
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:09,084
Do not kill the man.

654
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,607
[sighs]

655
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:09,143
[Frank] <i>You fucking hear me?</i>
<i>Sit the fuck down.</i>

656
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:12,448
- [Patrick] <i>Dad!</i>
- [thunder crashing]

657
00:50:13,616 --> 00:50:15,118
[panting]

658
00:50:19,823 --> 00:50:22,592
Oh. My poor sweet kitty.

659
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:27,430
[footsteps approaching]

660
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,520
What are you doing here?

661
00:50:51,522 --> 00:50:53,424
He went looking
around the commercial harbor.

662
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,726
- [door closes]
- John?

663
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,862
All these years I never
stopped thinking about you.

664
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:01,230
Look.

665
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:07,671
You put it on my finger
when I was 16. You remember?

666
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:14,311
Outside the Fix in the parking lot.
I kept it. It's the same one. Brass.

667
00:51:14,845 --> 00:51:18,115
You took it from the burner on
the stove of your dad's boat.

668
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:21,318
No. That's just some old ring
you found.

669
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:24,788
No.

670
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:32,463
You said, "With this stupid
ring, I thee wed, baby."

671
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,700
I remember it word for word.
And then you laughed.

672
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:38,535
I kept it.

673
00:51:40,204 --> 00:51:41,605
I wear it when I'm alone.

674
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:48,212
You remember that night?

675
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,381
- [inhales]
- We went to the bridge.

676
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:52,449
You were fishing.

677
00:51:53,617 --> 00:51:55,152
Eels and jacks.

678
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:56,654
Then...

679
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:01,392
you said
I was finally old enough.

680
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:05,362
First time for me.

681
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:08,332
First time ever.

682
00:52:09,934 --> 00:52:14,606
[sighs] If we could go back
to that bridge that night...

683
00:52:15,774 --> 00:52:16,741
would you go?

684
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,712
What do you mean?
No war. No fuck-up.

685
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,782
No body parts laying around in the sand.
My arms, my fucking hands.

686
00:52:25,784 --> 00:52:26,785
John...

687
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:31,289
[cries]

688
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:34,726
I loved you
even after you were gone.

689
00:52:40,665 --> 00:52:44,202
Listen up. Before this gets any
crazier, here's the deal.

690
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:52,377
I will take him out tomorrow.
He will drink. He will fall overboard.

691
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:56,848
Sharks will get to eat and I
will get ten million in cash.

692
00:52:57,649 --> 00:53:03,688
Afterwards, I will go somewhere, you will bring
my son to me and then we'll see what happens.

693
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,858
But don't you
bullshit me about love.

694
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:10,626
I'm doing this for him,
Patrick, my son.

695
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:13,696
You and me
are not part of the deal.

696
00:53:13,698 --> 00:53:15,364
Okay, okay.

697
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,869
People don't change.

698
00:53:21,874 --> 00:53:23,976
Then I'm still
the girl at the bridge.

699
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:40,659
[breathing heavily]

700
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:48,567
[Karen crying]

701
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:37,650
We're both destroyed, right?

702
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:41,922
Both damaged.
Both damaged in different places.

703
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:54,700
[moans]

704
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,342
[moaning]

705
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:37,911
That's it.

706
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:41,982
I beat him. I win.

707
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:47,454
Make sure you don't get him
there till noon tomorrow.

708
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:51,625
I'll take him out on the ebb.
When the water's high, I'll do it.

709
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,961
Then the current will take away
what the sharks leave behind.

710
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:16,017
[door closes]

711
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,160
Your mother says you can
hear me when I talk to you.

712
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:29,797
How can that be, huh?
It makes no sense.

713
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:32,133
But you never know with her.

714
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,869
Opportunity's all around her.

715
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,705
It pours off her like rain.

716
00:56:39,073 --> 00:56:42,910
We're gonna do this,
just you and me, tomorrow. Yeah.

717
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,983
Then maybe you can open the
goddamn curtains and step outside.

718
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:05,666
Mr Dill. It's quite a
bit unpleasant out here.

719
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:09,136
Can we go inside?

720
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:16,477
My name is Reid Miller.
From Fontaine.

721
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,713
The boat and fishing
tackle suppliers.

722
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:22,014
I am a technical representative
and head of regional sales

723
00:57:22,016 --> 00:57:23,751
in the latitudes
that include Plymouth.

724
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:26,154
May I come in
and talk to you?

725
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:27,521
It's 2:30 in the morning.

726
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:30,591
You're out at sea mostly.
I keep missing you.

727
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:32,593
By a bigger margin every time.

728
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:35,627
But with the storm
keeping you ashore,

729
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:36,932
I thought
I'd take my opportunity.

730
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:41,834
What I have in my hands
may change your life

731
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,738
and give you the one thing
you've always wanted.

732
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,542
That sounds great, Reid,
but I've got kind of a big day tomorrow.

733
00:57:48,977 --> 00:57:50,178
Yes, Mr. Dill.

734
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:52,748
I know all about your big day.

735
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:56,550
And I think you should hear
what I have to say.

736
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:15,037
Have a seat.

737
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:24,613
Can I get you something?
[clears throat]

738
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,314
- [uncorks bottle]
- Bigger hands.

739
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:27,783
What's that?

740
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,651
Uh, bigger hands.

741
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:33,855
Whenever I'm around fishermen,
I wish I had bigger hands.

742
00:58:34,823 --> 00:58:35,791
Now, listen, man.

743
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:37,592
What the fuck do you want?

744
00:58:38,126 --> 00:58:39,094
Mr. Dill,

745
00:58:39,995 --> 00:58:41,730
inside this suitcase...

746
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:44,097
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell me fishing tackle.

747
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:45,765
Yes. Yes, I am.

748
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:47,067
At 2:30 in the morning?

749
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:48,904
As I say,
you're often at sea.

750
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:51,840
The electrical storm
is my only opportunity.

751
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:54,974
All right, listen.
I'm a man who can appreciate persistence.

752
00:58:54,976 --> 00:58:56,978
- With me, it's a fish.
- With me, it's you.

753
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:01,817
[chuckles]

754
00:59:03,186 --> 00:59:04,818
Okay.

755
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,189
Here's what you're gonna do,
little man.

756
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:08,291
I'm gonna pour you a nip,

757
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,757
gonna keep the cold
off of you.

758
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,226
Then you're gonna
get the fuck out of here

759
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:13,762
and go back
where you came from.

760
00:59:13,963 --> 00:59:15,298
I got an early start
in the morning.

761
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:18,334
Actually, tomorrow
you don't sail until midday.

762
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:21,668
That is to say,
low tide is noon,

763
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,672
and as a rule,
you sail at low tide.

764
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,813
You know a lot about me,
don't you?

765
00:59:31,447 --> 00:59:32,381
Yes.

766
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:34,250
Almost everything.

767
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:40,223
[coughs]

768
00:59:52,768 --> 00:59:53,703
Drink up.

769
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:05,214
[coughs]

770
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:06,816
[clears throat]

771
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:12,088
What's in the case?

772
01:00:14,123 --> 01:00:15,425
This, Mr. Dill...

773
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,166
is the all-new Fontaine
marine sonic fish finder.

774
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:26,669
A fish finder?

775
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:28,270
It uses sub-aquatic
sonar signals.

776
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:29,937
I know what the fuck
a fish finder is.

777
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:31,908
- But Mr. Dill...
- Let me see that card again.

778
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:40,617
Is this a joke?

779
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:43,185
The guys at the Rope
put you up to this?

780
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:45,287
It's no joke. We are prepared
to give you this model,

781
01:00:45,289 --> 01:00:49,259
the Fontaine White Wave,
free of charge for one week. A trial.

782
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,030
Perhaps you could
try it out tomorrow.

783
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,403
What's so special
about tomorrow?

784
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,070
Hmm?

785
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:05,976
Mr. Dill, all I can say is I am
a representative of Fontaine...

786
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,313
and they really want you
to catch the fish.

787
01:01:17,555 --> 01:01:22,159
And I want you to take this
piece of equipment on trial.

788
01:01:24,562 --> 01:01:28,265
Just take the fish finder
and try it,

789
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:31,768
and it will work,
I promise you.

790
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:34,037
I am the rules.

791
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:40,077
You're the what?

792
01:01:43,013 --> 01:01:44,349
Those are the rules.

793
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:53,491
You said you knew something
about tomorrow.

794
01:01:56,827 --> 01:01:57,794
What do you know?

795
01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:02,700
Mr. Dill...

796
01:02:04,102 --> 01:02:06,271
please just decide
to catch the fish.

797
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:09,173
Don't kill that man.

798
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:11,808
Don't what?

799
01:02:12,977 --> 01:02:14,443
I... I really shouldn't drink.
I can't say any more.

800
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:15,380
I have to go.

801
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:17,382
Who the fuck are you?

802
01:02:22,186 --> 01:02:24,822
You're gonna tell me
what you know about tomorrow,

803
01:02:25,156 --> 01:02:27,158
and if you don't,
you're not gonna see it.

804
01:02:30,561 --> 01:02:31,796
Mr. Dill...

805
01:02:32,597 --> 01:02:34,799
if you have to kill me,
then kill me...

806
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:38,303
but I am just playing my part
in the game.

807
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:40,238
What game?

808
01:02:40,938 --> 01:02:42,807
What fucking game?

809
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:48,446
This game.

810
01:02:50,014 --> 01:02:51,947
- <i>Don't you get it?</i>
- [Karen screaming]

811
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:53,583
<i>Someone made the whole thing up.</i>

812
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:55,351
[Frank] <i>...fucking me.
You and the fucking kid.</i>

813
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:56,354
All of this.

814
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,497
<i>Plymouth Island</i> is a game.

815
01:03:10,336 --> 01:03:12,404
<i>There are lots of games
on Plymouth Island.</i>

816
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:16,107
Catch the Cat.
Count the Sprats.

817
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:20,546
<i>You get logs and frigate birds and
fish finders and bottles of rum.</i>

818
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:24,350
<i>You see, someone made a world
on their computer</i>

819
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:26,683
<i>so they could play games.</i>

820
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:27,952
[thunder rumbles]

821
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:34,393
<i>But his favorite has
always been</i> Catch the Tuna.

822
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:37,494
<i>The lighthouse.</i>

823
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:41,266
<i>Light, dark, one, zero.</i>

824
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:43,268
<i>The fundamental process.</i>

825
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:47,206
<i>The rule is you've got to catch
a particular fish.</i>

826
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:49,308
<i>That rule is your compulsion,</i>

827
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:52,177
<i>and your compulsion
is a rule in a game.</i>

828
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:56,615
<i>But now it seems
the fish is no longer the point.</i>

829
01:03:58,717 --> 01:04:01,286
<i>The new game
is that you kill a man.</i>

830
01:04:04,724 --> 01:04:06,659
[Dill] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>who the fuck you are,</i>

831
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,094
but it's time for you
to leave.

832
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,131
Who the fuck I am
is I am the rules.

833
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:15,467
And according to the rules,

834
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:19,138
on Plymouth Island,
no one dies.

835
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:21,608
It isn't meant to be
that kind of game.

836
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,179
So, as a representative...

837
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:29,682
of the existing program...

838
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,284
my question is,

839
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:35,154
the big question is...

840
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:40,092
why has the creator
changed the rules?

841
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:42,595
[Patrick screams]

842
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:44,497
[clock ticking]

843
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:48,167
[grunts]

844
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:53,939
[groans]

845
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,949
[alarm rings]

846
01:05:05,018 --> 01:05:06,152
[panting]

847
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:17,597
[sniffles]

848
01:05:56,336 --> 01:05:57,370
[sighs]

849
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:50,489
[man] <i>Unless you've been
living under a rock,</i>

850
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:52,658
<i>I think
I hardly need to motivate</i>

851
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,693
<i>machine learning and neural
networks to the present...</i>

852
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:58,397
[man 2] <i>We have these complex
systems of information relay points</i>

853
01:06:58,399 --> 01:07:02,169
<i>and from that,

854
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:06,171
[announcer] <i>Good morning.</i>
<i>This is Plymouth Radio,</i>

855
01:07:06,173 --> 01:07:09,644
<i>broadcasting to Plymouth Island
and the ocean.</i>

856
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:13,880
<i>Well, the storm's blown over.</i>

857
01:07:13,882 --> 01:07:15,782
<i>Where the hell
did that come from, right?</i>

858
01:07:15,784 --> 01:07:17,516
<i>Anyway, I would give you
the time,</i>

859
01:07:17,518 --> 01:07:19,852
<i>but you don't care
what time it is.</i>

860
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:21,723
- <i>This is Plymouth...</i>
- [turns off engine]

861
01:07:31,332 --> 01:07:32,400
All right, Patrick.

862
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:38,340
I'm gonna kill a man today.

863
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,644
That's what you want, right?

864
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:46,481
I've just got so many holes
in my memory.

865
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:49,149
I don't know what they're from.
The war, the rum.

866
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:51,853
I mean, I don't even remember
how the hell I got here.

867
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:55,824
But I remember you.

868
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:00,428
You were three years old.

869
01:08:01,763 --> 01:08:02,862
<i>We went fishing.</i>

870
01:08:02,864 --> 01:08:04,530
[indistinct]

871
01:08:04,532 --> 01:08:05,634
[laughing]

872
01:08:09,471 --> 01:08:11,306
<i>We didn't catch a damn thing.</i>

873
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:14,542
<i>I remember I got so mad.</i>

874
01:08:16,578 --> 01:08:18,780
<i>Maybe that's why
you made me like I am, huh?</i>

875
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,152
<i>Mad as hell
to catch that damn fish.</i>

876
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:28,858
Yeah, but lately I've been having
this thing in my memory where I...

877
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:34,897
where I see myself...

878
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:38,734
laying dead...

879
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:40,636
in the sand.

880
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,644
Mr. Dill?

881
01:08:50,445 --> 01:08:51,413
Remember me?

882
01:08:54,016 --> 01:08:55,216
Samson.

883
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:56,752
Constance's kid.

884
01:08:59,955 --> 01:09:02,390
My mom said
you had a job for me.

885
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,561
I quit my job
pumping gas in Miami.

886
01:09:05,928 --> 01:09:07,228
Here I am.

887
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:14,503
Are you okay, Mr. Dill?

888
01:09:14,837 --> 01:09:16,305
[lighter flicking]

889
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,375
You did always say
I was good around the boat.

890
01:09:21,043 --> 01:09:22,211
No.

891
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:24,580
I said
you were the lucky one.

892
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:26,449
The lucky kid.

893
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:30,453
I always thought if I got you
aboard, I might catch him.

894
01:09:30,753 --> 01:09:33,020
The beast? The big one?

895
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:35,589
Yeah, I always asked the game to
bring you to me, and now look at this.

896
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:36,592
Out of the blue...

897
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:39,228
here you are.

898
01:09:40,396 --> 01:09:41,831
You don't look so good,
Mr. Dill.

899
01:09:42,631 --> 01:09:43,599
Huh.

900
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:46,802
I had kind of a strange night.

901
01:09:48,504 --> 01:09:49,872
At the old Rope, right?

902
01:09:51,007 --> 01:09:52,341
You sank a few, huh?

903
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:54,276
[chuckles]

904
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,512
I brought some lures
I picked up in Boca Raton.

905
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:58,982
I don't need a man today,
Samson.

906
01:09:59,615 --> 01:10:00,884
He changed the rules.

907
01:10:01,684 --> 01:10:03,486
He wants me to do it,
I'm gonna do it.

908
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,421
That's it.

909
01:10:06,388 --> 01:10:08,022
But, Mr. Dill, please.

910
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:09,893
- [car door slams]
- [engine starts]

911
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:12,528
[music plays on car radio]

912
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,334
[announcer on radio] <i>Perfect
day to get out on the ocean.</i>

913
01:10:20,336 --> 01:10:24,072

914
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:26,440

for a beautiful Plymouth day.</i>

915
01:10:26,442 --> 01:10:29,780
<i>So just get out there
and catch that damn fish...</i>

916
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:32,549
[brakes screech]

917
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:36,553
[revving]

918
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:42,325
Yeah, come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on.

919
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:44,694
[revving]

920
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,332
- [grunts] Okay, here we go.
- [hand brake creaks]

921
01:10:58,142 --> 01:10:59,442
Baker Dill.

922
01:10:59,643 --> 01:11:00,944
Come on in.
I got something for you.

923
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:03,413
Yeah? What you got?

924
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:04,848
It's a surprise.

925
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:15,659
The latest thing.

926
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:19,096
Specimen tuna lures
that wriggle like a bitch.

927
01:11:20,097 --> 01:11:22,699
The latest thing on the Grand Banks.
Never fail.

928
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,001
I got tired of seeing your damn
face so disappointed all the time.

929
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:28,438
So I spoke to the
representative from Fontaine.

930
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,739
The skinny guy?

931
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,107
It's all right, Dill.
I know times are hard.

932
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:33,845
You can have those
free of charge.

933
01:11:34,145 --> 01:11:36,145
He's kind of a strange guy,
right?

934
01:11:36,147 --> 01:11:38,481
He gave them to me for free.
A free trial.

935
01:11:40,017 --> 01:11:41,118
Yeah, he...

936
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:43,420
He knew a lot about me.

937
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:45,056
Who?

938
01:11:45,656 --> 01:11:46,956
How do you explain that?

939
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,059
Explain what?

940
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:52,096
Huh.

941
01:11:52,663 --> 01:11:54,663
Say, Lois,
you know how in Plymouth

942
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:57,568
they like to say
everybody knows everything?

943
01:12:01,005 --> 01:12:03,373
Now, wouldn't it be funny
if the truth was that...

944
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:06,077
nobody knows anything?

945
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:11,949
Like where exactly it is...

946
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:14,652
that we are.

947
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:23,694
Where in the world are we,
Lois?

948
01:12:29,234 --> 01:12:32,067
Dill, well, you have yourself a good
day, now, and do what's right, okay?

949
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:33,105
Yeah, and what's that?

950
01:12:35,673 --> 01:12:37,142
Go catch that fish, Dill.

951
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:38,709
[clicks tongue]

952
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:42,413

955
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:03,532
[woman on phone] <i>Fontaine Boat</i>
<i>and Fishing Tackle Suppliers.</i>

956
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:05,902
Hi, yes. I'm calling
about a Mr. Reid Miller.

957
01:13:05,904 --> 01:13:08,204
He's a technical representative
with your company.

958
01:13:08,206 --> 01:13:10,106
He tried to sell me
a fish finder last night.

959
01:13:10,108 --> 01:13:12,175
I was just checking, he works for
you, right? He's real?

960
01:13:12,177 --> 01:13:14,277
[woman] <i>Real? Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

961
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:17,213
And Fontaine Boat
and Fishing Tackle Suppliers,

962
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:18,648
that's what you do,
you're real?

963
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:19,783
[woman chuckles]
<i>Why, yes, sir.</i>

964
01:13:19,785 --> 01:13:21,551
Great.

965
01:13:21,553 --> 01:13:23,219
Well, listen, I'd like to leave
Mr. Miller a message.

966
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:24,821
[woman] <i>Certainly.</i>
<i>Can I take your name?</i>

967
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:26,189
He'll know who I am.

968
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:27,190
[woman]
<i>Sir, there are rules here.</i>

969
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:29,693
My message is, "Thank you."

970
01:13:29,695 --> 01:13:31,196
[woman] <i>I cannot leave Mr. Miller
a message unless I take your...</i>

971
01:13:37,135 --> 01:13:38,103
Hey, Dill.

972
01:13:38,603 --> 01:13:40,036
Weather blew over
just in time.

973
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:42,072
I got your ice and beers
ready for you.

974
01:13:42,074 --> 01:13:43,942
Won't need ice and beer today,
Jack.

975
01:13:44,843 --> 01:13:45,978
Just a bottle of rum.

976
01:13:46,312 --> 01:13:47,744
You got customers today?

977
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:48,714
Mm-hmm.

978
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:52,184
I thought you had rules about
taking strong liquor on board.

979
01:13:54,152 --> 01:13:55,821
Well, the rules have changed.

980
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:00,056
You know, Dill,
if you're gonna catch old Justice,

981
01:14:00,058 --> 01:14:01,558
maybe you should go out alone.

982
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,129
Tourists just get
under your feet.

983
01:14:05,797 --> 01:14:07,331
Now, why would you say that,
Jack?

984
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,234
What's that?

985
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:09,835
Do you even know?

986
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:12,504
- Know what?
- Why you say things.

987
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,009
Do you even know
what this is all about?

988
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,584
No, it's just me
going crazy, right?

989
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:29,753
Probably need to see
Dr. Bob.

990
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:31,090
I think the island's
getting to me.

991
01:14:31,623 --> 01:14:33,793
Oh, yeah.
It'll do that okay.

992
01:14:41,834 --> 01:14:44,170
Exactly how many years
have I been here, Jack?

993
01:14:45,705 --> 01:14:46,605
What's that?

994
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:53,780
How long have I been
on Plymouth Island?

995
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:59,185
Sometimes it feels like we've
all been here forever, right?

996
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:03,389
Yeah.

997
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,192
I'll get you
that bottle of rum.

998
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,762
I got a feeling
today's the day.

999
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,832
Yeah, today's the day all right.

1000

[Frank] <i>Don't. Don't you dare.</i>
<i>You come back here.</i>

- [Karen] <i>I'm sorry, Frank.</i>

- [Frank] <i>Come back here, you bitch.</i>

1003

I will find a fucking hole for you.</i>

[gasps]

1010
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,902
No, Duke.
I'm going out alone today.

1011
01:16:23,003 --> 01:16:25,038
Yeah. Alone is right.

1012
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:29,409
You will be alone because
Mr. Zariakas won't be showing up.

1013
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:35,949
Frank?

1014
01:16:38,453 --> 01:16:39,353
[gasps]

1015
01:16:40,354 --> 01:16:42,388
I made some arrangements.
He won't be coming.

1016
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,657
What arrangements?

1017
01:16:43,957 --> 01:16:44,990
What happened?

1018
01:16:44,992 --> 01:16:46,793
[groans] I cracked my rib.

1019
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:49,163
I don't feel so good.

1020
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:54,868
I used my $2,000 to pay some Argentinian
cannery guy to break his hand.

1021
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,172
You fucking what?

1022
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:00,841
[breathing heavily]

1023
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:05,113
There was fucking six of them
against me.

1024
01:17:06,114 --> 01:17:07,979
- [gasps]
- [grunting]

1025

01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:10,784
- Fuck.
- [Dill] <i>You what?</i>

1027
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:13,288
I didn't do it to save him.
I did it to save you.

1028
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:15,854
No. No, Duke.

1029
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:16,890
[groans]

1030
01:17:19,194 --> 01:17:20,929
No, you didn't
fucking do that.

1031
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:25,298
You know, I don't think there's gonna
be any sport for me for a while, baby.

1032
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,833
[breathing heavily]

1033
01:17:27,302 --> 01:17:28,403
[yells]

1034
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:31,406
"Deliver me from temptation."
That's what you said.

1035
01:17:31,839 --> 01:17:32,972
And that's what I've done.

1036
01:17:32,974 --> 01:17:34,275
[yells]

1037
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:36,844
Dill, you're not right
in your mind.

1038
01:17:40,048 --> 01:17:41,447
You should go see Dr. Bob.

1039
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,717
Get the fuck off my boat.

1040
01:17:44,385 --> 01:17:46,287
- You should see someone.
- Get off my boat!

1041
01:17:49,324 --> 01:17:50,825
[roars]

1042
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,228
Fuck.

1043
01:17:57,031 --> 01:17:58,132
I quit!

1044
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,401
[roars]

1045
01:18:05,373 --> 01:18:06,274
Jack?

1046
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,276
Jack?

1047
01:18:11,012 --> 01:18:12,278
Give me a bottle of rum.

1048
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,547
I already gave you a bottle.

1049
01:18:13,549 --> 01:18:15,083
No, I already drank
that bottle.

1050
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:16,784
Give me a goddamn bottle.

1051
01:18:21,022 --> 01:18:22,458
[Jack] You're sitting
in old Wes's seat.

1052
01:18:23,124 --> 01:18:24,358
That's right, Jack.

1053
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,960
[bangs table] Right here.

1054
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:27,696
What happened?

1055
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:29,964
You don't drink
before you go out, Dill.

1056
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:31,400
That's because
I'm not going out.

1057
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:33,901
Why not?

1058
01:18:35,937 --> 01:18:37,371
You want something to eat?
I got ham and eggs.

1059
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:38,806
Mm-mmm.

1060
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:41,343
[draws chair]

1061
01:18:43,145 --> 01:18:44,146
Okay, Dill,

1062
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,181
here is how we all see it.

1063
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,353
Three days ago,
you pull a knife on some tourists,

1064
01:18:51,954 --> 01:18:53,455
yell bad things at Duke.

1065
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:57,559
Joe at the cannery says he sees
you running naked in the mornings.

1066
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:01,430
Last night everybody saw you
sitting on the deck in the rain

1067
01:19:01,997 --> 01:19:03,030
talking to the air.

1068
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:04,900
Hmm.

1069
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:07,403
And whether you like it or
not, I'm calling Dr. Bob, okay?

1070
01:19:08,437 --> 01:19:09,471
[chuckles]

1071
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,345
You're a part of it, Jack...

1072
01:19:17,513 --> 01:19:19,181
and you don't even know it.

1073
01:19:22,918 --> 01:19:25,287
This whole goddamn island's
a part of it.

1074
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:28,591
But nobody knows it.

1075
01:19:31,594 --> 01:19:33,362
You wanna go call Dr. Bob?

1076
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:38,167
Go do that.

1077
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:57,487
[chair slides]

1078
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,960
[tires screech]

1079
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,332
[groans]

1080
01:20:11,334 --> 01:20:13,236
[tires screech]

1081
01:20:16,706 --> 01:20:18,475
[song plays on car radio]

1082
01:20:28,685 --> 01:20:30,387
[brakes screech]

1083
01:20:30,587 --> 01:20:32,288
[song continues playing]

1084
01:20:41,531 --> 01:20:43,664
[announcer on radio] <i>Okay,
this is a message for Baker Dill</i>

1085
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:45,701
<i>from all your friends
on Plymouth Island.</i>

1086
01:20:45,703 --> 01:20:48,938
<i>"Come back, man.
You've got a fish to catch."</i>

1087
01:20:56,346 --> 01:20:58,413
I'm so mad about this.

1088
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:01,251
Oh, no, baby. They got
what was coming to them.

1089
01:21:01,685 --> 01:21:05,188
I so wanted my daddy
to catch me a big fish today.

1090
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,092
I spent so long planning this.
All those nights on the Internet.

1091
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:13,161
- I know.
- [sighs]

1092
01:21:13,163 --> 01:21:15,497
- I know.
- I'm so sad my dream's not gonna come true.

1093
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:17,000
I know, baby, but I'm...

1094
01:21:19,068 --> 01:21:21,035
I'm hurt pretty bad, baby.

1095
01:21:21,037 --> 01:21:22,673
Mmm. Okay.

1096
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:25,074
[sighs]

1097
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:26,976
Okay.

1098
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:30,044
[groans]

1099
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:31,480
I want you to pretend...

1100
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:33,047
[groans]

1101
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:36,117
...that my throat
is your big old fishing rod.

1102
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:37,588
- Baby, my hand is broke.
- See?

1103
01:21:38,155 --> 01:21:40,289
- Ah, baby...
- See if you can hold it. Just see.

1104
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,224
I can't.
My hand's broke, baby.

1105
01:21:42,226 --> 01:21:44,460
- Oh, just try, Daddy. Just try.
- I can't.

1106
01:21:44,462 --> 01:21:46,530
[groans]

1107
01:21:47,398 --> 01:21:49,465
Oh, yes, Daddy,
I feel that.

1108
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,669
- [grunts]
- That is so strong.

1109
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:54,071
They can't stop you.

1110
01:21:54,438 --> 01:21:56,371
Nobody can stop you.

1111
01:21:56,373 --> 01:22:00,044
[sighs] You know, if you wanted to
go, I'd come with you.

1112
01:22:00,544 --> 01:22:01,645
I'd help you.

1113
01:22:02,446 --> 01:22:03,412
You would?

1114
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:04,381
Yeah.

1115
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:31,175
[groans]

1116
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:37,649
How the fuck did you know
I was here?

1117
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:39,314
Oh, come on.

1118
01:22:39,316 --> 01:22:40,850
In Plymouth,
everybody knows everything.

1119
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:42,521
[chuckles]

1120
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:45,356
Yeah.

1121
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:48,393
Except what the fuck
is going on.

1122
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:53,665
If it helps,
I don't much know either.

1123
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:57,201
I just kind of know
what's supposed to happen.

1124
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,671
Yeah.

1125
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:03,642
Well, if it helps,
I called your office.

1126
01:23:06,144 --> 01:23:07,412
They said you are real.

1127
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,049
That's very kind of them.

1128
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:15,220
Did you ask them
what "real" means?

1129
01:23:15,487 --> 01:23:18,690
No, I didn't have enough coins
to get into that conversation.

1130
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:21,593
[chuckles]

1131
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:23,626
- Fuck.
- What's funny?

1132
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:25,297
What's not funny, huh?

1133
01:23:25,764 --> 01:23:28,133
Like your theory
on my own existence.

1134
01:23:28,366 --> 01:23:29,668
It's very interesting.

1135
01:23:30,268 --> 01:23:32,070
Intellectually challenging.

1136
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,537
But, I mean,
I gotta favor the notion

1137
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:36,575
that I've just been
on this island too long.

1138
01:23:37,509 --> 01:23:40,478
Had so much bad fucking rum,
I lost my grease.

1139
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:44,316
No.

1140
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:46,585
You're not crazy.

1141
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:49,387
No?

1142
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:50,488
No.

1143
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:56,860
Well, if someone invented me,
how come I know who I am?

1144
01:23:56,862 --> 01:23:57,830
You don't.

1145
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:02,500
You don't.

1146
01:24:05,403 --> 01:24:08,708
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on."

1147
01:24:09,809 --> 01:24:12,878
So, in short,
nobody knows anything. Hmm?

1148
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:15,381
Nobody except
whoever created us.

1149
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:17,617
And who's that?

1150
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:27,393
You know, don't you?

1151
01:24:30,296 --> 01:24:31,196
Know what?

1152
01:24:32,298 --> 01:24:33,399
Who the creator is.

1153
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35,468
If this is a game...

1154
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:44,343
then I guess I do.

1155
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:46,445
Everything is a guess.

1156
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:48,414
Every wave that breaks
is a guess.

1157
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:53,552
Come on, who is it?

1158
01:25:02,528 --> 01:25:03,562
It's a boy...

1159
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:07,700
sitting in a dark room.

1160
01:25:11,604 --> 01:25:14,941
In some other part of the house,
he can hear some guy beating his mother.

1161
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,315
So he sits in front of his computer
screen, wishing he could...

1162
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,818
bring his dad back so he
could kill the son of a bitch.

1163
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:27,721
There it is.

1164
01:25:30,256 --> 01:25:30,957
That's it.

1165
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:40,232
So that's the new game.

1166
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:43,603
Your new compulsion.

1167
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:46,773
Yeah.

1168
01:25:47,674 --> 01:25:49,743
Real, not real,
I don't give a fuck.

1169
01:25:50,844 --> 01:25:53,478
He wants me to do it,
he needs me to do it, I'm gonna do it.

1170
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,749
It's called "justice" or
something like that. I'm doing it.

1171
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:03,390
Well, if that's the new rule,
I should help you.

1172
01:26:06,059 --> 01:26:07,394
Fuck fish finders, right?

1173
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:12,532
Consuela told Lois
who told me,

1174
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:15,902
in spite of all the obstacles
that have been thrown in her way,

1175
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:19,639
Karen has persuaded Zariakas
to be on the boat at noon.

1176
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:24,678
If the game is to kill him,

1177
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:26,880
you don't have much time.

1178
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:47,735
Here we go. Come on, baby.

1179
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:49,667
That's right.

1180
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:52,673
I'm the rules.
I am the rules, huh?

1181
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,074
Gonna show you
how it's done, son.

1182
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:58,378
Just like Iraq. That was a game, huh?
A shoot-'em-up game.

1183
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,581
I was good at that game, huh?

1184
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,751
That's right.
I was put to good use.

1185
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:05,686
They call it justice, huh?

1186
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,921
Here we go.

1187
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:08,623
Uh-huh.

1188
01:27:14,428 --> 01:27:16,128
I gave him medication
and bandaged his hand.

1189
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,030
He's been drinking rum.
He's been throwing up.

1190
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,065
So let's get him on board
before he changes his mind.

1191
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:22,935
This is fate, John.
He's so broken up, he can't fight back.

1192
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,039
Stay calm, Karen.
I got this.

1193
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,772
Does he have a gun?

1194
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:28,709
No. I mean, yeah,
but I hid it.

1195
01:27:28,976 --> 01:27:30,411
It's fate, John.

1196
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,518
[Dill] How are we doing,
boss man?

1197
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:39,118
- What's that?
- Huh?

1198
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,586
Hey.

1199

turning soon.

1202
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:47,595
We should get on board
if we're gonna do this.

1203

He's badly wounded.

1204

Just get him on board.
He wants to fish.

1205

1233
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:40,977
When that fucking fish bites,

1234
01:29:41,177 --> 01:29:44,711
you be sure to put that rod in
my good hand, okay, Mr. Dull?

1235
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,015
Hey, you're the boss.

1236
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:49,116
Oh, yeah. Make sure he gives
the fucking rod to me, yeah?

1237
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:51,120
- Yes.
- To me. Yes, what?

1238
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:53,721
Yes, Daddy.

1239
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:56,159
Yeah. Yeah.

1240
01:29:56,926 --> 01:29:58,728
You fucking hear that, Dull?

1241
01:29:58,995 --> 01:30:00,761
She likes to call me Daddy.

1242
01:30:00,763 --> 01:30:01,631
Yeah, I hear it.

1243
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:03,232
How about your boy?

1244
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,901
He call you Daddy, too?

1245
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:06,501
[Frank] What's that?

1246
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,571
The creepy one. Patrick.

1247
01:30:10,173 --> 01:30:13,142
- He call you Daddy?
- [Karen] John, stay cool.

1248
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:14,677
What'd you call him?

1249
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,048
[Dill] All right,
we got blood in the water.

1250
01:30:19,682 --> 01:30:21,716
Sharks are gonna come, my man.

1251

Yeah, but we're after the fucking
tuna, though, yeah?

1252
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,556
Goddamn right
we're going after tuna.

<i>I bend over

1259

We catch the famous fish,

Hey, Mr. Dill.

1261
01:30:46,243 --> 01:30:47,842
I figured it was
last night's rum talking

1262
01:30:47,844 --> 01:30:49,113
when you said
you didn't need me.

1263
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:51,614
I stowed away.
But I'm here to help.

1264
01:30:51,981 --> 01:30:53,117
Oh, fuck.

1265
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:54,917
I wanna show you I am lucky.

1266
01:30:55,285 --> 01:30:56,186
[Karen] John,

1267
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:58,188
who the hell is this?

1268
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:01,158
I just... I thought
I'd bring you some luck.

John?

1272
01:31:08,065 --> 01:31:10,600
What the fuck
you keep calling him John for?

1273
01:31:12,903 --> 01:31:15,669
Shh.

1274
01:31:15,671 --> 01:31:17,673
[Samson] Mr. Dill, I'm sorry. I didn't
know. I thought you'd be fine with...

1275
01:31:18,008 --> 01:31:19,875
- You don't have to pay me.
- No, it's okay, Samson. It's okay.

1276
01:31:19,877 --> 01:31:22,012
Listen. I want you to go up
to the wheelhouse, tidy up.

1277
01:31:22,279 --> 01:31:24,112
When you're done,
fetch me a pack of cigarettes, okay?

1278
01:31:24,114 --> 01:31:25,047
Yes, sir, Captain.

1279
01:31:25,049 --> 01:31:26,050
Okay.

1280
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:29,051
Mr. Zariakas,
stay in your seat and watch the rigs.

1281
01:31:29,053 --> 01:31:31,086
Mrs. Zariakas,
do you wanna know where the toilet is?

1282
01:31:31,088 --> 01:31:32,222

Okay, okay, okay. Offer the kid
money to keep his mouth shut, right?

1286
01:31:50,274 --> 01:31:51,940
No, no,
that's not a good idea.

1287
01:31:51,942 --> 01:31:53,175
I'm not doing that
to the kid.

1288
01:31:53,177 --> 01:31:54,611
What do you propose?

1289
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:04,219
I can't go back to my life, John.
I can't go back to my life.

1290
01:32:04,221 --> 01:32:06,723
- No, no.
- Easy. Easy.

1291
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:09,825
[Samson] Fish on!
Bang on the shotgun!

[Samson] It's him? [whoops]

1303
01:32:38,156 --> 01:32:40,389
I knew it.
I knew I'd bring you luck.

1304
01:32:40,391 --> 01:32:41,625

- Yeah.
- Huh?

Yeah, give me
that fucking rod.

insisted that I transfer the rod to him.

this motherfucker is the beast.

[reporter] <i>Police tell us that Patrick

1369
01:36:33,627 --> 01:36:36,060

1372
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:45,172

1374
01:37:05,259 --> 01:37:06,260
Hello?

1375
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:08,562
<i>Dad? It's Patrick.</i>

1376
01:37:09,063 --> 01:37:11,029
<i>Is that you? Can you hear me?</i>

1377

<i>Dad, I just wanna know, are you okay?
What happened?</i>

1379
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:21,306
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

1380
01:37:21,308 --> 01:37:23,344
I don't know anything,
you know.

1381
01:37:24,044 --> 01:37:26,213
Nobody knows anything.

1382
01:37:26,981 --> 01:37:28,349
You know,
all I know is that

1383
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:32,253

somewhere.

1384

I know, I know. It's okay. It's okay.
You did the right thing.

1387
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:42,995
You hear me?

1388
01:37:42,997 --> 01:37:45,232
Sometimes we do...
we do bad things for good reasons.

1389
01:37:45,534 --> 01:37:48,035
<i>Dad, I'm gonna
change the game...</i>

1390
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:51,038

visit you sometime.</i>

1391
01:37:51,606 --> 01:37:52,705
<i>Is that okay?</i>
