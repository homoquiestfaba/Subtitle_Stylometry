1
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,455
Frankie was probably the most
naturally talented performer

2
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,748
I'd ever seen.

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,750
He was...

4
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,128
Energetic, dynamic, charismatic.

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,465
He got on that stage,
and, baby, he was huge,

6
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,758
bigger than life.

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,343
See, you all got to understand.

8
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,303
By the time I met Frankie,

9
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,390
he was a record-deal-needing,
broke-ass,

10
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,809
scam-on-his-mama-for-a-fix
druggie.

11
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,228
Hell, the boy had
so many needle marks on him,

12
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,397
I thought he was
a goddamn pincushion.

13
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,358
Hmph. A cute pincushion,

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,944
who could sing
his little ass off.

15
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,946
Frankie was a perfect gentleman.

16
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,448
We had a wonderful courtship.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,535
He used to bring me flowers
and write me poetry and...

18
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,829
Nobody could do it
like Frankie Lymon.

19
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,539
He was a junkie motherfucker.

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,123
He was the love of my life.

21
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,085
I don't know what I can
say about this next act.

22
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,006
What can you say
but "sensational"

23
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,507
all over the world.

24
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,717
Frankie Lymon

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,552

Peter Markowitz,

57
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,949
attorney for
Elizabeth Waters Lymon.

58
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,159
Sign here, please.

59
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,669
Hi.

60
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,462
Elizabeth Lymon.
Elizabeth Lymon.

61
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,506
Oh, Mrs. Lymon.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,010
Elizabeth, I'm... I'm
Peter Markowitz.

63
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,181
Elizabeth Lymon.
Why they send you?

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,308
Uh, legal referral sends
whoever's available.

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,434
Please.

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,855
Uh, my contact said

67
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,649
there was a dispute
over royalties.

68
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,901
Is that...

69
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,444
How old are you?
You look kind of young.

70
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,821
I'm 30.

71
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,989
30? Damn.

72
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,449
I swear, if you're
broke or in jail,

73
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,910
you get the kids
just starting out

74
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,162
on the bottom rung
out for a buck.

75
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,706
I'm hardly bottom rung,
Mrs. Lymon,

76
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,499
or should I say Mickey Waters,

77
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,920
alias Elizabeth Phillips,
alias Josephine Phillips...

78
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,256
Ok, ok, so you did your
homework. Whoop-Dee-doo.

79
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,716
Don't have a cow, all right?

80
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,219
What are you in for, this time?

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,013
I ripped off some clothes
and shit, but look...

82
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,266
I only got seven months left,
so let's just move on.

83
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,060
Now, you know anything
about the record business?

84
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,686
I know I like music.

85
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,397
You know you like music.
Tch.

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,525
Look, I was married
to Frankie Lymon.

87
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,777
Ok.

88
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,528
Frankie Lymon, sang
with The Teenagers,

89
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,280
remember them?

90
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,448
Before your time.

91
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,200
Anyway, look, when
Frankie was alive,

92
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,659
he wrote a lot of tunes,

93
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,536
and one of them was called
<i>why do fools fall in love.</i>

94
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,081
That's the song
Diana Ross has out.

95
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,624
Diana's singing it,
but Frankie wrote it.

96
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
Since he died, they've
been using that song

97
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,002
in the film <i>American Graffiti,</i>

98
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,212
a greeting card commercial,

99
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,547
and now Diana's
turning it gold again.

100
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,549
I'm his wife, so I
should get paid, right?

101
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,177
If Frankie wrote the song,
then he must own

102
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,345
at least part of the publishing
and its copyright,

103
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,347
thereby making it
part of his estate,

104
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,850
so, uh, yeah, you'd
be due those earnings.

105
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,018
Oh, yes! All right!

106
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,728
That's what I wanted to hear.

107
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,022
I'm gonna get paid, sister.

108
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,191
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

109
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,652
Mrs. Lymon,
what label was he on?

110
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,987
Uh, roulette records.

111
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,238
Roulette?

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,364
Call the owner.
Morris Levy. All right?

113
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,742
But if you do,
spray the receiver.

114
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,994
The guy's so slimy,

115
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,163

from the phone.

What are you doing here?

141
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,753
We have a situation.

142
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,922
The only situation
I'm interested in

143
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,799
is where is my dough?
Hey, Morris.

144
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,426
This is Lawrence Roberts.

145
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,138
He's an attorney from LA.

146
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,933
And this, it seems,
is Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

147
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,897
Oh, no.

148
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,606
Oh, miss thing knows me.

149
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,858
As you can see,

150
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,069
we seem to have one
Mrs. Lymon too many.

151
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,197
Wait a minute. I know you ain't
came all the way up to New York

152
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,866
in that cheap-ass
nylon wig talking shit

153
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,576
when you know that me
and Frankie was married.

154
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,785
Oh, please.

155
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,080
He dropped you like
a whore's panties.

156
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,331
Why, you bald-headed,

157
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,957
girdle-wearing,
fake-fur-wearing bitch.

158
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,959
Sit your nappy-headed
ass down, bitch.

159
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,669
I'm gonna kick your ass.

160
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,880
Ladies, come on.
Zola. Elizabeth.

161
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,840
Come on, it's obvious
that I've got a vested interest

162
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,010
in this situation.
You know?

163
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,595
So somebody please tell me...

164
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,306
Who was married to Frankie
when he died?

165
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,183
This is Frankie and Elizabeth's
marriage license.

166
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,977
It's dated January 23, 1964.

167
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,520
Screw that.

168
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,730
It's about this.

169
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,315
Miss girl here was married

170
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,609
to Charles Phillips back in '59.

171
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,945
Remember?

172
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,407
Well, she was obviously
divorced by the time...

173
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,700
No, I don't think so.

174
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,328
This is a copy
of the divorce decree.

175
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,163
Your client and Charles Phillips

176
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,418
weren't divorced until 1965.

177
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,753
Meanwhile, I married Frankie

178
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,089
October 8, 1965,

179
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,216
in Mexicali, Mexico.

180
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,801
Plus we have a contract
with Mr. Levy

181
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,470
stating that Zola gets 15 grand,

182
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,639
plus 20% of future royalties

183
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,225
as long as she proves
she's Frankie Lymon's widow.

184
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,645
Wait. This is the same deal
you cut with Elizabeth.

185
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,063
And tried to cut with me.

186
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,856
I tried to stop them, sir.

187
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,358
It's all right.

188
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,862
Emira, this Elizabeth Waters,
Peter Markowitz,

189
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,864
Lawrence Roberts
and Zola Taylor.

190
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,616
Everybody, this is...

191
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,368
Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

192
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,535
What?!
What?!

193
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,996
And this is my attorney,
Ezra Grahme.

194
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,748
That's right. And we're
on our way to court

195
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,376
to file a stay against
these proceedings,

196
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,587
and we are suing you,
Mr. Levy,

197
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,299
for all back royalties
you illegally collected

198
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,717
when you put your name
on Frankie's songs.

199
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,718
Excuse me?

200
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,305
Frankie and I were married

201
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,308
June 30, 1967,
in Augusta, Georgia.

202
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,601
We were still married
when Frankie died.

203
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,603
I paid for his funeral,

204
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,647
and I don't recall
seeing any of you there.

205
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,649
Oh, please, don't even play me,

206
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,068
not coming in here wearing
white after labor day

207
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,654
looking like some old
down-home schoolmarm.

208
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,991
Yes, I am a down-home
schoolmarm.

209
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,493
I teach high school English,

210
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,495
a class you obviously skipped.

211
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,955
Oh, no, she didn't.
No, she didn't!

212
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,790
It's bad enough I've got
to deal with this bitch,

213
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,210
let alone now
your country-apple ass!

214
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,878
Who you calling a bitch?!

215
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,006
Should I call the cops?!

216
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,008
Yeah, baby, you call the police

217
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,676
and tell them we got
two impostors up here

218
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,429
running a scam, because
I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

219
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,014
I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon!

220
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,724
I am
Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

221
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,851
Jesus Christ,
it's a goddamn game show.

222
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,852
She lying.

223
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,187
You lied to me.

224
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,563
What do you mean, I'm lying?

225
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,731
I buried Frankie.

226
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,068
All Mrs. Lymons
shut up, damn it!

227
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,111
Don't you tell me to shut up!

228
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,199
Who the hell
are you telling to shut up?

229
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,909
Hear ye, hear ye,
surrogate court

230
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,911
of the state of New York
is now in session.

231
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,162
All rise.

232
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,123
The honorable
Sarah d'Angelo presiding.

233
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,042
Draw ye near
and ye shall be heard.

234
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
Please sit.

235
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,755
This proceeding is
for letters of administration

236
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,550
for the estate of frank
Joseph Lymon deceased.

237
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,551
Is that correct?

238
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,634
Yes, your honor.

239
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,095
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,765
And am I to understand
that there are three women here

241
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,768
claiming to be the alleged
widow of the decedent?

242
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,103
Yes, your honor.

243
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,604
Yes, your honor.

244
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,983
Ok. Mr. Roberts, present
your first witness, please.

245
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,485
I'd like to call
Mr. Richard Barrett

246
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,903
to the stand, your honor.

247
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,905
My name is Richard Barrett.

248
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,576
For 32 years, I've managed
and produced entertainers.

249
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,035
And during those 32 years,
Mr. Barrett,

250
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,329
did you have the occasion
to manage Frankie Lymon?

251
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,248
I managed and produced Frankie.

252
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,000
Mm-hmm. And when was
that Mr. Barrett?

253
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,628
1955.

254
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,590
You see, in 1955,
he and his group

255
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,258
used to sing outside my window.

256
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,302
♪ Do fools ♪

257
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,973
♪ Fall in love ♪

258
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,100
Hey, Mr. Barrett,
give us a record deal!

259
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,435
Come on!

260
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,270
Who wrote that song?
We did.

261
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,313
I'll be right down.

262
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,106
I knew Morris Levy

263
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,275
and George Goldner, his partner,

264
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,652
and they were looking
for Latin groups to record.

265
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,613
Now, Herman Santiago,

266
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
the lead singer at the time,
is Puerto Rican.

267
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,619
I sold Morris on The Teenagers

268
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,037
by telling him
they were a Latin group.

269
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,124
On the day of the audition,

270
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,460
things didn't go exactly
the way I'd planned.

271
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,919
I called him three times.

272
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,920
Call his house!

273
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,547
I'll call him.

274
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,881
Sherman, is it ringing?

275
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,550
Please be there.

276
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,760
Hey. Here he is.
Here he is.

277
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,095
Herman.

278
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,347
Mr. Barrett,
he's sick.

279
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,265
What are we supposed
to do, postpone?

280
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,766
No, it's ok. We don't
postpone. We go on.

281
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,519
We go on, we do it.
I got here, all right?

282
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
Wait a minute.

283
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,686
I wrote the song with Herman,

284
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,896
and I know the high part.

285
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,897
I could sing it.

286
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,191
Yeah, he could do it.

287
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,317
Don't bullshit me.

288
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,901
I can do it. I can.
I promise.

289
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,487
Very good.
I'll get back to you guys.

290
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,155
Hey! How you doing?

291
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,323
Pretty good, yeah.

292
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,408
These are the guys
I told you about.

293
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,993
How you doing,
Mr. Morris?

294
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,578
These guys look
pretty un-Spanish.

295
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,121
Just listen to them, all right?

296
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,122
Good-bye, boys.

Come on, you can do this.

301
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,755

and into the doo-wop
business. Ha ha ha.

318
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,926
We got a deal?
We got a deal?

319
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,096
You know something? He made
<i>beaucoup</i> bucks on Frankie.

320
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,181
That's right.

321
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,516
What's your name?

322
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,017
Frankie Lymon.

323
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,730
The record went gold,
and Frankie was a hit.

324
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,941
And the women...
Ha ha...

325
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,276
They couldn't resist him.

326
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,278
And was Zola Taylor
one of those women?

327
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,488
Oh, yeah.
Zola was one of them.

328
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,616
Mm-hmm. And did you
know about a marriage

329
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,242
between she and Frankie Lymon?

330
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,620
Yeah. It was
public knowledge.

331
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,747
No further questions,
your honor.

332
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,874
Hey, everybody!
The real thing is in town!

333
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,293
And don't you ever forget it.

334
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,670
I am the originator.
I am the emancipator.

335
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,171
I'm the man that started it all,

336
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,715
and before me was nothing.

337
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,384
I've been abused. I've been
misused. I ain't no fool.

338
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,638
Settle down.
Mr. Penniman.

339
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,972
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

340
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,308
Mr. Penniman!

341
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,476
Yes, Bailiff.

342
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,060
Raise your right hand.

343
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,313
Do you solemnly swear the
testimony you're about to give

344
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,565
in the matter pending before
this court to be the truth,

345
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,567
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you god?

346
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,569
I do, do, do, do, do!
I do!

347
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,407
State your name and
occupation, Mr. Penniman.

348
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,034
My legal name
is Richard penniman,

349
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,036
but I'm known to everybody
as little Richard,

350
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,538
the architect of rock and roll.

351
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,003
I am the originator!
I am the innovator!

352
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,921
I am the emancipator!
I'm the motivator!

353
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,632
I conceived and achieved it,

354
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,217
defined and refined it.
Mold and souled it.

355
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,511
Then the white man stole it.

00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,371
Say, uh, dig that.

536
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,540
Dig what?

537
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,125
Right there.

538
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,960
It's a shame.

539
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,628
Hey, Frankie, where you going?

540
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,713
Leave him alone.

541
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,380
He's just being Frankie.

542
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,716
Look at your business.

543
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,636
Say, hold on a second.

544
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,638
You want to come in
for a cup of coffee

545
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,224
or some lunch or something?

546
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,474
No.

547
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,809
Why don't you
take this all right?

548
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,977
Just don't drink it all up, ok?

549
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,187
Be cool.

550
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,355
Thank you.

551
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,319
That was decent.

552
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,823
I know. Most of those
guys are alcoholics.

553
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,243
Could've been my dad.

554
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,204
I mean, he's sort of...

555
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,498
Well, he's kind of a bum, too.

556
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,502
Come on. Let's get
something to eat.

557
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,754
So tell me about your daddy.

558
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,048
Uh, he left us eight months ago.

559
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,843
I don't know.
It must've got to him

560
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,762
I was the one
making enough money

561
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,557
to pay for all the bills,
and he wasn't.

562
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,518
You know, he's the one
who started me singing.

563
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,020
Really?
Yeah.

564
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,897
He had a gospel group
when I was a kid,

565
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,982
and me and my brothers
used to sing with him.

566
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,944
We used to have a lot of fun.

567
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,571
It don't matter now.

568
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,989
He was a drunk.

569
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,409
Anytime I turned around,
he was beating on us.

570
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,913
When you're ready.

571
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,540
Uh, let me take care of this.

572
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,917
Because if you haven't heard,

573
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,710
my record's number three!

574
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,711
Yeah!
Yeah!

575
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,588
That's right.
Number three.

576
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,674
No, no. You better let me
take care of this,

577
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,343
'cause if you haven't heard,

578
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,429
my record is number one.

579
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,930
Ooh!
Ooh!

580
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,556
You tell him, Zola.

581
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,225
That's right, Frankie.

No, no, no! The King,
you stupid platter.

590
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,872
Are you playing to lose?

591
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,458
Come on!
Stop it!

592
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,754
This is business!
It's business!

593
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,714
It was not my decision, ok?

594
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,383
Talk to Morris, all right?

595
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,801
No, you talk to me!

596
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,552
Don't you walk away
from me, <i>¡cabrón!</i>

597
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,805
I started this group, ok?
Don't ever turn your back on me!

598
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,183
I will kick your ass!

599
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,269
Come on! Hey!

600
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,407
Frankie!

601
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,414
Don't you see he's
trying to break us up?

602
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,500
You've been walking
with this all damn night.

603
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,502
What does this say?
<i>Out in the cold again.</i>

604
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,587
And on the other side,
<i>miracle in the rain.</i>

605
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,341
That's Frankie Lymon.
There's no Teenagers.

606
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:53,386
There's no group.
There's no nothing.

607
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,515
This solo shit has been planned
from the gate, wasn't it?

608
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,099
You knew all along.

609
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,101
We were a family!
We came up together!

610
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,271
I swear, it wasn't my decision.

611
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:08,650
You want to walk? Fine.
But family doesn't do that.

612
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,777
Family ain't bound by contracts.

613
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,904
That's low.

614
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,571
We're still family.

615
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,657
No, Frankie.

616
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,992
Thanks a lot, Frankie.

617
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,078
Frankie, he's crazy.

618
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,538
You want a drink?

619
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,248
I don't want a drink.

620
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,418
Just leave me alone.

621
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,237
Frankie?

622
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,821
What are you doing?

623
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,492
Herman was right.

624
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:03,205
I... knew they wanted me
to go solo two months ago.

625
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,707
But the way Morris handled it...

626
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,667
So chickenshit.

627
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,425
Well, he's
a chickenshit guy, Frankie.

628
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,427
I thought he'd at least

629
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,012
keep The Teenagers
together, you know?

630
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,389
Yeah.

631
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,478
Those are my friends, Zola.

632
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,272
We grew up together.

633
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,608
We did everything together.

634
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,067
We're like family.

635
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,778
More family than my own,
and this...

636
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,405
This is how I treat them.

637
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,407
Really, I understand.

638
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,408
No. You...

639
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,119
I do. Really.

640
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,122
Why don't you and I
go for a walk?

641
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,958
We can maybe get a drink.
We can talk.

642
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,838
It'll make you
feel better. Hmm?

643
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,880
Come on.

644
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,841
Now, sooner or later, Frankie,

645
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,177
you are going to have
to realize, ok,

646
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,887
that it's <i>you</i>
people come to see.

647
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,099
<i>You</i> and that fabulous
voice <i>you</i> have.

648
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,269
Come on. Here's to
Frankie's voice.

649
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,940
Ahh, man.

650
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,277
You know, sometimes my voice,

651
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,571
me being on stage, it's like...

652
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,239
It's like all I got going.

653
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,660
When I'm out there, I'm not just
some colored kid from Harlem

654
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,870
or some guy record execs
are fighting over.

655
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,789
You know, man, I'm just me,

656
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,334
and that audience... ha ha!

657
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,003
I feel alive. I feel free,
and I love it!

658
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,755
First time I heard you sing,
I was standing in the back,

659
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,259
I saw you and said,
"this guy is so special.

660
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,512
He has got to be
touched by god."

661
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,390
What you have, Frankie,

662
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,893
it's so... Amazing.

663
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,354
I can't even...

664
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,273
It's what?

665
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,274
I... I...

666
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,569
Frankie, you know,

667
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,571
I think it was a mistake

668
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,781
that I asked you
to come up here.

669
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,867
Maybe the mistake was...

670
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,245
Not asking me sooner.

671
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,881
Baby...

672
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,426
Frankie, hold... hold on.

673
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,678
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

674
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,846
What...

675
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,684
Frankie, what are you doing?

676
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,645
Wait. Frankie,
what are you doing?

677
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,064
Wait. Frankie, wait.

678
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,065
What?

679
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,609
You're gonna rip my dress.

680
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,776
Oh, I...

681
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,278
It's over here.

682
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,197
Right. Right.

683
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,700
Do it like that.

684
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,202
Oh, man. Mmm!

685
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,038
Ha! Wait.
Frankie, wait!

686
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,916
Frankie. No.

687
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,379
Oh. Right.

688
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,423
It hooks in the back.

689
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,345
Thank you, god.

690
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,952
Frankie told me
what happened the next day.

691
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,705
But I wasn't no fool.

692
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,707
Even ray Charles could see

693
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,336
the two of them was like
white on rice after that.

694
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,505
You know what I mean.

695
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,507
Thank you, Mr. Penniman.

696
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,716
No further questions,
your honor.

697
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,511
Fine. Then this witness
is dismissed.

698
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,095
Groovy!

699
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,682
State your name and address
for the records, please.

700
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,433
Elizabeth Waters Lymon,

701
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,520
3639 south 22nd street,
Philadelphia.

702
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,691
Elizabeth,

703
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,610
when did you first
meet Frankie Lymon?

704
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,362
In 1961.

705
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,072
See, my first husband
had split on me and our baby,

706
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,701
so I left Yolanda
with my mama in Philly,

707
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,411
and I came to New York
looking for work.

708
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:15,248
Well, one day I was out shopping
and I ran into Frankie.

709
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,168
I didn't know that
he was Frankie Lymon.

710
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,428
Yes. I'd like to see
this perfume here, please.

711
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,555
Of course.
Just a moment.

712
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,014
Thank you.

713
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,440
Excuse me, miss.

714
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,192
I need you to empty
your pockets for me.

715
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,318
Excuse me?

716
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,362
I've been looking
all over for you.

717
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,988
Did you find the perfume
you've been looking for?

718
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,281
Are you two together?

719
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,117
Yes. This is the perfume
that mama loves.

720
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,870
Let's not forget
the bracelet for my mother.

721
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,705
The rest of our things
are at the counter.

722
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,831
Let's pay for it.

723
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:56,998
I'm watching you.

724
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,999
What the hell are you doing?

725
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,251
You should thank me, doll.

726
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,502
For what?
I ain't done nothin'.

727
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,590
Then what is all this?
Damn, baby.

728
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,258
You got a nursing school?
What's this?

729
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,385
What's your angle, huh?

730
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,512
Hey, I don't want to see
a cute thing like you

731
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,683
wind up in the 43rd.
It's a shithole.

732
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:15,893
Hmm.

733
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,937
Hey, what kind of a dog is that?

734
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,355
A somma dog.

735
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,857
A somma dog?

736
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,983
Yeah. Somma this,
somma that.

737
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,652
Ha ha ha! I like it.

738
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,738
He's cute. Yeah.

739
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,698
So you got a daughter
or something?

740
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,700
Yeah. I got
a little girl.

741
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:32,701
Yeah?

742
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:33,993
Her name is Yolanda.

743
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:34,994
Wow.

744
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,496
She's eight months.

745
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,290
Bet she's beautiful,
just like her mama.

746
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,293
So tell me, is her
daddy still around?

747
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,961
He told me he was a singer

748
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,463
and gave me two tickets
to his show that night.

749
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,381
I never been to this club.
I hear it's nice.

750
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,383
Mickey, who is he?

751
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,218
I don't know,
but he sure is cute.

752
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,219
He's cute!

753
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,723
But before I go,
I just want to say

754
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,058
if I've offended
anyone here tonight

755
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,727
or upset you
by anything I've said,

756
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,562
let me address that with this...

757
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,772
Kiss my ass.

758
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,240
Funny man. One more time.
Redd Foxx, y'all.

759
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,871
And now coming to the stage,
one of the all-time greats,

760
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,748
put your hands together,
ladies and gentlemen,

761
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,082

He was a class act.

792
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,522
All right.
Your honor.

793
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,608
You making him out

It's an a and b conversation.

797
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,948
Frankie was classy.

798
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,657
Miss Taylor, quiet!

799
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,284
That doesn't sound
like my Frankie.

800
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,703
Sit down, miss Taylor, please.

801
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,496
Sit down.
Sit down.

802
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,753
All right.
Continue, miss Waters.

803
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,129

Come on.

808
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,361
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!

809
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,656
Whoo!

810
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,032
Better get a towel.

811
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,742
This is it.
Come on in here.

812
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,120
Make yourself at home.
Have a seat.

813
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,543
You know...

814
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,754
This is normally not this messy.

815
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,756
I stay so busy, I'm always gone,

816
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,550
I haven't had time
to clean up the place.

817
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,052
I thought with you being
a star and everything...

818
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,054
You thought because I'm a singer

819
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,474
I should have maids
and servants.

820
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,559
Well, I don't.

821
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,727
Sure don't.

822
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,315
In fact, this ain't
even my place.

823
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,234
I share it with a roommate
who's always gone.

824
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,071
That's cool.
I'm not judging you.

825
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:42,159
I think it's fine.

826
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,077
You fine, too.

827
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,454
Thank you.

828
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,581
You can sing, too.

829
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,500
Thank you again.

830
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,919
That's Zola Taylor, huh?

831
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,839
Yeah. She's
a good friend.

832
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,341
Mmm. She's pretty.

833
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,679
So, you goin' out with her?

834
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,808
Oh, no.
See, that's old news.

835
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,935
Mm-hmm.

836
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,897
I just don't understand.
Why me? I'm a nobody.

837
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:16,735
I'm not some big star
like miss Zola.

838
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,778
I'm just Mickey.

839
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,574
Maybe it's because
you're not some big star.

840
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,283
Maybe it's because you
thought I was a nice guy

841
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,995
before... before
you knew who I was.

842
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,873
I still think you're nice.

843
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,835
I think you're nice, too.

844
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,609
Mmm. Come on.

845
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,861
What's that?

846
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,206
We moved in together.

847
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,707
I know, girl.

848
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,876
Said five minutes.
I been here five hours.

849
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,253
Ok. Right here
by the wall.

850
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,712
I ain't doin' this all day now.

851
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,339
Right there.

852
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,091
Wastin' my Saturday.

853
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,843
Girl, I'm a little woman.

854
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,678
I'll catch a hernia
messing with you.

855
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,680
Girl, I'm sorry
I had you dragging

856
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,389
this heavy thing up
here with me.

857
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,558
I should have got
one of the fellas.

858
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,060
It's all right.

859
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,396
I love dragging that bad boy
up four flights of stairs

860
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,525
just so you and your
broke-ass junkie boyfriend

861
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,528
can be comfy-cozy.

862
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,864
How you gonna talk
about my man like that?

863
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,699
Come on now, Mickey.

864
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,951
The boy got a $10-a-day habit.

865
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,037
Where you hear that lie from?

866
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,789
Who do you think
you're talking to?

867
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,750
He's taking you for a ride.
Seen it happen every day.

868
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,878
I'm from the streets.
I know what it look like.

869
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,713
When's the last time
he had a record?

870
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,131
He's been trying.

871
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,924
I got a record player.
I ain't heard no records.

872
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,177
You're too hard on him.

873
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,514
♪ No, no,
no, no, no, no, no ♪

874
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,516
Well, it was true.

875
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,518
Frankie hadn't recorded
in years,

876
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,896
and by '61, music had moved on,

877
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,900
and Frankie's career,
it was on the downslide.

878
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,318
How you doin'?

879
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,738
Make sure you get
a good book, all right?

880
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,240
Will do.

881
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,949
Hey, Mrs. Johnson.
Tell Vernon to come see me.

882
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:10,950
I will.

883
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,245
Ahh, Mickey, sweet Mickey.

884
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,665
Easy for us.
Up we go!

885
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,252
Gol-ly.

886
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,212
Now, how come you
can't do that, huh?

887
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,924
Aww...

888
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,259
Teach him.

889
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,928
Hey, Frankie.

890
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,138
Aw, baby,
it's looking good in here.

891
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,599
Well, I still got
to paint and stuff,

892
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,975
but it's coming along.

893
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,061
Hey, I got something
for you, sunshine.

894
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,897
For me?
Oh, that's so sweet.

895
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,817
Oh, my god!

896
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,404
Frankie, god, is it mink?

897
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,447
Of course, it's mink.
Try it on.

898
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,783
Help me.

899
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,285
Wow.

900
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,246
Nobody ever done nothing
like this for me before.

901
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,248
I love it.

902
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,375
I love you.

903
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,253
Frankie told me
he was gonna give me everything.

904
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,545
Strut your stuff.

905
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,091
And he did.
He was so good to me.

906
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,135
I was happier
than I had ever been.

907
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,971
When I was with him,
he made me feel like a star.

908
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,973
Yes! Told you
I was gonna show you things,

909
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,515
now come on, woman!

910
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,685
But then reality hit...

911
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,938
Big time.

912
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,773
Frankie's drug thing...

913
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,775
Well, it forced me to find

914
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,028
new and interesting
places to hide cash.

915
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,490
Hey, Frankie.

916
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,659
You talk to Morris
about an advance?

917
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,244
What did he say?
Yeah.

918
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,371
What you think?
He told me to beat it.

919
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,873
Forget him, Frankie.
Find yourself a new label.

920
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,460
Don't let folks
control your fate.

921
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,129
You know, I saw on
<i>what's my line?</i>

922
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,881
Where this guy Nietzche said,

923
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,759
"I am the master of my fate,

924
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,136
the captain of my soul."

925
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,512
Do you know what that means?

926
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,015
I don't want to hear
no bullshit about Nickiski

927
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,516
or whoever the fuck he is.

928
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,310
I need a gig, man!

929
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,437
Fine. I was just trying to
say some kind words to you.

930
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,315
Stay at roulette
and stay broke, then.

931
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,607
Can't say nothing to you.

932
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,985
You're always lecturing me.

933
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,403
Damn!

934
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,240
Look, um, I need some money.

935
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,326
No! The rent is due
tomorrow.

936
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,744
I'm gonna give it back
to you on time. Damn!

937
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,746
You said that shit last month.

938
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,040
That's why we
ain't got no phone.

939
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,541
Don't embarrass me.

940
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,918
I got this landlord asking
for the rent tomorrow.

941
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,921
Frankie, what are you doing?

942
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,632
Where the money
I gave you to hold?

943
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,551
You ain't gave me
no money, Frankie.

944
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,552
You hid it.

945
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,262
No, I didn't.

946
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,556
Frankie, this shit
has got you acting crazy.

947
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,017
You want me to look
through stuff?

948
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,519
Frankie, what are you doing?

949
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,896
Want me to look for the money?

950
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,272
Where the fuck is my money?

951
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,899
Stop that, Frankie!

952
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,527
That shit got you acting
like you're crazy!

953
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,611
You fucking crazy!
Where the money at?

954
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,531
What is wrong with you?

955
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,948
You're what's wrong with me!

956
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,450
You're why I can't get
off the fucking dime!

957
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,951
Always lecturing me!

958
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,038
I ain't done nothing!

959
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,915
I know you got the money
somewhere around here.

960
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,208
Acting like you crazy!

961
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,209
You got the money!

962
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,293
What's gotten into you?

963
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,794
You're supposed to be my woman!

964
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,380

Did you go see Zola?!

No! No!
Frankie!

Frankie, why are you running?

00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,403
Get him! Get him!

990
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,904
Go! Go!

991
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,575
Frankie, I'm gonna kill you!

992
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,498
Frankie, open the door!

993
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,499
Get in!

994
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,958
Frankie, what is going on?

995
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,002
Shit!

996
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,420
Oh, shit!
Wait a minute!

997
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,255
You ain't got time to say
"hi" to an old friend?

998
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,798
Unh!

999
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,301
Get that motherfucker!
Get that boy!

1000
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,428
No!

1001
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,472
Leave him alone! Oh!
What y'all doing?!

1002
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,641
Unh! Unh!

1003
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,808
Unh! Mickey!

1004
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,685
So you try to pop
and run out on me?

1005
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,727
Unh!

1006
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,608
Here. Here.

1007
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,776
Here! That's all
we got! Take it!

1008
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,487
This ain't shit.

1009
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,781
Oh, no! No!

1010
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,075
Ok! Ok! Ok!

1011
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,370
Oh, no! Please!
Wait! No!

1012
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,496
No! Please!

1013
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,332
No! No, please!

1014
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,708
It's mink! It's mink!
It's real!

1015
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,672
Next time your man
wants some of my shit,

1016
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,840
he pays up front in cash.

1017
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:18,841
Ok.

1018
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,510
No!
Unh!

1019
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,261
Get my money!

1020
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,765
It's ok. Just go.

1021
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,351
Just go.

1022
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,690
Frankie.

1023
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,233
Frankie.

1024
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,277
Oh, baby.

1025
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,820
It's ok.

1026
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,198
Why you give them
the mink, baby girl?

1027
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,575
I'll get a new one.

1028
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,117
That was your gift, baby.

1029
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,327
I'll get another one.

1030
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,786
Shouldn't have gave it to them.

1031
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,829
Shh.

1032
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,789
Shouldn't have gave it to them.

1033
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,083
It's ok.

1034
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,544
Because I gave Coop that money,

1035
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:57,171
we couldn't pay our rent
and we got evicted,

1036
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,674
so we had to move in
with my mama in Philly.

1037
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:06,556
♪ Oh, she may be weary ♪

1038
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:09,684
♪ Young girls,
they do get wearied... ♪

1039
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:12,395
We lived in
Philadelphia for two years.

1040
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,564
Boy, they were hard times.

1041
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,566
Frankie was hardly ever working,

1042
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,943
and we never had no money.

1043
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,446
He was struggling
with his drug thing.

1044
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,906
He really tried to quit.

1045
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,367
And I still believed in him.

1046
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,412
One time we drove down
to Virginia for a gig.

1047
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,086
What are we doing here?

1048
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,421
Come on.

1049
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,257
Say, we want to get married.

1050
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,260
Married?

1051
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,511
We do?

1052
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,513
Did you change your mind?

1053
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,598
No! No!

1054
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,267
Of course I want to marry you.

1055
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,271
Baby, I told you.
I'm gonna give you everything.

1056
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,315
I promise.

1057
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
Let's get to it.
Ok.

1058
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,451
I'm a little nervous.

1059
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,746
S-sign here.

1060
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,456
Right here? Ok.

1061
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,249
Elizabeth,
I'd like you to take a look

1062
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,170
at this document. Do you
recognize the signatures?

1063
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,046
Yes. They're
Frankie's and mine.

1064
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,049
And can you tell me what it says

1065
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,969
next to the words
"status of applicant"?

1066
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,095
"Single."

1067
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:31,848
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear that.

1068
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,226
It says, "single."

1069
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,228
Could you explain to the court

1070
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,980
why you wrote the word "single"?

1071
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,692
Actually, Frankie
filled in that part.

1072
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,778
I guess he didn't want
any confusion to stop us.

1073
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,614
So you admit there was confusion

1074
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,616
because you were still married

1075
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,743
to your first husband.

1076
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,203
You lied on your application.

1077
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,831
Not intentionally.

1078
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,833
I didn't know
I was still married.

1079
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,793
This lawyer told me
I was free to marry again.

1080
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,795
Isn't it true you'd
have done anything

1081
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,505
to marry Frankie Lymon,
including lie?

1082
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,756
Objection!
Don't answer that!

1083
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,299
I loved Frankie!

1084
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,969

and I had to do something...

1147

So I checked him
into a hospital.

1149
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,530

Damn! Man, what?!

1163
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,025
I can't go to jail.
My man is in the hospital.

00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,676
Frankie, what are you
doing here?

1170
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,637
I'm paying for you
to be at that hospital.

1171
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,306
Baby, I didn't like that place.

1172

1173
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,267
They didn't treat me right.

1174
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,561
Smell like
a damn distillery. Ugh!

1175
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,939
What you drinkin'?

1176
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,941
I've been drinking some liquor.

1177
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,110
What you doing with my bottle?

1178
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,278
Oh, man.

1179
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,197
Look, why don't you
pack your stuff up?

1180
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,699

1181
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,910

Philadelphia with your mama.

I'm going out to LA

1183
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,664
Zola?

1184
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,958
Yeah. She got some gigs
lined up for me, baby.

1185
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,293
We gonna make it this time.

1186
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,295
Boy, I am out here

1189
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:59,259

old girlfriend?

1190
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,721
Well, fine! Take your
sorry, junkie stank-ass

1191
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,140
and get on out of here!

1192
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,809

you ain't got shit,

1193
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:09,145
and you ain't
never gonna be shit!

1198
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,575
I'm gonna toss

1199
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,577
Frankie, don't do it!

1200
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,164
Don't play with the dog
like that!

1201
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,165
Apologize!

1202
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,541
I'm sorry!

1203
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,751
Get on your fucking knees

1204
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,837
Yeah! Uh-huh!

1205
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,464

1207
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:39,842

1210
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,597
Please don't play with the dog.

1211
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,642
Look at your ass.
"Frankie, please."

1212
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,644
What the fuck you want, Ming?

1213
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,396
I'll throw this motherfucker!

1214
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,356
I'll throw this... ha ha!

1215
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,026
I ain't gonna
do nothing. Get up.

1216
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,402
Ow!

1217
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,488
Shit!
The motherfucker bit me!

1218
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,532
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry, baby!

1219
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:07,036
Frankie, you killed my baby!

1220
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,371
He bit me! He bit me!

1221

1224
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,423
I didn't mean to do it.

1225
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,925
Get off of me!

1226
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,467
I didn't mean to do it.
She bit me!

1227
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,887
Get off of me!
Get out of here!

1228
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,888
Baby!

1229
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,890
Get out of here.

1230

Get out, Frankie!

1232
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,231
You gotta go!
I can't take no more.

1233
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,440
I'm sorry.

1234
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1235
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,402
Just go. Go!

1236
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,990
I didn't mean it, baby.

1237
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,785
I didn't mean it.

1238
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,298
Your honor, may I request
a short recess, please?

1239
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,470
Yes. We'll take
a 10-minute recess.

1240
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,471
Ok.

1241
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,807
Thank you.

1242
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,565
Elizabeth...

1243
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,777
Did you ever see Frankie again

1244
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,946
after the unfortunate
incident with the dog?

1245
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:28,408
Yeah. Later,
in 1965 in LA.

1246
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,828
Did Frankie mention
he married Zola Taylor?

1247
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,998
He ain't married no Zola.
He was still married to me.

1248
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,666
In fact, he wrote me in Philly

1249
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,251
telling me things weren't
working out with her.

1250
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,502
He didn't tell you shit.

1251
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,921
And begged me
to come and see him.

1252
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,380
And I went to see him.

1253
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,467
But I didn't know
we were staying at Zola's house.

1254
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,385
I'm glad you came out to see me.

1255
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,139
I was... I was missing you, baby.

1256
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,640
I want you to know,

1257
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,475
I'm really sorry about
the way things turned out.

1258
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,477
They say the best way
to put the past behind you

1259
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,937
is start all over.

1260
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,438
Start over?

1261
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,613
What the fuck is going on?

1262
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,614
Zola!

1263
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,700
Put your clothes on.

1264
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,660
Hey, Z.
This is my friend...

1265
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,330
I don't give a shit
who the fuck she is.

1266
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,207
What the hell is she
doing in my pool?

1267
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,416
He invited me for the night.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1268
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,960
For the night?

1269
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,504
You're getting your shit and
getting the fuck out now!

1270
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,923
She's leaving.

1271
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,758
Wait! Are those
my clothes?!

1272
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,177
Are you putting on my shit?

1273
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,678
Are you crazy?

1274
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,848
Out there with my man
in my pool in my shit?

1275
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,099
I'm going to kill her!

1276
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,185
Wait! Hold on!

1277
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,187
Frankie, you up here
with that bitch

1278
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,897
that brought you
down in New York?

1279
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,148
Who you calling bitch?

1280
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,025
I'm gonna put my foot
so far up your ass

1281
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,360
that you will be
sprouting shoelaces!

1282
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,029
Damn! Frankie!

1283
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,573
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1284
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,700
No, wait!

1285
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,785
Get her out!

1286
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,872
Get me? Goddamn it!

1287
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,207
That is a lie, your honor!

1288
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,666
You know it didn't
go down like that!

1289
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,585
Miss Taylor.

1290
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,295
Lie after lie after lie.
Do something.

1291
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,880
Will you chill?

1292
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,798
You're supposed
to be a class act.

1293
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,799
I am a class act.

1294
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,801
Then act like one.

1295
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,720
It's after 4:00.

1296
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,431
I suggest we end today's session
and resume tomorrow at 9:00.

1297
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,143
We are adjourned.

1298
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,603
Your honor, I'd like to call

1299
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,939
Zola Taylor to the stand.

1300
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,940
Do you solemnly swear

1301
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,024
the testimony
you're about to give

1302
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,192
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

1303
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,318
and nothing but the truth,
so help you god?

1304
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,322
Yes, the <i>real</i> truth.

1305
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,448
Miss Taylor,

1306
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,158
can you tell me how long

1307
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,327
you and Frankie Lymon
were involved?

1308
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,329
On and off for 10 years.

1309
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,164
What happened in 1962?

1310
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,166
I had to tour Europe
with The Platters,

1311
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,669
and Frankie's play dates
started to dwindle.

1312
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,173
And I believe
that was the time when...

1313
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,549
He started using.

1314
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,968
Heroin?

1315
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,677
Yes.

1316
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,680
When Frankie
couldn't get that high

1317
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,183
from being on stage...

1318
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,851
I think he...

1319
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,686
Tried to find it elsewhere.

1320
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,189
You see, Frankie's career
was never the same

1321
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,566
after he split
from The Teenagers.

1322
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,693
I was on tour,
traveling with The Platters,

1323
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,196
and I saw Frankie less and less.

1324
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,198
I still had my place
in New York, though.

1325
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,242
Frankie still had the key.

1326
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,536
Zola!

1327
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,207
Ha ha! Hey, Z!

1328
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,708
Zola Taylor, you tried
to sneak in town

1329
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,710
and didn't tell nobody.

1330
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,711
Come here.

1331
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,797
Mmm!

1332
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:29,923
It was obvious

1333
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,550
that he had been
doing some drugs.

1334
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,677
Strung out.

1335
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,220
My mink stole, Frankie.

1336
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,388
Where is it?

1337
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,390
You askin' the wrong person.

1338
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:39,891
I don't... mink?
I do...

1339
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:40,934
Frankie.

1340
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,227
I thought you took it.

1341
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,229
Look, Frankie,
I only came back here

1342
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,231
to do this <i>Ed Sullivan show.</i>

1343
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,066
And then I'm packing up
all my stuff,

1344
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,234
as you can see,

1345
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,735
and I'm going back
to LA.

1346
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,612
For good this time.

1347
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,822
For good?

1348
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,995
While I was on tour
this last time, Frankie,

1349
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,039
I, uh...

1350
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,501
I got married.

1351
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,004
I... I know it's all
kinda sudden for you,

1352
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,340
but you know,
he lives out in LA.

1353
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,008
He used to be a drummer,

1354
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,510
but now he's a carpenter.

1355
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,845
Out of the blue?
Just like that?

1356
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,806
He's a really nice man.
He's stable.

1357
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,099
Do you love him?

1358
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,519
I told you, Frankie,
he's a nice, good man.

1359
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,853
I didn't ask that!

1360
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,313
I asked you, do you love him?

1361
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,523
Yes!

1362
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,191
I love him, ok?

1363
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,026
No, no.
That's bullshit.

1364
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,111
You said marriage
would tie you down.

1365
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,988
You just didn't want
to be tied down to me.

1366
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,032
I never said that, Frankie.

1367
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,244
Oh, yeah.
That's what you said.

1368
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,579
Let me tell you something.

1369
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,542
You gonna always
be tied down to me,

1370
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,710
whether you like it or not.

1371
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,421
We're like magnets.

1372
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,051
Mm-mmm.

1373
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,219
Frankie, please.

1374
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,137
Don't do this to me, Frankie.

1375
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,972
Don't leave me right now, Zola.

1376
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,100
I'm married.

1377
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,060
That was a mistake.
That was a mistake!

1378
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,562
No! I got a life,
Frankie,

1379
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,063
and it ain't gonna include you.

1380
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,565
Now you got to go.

1381
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,108
Get out!

1382
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,747
♪ ...that you sang ♪

1383
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,084
♪ So sweetly ♪

1384
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,086

1387
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,097
I didn't see Frankie
for another three years.

1388
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,099
And then one day,

1389
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:44,891
out of the blue,

1390
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,144
he called me up.

1391
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,605
And he said that his career
had completely nose-dived.

1392
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,607
He wanted to know
if he could come out to LA

1393
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,609
and if I could help him
get some gigs.

1394
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,611
I said, "Sure. Come on out."

1395
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,779
'Cause, see, I knew Frankie.

1396
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,781
And I knew
that he needed to sing

1397
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,658
like he needed
the air to breathe.

1398
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,659
Frankie!

1399
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,453
Frankie!

1400
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,163
Zola! Zola!

1401
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,458
Oh, wow!

1402
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,127
Damn, Frankie, you look...

1403
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,629
Well, come over here.

1404
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,671
All right.

1405
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,148
Yeah, I got all dressed up
to come on out here.

1406
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,733
Well, first you need to
come up out that conk. Yes.

1407
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,194
You in LA, baby.

1408
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,655
Out here, we ain't colored
no more. We're black.

1409
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,864
Oh.

1410
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,324
Oh, and you need
to wear these. Really.

1411
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,659
Ok. Right on.

1412
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,661
It's the law out here, baby.

1413
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,162
Groovy, baby.
Groovy!

1414
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,163

1415
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,414

God, this is far out!

1422
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:06,848
You'll dig it out here.

1423
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,017
I'm already digging it.
Hey! Peace! All right!

1424
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,810
Everybody's into a different bag

1425
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,021
out here, Frankie.

1426
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,567
It was a beautiful day.
I took him to my house.

1427
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,027
Frankie couldn't believe
my house.

1428
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,198
I don't believe it.

1429
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,200
This is... this is beautiful.

1430
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,535
Ha ha!

1431
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,203
Whoo! Man!

1432
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,247
Y'all got a pool.

1433
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,208
Wow. Man,
y'all got every...

1434
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,418
Look at this.

1435
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,752
Look at this!

1436
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,214
I'm on the top of the world, ma!

1437
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,675
Actually, I don't think
it was the day.

1438
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,218
No, no, no. I'm mistaken.

1439
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,720
It was nighttime, actually.

1440
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,638
Yeah, because I remember...

1441
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,515
The lights were twinkling.

1442
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,016
I'm on top of the world, ma!

1443
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,018
I remember.
It was really romantic.

1444
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,520
This is great!

1445
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,521
Wow. Man.

1446
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,064
You got everything.

1447
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,149
Oh.

1448
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,694
Y'all got an extra
bathtub outside?

1449
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,029
It's a jacuzzi, Frankie.

1450
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,948
Oh, a jacuzzi.
I'm gonna try that out.

1451
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,199
Now, look,

1452
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,784
you know I'm on leave
from The Platters, right?

1453
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,619
What?

1454
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,494
Mm-hmm.

1455
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,246
Got walking pneumonia in may.

1456
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,706
They changed me
like a light bulb.

1457
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:15,542
11 years... boom.
I'm out.

1458
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:18,044
Wow. That's...
That's heavy, man.

1459
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,547
So what you doing now?

1460
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,049
Oh, I got my own little act.

1461
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,052
Zola Taylor's all-male revue.

1462
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,053
Oh.

1463
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,555
I'm doing ok.

1464
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,098
I can see.

1465
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,099
Now, look, Frankie,

1466
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,559
this is the guest room, ok?

1467
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,561
You can sleep here
as long as you want

1468
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,062
until you get yourself situated.

1469
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,564
That's beautiful.
I appreciate that.

1470
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,065
Wait, I gotta ask you,

1471
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,067
how does your husband
feel about me be...

1472
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,068
Frankie, look,

1473
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,403
when you called,

1474
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,238
I said I might be able
to get you a few gigs.

1475
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,574
That's it, ok?
Don't expect nothing else.

1476
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,409
Ok, I'm not, I'm not.

1477
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,077
Ok, it's cool.
I can dig it.

1478
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,955
So tell me, when do
I meet the carpenter?

1479
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,792
What?

1480
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,254
I divorced him
in Mexico, Frankie.

1481
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,089
You divorced him?

1482
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,633
In Mexico?

1483
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:06,134
Where's the divorce decree?

1484
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,095
Uh, your honor, there are
extenuating circumstances

1485
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,764
regarding the divorce papers.

1486
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,390
But miss Taylor
will testify that...

1487
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,684
Miss Taylor?

1488
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,101
Actually, your honor,

1489
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,645
all my papers got destroyed.

1490
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:17,937
Well, did you try to get a copy?

1491
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,063
Most certainly.

1492
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,982
I contacted
The Platters' lawyer,

1493
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,526
Ruben Rodriguez,

1494
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,111
to see if he could put me
in touch with Mr. Worrell...

1495
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,113
He was the attorney
that arranged

1496
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,115
the whole Mexican divorce
in the first place.

1497
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,618
But, uh, I found out
that he was dead.

1498
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,453
Is Mr. Rodriguez alive?

1499
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,121
Yes, but he's in the hospital.

1500
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,122
He's in the hospital.

1501
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:37,749
Yes, with his feet cut off.

1502
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,381
Let me just
get a handle on this.

1503
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,383
You got divorced in Mexico,

1504
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,134
but nobody can find any records.

1505
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,804
Your Mexican divorce papers
were somehow destroyed.

1506
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,806
Your ex-husband is dead,

1507
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,141
your Mexican attorney's dead,

1508
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,644
and your lawyer...

1509
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,979
Your lawyer just had
his feet amputated,

1510
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,232
so he can't come here
to testify for you?

1511
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,401
Basically, yes.

1512
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,152
Ok.

1513
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,364
Ok, Mr. Roberts,
continue...

1514
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,365
Somehow.

1515
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,825
Thank you, your honor.

1516
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:13,117
Uh...

1517
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,828
Miss Taylor...

1518
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,162
Did you marry Frankie Lymon?

1519
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,664
Yes, I did.

1520
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,332
And can you give us
the circumstances

1521
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,792
surrounding your marriage

1522
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,252

1523
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,504

01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,484
Yes!

1592
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,113
I still got the moves.
Ooh oom ooh.

1593
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,114
You do, baby.

1594
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,115

01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,126
You got it, baby.

1601
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,128
You still got it.

1602
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,798
Ohh, don't you just love
that feeling

1603
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,301
when it seems like
the whole world loves you?

1604
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,428
And they want you,
you know what I mean?

1605
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,554
You're traveling.

1606
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,139
You're on the road
going on tours,

1607
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,141
and you're making
all this good money.

1608
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,143
And all of a sudden, man...

1609
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,062
It vanishes. It's gone.

1610
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,148
That shit's hard, Z.

1611
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,651
It's real hard.

1612
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,695
You start feeling like
you're worthless to them.

1613
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,156
All of a sudden, you just...

1614
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:23,200
Start feeling like you're
worthless to yourself.

1615
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,162
And then you go to the drinking,

1616
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,330
drugs.

1617
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,206
You think
that's gonna handle it.

1618
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,668
Before you know it,

1619
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,088
drinking and drugs
has a handle on you.

1620
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,715
That's what happened.

1621
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,426
Until tonight.

1622
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,053
Because you believed in me.

1623
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,554
Uh-uh. No.

1624
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,516
Frankie, don't give me
the credit.

1625
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,687
You only needed
to believe in <i>you.</i>

1626
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,189
And you did that tonight.

1627
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,733
I wanna kiss you, Zola.

1628
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,530
Frankie, uh-uh.

1629
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,699
No, I...

1630
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,200
Let's not do that.

1631
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,243
Zola, ain't nobody else for me.

1632
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,705
Listen, I know that.

1633
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,208
I love you, Zola.

1634
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,251
Only you.

1635
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,714
Really?

1636
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,075
Ohh...

1637
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,617
Frankie.

1638
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,746
I keep telling myself

1639
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,665
that I don't need you.

1640
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,500
I do need you, baby.

1641
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,501
Let's...

1642
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:58,046
Let's stop playing.

1643
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,463
Let's get married.

1644
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,464
Let's get married?

1645
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,674
Yes.
Let's get married.

01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,051
Frankie.

1647
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,428
You want me to marry you,
Frankie?

1648
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,098
Say yes.

1649
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,559

and we got married.

1674
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,439
Tijuana?

1675
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,941
Really? In Tijuana.

1676
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,944
Now, in your sworn
pretrial deposition,

1677
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,155
you, uh...
You said Mexicali.

1678
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,031
Oh, ok.
Mexicali, Tijuana.

1679
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,117
I don't know.

1680
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,493
One of them Mexican towns.

1681
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:11,995
You are under oath.

1682
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,080
Now, did you marry Frankie Lymon

1683
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,915
in either Mexicali or Tijuana?

1684
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:16,916
Yes.

1685
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,126
Your honor,

1686
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,128
I have obtained certifications

1687
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,629
of nonexistence of marriage

1688
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,631
for frank Lymon and Zola Taylor.

1689
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,216
One from Tijuana, Mexico,

1690
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,843
one from Mexicali, Mexico.

1691
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,137
I don't care
what you think you have,

1692
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:31,139
I married Frankie,
and she knows I married Frankie.

1693
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:32,515
I even showed her my ring.

1694
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,017
You lying.

1695
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,144
Miss thing did come to my house,
just like she said,

1696
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:38,354
but <i>she</i> was the one running
around like a wild banshee,

1697
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,647
not me!

1698
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,652
What the hell is going on?

1699
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:48,156
Frankie said I could stay.

1700
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:49,157
Mmm.

1701
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,241
Frankie said?

1702
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,160
Yes. What part
of "Frankie said"

1703
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:53,661
don't you understand?

1704
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,663
The "Frankie" or the "said"?

1705
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,833
You crazy.

1706
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,585
What part of "get out"
don't you understand?

1707
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,171
The "get" or the "out"?

1708
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,173
Oh, god.

1709
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,674
You Zola Taylor!

1710
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,635
I'm a big fan of yours!

1711
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,137
Man, you're incredible!

1712
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,139
Well, fan your ass
on out of here.

1713
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,183
I don't need this shit, ok?
Forget you.

1714
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,685
And you can take
your little funky attitude

1715
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,813

you just came from, Missy.

1719
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,196
See, I can see
why Frankie is sick

01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,032

1721
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,533

Who is this guy?

You don't know

1743
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,027
You went and got

1744
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,987
I told you not to invite

When was you gonna tell me?

1747
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,616
I said no strangers.

1748
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,243
I have an insane,

1749
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:17,036
nappy-headed
black woman in my house.

01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,662

1759
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,216

1762
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,516
Then when I asked Frankie
about it,

1763
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,602
he told me that Elizabeth
had broken into the house...

1764
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,979
What?

1765
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,563
...and told me that
she was married to Frankie

1766
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,065
just to hurt my feelings.

1767
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,401
And I believed him
because he was my husband.

1768
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:49,735
And if he wasn't my husband,

1769
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:52,071
why in the hell
would I have trusted him

01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,785
Come on, now, Z.

01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,370
Four months on the road

1774
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,955
It's gonna feel like forever.

1775
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:01,956
Frankie,

1776
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,083
you're gonna be just fine.

1777
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,085
Can't they give you
a break or something,

1778
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,586
so you can come home and...

1779
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,588
Baby. Baby, listen...

1780
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,090
Take this, ok?

1781
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,591
There's enough money here

1782
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,260
to pay for the mortgage,
the bills, everything.

1783
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,595
Zola, you know I don't like
taking money from you.

1784
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:19,098
Baby, it's <i>our</i> money.

1785
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,100
How am I supposed to
remember all this?

1786
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,102
I wrote it down, ok?
You'll find it.

1787
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:24,603
Are you sure you'll come back?

1788
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:25,771
I'll be back.

1789
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,106
You'll find time
for a break, right?

1790
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:28,607
It's gonna go by in no time.

1791
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,609
Frankie and I weren't in touch

1792
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,111
until about five months later.

1793
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,612
One day I called

1794
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,114
and my phone was disconnected,

1795
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,116
so I asked my sister

1796
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,618
if she would go over
and see what was going on.

1797
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,662
And when she picked me up
from lax,

1798
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,164
she told me

1799
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,541
that Frankie had
had some woman at my house

1800
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:48,127
and that a neighbor had
to call the police

1801
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,629
because of all the arguing
and fighting going on.

1802
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:55,092
And I knew exactly
who that woman was, too.

1803
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,553
And then my sister told me

1804
01:15:57,594 --> 01:16:00,139
that I couldn't go home,

1805
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,183
'cause I didn't have one.

1806
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,223
Frankie.

1807
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,566
Oh, Frankie.

1808
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,197
Frankie!

1809
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,700
Frankie, you fucking
son of a bitch!

1810
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,202
Frankie!

1811
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,603
Everything I'd worked for...

1812
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,272
Gone.

1813
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:33,608
Everything.

1814
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,818
When I went to the bank,

1815
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,112
there was no money, either.

1816
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,240
I tried to call Frankie
in New York,

1817
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,242
but his numbers
were all disconnected.

1818
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:47,037
Then I heard he had been
drafted into the army.

1819
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,248
I had nowhere to go,

1820
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,293
so I had to move in
with my sister.

1821
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:17,067
It was a real nice house.

1822
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,571
And I'm real sorry
about it. I am.

1823
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:24,325
But I swear to you, Zola,
I never went back up there.

1824
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:28,329
It's been 18 years.

1825
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,798
You'd think I'd be through
with all that by now.

1826
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:52,019
State your name
and address for the records.

1827
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,521
Emira Eagle Lymon.

1828
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,649
2110 Clairview Drive,

1829
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:57,816
Augusta, Georgia.

1830
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,151
Mrs. Lymon,

1831
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,320
could you state your
educational background

1832
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,697
for the record, please?

1833
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,657
After high school,

1834
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,325
I attended Morris Brown College

1835
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,327
for about a year.

1836
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,954
Then Albany State College,

1837
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,123
Augusta College, Plaine College.

1838
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,960
And I've done studies
at Savannah State College,

1839
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:19,630
as well as
the University of Georgia.

1840
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:20,881
Do you hold any degrees?

1841
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,799
Is the pope an old white man?

1842
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,801
I have a bachelor's degree
in social studies

1843
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,804
as well as a bachelor's degree
in education.

1844
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,474
Now, with all
your accreditations

1845
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,975
and degrees,

1846
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,479
how did you come
to meet Frankie Lymon?

1847
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,480
He marched

1848
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,981
right into my bathroom.

1849
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,859
I was getting out of the tub,

1850
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:41,860
and he said...

1851
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,362
Looking good, doll.

1852
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,488
And I said...

1853
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,989
Aah! Get out!

1854
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,075
Go! Get out!

1855
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,577
Hold up, Emira.
You know who this is?

1856
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:50,994
I don't care who he is!

1857
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,996
It's Frankie Lymon, the singer.

1858
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,165
Tell him to sing
his behind on out!

1859
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,167
Wait, wait, wait.
No disrespect, ma'am.

1860
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,002
Eddie said I could grab
a beer from the fridge.

1861
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,046
I was only looking
for the kitchen.

1862
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,134
Are there usually toilets
in the kitchen?

1863
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,012
There was a cockiness
about him, you know?

1864
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,514
A bravado.

1865
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,683
And he was so cute...

1866
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,685
In a real street sort of way.

1867
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,894
Let me help you there.

1868
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,020
Shit.

1869
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,314
Ohh.

1870
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,649
I'm sorry.

1871
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,525
I didn't mean that.
Just wanted to help out.

1872
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,527
They're oatmeal.

1873
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,154
I made them myself.

1874
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,530
Em's a great cook.

1875
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,365
She oughta be owning
a restaurant

1876
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,033
instead of teaching
crumb-crushers.

1877
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,827
Mmm. I love oatmeal cookies.

1878
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,036
They're my favorite.

1879
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,871
Uh, look,
I really wanna apologize

1880
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,373
for barging in on you.

1881
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,542
I didn't mean to walk in
and to see what I...

1882
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,544
Wait, let me introduce
y'all formally.

1883
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,045
Uh, Frankie,
this is Emira Eagle,

1884
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,380
my fiancée's sister.

1885
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,383
Emira, this is Frankie Lymon.

1886
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,511
Nice to meet you.

1887
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:51,054
Nice to meet you too, Frankie.

1888
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,765
After that,
Frankie kept showing up...

1889
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:53,849
Emira.
Frankie.

1890
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,351
...and showing off.

1891
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,728
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

1892
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,063
Well, I was hoping
I could walk you home again.

1893
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,940
Oh. All right.

1894
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,570
He was just incredibly sweet,

1895
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,946
a perfect gentleman.

1896
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,617
Never made a pass
or came on strong again.

1897
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,454
And he didn't curse around me.

1898
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,055
Hey, Frankie.

1899
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:34,056
Hey, Emira.

1900
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,725
I brought you a present.

1901
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,394
Where'd you find the puppy?

1902
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,895
At the pound.

1903
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:41,188
Can't resist him, huh?

1904
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,106
Oh, it is hard.
He's so cute.

1905
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:46,943
Mmm. What's smelling
so good?

1906
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,445
Chicken and gravy.

1907
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,198
Pecan pie.

1908
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,449
You hungry?

1909
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,119
You know, Eddie was right.

1910
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,872
You sure can cook.

1911
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,081
Thanks.

1912
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,624
The Greens are from my garden.

1913
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,125
We would've had carrots,

1914
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,127
but the rabbits had
a feast this week.

1915
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,379
Yeah?

1916
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,130
Well, um, I could make
a net box for you,

1917
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,298
if you like.

1918
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,341
Really?

1919
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,136
For a city boy,

1920
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,138
he was pretty handy
with a hammer...

1921
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,642
Just right at home gardening
and working in the earth.

1922
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:19,643
Gardening!

1923
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:20,686
A hammer?

1924
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:22,145
Frankie wouldn't know a hammer

1925
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,564
if it hit him in the head.

1926
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:24,899
Please, Peter,
object to something,

1927
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,900
'cause gardening?

1928
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,276
She got to be lying.

1929
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:30,028
Then one day he just floored me.

1930
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,490
Oh, man.

1931
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,158
That was such a good movie.

1932
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,493
Yeah. This way.

1933
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,203
Wow.

1934
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,671
Um, Emira...

1935
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,673
I wrote something for you.

1936
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:50,800
Really?

1937
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,050
Yeah.

1938
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,513
I hope you like it.

1939
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,557
Uh, don't laugh.

1940
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,184
All right.

1941
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,185
Here goes.

1942
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,524
"The wonder of you fills me up,

1943
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,526
"takes me to your depths,

1944
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,528
"and I bare my soul to you,

1945
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,739
"o cherished queen of Sheba.

1946
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,532
"When you smile,

1947
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,159
you give light."

1948
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,078
"When you speak..."

1949
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:23,540
"You give life."

1950
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,042
"And when you leave,

1951
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,628
you take my love."

1952
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,548
I fell in love at that moment.

1953
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,716
I-it's not finished.

1954
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,134
I still have some more work...

1955
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,636
Oh, I love it.

1956
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,554
I love it. It's great.

1957
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,556
Next day, we got engaged,

1958
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,725
and about a month later,
we got married.

1959
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,027
Thank you. Thank you.

1960
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,766
Don't look.

1961
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,101
Oh. Oh, right, right.
I won't look.

1962
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,271
I mean, until you tell me...

1963
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,148
When I should look.

1964
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,489
Ready?

1965
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,332

but every now and then,

1979
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,172
I'd just catch him in a place

Frank G. Lymon.

2006
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:36,733
Yes.

2007
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,276
Come with us.

2008
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,736
For what?
What's the problem?

2009
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,030
Absent without leave.

2010
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:42,238
Wait. There must be
some misunderstanding.

2011
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,239
Frankie, wait.

2012
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:44,240
No misunderstanding.

2013
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,450
Wait. What's wrong?

2014
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,243
Listen, there's some
misunderstanding.

2015
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,079
Get in the back of the Jeep.

2016
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:51,289
Wait. Where
you taking him?

2017
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,250
It's ok. It's ok.

2018
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:55,585
I'll handle this, all right?

2019
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:56,920
Just go back in the house.

2020
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,548
He had been awol for four months,

2021
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,092
and he was
dishonorably discharged.

2022
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,218
Mrs. Lymon,

2023
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:04,720
can you tell us

2024
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,763
how long you were
married to Frankie?

2025
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,932
I'm still married to Frankie.

2026
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,017
Thank you, ma'am.

2027
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,187
No further questions,
your honor.

2028
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,188
All right,

2029
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,106
we'll take our lunch recess

2030
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,774
and resume again at 1:30.

2031
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,226
Thank you.

2032
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,453
Prissy little thing, ain't she?

2033
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,871
Mm-hmm.

2034
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,711
Doesn't seem
like Frankie's type.

2035
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,047
Seem like anything in a dress

2036
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,423
was Frankie's type.

2037
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,885
Bringing a book to lunch.

2038
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,263
Shit, she should've brought
a damn hairdresser.

2039
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:12,347
Ooh!

2040
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:15,767
That was a good one.

2041
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:17,853
Hmm.

2042
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,229
Aw, Zola.

2043
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,441
You know what I'm thinking?

2044
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,569
I'm thinking 50% of something

2045
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,281
is sure better
than 100% of nothin'.

2046
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:31,908
Look, wait, wait.
Check it out.

2047
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,577
If I win, we split it 50-50.

2048
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,413
You win, same thing.

2049
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,791
Are you trying to get
in cahoots with me?

2050
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,084
Yeah.

2051
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,585
'Cause I know
I was with Frankie,

2052
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,046
and I know you was with Frankie.

2053
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,047
But her?

2054
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:47,381
She was with Frankie, too?

2055
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,012
Deal?

2056
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:55,682
Deal.

2057
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,600
What do you mean
you made a deal?

2058
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:58,977
Mr. Markowitz.

2059
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,270
No, because it's unconscionable

2060
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,105
for you to cut a deal
and not include me.

2061
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:03,940
Mr. Markowitz!

2062
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,192
I'm sorry.

2063
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:07,694
Is our little hearing
interrupting you?

2064
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,321
I apologize, your honor.

2065
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:11,489
Your cross, please.

2066
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:14,701
Behave.

2067
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:17,620
Uh, miss Eagle,

2068
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,664
when was the last time
you saw Frankie Lymon?

2069
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,125
This is my favorite.

2070
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,626
Little Laura
made this one for me...

2071
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,128
You know,
from my second grade class?

2072
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,298
Oh, Frankie, there's the door.

2073
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,424
Put the, uh... this one up, too.

2074
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:32,468
Yeah!

2075
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,553
Postman!

2076
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,138
Got a package for Frankie Lymon.

2077
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,223
Oh, all right.

2078
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,850
Sign right there, bro.
You Frankie Lymon?

2079
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:39,851
Yeah.

2080
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:40,894
The singer?

2081
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:42,645
Yeah.

2082
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,646
For real?

2083
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,773
Yeah.

2084
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,109
Oh, man, wait till
I tell my wife.

2085
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,153
I thought you was dead.

2086
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:52,655
Man, we used to dance to
your stuff all the time.

2087
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,157
Man, you great.
You're fantastic.

2088
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,159
Have a happy holiday.
God bless you.

2089
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,411
Frankie Lymon.

2090
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:59,162
I delivered a package
to Frankie Lymon.

2091
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,705
Ha ha! Wow.

2092
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:02,707
Merry Christmas.

2093
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:14,177
I know you don't understand
this music business,

2094
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,679
but you're in school,
and you're a teacher.

2095
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:17,680
You know...

2096
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,515
No, Frankie.
I understand.

2097
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:20,683
Ok. Ok.

2098
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,685
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2099
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:23,686
Your book.

2100
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,188
Yeah.

2101
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:26,689
Your poetry book.

2102
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:27,690
Here.

2103
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:28,691
Oh, great.

2104
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,193
I'm so happy you understand

2105
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,446
that this is what
I gotta do, you know?

2106
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:33,989
It's my life.

2107
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,949
Frankie!

2108
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:36,992
Your lunch.

2109
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,952
Oh! My lunch. Yeah.
All right.

2110
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,954
And, uh, I want you
to make me a pecan pie,

2111
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,956
so when I get back

2112
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,458
I can have something
nice for dessert.

2113
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:45,459
Ok.

2114
01:31:45,499 --> 01:31:46,460
All right.

2115
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,961
I been thinking...

2116
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:49,629
Let's start a family, you know?

2117
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,631
I mean, we got such
a good life here.

2118
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,133
We should share it
with somebody.

2119
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:54,634
I love you.

2120
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,969
I love you.

2121
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,471
Mmm.
I love you, too.

2122
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:58,721
Gotta go.

2123
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,474
But you think about
a family, all right?

2124
01:32:00,514 --> 01:32:01,475
Ok.

2125
01:32:01,515 --> 01:32:02,684
I'll miss you!

2126
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:04,186
I'll miss you, too.
I'll be back soon.

2127
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:05,479
Ok.

2128
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:06,980
Call me when you get there, ok?

2129
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:07,981
All right.

2130
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:09,024
All right.

2131
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,489
That was the last time
I saw him...

2132
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,032
Alive.

2133
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:19,868
About a week later,

2134
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,161
Frankie's brother called me

2135
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,996
to tell me
that Frankie had overdosed.

2136
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,542
No further questions,
your honor.

2137
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,672
Do you think we could
take an hour's recess,

2138
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,007
please, ma'am?

2139
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,509
All right, Mr. Grahme.

2140
01:32:35,549 --> 01:32:37,010
Emira...

2141
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:40,013
Look, just let me
talk to you for a second.

2142
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:41,014
Emira!

2143
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,849
Emira... Emira, wait!

2144
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,184
Wasn't it enough

2145
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:45,685
I couldn't have him in life?

2146
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,521
Can't I at least
have him in death?

2147
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:49,022
No!

2148
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:51,066
None of us can.

2149
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:56,530
That flat-footed little weirdo

2150
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:58,532
played all of us.

2151
01:32:58,572 --> 01:33:00,574
He sure did.

2152
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:05,038
Why don't we go have a drink?

2153
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,040
That's a good idea.

2154
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,542
Come on.

2155
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:10,043
But I don't drink.

2156
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,295
Well, honey, you about to start.

2157
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:13,880
You can have an iced tea
or something.

2158
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,173
You don't have to drink.

2159
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:18,176
That lying, no-good,
no-bill-paying,

2160
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,053
house-losing bigamist!

2161
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,555
Please.
A <i>trigamist.</i>

2162
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:23,056
Who gardens, no less.

2163
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,558
Honey, come on.
Frankie and flowers?

2164
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:25,934
Gimme a break.

2165
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,395
I don't even know
what I saw in that little...

2166
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:30,230
It wasn't like
he was some bronze Adonis

2167
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:31,565
or some shit.

2168
01:33:31,605 --> 01:33:33,191
I thought he was talented.

2169
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,569
Ok, he could sing.

2170
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:37,070
He could <i>sing</i> me

2171
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,905
right out of my panties.

2172
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,574
I got to give it up for that.

2173
01:33:40,614 --> 01:33:42,200
The boy was a good fuck.

2174
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,913
Ohh, come on, Emira.

2175
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:49,082
Now, you know you got
that rock of Gibraltar.

2176
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,292
Come on now!

2177
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,502
You guys are talking
about my husband.

2178
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,003
Your husband?
Your husband?

2179
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,004
<i>Please.</i>

2180
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,590
He was all of our husbands.

2181
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:59,092
But I just don't understand.

2182
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,928
How could he write me
those beautiful love poems,

2183
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,764
knowing he was still married
to at least one of you?

2184
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,099
Come on now.

2185
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,601
That was Frankie being Frankie.

2186
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:09,018
Amen.

2187
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,770
Frankie just...

2188
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,772
Needed something different

2189
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,107
all the time.

2190
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,942
Something different.

2191
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,360
My god, look at us.

2192
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,529
Could we be more different?

2193
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:20,947
I mean, look at you.

2194
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,740
You're a glamorous singer.

2195
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,118
I'm just a Southern
schoolteacher.

2196
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,578
And, you, Elizabeth,
look at you.

2197
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,455
I mean, you...

2198
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:30,332
I'm not sure
what to think of you.

2199
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:33,126
I mean, no disrespect.
It's just that...

2200
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,877
What did Frankie see in you?

2201
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,171
Ooh.

2202
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,549
Girl, now,
what you talking about?

2203
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,134
Shoot, back in the day,

2204
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:43,136
I was a sho'nuff fine
foxy thing.

2205
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,138
Tell her, Zola.
You was there. Tell her.

2206
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,640
I was there and...

2207
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,308
She was all right.

2208
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,144
No, you didn't.

2209
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:52,145
But foxy?

2210
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,647
You were more poodley.

2211
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,734
Forget y'all.
Whatever.

2212
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,071
Hey.

2213
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,949
Maybe there were
three separate Frankies,

2214
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,118
and each of us got a piece.

2215
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,040
I think Frankie was like
that broken record.

2216
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,834
Maybe that's what happened
that last day.

2217
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,421
It got so painful...

2218
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,674
He couldn't put himself
back together.

2219
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,469
I just wish
we would've been there

2220
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:26,804
to save Frankie
from himself that day.

2221
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,640
Girl, you don't know
how many times

2222
01:35:28,682 --> 01:35:30,475
I tried to save Frankie
over the years.

2223
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:32,018
Shoot, he wore me out.

2224
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:34,979
It just couldn't be done.

2225
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:37,482
I wonder who this next
surprise witness is.

2226
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:39,484
Better not be another woman.

2227
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,379
Hey, how you doing?

2228
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:00,589
All right.

2229
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,382
Frankie Lymon here
to see Morris Levy.

2230
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,050
Do you have an appointment?

2231
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:06,886
Uh, no.
Uh, not... not actually.

2232
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:09,138
Uh, I'm an old friend.

2233
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,806
He knows me, you know?

2234
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:11,974
Uh-huh.

2235
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,226
Mr. Levy?

2236
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,395
A Mr. Frankie Lemon
is here to see you.

2237
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:16,688
No, no, no.
Frankie Lymon.

2238
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:17,731
Get rid of him.

2239
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:19,357
Hey, Morris!
Long time no see.

2240
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:20,734
Excuse me!

2241
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:22,736
You ain't got a minute
to talk to an old buddy

2242
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:24,571
who's made you
a couple million bucks?

2243
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:26,906
Hey, Frankie, your last
album was eight years ago,

2244
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,158
so don't pull the "old
friend" bullshit on me.

2245
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,410
Now, what can I do for you?

2246
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:32,786
Look, I'm glad you asked.

2247
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:34,706
All right, I'm gonna be
straight with you, Morris.

2248
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,249
I'm ready to get back out there.

2249
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,460
Now, I went down south
for a while, and I got married,

2250
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,045
but I've still been writing
and still singing, man,

2251
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,796
and people still
seem to know who I am.

2252
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:45,049
Jeez, where are the violins?

2253
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,593
No, you don't understand.
I still can do the sp...

2254
01:36:46,635 --> 01:36:48,010
Well, I can't do
the splits right now,

2255
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,012
but I'm telling you,
I still got it.

2256
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,222
Still got it?
Yeah.

2257
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,600
Who the fuck cares,
you still got it?

2258
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:56,102
In case you don't know it,
doo-wop is dead.

2259
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,563
The Beatles stomped it out,
Motown kicked it out,

2260
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:00,982
and Hendrix
took it someplace else.

2261
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:02,275
Now get out of my office.

2262
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,777
No, no, wait, man.
Listen.

2263
01:37:03,817 --> 01:37:05,153
Let me just do a demo
or something.

2264
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:06,780
Why don't you call one
of your cronies up and...

2265
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,947
And what?

2266
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,532
Tell them I got
a blackballed junkie

2267
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,701
in my office
looking for a comeback?

2268
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,119
Hold on now, Morris.

2269
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,246
You're taking it
too far now, ok?

2270
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,498
I'm not a junkie any...

2271
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,541
I don't shoot up, man.
I'm clean.

2272
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,293
Please! You shoot up,

2273
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:21,877
and you're a no-show at gigs.

2274
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:25,131
Hey, only an asshole
takes a chance on a junkie.

2275
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,300
I told you I'm not
a fucking junkie!

2276
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,718
Didn't you just hear me?!

2277
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,261
Do you know who the fuck
you're talking to, huh?

2278
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:31,971
You see what I mean?!
This is why

2279
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,556
you're not booked
at the Orpheum tonight!

2280
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,308
You understand that?
You're a crazed maniac.

2281
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,559
Look, Morris...

2282
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,935
You're not a cute kid
anymore, Frankie.

2283
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,604
You're a loser,
you're a has-been,

2284
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:41,272
and you're a fuckin'
drug addict!

2285
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:43,149
Now get your fuckin'
ass out of here.

2286
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,818
You're fuckin' dead!

2287
01:37:44,858 --> 01:37:46,944
Get security up here.

2288
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:48,613

He was so talented.

2358
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:17,441
Mr. Levy, do you
know what this is?

2359
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:20,695
Yeah. Sure. It's <i>why</i>
<i>do fools fall in love.</i>

2360
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:24,782
Oh, uh, Mr. Levy, whose names
appear as songwriters on this?

2361
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:26,199
Lymon and Levy.

2362
01:43:26,241 --> 01:43:29,037
Uh-huh. Well,
how did this come about,

2363
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:31,164
you writing the song
with Frankie?

2364
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:32,456
I don't understand.

2365
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,876
Did you two sit down
together at the piano,

2366
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,502
uh, he plays some music...

2367
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:38,838
No, no, no.
You get together,

2368
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,256
and you kind of put the words

2369
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,634
and the music together.
You get a beat going.

2370
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:44,802
I mean, I'm not saying

2371
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:46,721
that I'm writing
songs like Chopin.

2372
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:47,763
Like Chopin.

2373
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:52,560
That's very funny.
Very funny, Mr. Levy.

2374
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:55,897
It's not quite as funny
as this, though.

2375
01:43:55,938 --> 01:44:00,902
Now, whose names are listed
as songwriters on this record?

2376
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:03,278
It's "Lymon, Santiago,
and Goldner."

2377
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,322
Uh-huh. As in
Herman Santiago,

2378
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,658
the original lead singer
of The Teenagers?

2379
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,077
What's the name of this song?

2380
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,411
<i>Why do fools fall in love.</i>

2381
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:12,121
<i>Why do fools fall in love.</i>

2382
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,332
So, in fact, Mr. Levy,
you didn't write the song.

2383
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:17,376
You just slapped your name on it

2384
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,420
so you could collect
songwriter royalties

2385
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:21,089
and copyright entitlements.

2386
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,132
Listen, counselor,
I'm a businessman.

2387
01:44:23,174 --> 01:44:24,633
It was just business.

2388
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:28,054
Mr. Levy, how much money
have you made over the years

2389
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:30,639
from the song
<i>why do fools fall in love?</i>

2390
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,640
Who knows?

2391
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,266
Try $4 million, Mr. Levy.

2392
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:34,602
$4 million!

2393
01:44:34,643 --> 01:44:36,104
Shh.

2394
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:38,940
And how much of
that money, Mr. Levy,

2395
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,274
have you tried to pay
to Frankie Lymon's estate?

2396
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:42,944
I got accountants
for that kind of stuff.

2397
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:46,488
The answer is zero,
Mr. Levy. Nothing.

2398
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:49,282
Not one single penny,
Mr. Levy!

2399
01:44:49,324 --> 01:44:50,785
No further questions,
your honor.

2400
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,078
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

2401
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,328
You're all acting

2402
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,664
like I was the only one
doing business that way.

2403
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:57,625
Everyone was doing it.
Every record producer,

2404
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,961
every owner of a label,
every promoter.

2405
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,796
It was standard
industry practice.

2406
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:03,256
All right, Mr. Levy,
that's enough.

2407
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,966
And another thing, there
would be no Frankie Lymon

2408
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:05,800
if it wasn't for me.

2409
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:07,051
I discovered him first.

2410
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:08,719
I invested in him first.

2411
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:10,429
I promoted him first.

2412
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:13,099
And you're sitting here
talking like I'm the one

2413
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:14,976
who put that smack
into his veins.

2414
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,561
All right, Mr. Levy,
I said that is enough.

2415
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:18,980
I just wanted you to know...

2416
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,856
Mr. Levy,
you are excused.

2417
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:22,191
Thank you very much.

2418
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,525
You're welcome.

2419
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:27,280
All right, we're going
to adjourn for today.

2420
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,198
We'll reconvene
tomorrow morning at 9:00

2421
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,742
at which time
I will render my decision.

2422
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:33,410
Thank you.

2423
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:34,870
Scotch and soda.

2424
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,329
Strawberry Margarita.

2425
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:37,456
Iced tea, please.

2426
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,750
Long island iced tea.

2427
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,628
$4 million. Do y'all
believe that shit?

2428
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:43,754
Mm-mmm.

2429
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:45,089
Shit, when Frankie was alive,

2430
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:47,008
he didn't have two nickels
to rub together.

2431
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,301
I heard that.

2432
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:49,927
Money like that
I only read about

2433
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:50,970
in <i>fortune</i> magazine.

2434
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:53,014
You read <i>fortune?</i>

2435
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:57,350
Yes. It's got forecasts,
futures, you know, stock tips.

2436
01:45:57,392 --> 01:45:58,602
Oh, thank you.

2437
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,063
Mmm.

2438
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:02,564
Mmm.

2439
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,735
Mmm. Mmm.

2440
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:14,743
That is delicious.

2441
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:17,163
That long island iced tea
flavoring is tasty.

2442
01:46:17,205 --> 01:46:18,998
Ooh, excuse me.

2443
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

2444
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:22,251
Ooh.

2445
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:29,050
You know, I wish we could
rethink this whole court case

2446
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,219
and refuse to let
our lives be dictated

2447
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,888
by Morris and Frankie
and all these vultures.

2448
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:36,057
Honey, I wish we could
tell our lawyers

2449
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:39,643
to kiss our big butts.

2450
01:46:39,685 --> 01:46:41,812
Well, here is to telling
all of our lawyers

2451
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:43,898
to kiss our big butts.

2452
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,566
Big butts!

2453
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:47,902
Juicy booties.

2454
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:51,404
Ooh, 'cause I know my butt
has gotten a little big.

2455
01:46:51,446 --> 01:46:52,698
But you know what, ladies?

2456
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,576
Why don't we tell all
of them where to go

2457
01:46:55,617 --> 01:46:57,452
and walk out of here friends?

2458
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:59,038
Baby, I could be
a much better friend

2459
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,373
with 4 million bucks.

2460
01:47:00,413 --> 01:47:02,583
Wait. If we do your plan,
we can all...

2461
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:03,625
What plan?

2462
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:04,960
What are you talking about?

2463
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:06,962
Wasn't it you that said
50% of something

2464
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:08,756
is better than no percent
of nothing?

2465
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:10,258
Then you split
your 50% with her.

2466
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:12,551
What about you?
It's gonna be 30-30-30.

2467
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:13,594
Excuse me.

2468
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:16,805
Excuse me!

2469
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,182
What are y'all talking about?

2470
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,142
'Cause whatever it is,
it sounds illegal to me.

2471
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:22,103
No.
No.

2472
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:23,104
It's not illegal.

2473
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:25,189
It is not illegal.

2474
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,941
It sounds illegal.

2475
01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:28,109
We can do what we want.

2476
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,235
It was her idea.

2477
01:47:29,277 --> 01:47:30,819
It sounds illegal to me.

2478
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:32,405
Fuck it, all right?

2479
01:47:32,445 --> 01:47:35,157
Look, here's the deal:
Whoever won, me and her,

2480
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,867
we was gonna split it 50-50.

2481
01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:38,244
Now we can cut you in.

2482
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:39,954
We don't need to leave here

2483
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,332
until we can make
a deal to get paid.

2484
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:44,959
Come on, Emira.

2485
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,878
That is a million-
three-hundred gs each.

2486
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,381
Each?

2487
01:47:50,423 --> 01:47:51,424
Each.
Each.

2488
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,097
Well, I could use a new car.

2489
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,808
You could get yourself
a Cadillac, girl.

2490
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:02,101
Brougham!

2491
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:06,647
Ooh, well, that is
Kool and The Gang!

2492
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:08,149
Yeah!

2493
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:10,776
I knew we could get her.

2494
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:14,863
♪ Met someone who knocked you
back off your heels ♪

2495
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:16,698
♪ Goody goody ♪

2496

♪ You met someone, and now

2497
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,458
What was at issue in this case

2498
01:48:25,498 --> 01:48:28,461
was determining which
of the three alleged widows

2499
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:32,340
is the lawful surviving
spouse of Frankie Lymon.

2500
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:35,009
Widow number one,
Elizabeth Waters,

2501
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,510
claimed
that she and Frankie Lymon

2502
01:48:37,552 --> 01:48:39,930
lived as common-law
husband and wife

2503
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:42,808
and that they were married
in a civil ceremony

2504
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,185
in the state of Virginia,

2505
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:45,853
and all of this, apparently,

2506
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:48,730
while she was still married
to someone else.

2507
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,986
Now, widow number two,
Zola Taylor,

2508
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:55,363
claims that she married
Frankie Lymon

2509
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:57,948
in either Tijuana or Mexicali,

2510
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:59,492
depending upon which day
of the week it is.

2511
01:48:59,532 --> 01:49:03,120
But, unfortunately,
miss Taylor was unable

2512
01:49:03,162 --> 01:49:05,831
to provide any substantive proof

2513
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,501
of either her marriages
or her divorces.

2514
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:12,171
Which brings us
to widow number three,

2515
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:13,839
Emira Eagle,

2516
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,633
who was married to Frankie
in a church ceremony

2517
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,677
replete with white wedding gown

2518
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,347
and a honeymoon suite
in Augusta, Georgia,

2519
01:49:21,389 --> 01:49:24,683
and all of this would
have been well and good,

2520
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,685
except for the fact
that New York state

2521
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,229
upholds the Pennsylvania law

2522
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,105
which recognizes
common-law marriage

2523
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:31,857
as legal and binding.

2524
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:35,194
And since Elizabeth continued
to live with Frankie

2525
01:49:35,236 --> 01:49:37,570
after her divorce
from Charles Phillips

2526
01:49:37,612 --> 01:49:41,409
and based on the statutes...
<i>Cross vs. Cross,</i>

2527
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:43,285
<i>commonwealth vs. Highland,</i>

2528
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:44,828
<i>and Skinner vs. Skinner...</i>

2529
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:48,707
Both the common-law marriage
and the Virginia marriage

2530
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:50,042
were indeed valid,

2531
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:52,627
and since neither marriage
was dissolved

2532
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,547
at the time of Frankie's death,

2533
01:49:54,587 --> 01:49:56,382
it is the determination
of this court

2534
01:49:56,424 --> 01:50:01,262
that the lawful, surviving
spouse of frank Joseph Lymon

2535
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:03,305
is Elizabeth Waters Lymon.

2536
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:04,765
Yeah!
Yes!

2537
01:50:04,806 --> 01:50:06,392
I told you!

2538
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:08,227
Yes! Yes! Yes!

2539
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:09,395
We did it!

2540
01:50:09,437 --> 01:50:11,105
Aah!

2541
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:13,732
Stop! See,
she said that we won,

2542
01:50:13,774 --> 01:50:15,734
so that mean that y'all lost,

2543
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:16,985
so talk to the hand,

2544
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,904
'cause me and my counselor
got to go.

2545
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:20,114
What?!

2546
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:22,950
You Jheri curl-wearing,
ghetto bitch!

2547
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:24,617
I'm gonna whup your ass!

2548
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:25,911
Order in the court.

2549
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,747
Elizabeth won

2550
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:32,126
and told the rest of us
exactly where to go.

2551
01:50:33,626 --> 01:50:34,962
She got us.

2552
01:50:35,003 --> 01:50:36,547
But, you know, hey,
I didn't really care,

2553
01:50:36,589 --> 01:50:39,383
because I was tired of
the courts and the lawyers

2554
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:40,968
and the whole thing anyway.

2555
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,470
I wasn't having it.

2556
01:50:42,511 --> 01:50:44,805
I filed suit in
the U.S. court of appeals.

2557
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:47,808
It was a mess.
It took years.

2558
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:49,602
But they ruled in my favor.

2559
01:50:49,642 --> 01:50:51,270
So, you see,

2560
01:50:51,312 --> 01:50:54,607
the schoolteacher
won Frankie's estate after all.

2561
01:50:54,647 --> 01:50:58,860
But the final tee-hee-hee
was on her.

2562
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,989
See, Frankie's estate wasn't
nowhere near no $4 million.

2563
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,616
And after all miss thing's

2564
01:51:03,656 --> 01:51:06,577
lawyers' legal fees
and expenses,

2565
01:51:06,619 --> 01:51:09,288
she only ended up with 15 grand.

2566
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,663
The same amount

2567
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:13,417
that Morris had offered her
from jump street.

2568
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:15,836
Now, ain't that nothin'?

2569
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,129
Well, honey,
I could've told them

2570
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:19,256
wasn't none of them
gonna get no money!
