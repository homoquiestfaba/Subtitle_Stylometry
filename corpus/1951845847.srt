Her name is Mariposa.

And she's
a butterfly fairy.

Mariposa lived
in faraway Flutterfield.

cannot help
but notice them.

the Prince never
went out in public.

True,
so when he does,

161

it will be to
fall in love.

162
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,791
With me.
Or me.

163
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,534
My turn now.

00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:28,536
Why do you think
you'd fall in love
with the Prince?

165

(GIGGLING)

184
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,219
I love it.
Oh yes.

185
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,594
I will look
gorgeous in this.

186
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,998
Can I ask
you guys
something?

187
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,697
Do you ever feel,

188
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,573
I don't know,
like you
don't belong?

189
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,446
(LAUGHING)

190
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,152
Why would we?

191
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,897
What do you do when it's not
enough to just be you?

192
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,132
You steal the me
you want to be.

193
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,175
(LAUGHING)

194
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:46,177
(SIGHING) So long,
Queen Marabella!

195
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:51,716
Time for your servant
to get the respect
she deserves.

196
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:54,510
(LAUGHING WICKEDLY)

197
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,716
I want to
go in first.

198
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,387
No way!
I am going in first.

199
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,730
I can't believe
you actually
found thistleburst.

200
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,926
Yeah?
I can't believe
I didn't gag!

201
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,992
The whole place
smelled like feet!

202
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,130
Willa, Mariposa.
Don't go too far.

203
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,835
We want you around
if we need anything.

204
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,301
Hey!

205
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,403
(GRUNTING)

206
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,178
Hmm. Let me guess.

207
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,346
You wanna
sit this one out.

208
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,081
Do you mind
if I don't go in?

209
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,786
I'm just gonna stay
around the palace.

210
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,861
Okay,
I'll see you
when it's over.

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,494
So I grabbed the rapscallion
and thwarted his evil plan,

212
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:50,304
rescuing Flutterfield
from the brink
of certain disaster.

213
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,344
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

214
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,111
Impressive.

215
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:58,474
At least it
would be, if it ever
actually happened.

216
00:13:58,551 --> 00:13:59,575
It didn't?

217
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,778
Please.

218
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:04,152
Lord Gastrous
may be the Queen's
chief adviser,

219
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,453
but he's
never dealt
with anything tougher

220
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,790
than what to have
for breakfast.

221
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,624
Are you coming in?

222
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,356
No, thank you.

223
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,568
Okay, but remember,
I meant what I said.

224
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:22,139
Stick with me
and I can get you
everything you want.

225
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,038
Oh, thanks.

226
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:30,942
Henna!

227
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,317
You dropped this.

228
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,546
(GASPS)

229
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,283
Oh, thanks.

230
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,961
(EXCLAIMS)

231
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,368
Uh, hi.

232
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,644
I think this is yours.

233
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,214
Oh, I'm so sorry.

234
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,943
I didn't mean to...
It's okay.

235
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,508
No. I'm such a klutz.

236
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,918
I just got so lost
in my book, and then...

237
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,048
Wait a minute.
Are you...

238
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,557
No, no. No, I'm not.

239
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,150
You are, though.

240
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,958
The book,
it's the same one
I'm reading.

241
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,099
Oh, the...
You're right, it is.

242
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,034
Do you like it?
It's my absolute favorite.

243
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,602
Really? Mine, too.

244
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,401
I've read it nine times.

245
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,736
Ha! Ten.

246
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,373
Wow! What do you
like best about it?

247
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,913
Well, it's not safe
to leave Flutterfield,

248
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:39,111
but when I read,
I get to visit
the entire universe.

249
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,013
Most butterfly
fairies I've met

250
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,081
aren't interested
in the rest
of the universe.

251
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,327
Are you here
for the party?

252
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,387
Sort of.

253
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:53,759
I work for two
of the fairies there.

254
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,996
I could have
gone in but...
I don't know.

255
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,401
I'm not really
comfortable at parties.

256
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:00,632
Is that awful?

257
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,038
Not at all.
I feel the same way.

258
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,167
You do?

259
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,173
I'm Mariposa.

260
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,577
Oh, I'm...

00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,081
(HESITATING) Andreas.

262
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,344
Really?
Like the hero
in the book?

263
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:16,149
Exactly.
Maybe that's why
I like it so much.

264
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,186
RAYLA: Mariposa!
Oh.

265
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,384
Duty calls.

266
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,484
I hope I see you again.

267
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:24,586
Me, too.
RAYLA: Mariposa!

268
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,290
I have to go.
Bye.

269
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:30,460
Bye.

270
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,765
You found him?

271
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,501
No, Sir.
Nothing yet.

00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:46,279
Who is it?
(WHISPERING)
Mariposa. It's me.

274
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,513
Andreas?

275
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,918
Andreas,
what's going on?

276
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:54,982
I am so sorry.

277
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,260
I don't mean to startle you.
I'm not who you think I am.

278
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,766
I am Prince Carlos,
and I need your help.

279
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,823
What?

280
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,130
GUARDSMAN #1:
You, search over there.

281
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,330
It is the Royal Guard.
They are after me.

282
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,667
Why?

283
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,708
For my own protection.

284
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,504
Orders from Lord Gastrous.

285
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:14,444
GUARDSMAN #2: Hello! I need you
to open up, please.

286
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,248
Just a minute.

287
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:18,476
Listen.

288
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,382
The Queen is very ill.

289
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,444
I believe it's
Illios poisoning.

290
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,510
Illios?

291
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,057
But I thought
that poison
didn't really exist.

292
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,059
That is what
everyone thinks.

293
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,925
But Illios is
the only thing
strong enough

294
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,055
to make the Queen
as sick as she is.

295
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:36,033
Without an antidote,
we will lose her
in two days.

296
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,293
That's terrible!

297
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,428
For everyone.

298
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:40,631
Without the Queen,
the Flutterfield lights
will go out.

299
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,970
(KNOCKING)
GUARDSMAN #2:
I have to insist.

300
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,976
One more
moment, please.

301
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,808
I am giving you a map
to the Illios antidote.

302
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,816
I have memorized it,
but if the guards catch me,
and I cannot get away,

303
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,546
I need to know
someone else can follow it,
and help the Queen.

304
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,110
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
GUARDSMAN #2: Miss?

305
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,177
Why me?

306
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,156
You are the only
other fairy I know

307
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,285
who understands the world
outside Flutterfield.

308
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,726
It has to be you.

309
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,259
GUARD: That's it.
I'm coming in.

310
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,699
Oh, hi!

311
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,100
Prince Carlos
was spotted
in this area.

312
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,462
Prince Carlos?

313
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,169
No. Hmm.

314
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,071
Thank you
for your time.

315
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,139
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you.

WOMAN: Poisoned?

318
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:35,924
MAN: Well, they think it's
poison. They're not sure.

319
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,295
WILLA: Everybody's
talking about it.

320
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,264
They say
the Queen's
been poisoned.

321
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,027
But nobody knows how.

322
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,999
Is anyone
talking about Illios?

323
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,970
WILLA: Illios?
What's that?

324
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,767
MARIPOSA: Poison.
It's not supposed to
really exist...

325
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:52,072
WILLA: Queen Marabella
is sick with something real.

326
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,635
Nobody knows
if she'll even be okay.

327
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,080
You're late.
WILLA: Sorry.

328
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:04,122
We got a little distracted
worrying about the Queen.

329
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,090
Si, si.
But did you ever once think

330
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,786
what the Queen's
illness means for me?

331
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,322
Of course.
We weren't thinking.

332
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,432
You and Rayla
must be worried, too.

333
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,028
Yes, worried that
our attendants would not
be here to help plan

334
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,868
our "Get Well, Marabella"
party tonight.

335
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,034
Here's everything we need.

336
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,474
Now hurry!

337
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,707
More thistleburst.

338
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:30,976
As much as you can find.

339
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,678
We want our
whole house
to sparkle.

340
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,448
(MOCKING) "We want the
whole house to sparkle."

341
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:40,852
Go, go.

342
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:42,688
(SIGHING)

343
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:44,524
RAYLA: Mariposa, come here.

344
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,558
You have to get
our house ready.

345
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,691
We need
to glitterize
every inch.

346
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:49,893
And then...

347
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,834
Rayla, I have
the biggest scoop ever.

348
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,895
What? Tell me.

349
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,497
Prince Carlos

350
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:59,168
has been locked up
in the palace
for his own protection.

351
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,873
He's in danger.

352
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,812
That's so romantic.

353
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,043
Isn't it?

354
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:11,122
Hey! You have
work to do.

355
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:13,313
(SIGHS) Yes.

356
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:15,622
I think I do
have work to do.

357
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,121
The Prince
gave me this map.

358
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,423
The Prince!
The Prince!

359
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,991
Okay, you need to
spill, spill!

360
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,697
He needs me to
find the antidote

361
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,637
that will save
the Queen.

362
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,765
I want to see it.

363
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,866
No way.

364
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,374
So it's true.

365
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,981
Of course it's true.

366
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,618
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

367
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,846
We are going
to get the antidote.

368
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:45,948
What?

369
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:51,122
You do not think someone
like you can be trusted
to rescue the Queen, do you?

370
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:52,356
Someone like me?

371
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,194
You will come
with us, of course.

372
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,063
To carry snacks
and things.

373
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:59,400
Flutter corn, fairycakes.
I will make you a list.

374
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,962
But we will be the ones
to save Flutterfield,

375
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,669
win the Queen's
undying gratitude,

376
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,610
and the greatest
reward imaginable.

377
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,610
The Prince.
The Prince.

378
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,516
I don't think
you understand
what you're saying.

379
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,679
The map leads
out of Flutterfield,

380
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,745
into Skeezite
territory.

381
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:20,724
We will just
make it back
before dark. Easy.

382
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,124
But...
No buts.

383
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,719
Now pack our bags
and let's go!

384
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,094
Okay.

385
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,805
ELINA: So the three fairies
set out to follow
the Prince's map.

386
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:36,898
They were a little nervous
when they neared
Flutterfield's edge,

387
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,343
but it was still daylight,
so it was easy to be brave.

388
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,245
This is it.
The last light
of Flutterfield.

389
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,786
According to the map
we need to go to the
center of the Bewilderness,

390
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:52,381
where we'll find
a white flower,
which must be the antidote.

391
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:55,587
We start off towards
the Cecitane mountains.

392
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,259
Beyond the lake,
that way.

393
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,731
I've never been outside
the city. Have you?

394
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,940
For the
greatest reward
imaginable.

395
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,508
For my soon to be husband,
Prince Carlos.

396
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,477
For hope.

397
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,940
For all of us.

398
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,314
(CHITTERING)

399
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,257
Bibble, what are you doing?

400
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,795
(CHITTERING)

401
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,353
You're protesting?

402
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,294
You don't think
they should leave?

403
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:39,633
(CHITTERING)

404
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,773
You're right.
Leaving Flutterfield is scary.

405
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:47,073
But if they don't go,
all Flutterfield
could be destroyed.

406
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,782
Don't you think
there are some things
important enough to do?

407
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,317
Even if they're scary?

408
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,012
Uh, no.

409
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:57,419
Well, I think there may be.

410
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,757
Should I go back to the story?

411
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,051
Okay, then.

412
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:06,029
So, while Mariposa,
Rayna and Rayla
left Flutterfield...

413
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,963
Okay.

414
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,627
This time,
it smelled worse
than feet.

415
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,429
It's not like
the toe jammiest,

416
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:17,965
humongous
"fungus among us"
of a whole bag of feet!

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,673
Lord Gastrous,
I command you
to release me!

427
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:53,308
I'm sorry
but I can't
do that.

428
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,039
Nor can you command it.

429
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:56,604
As the Queen's chief adviser,

430
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,708
her power goes to me
when she can't rule,
not to you.

431
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,413
Which is exactly
what you want, is it not?

432
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,616
That is why you won't let me
go after the Illios antidote.

433
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:09,821
I swear, Gastrous,
if you are behind
what happened to my mother...

434
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,260
No, no, Your Highness,

435
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,697
I promise you,
I only want her
to be well.

436
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,701
But if the worst happens,

437
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:20,535
Flutterfield needs
you to be here,
safe and ready to rule.

438
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:25,339
Not off risking your life,
chasing a cure for a poison
that doesn't exist.

439
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:28,707
I'm sorry,
but I have
no other choice.

440

Lord Gastrous!

441
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,018
Mariposa,

442
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,154
I hope you're
in better shape
than I am.

443
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:56,272
(MOANING) How can we
not be there yet?

444
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:59,208
Maybe if I had
held the map,
we'd be there.

445
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:00,540
You just wanted
to hold it

446
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,842
so you could
tell the Prince
you were in charge.

447
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,382
So did you.

448
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:05,438
Hey.

They rely on smell.

534
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,189
You don't suppose
there's the
slightest chance in...

535
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,318
Gastrous!

536
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:47,058
I wish as much
as anyone that
we could help the Queen.

537
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:51,695
But everyone knows
Illios doesn't exist.

538
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:55,534
Prince Carlos
is clutching
at fairytales.

539
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,803
Probably, but...

540
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,468
But, you're in charge.

541
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:02,911
If you think
it's wise to put
fairies at risk,

542
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:06,314
searching the world
for an Illios antidote,

543
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:09,410
you have
my complete support.

544
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,952
No, no.
It's ridiculous,
of course.

545
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:19,325
Perhaps you should
check in on the prince.

546
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:20,762
Oh, I will.

547
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,431
Minute you know
something,
let me know.

548
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:28,098
The second.

549
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,198
Of course.

550
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:36,939
Not long now,
Queen Marabella.

551
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:40,280
And I will rule
all of Flutterfield.

552
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,513
Price Carlos,
I am Willa.
Mariposa sent me.

553
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:17,380
(SIGHS)
You prince,

554
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:19,150
me Will...

555
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:20,213
(MUFFLED)

556
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:26,259
Mariposa!

557
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,402
Mariposa!

558
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:34,665
(GASPS) Mariposa!

559
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,141
GASTROUS: Prince Carlos!

560
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,045
Is everything okay in here?
I thought I heard something.

561
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,514
No. No, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.

562
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:49,611
Except, I was hoping
for a little fresh air.

563
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,155
Could you
open the doors?

564
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:56,489
But, Prince Carlos,
we must keep the door shut
for your own protection.

565
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,290
Just while
you are here.

566
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,058
You will be able
to protect me.

567
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,164
Of course!

568
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:15,110
We are doing
everything we can
to comfort the Queen.

569
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,412
But if you only
let me out
using the key.

570
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:23,352
Oh, we cannot
take the risk,
Prince Carlos.

571
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:28,552
I understand. But the key
on your belt can free me
to comfort the Queen.

572
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:32,256
It is more important
that we keep you safe.

573
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,230
I understand.

574
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:35,391
You do?

575
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,903
And I appreciate
you looking out
for my safety.

576
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,272
Well, it is my duty.
And one that I take
very seriously.

577
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,209
Of course.

578
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,909
Has there been
any change?

579
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:55,111
Not yet.
But I am hopeful.

580
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:00,357
It is your hope
that sustains us,
Lord Gastrous.

581
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:03,585
Thank you,
Prince Carlos.

582
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:06,460
Will you let me know
if there are any changes?

583
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:09,398
Of course,
Prince Carlos.
The second.

584
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,566
So you're the prince.

585
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,872
Please. My name is Carlos.

586
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,468
Hello, Carlos.

587
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,242
And you're
a friend of Mariposa?

588
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:26,113
I'm Willa.

589
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:27,742
Thank you, Willa.

590
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:28,808
You're welcome.

591
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:29,876
At last.

592
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,184
I must find
the antidote.

593
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:35,055
Oh, first we have
to find out
what Henna is up to.

594
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,354
Henna?

595
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,362
She's the one
who poisoned the Queen.

596
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,454
What?

597
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,522
I saw her
giving the Queen
a tonic.

598
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,126
She said she wants
to take over
Flutterfield.

599
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:46,431
Come on!

600
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,547
What is this place?

601
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:05,750
Hey!
What?

602
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,018
What was that for?

603
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,684
I did not
do anything.

604
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,854
Hey! I said
I did not do anything.

605
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:15,524
I know. I heard you.

606
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,260
So why did you hit me?

607
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,324
I did not.

608
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:20,530
You guys,
let's not fight.

609
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:23,802
We need to find the antidote.

610
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,933
Hey!

611
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,442
What?
What?

612
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:29,245
(LAUGHING)

613
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,346
Uh-oh.

614
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:40,922
HI. I'm Zinzie.
Zinzie, the Mewah.

615
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,256
You are the one
throwing seeds at us,
are you not?

616
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,327
Uh-huh.

617
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:47,729
Why would you do that?

618
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,063
It's funny.
You should've
seen your faces.

619
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:51,397
(LAUGHING)

620
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:54,436
That's not very nice.

621
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:55,530
It's not?

622
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,599
Well, I wasn't trying
to be not nice.
I just wanted to play.

623
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,871
I don't see anyone in
the Bewilderness a lot.

624
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:02,571
And it gets
really Ionely.

625
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:05,115
Wait! Did you say,
"The Bewilderness"?

626
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,549
Sure, that's where we are.

627
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:08,847
ZINZIE: The Bewilderness.

628
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,046
MARIPOSA: Yes!

629
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,318
The Archer.
You are a genius.

630
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,325
(CHUCKLING)

631
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,622
(ZINZIE EXCLAIMING)

632
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,187
What are you doing?

633
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:20,731
Celebrating.

634
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:25,529
Look. We need you
to take us to the center
of the Bewilderness.

635
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:28,800
But, that's such
a long way.
It's so dangerous.

636
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,967
Only a Mewah brave
and courageous enough
could take you there.

637
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,342
Zinzie, you like
flutter corn, right?

638
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:37,074
Flutter corn!

639
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,718
That heavenly crunch.
That delectable aroma.

640
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,183
Mmm-hmm?

641
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:46,553
A whole bag of it.
And it's all for you,

642
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:49,957
if you take us
to the center of
the Bewilderness.

643
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:53,464
Yes. Give me.
Give me, give me,
give me. Oh, give me.

644
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,294
Here you go.

645
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,096
Flutter corn!

646
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,865
(MUNCHING)
ZINZIE: Oh, this is so good.

647
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:01,997
Oh!

648
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,110
Want some? Kidding!
It's all mine.

649
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:10,204
Every little crunchy, sweet,
deliciously delectable...

650
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,217
Here we are.

651
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:17,118
This is the center
of the Bewilderness?

652
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:18,277
ZINZIE: Ha ha!

653
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:23,360
I don't understand.
There's supposed to be
a white flower here.

654
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,888
There is.
Right here.

655
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,900
That is the flower
from the map.

656
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:36,429
Maybe the antidote
is not a real flower.

657
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,509
Maybe it is this rock!

658
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:41,909
I don't think so.
I think this is another map.

659
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,641
MARIPOSA: I think
we have to find
this mermaid,

660
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:45,615
and she can tell us
where the flower is.

661
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,480
But where
do we find mermaids?

662
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,349
I know. They live
in the Water Rose.

663
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,978
I can take you there
if you want.

664
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,751
And what
do you want
in return?

665
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:55,986
Flutter corn. Please.

666
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,621
Done.

667
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,720
(WHOOPS)

668
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,260
Oh, flutter corn.

669
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:05,335
Mmm. Yum!

670
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:06,597
(MUNCHING)

671
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:10,199
Hi, Henna.
Henna.

672
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:11,537
Hi. How are you?

673
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,598
It's good to see you.

674
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:13,644
HENNA: Thank you.

675
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:16,236
Are you sure
it was Henna
who poisoned the Queen?

676
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:17,303
Yes!

677
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:19,350
But we have been
following her for hours

678
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,749
and she has done
nothing out
of the ordinary.

679
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,047
I'm positive
it was her.

680
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,110
HENNA: Good bye.

681
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:26,622
Wait, wait.
Where is she
going now?

682
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,181
See? What'd I tell you?

683
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,521
Come on.

684
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,666
What is she
doing down here?

685
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:48,371
I don't know.
But I don't like it.

686
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,277
We must find out.

687
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:51,576
(NERVOUSLY) We must?

688
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:58,245
You promised us
butterfly fairy.

689
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,881
What are they
doing here?

690
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:03,086
Yeah,
we want
butterfly fairy.

691
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:05,527
Be patient,
my little ones.

692
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:09,966
Tonight, you will have
all the butterfly fairies
you can eat.

693
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,558
But I'm hungry now.

694
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:13,900
Me, too. Hungry now.

695
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,805
BOTH: We want
butterfly fairy.

696
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,074
The light.
Oh, oh, no.

697
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:24,740
Not the light.
Can't stand the light.

698
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,842
You were saying?

699
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,114
Nothing. Saying nothing.

700
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,713
Yeah. Not hungry.
Me not hungry.

701
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,052
What kind
of light was that?

702
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,595
I don't know.
But we must find out.

703
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,460
Shouldn't we get
Gastrous first?

704
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:41,930
No, he will not
believe me.

705
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,729
I need
real evidence.

706
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:47,765
We must wait
for her to leave.

707
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,830
Oh, goody.

708
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,540
ZINZIE: The Water Rose.

709
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,046

00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,193
(GIGGLING)

889
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:04,495
SKEEZITE #1: Hey!

890
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:05,557
Uh-oh.

891
00:52:07,037 --> 00:52:08,561
What?

892
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,373
Oh. Hi.

893
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:16,435
(GASPS)

894
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,854
That smarts.

895
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:33,553
Thanks, Zinzie.

896
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,633
Looks like
we owe you.

897
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,828
Well, I'll accept
payment in flutter corn.

898
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:48,575
The Cave Of Reflection.

899
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,191
Hey.

900
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:06,251
What is this?

901
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,319
(GIGGLES)
It tickles.

902
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,125
Just whack it
between your hands.

903
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,536
Watch where
you place
those mitts.

904
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,400
You could hurt someone.

905
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:21,167
You're a fairy.

906
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:25,614
The fairy. As far as
anyone trying to enter
my cave is concerned.

907
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:27,343
Would that be you?

908
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:28,812
It would.

909
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:29,910
Hmm.

910
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:34,720
Head count.
One, two, three,
four. No, too many.

911
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,691
One of you
stops here.

912
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:40,219
I'll stop.
The rest
of you, go on.

913
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:41,730
As you wish.

914
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:51,499
Come.

915
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:58,681
Maybe we should explain.

916
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:00,876
We're looking
for the antidote
to the Illios...

917
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:02,145
Ah-ah-ah!

918
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,551
Don't speak.
Come.

919
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,219
Do you think
it is smart
to follow her?

920
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:11,261
This is where
the mermaid said
we had to go, right?

921
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:12,818
Yes.

922
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:15,797
It's exactly
where they said
you had to go.

923
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:17,424
Hold up.

924
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:20,163
Did you just
answer yourself?

925
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:22,899
No,
my reflection did.

926
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:27,534
Come on, it is not
that weird, is it?

927
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:29,910
Oh.

928
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,211
You really think
you can avoid me
that way?

929
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,271
(SHRIEKS)

930
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:42,219
Now, two of you
can continue.

931
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:45,221
If I stop,
will she go away?

932
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:47,320
Only one way
to find out, right?

933
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:49,194
(GASPS) I will stay.

934
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:54,601
Rayla? What did you
do to my sister?

935
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,231
So impatient, this one.

936
00:54:57,307 --> 00:55:00,743
You'll see
your dear sister again
if you succeed.

937
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:07,314
If we succeed?
What is that
supposed to mean?

938
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:13,448
It means this is important,
too important to leave
to a nothing like Mariposa.

939
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,957
Stop. I never said that.

940
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:19,052
Just ignore it.
It's some kind of test.

941
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:25,227
Was that advice from a fairy
too unsure of herself
to even go to a party?

942
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:29,534
The final choice.
Only one can continue.

943
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,934
Go. Think about the glory.
Think about the rewards.

944
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:38,641
Think about the Prince, huh?
You've waited for this.

945
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:41,912
You really want Mariposa
to get it all instead?

946
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,920
She's right.
Rayna should go.
She's somebody.

947
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:49,959
Fairies listen to her.
Stay behind.

948
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:52,154
You'll only fail
if you try.

949
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:54,858
Rayna...

950
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:57,161
No. Do not
say a word.

951
00:55:57,234 --> 00:56:00,692
You are the one
who can do this.
I am sure of it.

952
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:03,936
I want to stay back.

953
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:18,278
So, your friends
have chosen you.

954
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,988
But did they
choose correctly?

955
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:26,960
And will you
choose correctly?

956
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,386
These stars
hide many things.

957
00:56:58,495 --> 00:57:01,020
One hides
the antidote
you seek.

958
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:04,261
You have
a single chance
to choose.

959
00:57:04,334 --> 00:57:05,494
But, how?

960
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:10,438
How can I choose
just one star?
There are so many.

961
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:15,911
Though now
you may not comprehend,
every riddle has an end.

962
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:19,205
Search your mind
for what you know,

963
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:23,013
and the answer
soon will show.

964
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,762
Wait. Patterns.

965
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,560
The stars always
make patterns.

966
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:45,597
There's the Unicorn.
And there's the Crown.

967
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:50,244
The Archer. There he is.

968
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:55,943
So, it's the Archer.
What does that mean?

969
00:57:56,019 --> 00:57:58,078
The Archer
is a navigator.

970
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:00,646
You can guide yourself
by the way
his arrow points.

971
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:03,318
Like the way we got
to the Bewilderness.

972
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:06,954
Okay. So what does
his arrow point to now?

973
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,123
REFLECTION:
It points to nothing.

974
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,361
Try again.

975
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:17,499
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

976
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:23,977
But that star is
where the archer's pointing.

977
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:27,073
Which means
the archer isn't what
you're looking for.

978
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:32,087
That's a little star all
by itself that doesn't fit in
with anything else in the sky.

979
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,884
It's meaningless.

980
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:43,827
No. It doesn't fit in.

981
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,461
But that
doesn't make it
meaningless at all.

982
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:48,731
Of course it does.

983
00:58:48,805 --> 00:58:51,899
No, every star
is there for a reason.

984
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:54,705
They don't have to fit in
with the other stars
to be important.

985
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:57,406
They just have to
be themselves.

986
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,971
And that star
is the one I need.

987
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:12,155
(GASPS)

988
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,291
The antidote.

989
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:21,633
It was the one star
off by itself that
made all the difference.

990
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:24,003
You feel this
in your heart.

991
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:27,305
But it's time
you saw it in yourself.

992
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:42,885
What's happening?

993
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,137
My wings.

994
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:16,251
You and your friends
will be carried back
to Flutterfield.

995
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,116
Thank you.

996
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:21,425
ZINZIE: Whoa.
Look at your wings.

997
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:25,025
Mariposa,
they are beautiful.

998
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,270
FAIRY: It is time to go.

999
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:34,142
Good luck.

1000
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:55,327
Lord Gastrous,
the remaining fairies
are now hiding

1001
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:56,797
deep within
the root neighborhood.

1002
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:58,766
Oh, thank you.

1003
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:02,032
Please tell them
there is
no need to panic.

1004
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:06,235
Even now doctors
are attending
to Queen Marabella.

1005
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,102
Oh, we are
doomed, Henna.

1006
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:14,048
I'm afraid
you may be right,
Lord Gastrous.

1007
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:17,177
It looks like
we are about to
run out of time.

1008
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:23,158
You must join
the others and hide
in the root neighborhood.

1009
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:24,318
Oh, no.

1010
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:27,693
I will be loyal
to the Queen
until the end.

1011
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,528
You truly are
a good friend,
Henna.

1012
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,261
Lord Gastrous,
it's the prince.

1013
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:35,361
Prince Carlos,
where have you been?

1014
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,303
We have been looking
for you everywhere.

1015
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:39,740
There is no time
for my explanation.

1016
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:41,970
Perhaps it is Henna
who should explain.

1017
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:43,376
Excuse me?

1018
01:01:43,446 --> 01:01:44,913
She is behind this.

1019
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,073
What?

1020
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:48,208
You poisoned the Queen.

1021
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:50,650
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1022
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,280
Henna has done nothing
to hurt the Queen.

1023
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:56,291
Then perhaps
she would like
to explain this.

1024
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:57,451
(GASPS)

1025
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:02,322
I have no idea
what you're
talking about.

1026
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:04,230
We followed you
to your lair.

1027
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,291
We saw you
with the Skeezites.

1028
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,132
We found the Illios.

1029
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:09,569
You mean...

1030
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:16,077
Yes, Gastrous,
this is all
because of me.

1031
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:17,978
Guards!

1032
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:22,314
GASTROUS: How could you,
Henna? Flutterfield
will be destroyed.

1033
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:25,411
We will all be eaten
by the Skeezites.

1034
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:27,115
Oh, will we?

1035
01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:32,487
(GASPS)

1036
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:36,465
Time for your feast,
my little friends.

1037
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:40,468
Butterfly very yum.

1038
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:41,629
Yum!

1039
01:02:41,704 --> 01:02:44,195
Give me, give me,
give me, give me!

1040
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,133
No!

1041
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:55,678
The light. It hurts.

1042
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:57,242
Away!

1043
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,311
Fear not,
my little Skeezites.

1044
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:02,324
One little light
cannot hold us all back.

1045
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,326
How about 100?

1046
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:06,588
Willa!

1047
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:09,795
(CHITTERING)

1048
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:14,300
(GROANING)

1049
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:17,230
Hold your ground!

1050
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:19,036
Guards, help them!

1051
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:29,409
Now!

1052
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:36,883
(GROANING)
I don't feel so good.

1053
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,155
You don't look
so good.

1054
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:40,287
No!

1055
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:43,298
Hey, stop it!

1056
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:45,027
How long
can we
hold them?

1057
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:48,901
Admirable effort.
But you can't hold
us off forever.

1058
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:52,271
So, when the Queen
succumbs to my poison...

1059
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:53,900
MARIPOSA: Your poison?

1060
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:57,269
Mariposa!

1061
01:03:57,347 --> 01:04:00,839
You did this.
How could you?

1062
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,613
Oh, come on,
Mariposa, you...

1063
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:04,675
(GASPS)

1064
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:07,517
Get her!

1065
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:10,986
Fire!

1066
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:14,825
Go!
We'll cover you.

1067
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:37,045
You didn't think
I'd let you spoil
my plans, did you?

1068
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:39,477
Henna! No!

1069
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:42,789
(HENNA LAUGHING WICKEDLY)

1070
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:51,296
In less than one minute,
the last of the Queen's
life force will fade away.

1071
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,930
What are you
doing this for?

1072
01:04:56,706 --> 01:05:00,608
Why serve a Queen
when you can be one?

1073
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:12,952
Why are you
fighting this,
Mariposa?

1074
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:18,551
You've never felt
like you belonged
in Marabella's kingdom.

1075
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:21,960
But you will
in mine.

1076
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,759
Join me.
Everyone will
have to love you.

1077
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:29,868
Really?

1078
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,137
You'll be adored
by every single fairy
in Flutterfield.

1079
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:36,037
Adored?

1080
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:39,548
Yes, Mariposa.
Finally you will fit in...

1081
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,081
What?

1082
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:46,586
I don't need
that anymore.

1083
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:54,420
No!

1084
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:00,958
(GASPS)

1085
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,832
Too little,
too late,
Mariposa!

1086
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:07,471
Flutterfield is mine!

1087
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:11,837
(HENNA LAUGHING WICKEDLY)

1088
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:45,770
(GASPS)

1089
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:56,854
The light! The light!

1090
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,522
My eyes!

1091
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:04,358
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

1092
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,791
Yeah!

1093
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:10,528
Oh.

1094
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:14,303
Queen Marabella?

1095
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:16,168
Oh.

1096
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:18,641
Henna...

1097
01:07:19,282 --> 01:07:21,443
The last thing
I remember...

1098
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,011
You...

1099
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:25,076
You!

1100
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:28,715
Your Majesty,
I can explain.

1101
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,589
You know,
the funniest thing
happened.

1102
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:33,094
No, not the light!

1103
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:35,661
Skeezites!

1104
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,195
This isn't over, Flutterfield!

1105
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:43,602
I will be back! Away!

1106
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:46,134
Away!

1107
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:48,206
Retreat!

1108
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,345
SKEEZITE: Got to get away.
Got to get away.

1109
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,112
Out of the way.
Get out. Hey!

1110
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:59,518
I have a feeling
there's a lot
I need to know.

1111
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:01,454
Can you help me?

1112
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:03,924
Actually, I...

1113
01:08:03,993 --> 01:08:05,517
CARLOS: I can explain.

1114
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:13,063
It's a long story.
But it all starts with
the bravery of Mariposa.

1115
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:28,511
In thanks for
your great bravery,

1116
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,984
I present you
with these gifts.

1117
01:08:54,277 --> 01:08:55,608
Thank you.

1118
01:08:58,714 --> 01:09:00,648
ALL: Yeah!

1119
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:02,876
(ALL CHEERING)

1120
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,393
ELINA: And from
that day forward,

1121
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:17,922
Mariposa always felt
she belonged in Flutterfield.

1122
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,663
Having learned
the best thing
you can be is yourself.

1123
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:23,771
The end.

1124
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,071
(CHITTERING)

1125
01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:31,513
Well, I don't know
if Zinzie leaves
Flutterfield.

1126
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:35,039
Which reminds me,
don't you have to
leave to see Dizzle?

1127
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:39,820
Oh, wait, that's right.
You're not going to go.

1128
01:09:39,922 --> 01:09:42,618
(CHITTERING)

1129
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:45,784
Really? You're not
worried about fitting
in with her friends?

1130
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:49,823
(CHITTERING)

1131
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:58,202
Yes, you are the Bibble
who singlehandedly defeated
Laverna three times.

1132
01:09:58,274 --> 01:09:59,434
I forgot.

1133
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:02,569
Bibble! Hi, Bibble.

1134
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:04,613
Dizzle, hello!

1135
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:08,914
(CHITTERING)

1136
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:15,418
(CHITTERING)

1137
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:21,428
Wow!

1138
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:26,062
(CHITTERING)

1139
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:32,464
Yes, Bibble,
they are Flutterpixies.

1140
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:36,444
(CHITTERING)

1141
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:41,044
(CHITTERING)

1142
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,879
(CHITTERING)

1143
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:44,476
You're welcome.

1144
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:53,828
Bye.
