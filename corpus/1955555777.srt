1
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,721
Have a seat.

2
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,766
<i>Now this is highly irregular, Agent Thorn.</i>

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,089
Never had to recall this type of
specialist back into active service.

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,850
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,881
<i>Saved more lives than
he could possibly know.</i>

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,089
Smart, loyal, keen military instincts.

7
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,210
Best I ever served with.

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,406
And the family?

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,761
<i>Very Supportive.</i>

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,526
No, the Wincotts are
military through and through.

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,402
They were only happy to lend him to us.

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,003
He looks good on paper,

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,168
but he's been out of the game for a while.

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,685
How do we know he's still got it?

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,046
Agent Thorn,

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,120
meet Max.

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,528
Welcome to the Secret Service, Max.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,567
<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKS)</font>

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,126
<i>And Russian president Vladimir Bragov</i>

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,536
<i>will be arriving later this week</i>

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,246
<i>to attend President Bennett's
first state visit since taking office,</i>

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,880
<i>an event that's set to kick
off a full week of arms</i>

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,084
<i>negotiations at presidential
retreat Camp David.</i>

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>These two leaders
couldn't be more different.</i>

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,484
<i>The question remains
if Bennett's laid-back style</i>

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,881
<i>can handle Bragov's stronger,</i>

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,256
<i>- more aggressive stance.</i>
- What?

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
<i>Critics will be watching...</i>

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,606
Stronger?

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,571
Just because the Kremlin
cowboy hunts tigers,

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,125
it doesn't make him strong.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,841
Dad, can I talk to you about something?

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,490
It's about school.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,721
Look, these things, they just take time.

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,450
You're the new kid on the block.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,090
Look, TJ. Why don't you

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,965
invite some of your
new friends over to the White House?

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,845
I mean, how many kids your age
have their own bowling alley?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,651
No, I'd love to invite
my new friends over.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,005
If I had any.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,806
<i>Okay, you know, it's kind of
hard to make friends</i>

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,288
when every time someone comes
up to you, they get frisked.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,727
We know this is hard, TJ.
It's a big adjustment for all of us.

46
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,087
It's more than just an adjustment, Mom.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,810
It's like living in a fish bowl,

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,008
and I'm the only one
who didn't ask for this.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,325
There have been a lot of kids

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,131
who grew up here,
and I'm sure every single one of them

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,721
felt exactly the way you do right now.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,248
But I will bet that
they wouldn't trade that experience

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,925
for anything in the world.

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,527
You know, so,

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,729
maybe, do your mom and I a favor

58
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
and just try to give it a chance.

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,281
I guess.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,050

Don't forget your lunch.

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,931
Baby bird? Seriously?

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,891
Oh, man. I've gotta get
a cooler code name.

Well, I guess I know what you want.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,886
Who's a good boy?

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,407
Who likes his belly rubbed?

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,481
- What's your name, fella?
<font color=#aa4040>AGENT THORN:</font> His name <i>is</i> Max.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,003
And he's not here to play.

77
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,251
I wasn't playing with him,
Agent Thorn. I was just...

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,882
Okay, maybe I was
playing with him a little.

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,727
What's he doing here?

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,248
Max is one of the country's
highest-trained tactical canines.

81

<i>He's been called to duty

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,722
Hmm. Charlie's a girl?

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,846
Let's go, Max.

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,408
Now, if you'll excuse us.

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,245
We have work to do.

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,201
Max, come.

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,770

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,848
But now I'm a part of the tour, Coop.
I live here

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,846
but I feel like I'm on exhibit
365 days a year.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,846
At least a gorilla in the zoo
gets Christmas off.

<font color=#aa4040>COOP:</font> Look at the bright side, T.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,207
At the zoo, they don't let
you feed the animals.

118
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,241
Think about it.

119
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,321
Worst case, you're only gonna
be here for eight more years.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,449
Less if your dad gets impeached.

121
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,050
Thanks for cheering me up, Coop.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,123
I do hear what you're saying, T.

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,245
But for some reason, they put a really
high value on security here.

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Did you know that they X-ray
everything that comes into the kitchen?

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,841
Even the grapes.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,376
I mean, what can you hide in a grape?

127
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,640
But it's not just that.

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,087
I miss my old life, my old friends.

129
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,970
I didn't run for office, you know.

130
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,289
Might just grow on you, T.

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,444
Why do you think so many presidents' sons
go into the family business?

132
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,765
Like you said, at least
the food's good here.

133
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,924
I mean, what do you put
in these things anyway?

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,090

That one's still probably

Uh, Dad, I don't think

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,526
Agent Thorn wants anyone to
be playing with Max like this.

TJ, come on.

I apologize. Our new security canine

161
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,080

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,566
We're still getting him up to
speed on his duties here.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,609
Good, then it's not too late.

164
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,244
Too late for what, sir?

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,289
To add a few more duties.

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,330
Like playing with TJ on his off hours.

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,521
Sir, as head of White House security,
I must voice my concerns.

168

This is an important week.
And I would hate for the dog to get

169

confused about his purpose here.

170
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,720
<font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font> Noted, Agent Thorn.

171
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,081
But I'm sure a man with your abilities

172
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,244
can find a way to accommodate
this simple request.

173
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,291
Otherwise, I'd have to
issue an executive order.

174
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,204
Get the Supreme Court involved.

175
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,124
You know, it can get really messy.

176
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,891
Of course, Mr. President.

177
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,483
Thank you, Agent Thorn.

178
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,565
Well, you see that, TJ?

179
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,771
This morning, I told you
things would turn around for you here.

180
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,163
And President Bennett always
delivers on his promises.

181
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,891
Thank you, Dad. Come on, Max!

182
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
Come on, Max! Let's go!

- I'm TJ.
- Alfred.

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,763
- Max, security detail.
- Cool.

198
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,083
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

199
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,961
That's cool.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SONG PLAYING ON PIANO)</font>

201
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,563
Mom, Dad, can I go to a party tonight?
A kid at school invited me.

202
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,722
Oh. I'm sorry, honey.

203
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,083
Tonight really isn't
the best time for this.

204
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,528
TJ, you know that the Russian
president is gonna be here...

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,051
What's that gotta do with me?

206
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,443
Look, I know that this
has been really difficult,

207
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,009
but we are the First Family and that
job has responsibilities.

208
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,291
And you know what?
We were hoping that you could help us out.

209
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,361
See, President Bragov's
wife couldn't make the trip,

210
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,648
but he is bringing his kid, Alex,

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,246
- who just happens to be about your age.
- TJ: Wait.

212
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,881
So you want me to babysit
some Russian kid?

213
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,961
Well, we were hoping that
you would see it more as

214
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,481
being our "goodwill ambassador."

215
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,410
Well, I was hoping

216
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,564
I would have a vote
on anything that goes on in my life.

217
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,371
It's not fair and there's no
way I'm dressing up

218
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,842
in a fancy outfit and smiling
for the cameras

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,968
just so you can get your poll numbers up.

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,002
Look, I'm sorry, nope.

221
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,323
I am just not doing it.

222
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,771
- TJ, what is on your face?
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> Mom.

223
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,604
- Mom!
- Hey, hey, hey,

224
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,491
Dad, she's a girl.

225
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,884
Yes, Alex is short for Alexandra.
I hope that's not a problem.

226
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,969
President Bragov, it is an honor to
have you here as my guest.

227
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,121
Honor?

228
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,000
You seem to have changed
your tune since campaign

229
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,083
when you called me, what was it?

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,928
"Crazy Kremlin cowboy."

231
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,643
<font color=#2aa5ff>(LAUGHS)</font>

232
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,131
You must be tired, let me
show you your quarters.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

234
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,525
- He seems nice.
- Yeah.

235
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,648
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> I'm supposed to be nice to you.

236
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,167
I am to be polite, nothing more.

237
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,970
My name is Alexandra Bragov,
but you may call me Alex.

238
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,121
I'm TJ.

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,846
I know, I had briefing about you.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,322
They say you are very
resourceful and fine player of baseball.

241
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,490
Also a big fan of spy movies

242
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,564
and always eat ice cream too
fast and get brain freeze.

243
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,171
They know all that about me?

244
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,966
My papa's people are very thorough.

245
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,767
- But no mention of dog.
- Oh.

246
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,160
This is Max.

247
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,010
But he's not my dog.

248
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,887
I mean, I guess he is now,

249
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,163
- but, um, not later or before.
- Do you know what breed he is?

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,163
Oh, he's a Secret Service dog.

251
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,209
I mean, I know it's not a breed.

252
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,681
- He's a...
- Belgian Malinois.

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,206
How'd you know that?

254
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,887
I am, how you say? Dog person.

255
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,650
Oh, yeah? Me too.

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,089
Tell them to put that in my file.

257
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,962
So, TJ, do you think your "dog-for-now"

258
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,966
could help us sniff out something
to eat other than boring state dinner?

259
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,044
I think I know just the place.

260
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,402
<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

261
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,488
Oh! No, no, you Malinois!

262
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,928
In borscht, we slice
beets thin like paper.

263
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,565
- My president...
- Dimitri!

264
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,687
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

265
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,527
I misspoke.

266
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,286
It is honor to be in
such beautiful kitchen.

267
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,645
Even if you do not belong here.

268
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,250
I assume he came with you?

269
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,081
<i><font color=#aa4040>TA:</font> Hey, Coop.</i>

270
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,009
Meet Alex, she's from Russia.

271
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,850
Call me Coop, I'm from Brighton Beach.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,001
Pleasure.

273
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,481
<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Say, Coop,

274
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,081
would you like to whip us up a
couple of the house specials, please?

275
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,641
Why, of course, sir.

276
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,724
Anything to get me off borscht detail.

277
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,881
<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

278
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,881
Mmm.

279
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,447
Mmm.

280
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,805
<i><font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> Such flavor!</i>

281
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,167
Why is this grilled cheese so good?

282
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,169
Sorry, secret ingredient.

283
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,766
It's classified.

284
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,570
You do not know, do you?

285
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,767
Nope.

286
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,047
So what do you do for amusement here?

287
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,489
Well, do you like to bowl?

288
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,245
Not particularly.

289
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,321
Me neither.

290
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,320
There's all kinds of stuff here,
but they're no fun to do alone.

291
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,649
And under 24-hour watch.

292
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,521
And let me guess, many
important "responsibilities."

293
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,480
No kidding. Sometimes,
I feel like I'm just here for photo ops.

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,326
At least you do not have to stand for
eight hours at the Victory Day Parade.

295
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,484
Doesn't even compare to
visiting the Iowa State Fair.

296
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,762
They make sculptures out of butter.

297
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,841
- Why?
- I think there isn't much to do there.

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,126
<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

299
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,841
I was actually invited
to go to a party downtown tonight.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,209
But I can't go 'cause I have
to entertain our guests.

301
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,368
Well, I hope they're at least nice.

302
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,284
Not so bad so far.

303
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,161
I know how this goes.

304
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,728
You can't go to your party because your
parents are making you go to their party.

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,487
It's not fair.
Just 'cause we're the presidents' kids

306
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,608
means we don't get to have any fun?

307
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,761
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

308
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,521
Sneaking out to party would be fun.

309
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,487
It would, wouldn't it?

310
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,246
But if we got caught...

311
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,401
Siberia?

312
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,204
I was going to say Guantanamo.

313
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,401
Same difference.

314
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,523
But do you always obey your parents?

315
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,842
Me? Not always.

316
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,170
Sometimes.

317
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,130
Okay, pretty much always.

318
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,321
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

319
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,003
I just thought I was in
"land of the free and

320
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,884
"home of the brave."

321
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,842
Don't worry, Max. We'll be right back.

322
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Let's go, come on.

323
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,641
Tomorrow morning, we'll be
heading to Camp David.

324
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,410
I know how much you love the outdoors

325
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,928
and I thought it would
be a more informal venue for our talks.

326
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,361
We will see.

327
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,810
Of course, the brunt of our time will be
spent discussing the arms treaty,

328
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,804
but we've got all sorts
of great events planned for your visit.

329
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,602
My beautiful wife here
is an esteemed concert pianist.

330
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,730
She's agreed to perform
an evening of Tchaikovsky.

331
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,769
- Pyotr Tchaikovsky?
- Yes.

332
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,763
I love Tchaikovsky.

333
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,447
But everywhere I go,
they play me Tchaikovsky.

334
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,566
I was hoping for Bon Jovi.

335
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,721
<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

336
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,964
Well, I hope the kids
are getting along better than we are.

337
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,281
<font color=#2aa5ff>(GASPS)</font>

338
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,361

We were worried half to death.

391
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,370
Agent Thorn, how is this even possible?

392
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,806
Unfortunately, sir,

393
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,727
due to the restoration, the alarms on the

394
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,410
I'm really sorry, Dad.

395

Okay. I didn't wanna
say anything in front of our guests

399
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,684
but I think I heard one of
those guys say something in Russian.

400
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,924
<i>Max bit one of the guys on the ankle.</i>

401
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,576
Dad, you have to check every one of
those Russians for bite marks.

402
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,763
Son, let's just let the
Secret Service handle this, okay?

403
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,126
You mean the Secret Service

404
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,931
who can't keep track of
two 12-year-old kids?

405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,401
Okay, I think that you have
caused enough trouble

406
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,449
for one evening, young man. Don't you?

407
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,602
- But, Dad, all I'm...
- No, <i>I</i> don't wanna hear it.

408
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,490
I want you to go to your room, go to bed,

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,211

Fine. Come on, Max.

411
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,525
If he did hear someone speaking Russian,

412
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,560

Why are you being so weird?

434
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,684
I was thinking we could get together later

435
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,216

what happened last night.

436
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,241
No.

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,731

- What?

438
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,881

441
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,244
In fact, you pretty much made me go.

442
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,846

443
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,040
How better to make it look
like you're not involved?

444
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,968
Um, just off the top of my head,

445
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,976
maybe not sneaking out with you
in the first place?

446
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,367

453

to keep Mother Russia strong

454

is to keep Uncle Sam weak.

455

when Alex and I were sneaking out.

What are you doing?

501
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,529
What does it looks like? I'm making famous
homemade Russian rye bread.

502
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,690
- Bread?
- Da.

503
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,730
Finally put stop to dry,
tasteless monstrosity

504
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,769
your buddy, Coop, insists on making.

505
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,645
Now you ruin surprise and dough!

506
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,004
Security hear about this.

507
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,726
And then I tell your mama.

508
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,281
Wait, no. I wasn't here
to ruin the surprise.

509
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,727
I was here because... I... Um...

510
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,606
Because the US President is allergic.

511
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,886
Alex?

512
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,407
- Allergic?
- Yes.

513
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,166
That is why American chef make dry bread.

514
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,560
It's gluten free.

515
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,649
Oh, oh, yeah. My dad gets
real sick if he has any gluten at all.

516
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,570
Didn't you hear in the last campaign?

517
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,603
It was a huge scandal.

518
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,571
<i>The wheat growers association
wouldn't endorse him.</i>

519
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,401
The pizza lobby picketed his events.

520
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,606
I just wanted to stop you
before you got in big trouble.

521
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,446
Yes, you owe this boy
a great debt and apology.

522
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,761
Don't you?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKS)</font>

524
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,805
My humble apologies.

525
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,128
Now, come on, TJ. Weren't you going to
give me a tour of the grounds?

526

He had body in box?

528
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,569
I don't know. l...

529
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,965
That was stupid, right?

530
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,964
Not as stupid as thinking
I was behind the attacks.

531
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,930
Sorry about that. I didn't
know who to trust and...

532
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,081
It's okay.

533
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,329
You knew I was innocent. Didn't you, Max?

534
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,962
Uh, how did you know we were out here?

535
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,647
I was doing my own
investigation and saw you doing yours.

536
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,643
You were investigating me?

537
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,808
Someone is looking to hurt
both of our families, TJ.

538
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,883
You think I am not worried, too?

539
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,765
You would have known this if you
actually talked to me this morning

540
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,928
instead of putting me on Most Wanted list.

541
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,606
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> You're not gonna let
me live that down, are you?

542
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,490
Not until it stops being fun.

543
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,528
So, who do you think is behind it?

544
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,841
Her?

545
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,007
<font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> <i>Before trip, I heard Olga say
she thought arms talks with your country</i>

546
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,650
were terrible thing.

547
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,404
Would make my country weak.

548
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,684
In America, everyone is
innocent until proven guilty.

549
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,046
I also saw her applying
antibiotic ointment

550
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,602
to her ankle this morning
like she has fresh wound.

551
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,804
Hope she looks good in orange.

552
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,925
Stop staring at her.

553
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,809
Well, if I'm not staring at her,

554
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,241
how am I supposed
to know she's doing anything suspicious?

555
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,481
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

556
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,206
Would anyone like to sample
today's blue plate special?

557
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,206
- Thanks, Coop.
- She's cute, T.

558
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Honey, do you want me
to get you some more ice?

559
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,568
A glacier wouldn't help.

560
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,721
<font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTS)</font>

561
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,771
Oh. Morning, Vladimir.

562
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,046
How was your sleep?

563
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,729
The sleep of 1,000 men. You?

564
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,963
Who wouldn't feel great after
a four-hour ride on Diablo?

565
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,086
Good, then, well rested.
We go white water rafting today.

566
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,322
White water rafting.

567
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,450
You know, I was hoping that we could just
jump right into our talks.

568
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,400
No, today we ride the rapids.

569
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,165
<font color=#aa4040>BOTH:</font> Like men!

570
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,241
Maybe I'm not hating
him as much as I thought.

571
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,207
Seems we're having more
in common all the time.

572
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,120
- I'll send for your chiropractor.
- Thank you.

573
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,201
Yeah.

574
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,687
Morning, kids.

575
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,841
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning.

576
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,009
Come on, let's follow her.

577
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,168
TJ. Maybe we should tell
somebody about this.

578
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,926
We will, as soon as
we've got proof. Come on.

579
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,201
Wait.

580
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,331
Are you scared?

581
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,607
Aren't you?

582
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,370
Why should I be scared?

583
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,407
We've got Max.

829
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,686
And it was his job
to follow up on all leads

830
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,887
for both attacks.

831
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,129
Exactly. And all that stuff about Max
not spending time with me?

832
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,964
He probably knew he'd sniff him out.

833
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,488
He also could've intentionally
let us sneak out to go to that party

834
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,971
so you'd get attacked.

835
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,202
I knew it, an American is behind this.

836
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,886
Wait. Who said he was American?

837
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,281
He could really be a Russian in disguise.

838
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,441
A double agent.

839
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,896
Remember the accent we heard that night?

840
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,447
He was probably faking that accent
to make it seem like he was Russian.

841
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,409
An American posing as a Russian.

842
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,800
A triple agent.

843
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,603
Or he's a quadruple agent.

844
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,925
Really a Russian,
faking the accent of an American,

845
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,924
doing a Russian accent
so we'd think he was American...

846
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,491
Okay. Maybe we should
stop at double agent.

847
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,130
Russian or American.

848
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,761
I can live with that.

849
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,281
So, wait.

850
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,241
Are we really accusing the head
of your presidential security...

851
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,404
Of what is basically treason
with almost no proof?

852
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,840
My dad will think I'm crazy.

853
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,202
And as much as my papa would like to
embarrass your country,

854
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,925
I think he would, too.

855
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,886
So, we set up a trap to
expose him to our fathers.

856
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,451

1056

Look at it this way, T.

1057
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,240
At least you got the first chapter

1073

Oh, yeah.

1077

My name's not really Coop, T.

1078
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,570
That's just a good friendly
American name, no?

1079

1080

- Why?
- Why?

1081
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,011
Because peace is weak.

1082
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,289
The people I work with will not allow
my country to surrender its weapons,

1083
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,727
not for your country, not for anyone.

1084
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,406

not men like Bragov.
