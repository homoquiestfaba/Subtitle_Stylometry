1
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:06,821
Hey, Dad. Shit!

2
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,490
You owe me a pack of smokes.

3
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,158
Come on, it was one cigarette.

4
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,592
Punitive damages.

5
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,427
Here's a whole carton.

6
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:23,733
So?

7
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:25,734
Nothing.

8
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,777
How's your mother?

9
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:30,737
She's fine.

10
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,739
You could call her Mary
every once in a while.

11
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:34,873
Close that gap up a little bit.

12
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,307
Don't start on me.

13
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,238
Is Sherry okay?
She ain't been in.

14
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,713
Everything good with her?

15
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:47,248
A squabble. She's back home.

16
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,484
Oh, hey, Mark. Hi.

17
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,219
Well...

18
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:57,156
Mark? Yeah?

19
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,357
You still doing it?

20
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:00,891
No, I stopped.

21
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,515
Pop, they only give me an
hour for lunch, so I gotta...

22
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,229
I'll see you next time.

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,735
Hey, he's a vet, okay. What do you
say you keep an eye on him for me?

24
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:16,636
Oh, no, you don't have to.

25
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:18,638
Just take it. In case
he needs anything.

26
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,906
Hey, I got him, my man.
I got him.

27
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,240
I appreciate it.

28
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,878
<i>Sports Facts.</i>

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Yeah, 54012, Princess Leia.

30
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:31,781
<i>Go 54012.</i>

31
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,649
I want Marshall for five dimes.

32
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,616
<i>The line is down to 10.</i>

33
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:38,519
I don't care if it's down to seven.
Marshall plus the points is a gift.

34
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,854
<i>One play on this call?</i> Yeah.

35
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,723
Yeah.

36
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,245
The Thundering Herd.

37
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,747
Go Marshall.

38
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,449
Please.

39
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,483
Please.

40
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,431
Me, I'd forget
the one with the scanner.

41
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,698
Everything you need is
on the net anyway.

42
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,768
Like you're actually going to check out
a library book and scan it, right?

43
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,502
Right.

44
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,438
You're gonna print, you know.
Maybe make the odd copies.

45
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,306
Doesn't hurt to have
the fax function.

46
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,707
Just the fax, ma'am.

47
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:46,357
You know what, I'm gonna
show you something.

48
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:48,446
Forget that other merch, okay?

49
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:52,650
It's their ticket to a pure profit stream,
overcharge you on the replacement cartridges.

50
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:56,754
This one is cheaper out the door, and
you can refill the ink yourself.

51
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,521
Thanks. Yeah.

52
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,922
We don't make
anything off that one.

53
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,424
Take a microscopic margin.

54
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,558
Okay.

55
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:10,496
Wait.

56
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,434
I want to get you my
employee discount.

57
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,935
20% is 20%, right?

58
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:18,569
Yeah.

00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,971

65
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,352
What the hell's
going on here, huh?

66
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,021
Yeah.

67
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,656
Sorry, Stan, we were just...
Goofing off

68
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,324
and costing me money.
You think I can't see that?

69
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:48,493
Well, not to put too fine a point on it,
but wouldn't it be Pete Coors' money?

70
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,462
If that truck isn't cross-checked
and rolling in five minutes,

71
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,497
you don't work here anymore.

72
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,331
Roger that.

73
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,567
<i>And Juan Valdez is, you know,
up in the hills going,</i>

74
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,369
"Don't sue me,
if you burn yourself."

75
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:01,669
Right?

76
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:06,440
But, you know, the thing that kills me is
that they invented a whole new business.

77
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,341
You know,
$3 for a cup of coffee.

78
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:10,710
I don't remember anybody saying,
"Hey, this coffee sure tastes great,

79
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:13,946
"but I'd rather say<i> grande</i>
and pay $3 for it."

80
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:16,381
You talk a lot.

81
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,517
But you're cute.

82
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,789
Got two more hang-ups today.

83
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:35,484
It's starting to give me the creeps.
I'm on it.

84
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,567
What are you doing there? Stuff.

85
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,669
Need help? I'm good. I got it.

86
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,200
Are you gonna tuck Hayden in?

87
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:53,546
Hey, buddy, what's up?

88
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,789
Good.

89
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,516
Doesn't sound like it.

90
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,117
Hey, uh...

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,819
I thought we were partners.

92
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,053
We are.

93
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,588
So, we share intel, right?

94
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,089
Right. Well?

95
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,790
Mommy's worried.

96
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,859
Of course,
she's worried. Mommies worry.

97
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,761
What do you mean,
Mommy's worried?

98
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,929
About the football games.

99
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,730
Well, Mommy's a fan.

100
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,501
Mommy doesn't care who wins
but she knows you do.

101
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,741
I won't be late.

102
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:40,681
I just keep getting better. You wouldn't
think it was possible, but there it is.

103
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:43,684
Did he foot fault? I don't
need to cheat with you clowns.

104
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,585
I don't know, gonna want
to check the video.

105
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,820
Oh, do I detect a hint
of athletic envy?

106
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,589
Of you? Not in this
lifetime, baby.

107
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:54,492
Face it. You guys cannot stand the
fact that there's finally a sport

108
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:55,694
that I'm better than you at.

109
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,628
Hold it. Darts is not a sport.

110
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,796
Of course it's a sport,
numbnuts, it's on ESPN.

111
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,531
So is poker, big deal.

112
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,899
Darts is an activity.

113
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,133
A game, at best.

114
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,167
A game, huh? How do you figure?

115
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,472
Simple, anything you can drink beer and get
better at, by definition isn't a sport.

116
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,941
Football, hockey,
baseball, sports.

117
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:17,010
Bowling, pool,
darts, activities.

118
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,878
What about golf? Activity.

119
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,879
Waste of time. It's a sport.

120
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,849
No. If they made them carry their
own bag and run to the ball, maybe.

121
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,650
But it's strictly a game.

122
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,053
Talking about
the Championship Bowl?

123
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,553
Yeah. Who do you like?

124
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,087
The dog, Marshall.
The underdog, really?

125
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,889
Yeah, whenever you don't know you
take the dog and the points.

126
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,890
No kidding. Absolutely.

127
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,725
There's four possible
outcomes in any contest.

128
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,860
Favorite wins a blowout.
Favorite wins in a squeaker.

129
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:40,595
Dog wins a blowout.
Dog wins in a squeaker.

130
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:43,564
Three out of four scenarios you win
if you take the dog and the points.

131
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,731
Spend any time
thinking about this?

132
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,767
<i>Big game is Saturday, who do
we like, Texas or Marshall?</i>

133
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,703
<i>Texas is a walk. The game is
over by halftime I'd say...</i>

134
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,907
<i>Ah, I'd hate to agree with the Spider-Man,
but this one is a mismatch for the ages.</i>

135
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,176
<i>All right, Dibs, we haven't heard from you.
I don't like football.</i>

136
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,677
<i>You gotta pick, Dibs.</i>

137
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,647
<i>All right, if I have to, Texas. You
don't need to be a brain surgeon.</i>

138
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,148
<i>Goliath is gonna win</i>
<i>this one going away.</i>

139
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,517
<i>Anybody who picks</i>
<i>Marshall is nuts.</i>

140
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,785
<i>All right, it's unanimous.</i>
<i>Texas blows them out.</i>

141
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:12,187
Those guys don't know anything.

142
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,790
<i>Charlie starts building</i>
<i>prow ends for the pontoons,</i>

143
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,159

<i>another use...</i>

144
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,927
Hey, babe. Hi.

145
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:23,830
Ta-da!

146
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,933
Very thoughtful.

147
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,570
You smell like smoke.

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,172
That's 'cause I'm smokin'!

149
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,976
Who is this jerkoff?
He's always on.

150
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:41,243
He fixes things.

151
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,978
I can fix stuff too, you know.

152
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,779
Yeah, I know you can, honey.

153
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,283
Do you have anything
needing repair, ma'am?

154
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,018
I'm all tuned up.
Thank you very much.

155
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Maybe I should start
under the hood.

156
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:02,594
<i>¶ Beer, beer, beer</i>

162
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,935
New move?

163
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:45,263
If she's got another
concussion, she's fired.

164
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,933
Somebody clean that up.
Pick up the chairs.

165
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:51,702
Don't worry about her.
Get the chairs first.

166
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,938
Hey, Billy. Scarlet.

167
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:59,676
You work too hard. Says
the princess of the pole.

168
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:01,277
What is that supposed to mean?

169
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,114
Well, do you not fling yourself
through the air like a sexy gazelle?

170
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,817
How come you never let
me dance for you?

171
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,118
'Cause I'm married.

172
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,152
Married guys are my specialty.

173
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:15,156
I did one right thing in my life, Scarlet,
and the price, no snacks on the side.

174
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:18,826
Snack, my butt.
You'd never eat at home again.

175
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,094
Maybe so.

176
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:22,995
Suit yourself.

177
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,178
Swing by if you
change your mind.

178
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,050
See you next week, Scarlet.

179
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,339
<i>Okay, when everyone's</i>
<i>quiet, we can do this.</i>

180
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:40,008
Watch me win this raffle.
These tickets are mine.

181
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,377
Funny, if you're five.

182
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,913
Is it just tickets to the Championship
Bowl or do you get some parties too?

183
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,715
Yeah, there's a party in your
mouth and everybody's coming.

184
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:51,317
It's nice to have
so many first-graders here.

185
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,751
And the winner is...

186
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:54,418
Jason Klein.

187
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,719
Ugh!

188
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:58,821
Wow. I never win anything.

189
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,757
Have fun.

190
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,926
Thanks.

191
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:09,329
Wow, this is great.
Um, I want to thank...

192
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:10,938
You suck.

193
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:27,346
Florida? No.

194
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:30,716
Look, you're a nice enough guy and all, but that's it.
Go to Florida with you?

195
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:34,086
We were so good together at coffee. We
both like two sugars and a NutraSweet...

196
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,756
For Christ's sake, Jade, I've got
a full waiting room. Let's go.

197
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,890
Yes, Doctor.

198
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,224
Does anyone work here?

199
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,859
This is what I get for
having a latte with a loser.

200
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,460
So you gonna think about it?

201
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,961
I said no, are you deaf?

202
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:48,830
Take your tickets and your
NutraSweet and get out of here.

203
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:49,997
This is my job.

204
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:56,868
So you understand why I'm here.

205
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,471
Daddy had the Jets. That's right.
And the Jets lost.

206
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:01,839
I know.

207
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,241
And that wasn't the only one.

208
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,809
Daddy.

209
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,010
Hello, Mark.

210
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:08,110
What are you doing here?

211
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:12,447
How is it that this little man understands
so much more clearly than his deadbeat dad?

212
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,148
Hayden, get in the kitchen.

213
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,515
Now!

214
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:21,386
You've got some nerve.

215
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:23,087
Just doing my job.

216
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:23,520
Now pay up.

217
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:27,056
You come into my house. You scare my wife.
You touch my kid.

218
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,157
I'm not paying for that.

219
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,460
I go where I'm sent and I get what I'm sent for.
Now what do you have for me?

220
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,794
I'll show you what I got.

221
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,095
We can do this either way.

222
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:36,063
You got some balls.

223
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,331
True, but enough about me.

224
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,066
Mark. Not now.

225
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,501
You will come across. You
know I don't leave otherwise.

226
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,835
- Oh, yeah?
- Mark.

227
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,870
What? Your dad died.

228
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:51,842
Hmm.

229
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,016
Be seeing you.

230
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:08,190
<i>(IF YOU WERE A BLUEBIRD.</i>

231
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:16,563
Hey, Jason.

232
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,197
Hey. Hi. Come on in.

233
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:25,337
Thirty-seven years
I knew him. He was a good man.

234
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,239
112, high average, not bad.

235
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,406
Well he did love to bowl.

236
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:34,811
What the hell happened to you, kid? We all
expected you to be doing big things by now.

237
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:36,945
Was it the divorce?

238
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:40,348
Your old man always blamed himself
for knocking you off track...

239
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,151
Hey, thanks for coming, Mr. Dean.
It really means a lot.

240
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:45,886
Let's top you off there.

241
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:47,729
Is there any wine? For sure.

242
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,491
That's appropriate.

243
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:52,925
What?

244
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,928
Well you're the one who decided
to wear your ass as an outfit.

245
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,829
Whatever.

246
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,600
Yeah, I'm here to clean
out my dad's locker.

247
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,568
Sure, kid. Number 64.

248
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:27,454
Sorry to hear about your pop, kid.
Straight shooter.

249
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,189
Oh, Dad.

250
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:30,047
Hey, Sherry, what's this?

251
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,648
We're going to my mom's again.

252
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:34,283
Don't call for
a few days, okay?

253
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,385
No, of course it's not okay.

254
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,652
What are you doing?

255
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:40,187
Don't act surprised.
You did this.

256
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:43,724
Look,

257
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:48,159
I don't like the timing,
but you put us at risk.

258
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,026
He's my son.

259
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,388
I'm not going to keep
your son from you.

260
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,062
Bye, Daddy.

261
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,664
This was the last straw.

262
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:10,010
I'm just saying it takes time to lug five
pallets of empties down two flights.

263
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,445
<i>No, McGriff,</i>
<i>you are not getting off early.</i>

264
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,414
<i>I need you back here at base.
Truck 18 is loaded ass-backwards,</i>

265
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,016
<i>all the longnecks are in front.
Get back here.</i>

266
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:19,617
It's not my bad, Donnie.

267
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,286
I'm knocking off early today.

268
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:26,556
Big plans.

269
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,002
Jesus!

270
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,041
How did I get here?

271
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:54,485
Hiding out in my own house.

272
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:59,649
You remember, coming out of
high school, we were stars.

273
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,284
Well, you were.

274
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,552
You gotta be kidding me.

275
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,154
You were fast-tracked,

276
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,655
4.0 pre-law at Penn.

277
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:12,225
I had my football ride,
granted it was Division II.

278
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:15,527
How many guys even
get to play college ball?

279
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,595
Not many.

280
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,396
And not quarterback.

281
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,632
Yeah.

282
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:44,486
Hey, baby.

283
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:48,689
No way.

284
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,859
Aren't you Billy McGriff
of the McGriffters?

285
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,160
Oh, you guys were awesome.

286
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:58,496
I was there at Toad's Hole that night
that Joe Strummer jumped up on stage

287
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,564
and started cranking out
that song.

288
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,634
<i>¶ Which way, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

289
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:07,603
<i>¶ My way, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ¶</i>

290
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,473
Yeah, man, that was the one.
You had it going on.

291
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,708
You're such a fan. Shouldn't
I be banging your wife?

292
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,442
She's your wife?

293
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:20,746
Geez, I had no idea.

294
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:38,863
Give me a triple kamikaze,
with two beers back.

295
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,297
And whatever they're having.

296
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,075
So I'm guessing
you're off the wagon.

297
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,436
Of all the guys in the world,
she chooses that nitwit.

298
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,372
I mean, come on. You're gonna cheat,
pick somebody better than that.

299
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,941
Till death do us part, period.
Fact.

300
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,476
Well, I'd like to
make a suggestion.

301
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,544
What do you say to
a little adventure?

302
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:02,880
Shed some layers.
Fun, sun... Anyone?

303
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:03,580
Pass.

304
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,882
It'd be good to get away for a while.
Therapeutic.

305
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,617
I'm not running. I am.

306
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,585
Where are you thinking?

307
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:13,388
Into every rain,
a little sun must fall.

308
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,757
Championship Bowl,
how'd you get these?

309
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,293
The one and only OfficeMax
Christmas drawing extravaganza.

310
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,761
What do you know?

311
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:21,928
I got five...

312
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,699
I made a little bet.
You know, on Marshall.

313
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,401
You know, just so I can watch the
game and have a rooting interest.

314
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:32,837
What did you bet? Just a
friendly wager, you know.

315
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,738
Thundering Herd, 50 bones.

316
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:37,706
Hmm, these are tremendous.

317
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,709
Okay, don't get any ideas. I am
definitely sitting in one of those seats.

318
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:44,245
You'll be very comfortable in the car.
Game's better on the radio.

319
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,246
Yeah, you get Keith Jackson.

320
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,648
"As another lovely Florida day
drifts into the gloaming..."

321
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,250
Keith Jackson's on TV.
Sometimes he does the radio.

322
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:51,718
Or you get Marv Albert. Yes!

323
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,287
No. No, I'm no dummy.

324
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,388
Nobody said you were.

325
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,323
You may recall, I graduated
first in our class.

326
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,591
I remember. You put the
"dick" in valedictorian.

327
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,227
This game is on Saturday. If we're
going, we better get underway.

328
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,594
Pronto.

329
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,362
Cheers.

330
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,263
Florida.

331
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:12,832
I want to be clear on this. I get
to use one of those tickets.

332
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,600
I won them,
and I get to use one.

333
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,501
You two can figure out
who sits with me,

334
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:19,804
and we'll scalp another
single for whoever loses.

335
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:23,240
Why should you be automatic? It
was a random draw, was it not?

336
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,541
Yeah, come on. It's not
like you earned them.

337
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,009
Just let me get my guitar.

338
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,877
We got the radio. We got CDs.

339
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,346
There's always
room for live tunes.

340
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,850
No way I can stomach
1,000 miles of his light FM.

341
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:37,318
What happened to him, anyway?

342
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,519
Why did he go all
sensitive-acoustic?

343
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:40,754
I don't know. Maybe he can
play his way out of it.

344
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,556
These tunes
he's singing now, yuck.

345
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,724
It's like he's got
Music-heimer's or something.

346
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,459
He's trying to stretch.
Have a range.

347
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,894
Well, I like it
electric and loud.

348
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:53,564
Whatever was rock and roll
about him is long gone.

349
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,298
Museum gone.

350
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,750
I should've banged your
sister when I had the chance.

351
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,694
We are not gonna make Florida
on one case of beer.

352
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,977
I can tell you that right now.

353
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,930
Here we go.

354
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,766
27, 28, 29, and one is 30.

355
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:37,468
Give me a scratch ticket,
and make it a winner.

356
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,735
We're going to Florida.

357
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,902
$1.

358
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:41,737
Have you got any halva,
for the trip?

359
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,705
Halva? When in Rome.

360
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:44,906
This is Pennsylvania.

361
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:46,307
85 cents.

362
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:49,843
Hey, guys. I won.

363
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,411
5 bucks, it only cost
me a buck. I'm up 4.

364
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,347
That ought to cover a couple of tolls.
That a boy.

365
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:56,448
Give me six numbers.

366
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,918
Let me do it. I'm on a roll.
I'm seeing...

367
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,453
Quick pick.

368
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,321
Okay, that's a loser.
What do you got?

369
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:08,591
6, 11 and 56. June 11, 1956,
Joe Montana's birthday.

370
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:11,794
Pennsylvania boy and the greatest
quarterback in history for a little yin

371
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:15,631
and if you want to go ultimate yang,
we're going with the Boston Red Sox:

372
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,500
10, 25, 86, October 25, 1986.

373
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:21,402
Billy Buckner's grounder
Game 6, World Series.

374
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:22,669
You're thinking the whole
yin-yang package.

375
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,337
You're feeling me,
aren't you, Billy?

376
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,372
86 is too high.
It's gotta be 60 or less.

377
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:30,342
That's okay. We go 10,
25, and let's say... 57.

378
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,677
Heinz 57.

379
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,880
You just went from Joe
Montana to steak sauce.

380
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,048
Yeah. No, no, no. I like it.

381
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,415
Run it, Abdul.

382
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,783
My name is not Abdul.

383
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,387
<i>(QUIT YOUR LOWDOWN WAYS.</i>

384
00:23:51,093 --> 00:23:52,625
What if we get a flat?

385
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:53,993
That's defeatist.

386
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,633
Come on, guys. Just let me hold
them till we get to Florida.

387
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:02,900
You can be shotgun.

388
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:03,867
I'm already shotgun.

389
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:06,070
And I'd like
to hold my tickets.

390
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,103
Relax, you will.

391
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:10,106
That's right. We are still waiting for the
food to show up for the Labor Day picnic.

392
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:11,373
That wasn't my fault.

393
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,440
But it was your responsibility.

394
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:15,543
That's great. Focus.
Shotgun is no joke.

395
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:17,578
Keep this map safe
and dry at all times.

396
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,714
And no snoozing. There is nothing
worse than shotgun sawing wood.

397
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:23,383
What about the radio? Doesn't
shotgun handle music?

398
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,550
We'll see how it goes.

399
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:25,517
You gotta earn those stripes.

400
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,687
Okay, ship's going down, <i> Titanic,</i> whatever.
You got one life ring.

401
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,855
Who are you throwing it to,
your wife or your kid?

402
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:34,090
She won't like it,
but it's gotta be the kid.

403
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,624
Gotta be the kid.

404
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:38,159
Okay, I got one.

405
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:44,865
What would you rather lose,
your eyesight or your penis?

406
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,604
Is this my cock or your cock?

407
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:51,504
Here we go.

408
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:52,605
'Cause my cock,
that's one thing...

409
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,407
I'm not comfortable with that
kind of talk in the Fury.

410
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,043
My mother insisted on giving
me a bath till I was 12.

411
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,612
Scrubbed my ears, the whole deal.
Twelve?

412
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:02,946
That's sick, why did
you stand for it?

413
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,868
I didn't know any better. She
was the only mother around.

414
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,450
Drew the line
when pubes sprouted.

415
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:08,883
Okay, uncle.

416
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,919
No disrespect, but I always thought
your mother was a whack job.

417
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,987
Ditto. Hey, that's my mother.

418
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:15,588
You can't talk that way
about somebody's mother.

419
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,889
If I knew you a week less,
I'd have to hit you.

420
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,558
You brought her up. Yeah, we're
just trying to be supportive

421
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,726
like good friends are supposed to be.
Oh, thank you.

422
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,662
By the way, just let me hold the tickets.
I'm not comfortable with this setup.

423
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:27,898
I don't know. You two never
give me any responsibility.

424
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,032
Two words...

425
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:30,633
Labor Day party.

426
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,701
That was 14 years ago.

427
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,836
We suffered the whole day. Oh!

428
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:37,738
All right, I tell you what.
We'll go Switzerland.

429
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,605
What?

430
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:41,174
Switzerland, neutral spot.

431
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:44,297
Put them in the glove compartment.
We'll sort it out later.

432
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,611
Okay. So, we have
an understanding.

433
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,146
I get a say in who
ultimately gets to use these.

434
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,614
Agreed?

435
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,619
Oh, oh! Turn this up.
Dire Straits. Awesome.

436
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,887
Man, back in the day
these guys were the kings.

437
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,256
Hundred million albums,
you heard them everywhere.

438
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,058
You turn on the radio now, it's
all boy bands and Britney.

439
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,958
I'd throw one in her.

440
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,027
Nice of you. The point is,
they went from the top,

441
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:09,896
the very top, to nowhere or...

442
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:12,098
I don't know, back to some
castle in England.

443
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,299
They're not clipping
any coupons.

444
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, or carrying
their own luggage.

445
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,569
Except for the bags
that are filled with cash.

446
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:21,038
I guess their time has passed.

447
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,639
It's scrudge. Skip it.
Wait a second.

448
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,008
- Turn it down. Scrudge.
- Scrunge?

449
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,009
No. Scrudge.

450
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,711
That song is not scrudge.
It's a change of mood.

451
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:29,878
The funkiest of scrudge.

452
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,712
What is scrudge?

453
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,747
Scrudge, a song
that follows a great song.

454
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,215
Doomed from the first time
you hear it on the CD.

455
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,618
We're talking about Dire Straits here.
They're incapable of scrudge.

456
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,752
Dead in the recording studio.

457
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:41,855
You see, every group knows immediately
when they got a great song.

458
00:26:41,857 --> 00:26:45,191
And they don't want to burn a perfectly
decent one by putting it after that.

459
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,825
So they pick a shit
song for that slot.

460
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,694
You know, to fall on the
grenade, take one for the team.

461
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:50,861
A scrudge song.

462
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:51,695
Give me an example.

463
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:56,032
Okay. Do you remember the song
that followed, uh... <i> Freebird?</i>

464
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:57,099
Um, no.

465
00:26:57,101 --> 00:26:58,633
Exactly.

466
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,301
<i>Brown Sugar?</i> I don't know.

467
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,336
<i>Born to Run?</i>
Hey, back off Bruce.

468
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:05,639
Oh, so you can cap Knopfler
but Springsteen's off-limits?

469
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,107
Good Christ,<i> She's the One.</i>

470
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:08,608
Talk about scrudge.

471
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,709
<i>- Stairway?</i>
- Uh...

472
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,843
<i>Where the Streets Have No Name?</i>

473
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:14,212
<i>Bullet the Blue Sky</i>
is not scrudge. It's sonic.

474
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:17,915
Any reasonable debate, by
definition, means non-scrudge.

475
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,716
Flip it back to three.

476
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,654
Sing it, Jase!

477
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:36,997
I could do this all night!

478
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:03,285
Watch out! Jesus!

479
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:05,287
Oh! Watch the road!

480
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:07,422
I was out like a light.

481
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:08,823
Who farted?

482
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,124
My bad.

483
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:13,026
Oh, God, that's vile.

484
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:18,878
Grab it. The map!

485
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,873
It's a long way down.

486
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,241
Man, that would have hurt.

487
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,842
Watch where you're going.

488
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,811
Can't help it. It's the open road.
It gets me all fired up.

489
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,878
Always has.

490
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,946
Hey, you smoking now? Yep.

491
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:40,281
I never went on a road
trip with my parents.

492
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:41,415
Never.

493
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:46,153
We went to the Poconos, and my Aunt
Mickey's house in Long Island. Lindenhurst.

494
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,021
You missed out.
We went all the time.

495
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:49,856
From sea to shining sea.

496
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:53,893
Hey, your old man was a
road warrior, huh? Nah.

497
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:55,760
He just wanted to get there.

498
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:58,095
He wasn't a stop-and-smell-the-roses
kind of a guy.

499
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:01,031
I mean, me and Ma, we'd be
looking at something amazing and

500
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:05,802
he'd just be standing there, smoking
a heater, facing the highway.

501
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:11,007
And he'd click his fingers, "Let's
go." And we'd be on our way.

502
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,943
Man, they don't make
them like that anymore.

503
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:16,378
Billy, I'm bagged.
You take them.

504
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,246
I'm still shotgun,
right, Crime Dog?

505
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,281
But I handle the music.

506
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,016
Okay, fair enough.

507
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,351
<i>(DRIVING WITH THE BRAKES ON.</i>

508
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:42,934
Guess who?

509
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:57,314
Christ.

510
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:00,483
What am I doing?

511
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:04,753
Quality time, bro.
Beats a shrink.

512
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:06,321
No, not this.

513
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,858
I just always thought having
a kid would grow me up.

514
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:17,430
Instead, it's a bill, due
every day, every minute.

515
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,032
At least you got one.

516
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:21,433
I'm not griping.

517
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:23,195
I just thought it would
make a man out of me.

518
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:26,971
My dad always seemed like a man
and he had me when he was a kid.

519
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,040
Hey, want to order
some room service?

520
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,442
Room service?
What, in a dump like this?

521
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,310
Here we go, Chinese.

522
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,245
Alligators, cool.

523
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:40,248
Let's see. What goes
good with 42 beers?

524
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,817
Okay, wait. Let's get something
straight here, fellas.

525
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:45,352
I definitely get one
of these beds.

526
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,821
How do you figure? It was my
Championship Bowl tickets

527
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:51,191
that started this whole trip, so
eventually the perks have to kick in.

528
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,359
Nice try there, Billy.

529
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:57,196
But my chariot got us here, which
means bed number B comes my way.

530
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:58,230
Not from this angle.

531
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,831
Then you leave me no choice.

532
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:01,999
SmackDown. Oh, yeah.

533
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,467
WWF, this is going to be good.

534
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:05,268
You too, liver lips,
on your feet.

535
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,436
Both beds will be earned
out here on the mat.

536
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,226
Oh!

537
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:12,839
My balls! That's dirty, Mark.

538
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,273
What can I tell you?

539
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:15,407
Next battle.

540
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,942
Fine, let's go.

541
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,358
I give up!

542
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,818
You want it that bad,
you can have it.

543
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,985
Just like that, huh?

544
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:33,019
Just like that.

545
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,420
I'm tired and I don't care.

546
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:38,423
To the victor come his spoils.

547
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:42,593
Ugh!

548
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:46,229
Aw, it figures, I get
Heidi Fleiss' cot.

549
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:48,831
This is gross.

550
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,033
I guess you get
what you pay for.

551
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:57,038
See, never bet
against the Crime Dog.

552
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,311
Hey, guys, I'm
glad we're doing this.

553
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:05,911
Me too.

554
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:10,181
Ever notice if you scratch halfway
between your balls and your asshole

555
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,582
it smells like pussy?

556
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,251
No, it doesn't.

557
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,319
Get a little
closer to your bung.

558
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,521
Hmm?

559
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,189
I just wanted to say goodnight.

560
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,291
You guys are sick.

561
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,264
Excuse me, miss.

562
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,098
Yeah.

563
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,867
I ordered sunny-side up.
These are over easy.

564
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,935
Okay, I'll get them
to redo them.

565
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,602
Why do they always
foul up my order?

566
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:43,571
'Cause you always ask for
side orders and confuse them.

567
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,573
Why not just make it easy?
Order number three.

568
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:47,341
I don't like the way
everything gets hash browns.

569
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:51,912
Hash browns are a filler. I want eggs
and meat, period. Like the Duke.

570
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:56,182
John Wayne? I happen to know
John Wayne hated hash browns.

571
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,349
You're out of your mind.

572
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,117
When am I gonna learn?
Stick with the cereal.

573
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,453
You get your own little self-contained meal.
Nobody has had their mitts on it.

574
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:06,056
Special K, Frosted Flakes.
It's impossible to screw up.

575
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,358
I asked for dry.

576
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,360
Hey, Miss Allison, how are you?

577
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:12,494
Sher, sure hope you get
this message.

578
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:17,098
We're just down here in South Carolina,
making our way to the Championship Bowl.

579
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,101
I was thinking about you. We
stopped and got something to eat.

580
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:23,070
How's, uh...
How's Hayden doing?

581
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:24,604
God almighty,
I miss him so much.

582
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:30,309
Hey, Sher, I gotta tell you. I didn't like the
way that you decided to throw him in the,

583
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:31,643
in the car and split.

584
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,610
I know I screwed up and all.

585
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,079
But you can't just take
somebody's kid like that.

586
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,914
You're not perfect either,
for the record.

587
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,118
I mean, how many times did you come visit
my father when he was in the hospital?

588
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,752
The man's sick and you
can't pop in and see him once?

589
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:47,389
When your mother was sick I was like a
frickin' delivery service three times a week.

590
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:52,026
Just put the shoe on the other foot.
That's all I'm saying, you know.

591
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:55,362
It's a two-way street
and I know, I know...

592
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,697
Your, like, 11 hours
of labor and diapers

593
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:01,100
and I'm under a lot
of pressure too, okay?

594
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:02,801
I mean, you find a way to pay
the freight for three people,

595
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:07,272
start a college fund and somehow figure
out how to stay ahead of the various...

596
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:09,506
Bills, you may have.

597
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,742
So I frickin' gambled. So what?

598
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:15,811
I made a few picks. They didn't come in.
Nobody's perfect.

599
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:18,613
All I can tell you is
that I never quit on you.

600
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:21,248
I never quit on you,
you selfish...

601
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:28,488
<i>I'm sorry. This is my mess.</i>

602
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,057
<i>Sorry, Sherry.</i>

603
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,145
How's the wife?

604
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,112
Line was busy.

605
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:55,812
Awfully long busy signal.

606
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:58,214
Who are you, the time keeper?
I said the line was busy.

607
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,182
Just a concerned citizen.

608
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:04,452
Hey, Mark, want to get some fireworks for
old time's sake? It's legal in the South.

609
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,587
It's legal all the way up
the Delaware Water Gap.

610
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,288
You shouldn't know that. You
can get whatever you want

611
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,491
the minute you leave Jersey.
Sparklers, the mortars, floral shells,

612
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,426
reloadable black powder
rockets.

613
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:15,859
Anything you want.

614
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,760
I'm worried about you.

615
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:20,395
Look, Vanna White.

616
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:23,197
Vanna. I used to love her.

617
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,431
Me too. She's a babe.

618
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,299
I wonder if she ever
did that Chuck Woolery.

619
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:28,534
She did Chuck Woolery's <i> Love Connection.
</i> Think she did?

620
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:30,869
No, might have taken
a run at Bob Barker though.

621
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:33,338
Down at the commissary. He's
been known to tap the help.

622
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,206
If the price was right.

623
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:39,676
Okay, quick quiz.

624
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:41,744
Dead or alive, Monty Hall?

625
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:43,186
Dead. Alive.

626
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:44,412
He's alive.

627
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:45,679
- Gene Rayburn?
- Dead.

628
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:47,647
Richard Dawson? Who?

629
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:49,582
The<i> Hogan's Hero</i> guy.
Or<i> Family Feud.</i>

630
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:52,351
The fat dude? Nah. You're
thinking Louie Anderson.

631
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:53,585
Dawson was the original.
Dead or alive?

632
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:56,187
He's gotta be dust or he'd still
be doing the show, right?

633
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,523
Look at us.
We're officially white trash.

634
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,725
Yeah, pretty much.

635
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:02,692
A Vanna museum.

636
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,461
My mother always said I'd
make it to the White House.

637
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:09,798
You know Vanna was on a soap for
like two months? <i> Edge of Night.</i>

638
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,120
Some folks said she had a
shot as a serious actress.

639
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:14,836
Then she got the<i> Wheel.</i>

640
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:17,138
Add that to the list of
useless information.

641
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,308
How many people do you know have the first
100 episodes of Wheel of Fortune on VHS?

642
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,544
Might want to keep that
autobiographical tidbit to yourself.

643
00:36:24,546 --> 00:36:26,412
I want to get them
transferred to DVD.

644
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:29,481
I just don't like the loss
of quality in the digitizing.

645
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,783
Billy, what are you doing?

646
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:34,317
Sniffing Vanna White's bush.

647
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,486
16, 17...

648
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:39,454
Is that 21? Yep,

649
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,888
21 rocket salute.

650
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:43,490
22, Vanna White.

651
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:47,627
To the greatest
letter turner of all time.

652
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:50,396
To the only letter
turner of all time.

653
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:51,999
Which makes her the greatest.

654
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,312
Oh, no.

655
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,913
What do we do?

656
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:16,249
I'm pretty sure we just
lit Vanna's house on fire.

657
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,185
Oh, shit!

658
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:23,721
Come on, guys. We gotta do something.
We gotta put it out.

659
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,751
This is a piece
of history here.

660
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:29,827
Cheers, Billy.

661
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:34,009
How could Vanna
not have a hose?

662
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,230
That wood's dry.

663
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,331
Yep.

664
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,833
Get a blanket. Check the Fury.
Get something.

665
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:42,869
I'd like to buy a vowel
and solve the puzzle.

666
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:43,970
You may.

667
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,938
"Smoldering rubble."

668
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,910
Remember when Vanna stopped
actually turning the letters?

669
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:57,713
She did? Yeah. Now she just touches them.
Special effect.

670
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:59,614
Out of the blue,
she just went electric.

671
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:03,250
Like Dylan. Way worse. I'm
dead-ended right there.

672
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:05,452
Uh-oh. Fire guys are rolling.

673
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:38,885
Okay, Medal of Honor
or Super Bowl MVP?

674
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:40,285
Medal of Honor.

675
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:42,287
Nobody is shooting at you
in the stadium. Fact.

676
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:43,688
Ooh, 3 o'clock.

677
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,322
Nice.

678
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,723
Anybody want a taco?

679
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,993
So the doctor says, "If this
is my rectal thermometer,

680
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,995
"what the hell did I do
with my pen?"

681
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,261
Is that funny?

682
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:56,395
I think it would be.

683
00:38:56,397 --> 00:38:57,963
Yeah, definitely.

684
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:58,863
It would be if what?

685
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:02,399
If we weren't shroomed out of our tits.
Uh-huh, yes.

686
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:03,641
Absolutely.

687
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:06,302
Mushrooms?

688
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,436
It's a hallucinogenic.

689
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:09,771
I know what it is. Where
are you guys from?

690
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:10,933
Nashville.

691
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:13,908
Cool.

692
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:18,478
<i>¶ Give me a job</i>
<i>Give me security</i>

693
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,847
<i>¶ Give me a chance to survive</i>

694
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,984
<i>¶ I'm just a poor soul</i>
<i>in the unemployment line</i>

695
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:28,654
<i>¶ I swear I'm barely alive</i>

696
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:31,690
<i>¶ My mother and father,</i>
<i>wife and my friends</i>

697
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,792
<i>¶ I've seen them</i>
<i>laugh in my face</i>

698
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:37,295
<i>¶ But I got the power</i>
<i>and I got the will</i>

699
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,797
<i>¶ I'm not a charity case</i>

700
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,533
<i>¶ I tell you long nights</i>

701
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:44,368
<i>¶ Impossible odds</i>

702
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,937
<i>¶ Keeping my eye</i>
<i>on the keyhole.</i>

703
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:49,339
We have to go. Now.

704
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,974
<i>¶ Well I'm gonna be</i>
<i>a blue collar man ¶</i>

705
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:53,709
You shouldn't do that.

706
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:55,744
Ever.

707
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:58,612
Come on. Let's get going.
Now that's funny.

708
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,647
You're pathetic.

709
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,050
Nice ho tag.

710
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:08,018
What?

711
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,585
Ho tag?

712
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:10,319
Let me guess.

713
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,655
That tattoo is to remind your boyfriend
that your ass is not your face.

714
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:17,057
Jerk.

715
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,792
- Skank.
- Come on.

716
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,059
Geez.

717
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,561
And here I thought
Styx was bulletproof.

718
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:26,630
That was Styx? Oh.

719
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,931
I'm gonna take a leak.

720
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:34,335
Why don't we leave that
in the trunk for a while?

721
00:40:34,337 --> 00:40:36,837
In the trunk? Yeah, you
can give it a rest.

722
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,371
I'll ride in the trunk
before that happens.

723
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:43,943
This baby is a work of art, worth at least 7 grand.
No way she's sleeping in the dark.

724
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:57,722
I'm not kidding. He just came up
from the field house and he says

725
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:00,524
half the basketball team just got
suspended by the NCAA. No way.

726
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,892
They got free clothes
from a store.

727
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:04,761
Some big booster was hooking them up
with all this swag, totally illegal.

728
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:05,895
They gonna miss
the game tonight?

729
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,596
Four starters and the Russian.

730
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,831
They're gonna get smoked.

731
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,567
Virginia is like
a 22-point underdog.

732
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,937
I bet you they'll cover the
spread tonight. No doubt.

733
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,474
This is the surest thing
in the history of sure things.

734
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,916
If you could just let me put
down $1,000 on Virginia, I'll...

735
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,146
I hate you.

736
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,648
All right, I need you
guys to concentrate here.

737
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,151
Do you know anyone who lives in
or near Atlantic City or Vegas

738
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:35,753
with access to
large sums of cash?

739
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,053
Not that I can think of.

740
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:37,887
You cannot be serious.

741
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:40,222
I haven't been more serious in my life.
Think harder.

742
00:41:40,224 --> 00:41:41,790
You'll be doing them a favor.
All they gotta do

743
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:45,260
is walk into the casino, put down a
bet for me and I'll give 'em 50%.

744
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:46,661
I don't know anybody.

745
00:41:46,663 --> 00:41:47,595
80%.

746
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,162
We just don't know.

747
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:52,199
An Indian casino, Foxwoods. You must
know somebody who lives in Connecticut.

748
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,833
Mark, calm down.
This is my lock.

749
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:57,670
This is my bulletproof, no two ways
about it, once in a lifetime lock.

750
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:00,539
It's like I can see
tomorrow's sports pages today

751
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,641
and word is gonna get out, it's
gonna spread like wildfire

752
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:05,176
and then they're gonna take this thing
right off the board. Now think!

753
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:08,512
We don't know anyone who can bet.
I am going to miss this!

754
00:42:08,514 --> 00:42:10,547
I am going to miss this!
Get a hold...

755
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:11,981
Mark, get a hold of yourself.
Come on!

756
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:12,948
Here, medicine.

757
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,750
What it that? Mushrooms,
the redhead dropped them.

758
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:23,256
I walked right into a taco stand.
I can't believe it would...

759
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:27,627
I thought it would be on a train.
A metro-liner rolling down to DC

760
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:32,798
for a Redskins game when a senator
comes in and sits next to me and

761
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,034
tells me he's gonna have the Secret
Service shove the guy into a dumpster.

762
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:40,304
Give me those. If I've gotta listen to
him, I've gotta be on the same planet.

763
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:45,308
Just don't let him
push you around.

764
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,710
Do you even know where
he's staying?

765
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:50,546
I got the seat locations
from Jason's mom.

766
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:51,647
Sure you want to do this?

767
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:55,009
Mom, he sounded terrible on the phone.
I need to go to him.

768
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:57,785
Here, Mommy, for luck.

769
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,286
I love you.

770
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:04,223
Can you see from back there?
Yeah, I'm fine.

771
00:43:04,825 --> 00:43:07,058
Got chasers? A little bit.

772
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,592
You've done this before?

773
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:09,759
Not in a while.

774
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:12,895
I had a phase.
I tried most everything.

775
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:15,831
Gourmet reefer, crystal meth,

776
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,332
shrooms the odd Friday.

777
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:18,199
Crystal meth?

778
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:22,836
Nobody's paying much attention to me
so it's pretty easy to hide the buzz.

779
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:25,038
What if I just jumped?

780
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,072
Whoa, whoa.

781
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:27,106
Hey, don't screw around.

782
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:31,143
What would I be thinking when I hit?
You know, the last thing

783
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,811
going through my mind?

784
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,178
Your ass.

785
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,182
38 years old and I got squat.

786
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,350
You too, Billy.

787
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:44,585
Back there was
a stinking disaster.

788
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:46,587
You know, wasn't long ago
you were gigging clubs

789
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,989
and knocking chicks off
your dick with your guitar.

790
00:43:48,991 --> 00:43:50,991
Ancient history, bro.
Dead and buried.

791
00:43:50,993 --> 00:43:54,961
No, no. I used to love
watching you on stage.

792
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,696
You had the walk.

793
00:43:56,698 --> 00:44:01,033
Then some Tuesday, you woke up a roll-over
pussy just taking shit from everybody.

794
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:03,301
Your wife, people at work.

795
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:05,202
Dog chases every car he sees.

796
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:06,670
First one he lets go...

797
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:10,640
It's not just me.
I mean, all three of us.

798
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:14,110
I don't know if it's bad
luck or age or laziness.

799
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:17,646
One day you realize you're
not going to be president.

800
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,188
You don't get it.

801
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,848
I mean no offense, fellas,

802
00:44:22,684 --> 00:44:24,925
but I was gonna be president.

803
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:27,785
Or governor, CEO...

804
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:30,353
An astronaut.

805
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:33,316
I don't know. You know...

806
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,356
Somebody instead...

807
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,264
Mark, you got a kid.

808
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:48,101
Who collects a half million dollars if I
should happen to fall off this bridge.

809
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,002
Hey, that's crazy talk.

810
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:55,007
Yeah, well, I'm running out of illusions. And
I'm not going into the New Year a loser.

811
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,977
Wow, we got nothing
going for us.

812
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:01,278
We got beer left.

813
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:18,860
Hey, Billy.

814
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:22,963
You taking a pee or just
standing and touching yourself?

815
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:25,298
You know how it is,
once you break the seal.

816
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,368
Hey, where's the best place
you guys ever took a leak?

817
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,437
No such thing as a bad
leak as far as I'm concerned.

818
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,971
Agreed.

819
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:35,305
Grand Canyon.

820
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:36,005
Really?

821
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:39,274
Yep. Right over the friggin' edge.
A gust of wind,

822
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:43,278
I would have fallen a quarter-mile
and pancaked a pack mule.

823
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,947
I took a leak between
subway cars.

824
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:51,052
Elevated 7 train, rolling through
Queens on the way to Shea Stadium.

825
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,120
Fourth of July, doubleheader.

826
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:55,054
Nice.

827
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:58,724
You? Nancy Golotta's back.

828
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,159
Her back? I didn't want to.
She asked me.

829
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:04,828
She's dirty. Ya think?

830
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,130
You could've said no. Hold it.

831
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:11,867
You had sex with Nancy Golotta?
You demon!

832
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,971
The last girl I was with before my wife.
My wife...

833
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,406
Ha! Who's coming off?

834
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,307
Look at those stars!

835
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:23,877
Drink that on the horizon.
Twinkle, twinkle, Twinkie.

836
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:27,013
The trees in front of you
are 30 feet high, genius.

837
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:28,280
You can't see the horizon.

838
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:30,048
Come on, what's taking you...

839
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,315
Good Lord!

840
00:46:31,317 --> 00:46:33,784
I'm blocked! What should I do?

841
00:46:33,786 --> 00:46:35,786
Okay, I know what
to do. I know what to do.

842
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,889
Hold your balls, fetal
position. Play dead.

843
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:42,158
Play dead? No, that's bears!
Run, dumbass.

844
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,295
Come on, come on, come on!

845
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:52,800
- Easy...
- Cover my balls...

846
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:08,180
Whoa, hey, pull over.

847
00:47:16,456 --> 00:47:21,459
How you feeling? We found a
carnival on shrooms, you tell me.

848
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,234
Hey.

849
00:47:31,536 --> 00:47:34,136
Step off of that thing,
young man.

850
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:38,806
If you break that, somebody's
gonna have to fix it. Sorry.

851
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:42,376
No harm done,
just can't add work

852
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:44,659
when there's plenty
to do already.

853
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,080
I knew these things were rigged.
You can call me Melville.

854
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:51,515
Bill McGriff, Chalfont, PA.

855
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,084
Hour west of Philly,
I know it well.

856
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:58,387
Worked the northern circuit with
the Clyde Beatty outfit for years.

857
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,290
Hey, wait.
That's the circus, right?

858
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:05,359
The real circus, where you
smell the elephant dung.

859
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,994
Not like that tutti-frutti
French affair.

860
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,229
Cirque du Soleil?
Yeah, that'd be the one.

861
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:14,433
I'm Jason, and I love the circus.
Yeah, me too, Jason.

862
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:16,501
Till they forced me out.

863
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:18,870
Come on, boys,
have a drink with me.

864
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,204
Come on, guys.

865
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:21,305
Right behind you.

866
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:22,572
They forced you out?

867
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:24,006
Yes, they did.

868
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:25,507
Big cats.

869
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:27,375
Must've hurt.

870
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:30,411
A lion and a tiger
have a fight. Who wins?

871
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:34,348
Give you a hint. A female lion looks
enough like a female tiger that

872
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,884
the horny striped male thinks
he might take a shot at her.

873
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:41,187
King of the jungle doesn't like
the competition. Fight's on.

874
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:45,524
So the lion wins. He's got right on his side.
You see, a tiger

875
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:50,328
stands on three paws.
Swings with his fourth.

876
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,031
Lion gets up on his haunches,
fires back, two-hand volley.

877
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,470
Outgunned, tiger flips onto his back,
tries to fight up from the bottom.

878
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:01,570
Fatal mistake.

879
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,005
Is that what happened to you?

880
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:05,440
You got between
a lion and a tiger?

881
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,477
Nah, I rolled my pickup
shitfaced outside of Albany.

882
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,347
Can't drive a stick no more,

883
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:16,383
but I get by all right.

884
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:20,452
Hey, fella. St. Nicholas,
where you been?

885
00:49:20,454 --> 00:49:24,255
Got some lungs on him. Yeah,
well he's got a lot to say.

886
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:26,590
St. Nicholas...
Like Santa Claus?

887
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:28,425
Come here, buddy. Hey.

888
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:35,498
Yeah, he brings me presents all year. Birds, mice...
Deader than yesterday.

889
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:50,344
A gift's a gift.

890
00:49:55,718 --> 00:50:00,320
Pennyfeathers. I figure you
Pennsylvania boys are heading south.

891
00:50:00,322 --> 00:50:02,622
- Florida, hmm?
- That's right.

892
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,757
Best damn bar in the state.

893
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:08,326
Pennyfeathers?

894
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:10,528
What you seek,

895
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:13,630
you may find there.

896
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:27,574
One arm, lives in
a dirty old trailer...

897
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:29,208
Didn't seem to bother him much.

898
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:32,344
Big talk, little cat, creepy bastard.
Deluded.

899
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:34,446
- Senile.
- We won!

900
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,049
We won, we won!
I don't believe it!

901
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:43,721
We're rich! Whoo! We won, we won!
I gotta tell 'em.

902
00:50:43,723 --> 00:50:47,591
Jason, Jason, what...

903
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,461
Tell who? Come on.

904
00:50:53,164 --> 00:50:57,299
We won! Did you take my
sports section, chief?

905
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:58,566
The answer to all our prayers.

906
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:00,501
Hand me the toilet roll,
will ya?

907
00:51:00,503 --> 00:51:03,637
Oh, sure, Elmo.
You need to wipe up? Here.

908
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:06,740
Wipe up, Elmo. Use that.
Oh, that's stinky, Elmo.

909
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:09,542
Use this, that'll make you...

910
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,076
Get out of here!

911
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:13,611
What's the matter
with you, huh?

912
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:18,148
What the hell are you doing? Can
you say, "Mega Mad Millions"?

913
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,583
Can you say $26 million?

914
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:24,086
Million, as in
ma, ma, ma, million!

915
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:29,057
0, 6, 10, 11, 25, 56, 57.
God damn, he's right.

916
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,258
It's a match!

917
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,292
We won!

918
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:32,760
We won! We won!

919
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:36,482
We won! We won! We won!

920
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:39,798
I can't believe it.

921
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:44,402
Wait a minute.

922
00:51:44,737 --> 00:51:46,136
There's a problem.

923
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:47,570
See, we split equal shares.

924
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,538
No problems at all!

925
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,473
Last week's newspaper.

926
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,444
Never thought my last
meal would be a corn dog.

927
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,281
I wonder if you can actually hear
your back snap when you hit.

928
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:04,351
Hey, I got an idea.
What if only you guys jump.

929
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:07,554
I tried to save you.
You know, I go back home,

930
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:10,523
say great things about you,
work your legacy.

931
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:13,292
You exist forever,
like dead heroes.

932
00:52:13,294 --> 00:52:15,160
Heroes who offed themselves?

933
00:52:15,162 --> 00:52:19,330
Oh, I know, I could write a
ballad about you guys. No.

934
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,599
Now you can jump last,

935
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:25,201
but then, of course,
you'll be bridge scrudge.

936
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:28,337
No way. We go, we go together.

937
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:29,771
All right then.

938
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:31,705
One.

939
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:33,306
Two.

940
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:34,714
Three.

941
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:42,146
Last time I was happy. Well, Mom
and Dad, I guess this is it.

942
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:47,584
I had a dog once. Wouldn't
poop till I looked away.

943
00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:50,320
We had a picture of my wife
and my kid in the car.

944
00:52:51,256 --> 00:52:52,655
It's going with me.

945
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:12,674
I just wanna say,
if we're gonna do this...

946
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:15,909
You're my best friend... Pal.

947
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:19,913
Thanks, buddy. That means a lot.
Ah, you don't give a fuck.

948
00:53:19,915 --> 00:53:24,651
No sense going alone.
Here, I brought your wife too.

949
00:53:29,391 --> 00:53:31,691
<i>Speak up, dear.</i> Ahhh!

950
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:36,328
Sweet Jesus, we killed him.
Help me, you idiots!

951
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,431
Come on, grab my wrists!

952
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:41,366
We got you!

953
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:43,468
I got you, I got you.

954
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,704
I got you, I got you.

955
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,710
- Oh, my back!
- My balls!

956
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:56,677
Swim!

957
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,178
So much for that buzz.

958
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,281
Oh, shit.

959
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:08,687
A midget couldn't kill
himself off of that bridge.

960
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,768
Isn't this the part where the
hillbilly bangs me in the ass?

961
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,903
Oh, you guys wear me out.

962
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:31,407
You know what? I don't wanna be dead.
No way.

963
00:54:31,976 --> 00:54:33,542
Me neither.

964
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,544
What if you could...

965
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,614
What if you could be dead
and not be dead?

966
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:41,815
Dead and... Huh?

967
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:42,949
Yeah.

968
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:47,253
No responsibilities.
No obligations.

969
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,254
And no debt.

970
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:51,789
You just get a fresh start.

971
00:55:07,706 --> 00:55:10,239
Uh, I wanna get an order
of wings, to go, please.

972
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:11,473
Sure, hon, what size?

973
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,975
Medium bucket. I'd like
a big bucket, myself.

974
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,010
But I'm gonna make an
exception in your case.

975
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:20,314
That's a sweet little turd cutter
you got there. First-rate.

976
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,751
How would you like 'em?

977
00:55:24,753 --> 00:55:26,519
Hot, baby, real hot.

978
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:28,354
Buddy...

979
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:32,991
Uh, not the spiciest, but you know...
Good. Be right back.

980
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,829
They got great wings here, huh?

981
00:55:38,831 --> 00:55:40,897
Best goddamn wings
in the world.

982
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:42,765
Any place else,
I won't eat 'em.

983
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:45,467
They make 'em with
too much lard, no butter.

984
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:50,371
Makes me crap like I got a can
of snakes coming out of my ass.

985
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,506
That's good to know.

986
00:55:54,443 --> 00:55:59,312
You like that? I'm not a
swordfish no sauce guy.

987
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,380
If it's on the menu,
I'm eatin' it.

988
00:56:01,382 --> 00:56:04,282
That so? You bet
your ass, tough guy.

989
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:10,854
Mark? Yeah.

990
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:14,424
If I get married,
I want you to be my best man.

991
00:56:14,426 --> 00:56:16,859
Sure, just let me know when
you meet somebody.

992
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,661
No, seriously.
Yeah, I know it's

993
00:56:19,663 --> 00:56:23,031
not a time to bring it up, but
I've been thinking about it.

994
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,466
And I consider you to be
my best friend.

995
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,668
All right, buddy. I'm honored.

996
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,970
Ah, you don't give a fuck.

997
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:34,907
Anything else?

998
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:38,343
No, that's it. How about
a kiss for old Daddy-o?

999
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,043
No touching!

1000
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:42,979
Mmm, still got
that new car smell.

1001
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:45,014
You ought to be careful.
Sometimes they have boyfriends.

1002
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:46,815
You're liable to get
yourself popped.

1003
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,050
What the hell do
you know about it?

1004
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:51,352
What? You heard me.

1005
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:52,786
Look, there's two kinds of
guys in the world, right?

1006
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:56,923
I mean, look at you. You've never
been in a scrap in your whole life,

1007
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,392
have you? Am I right?

1008
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:02,461
It's not a big deal. I mean,
a lot of guys missed it.

1009
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,995
It starts in kindergarten.

1010
00:57:03,997 --> 00:57:07,932
You pretend that the bully didn't knock you down.
Then, in grade school, you pretend

1011
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:11,101
they didn't take your lunch
money away from you.

1012
00:57:11,103 --> 00:57:12,435
You're always
duckin' and dodgin'.

1013
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:17,573
You get to high school, you pretend you
didn't hear the teasing and the catcalls.

1014
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:20,709
And all the time, you're
running from the danger.

1015
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:24,713
You skip enough chances, before
you know it, you're 30, 35,

1016
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:27,115
and you've never
been in a beef.

1017
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:29,717
I guess you know everything.
Nah,

1018
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:33,087
just a guy who's lookin' for
answers in a bottle.

1019
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:39,826
Nope, not in that one.

1020
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,499
So let me get this straight, you fake your
demise, your wife and kids get the money,

1021
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:49,666
and you slip the bookie.

1022
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:51,067
And the 27 G's I owe him.

1023
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:55,162
And then what happens, you go into
the Loser Protection Program?

1024
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,639
Give me the chum.

1025
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,141
It's where you
were pissin', right?

1026
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,512
Hey, hold on. Don't you think this is a little rash?
I mean, sure, you got problems,

1027
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,147
big ones, but who doesn't? Sure
wish I'd paid more attention to

1028
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:10,016
the Discovery Channel. I'd know
what these lizards like to eat.

1029
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,984
Odds are it's not Hooters.

1030
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:16,955
They're like sharks, they're opportunistic.
They'll eat whatever they can get.

1031
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,490
Except chicken
wings, apparently.

1032
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:21,158
The Discovery Channel
is awesome.

1033
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,126
I remember watchin'
this one about panda bears.

1034
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:27,230
Apparently panda bears have very low
libidos, so these poor Japanese bastards...

1035
00:58:27,232 --> 00:58:29,198
- Chinese.
- Huh?

1036
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,666
Pandas are in China.

1037
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:34,202
Chinese, Japanese, Charlie is Charlie.
The point is,

1038
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:38,239
is that they spend all day showing 'em
movies of other pandas getting busy.

1039
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:39,806
Panda porn.

1040
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:43,042
Panda porn? That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard of.

1041
00:58:43,844 --> 00:58:45,009
Till this.

1042
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:46,677
So where you gonna go?

1043
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:49,612
I dunno. Exile.

1044
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:52,280
Where's that? In Mexico?

1045
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:56,149
What about us? Are we ever
gonna see each other again?

1046
00:58:56,818 --> 00:58:58,184
Guess not.

1047
00:58:58,186 --> 00:58:59,618
Ever?

1048
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,586
I don't see how.

1049
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:07,758
Well that settles it.
We go, we go together.

1050
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:11,661
- To exile.
- Exile.

1051
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,131
All right, gentlemen,
we are officially in business.

1052
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:20,268
Okay, here's the play.

1053
00:59:20,637 --> 00:59:22,269
I wind it up to 120 rpms.

1054
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:24,771
Kick it back down into second,
lock her up in the gravel.

1055
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,840
She stops in a power slide
10 feet shy of the swamp.

1056
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:29,541
We push her in from there.

1057
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:30,308
That's pretty fast.

1058
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,777
We gotta make it look
like an accident, right?

1059
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:35,746
You sure you can stop in time?
It's a Fury.

1060
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:37,848
I can stop this baby on a dime.

1061
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,684
I'm thinking we should
salvage some things.

1062
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:43,186
Definitely get some cash
for these rims.

1063
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,087
Sure, maybe there's
a swap meet Saturday.

1064
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:46,154
This is the South, man.

1065
00:59:46,156 --> 00:59:50,024
Rims are like currency down here. They pass
'em down from generation to generation,

1066
00:59:50,026 --> 00:59:50,924
like heirlooms.

1067
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:53,293
Mark... We should
yank the stereo too.

1068
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:55,728
It's no Sanyo box, Blaupunkt.

1069
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,163
Like Mercedes.
German gear keeps its value.

1070
00:59:58,165 --> 00:59:59,831
Wait a second.
For this to work,

1071
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:03,067
the car has to go in as-is,
end of discussion.

1072
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:06,303
Fine, I lose my car,
guitar gets wet too.

1073
01:00:06,305 --> 01:00:09,806
Leave her out of it. No way,
if Fury goes, guitar goes.

1074
01:00:09,808 --> 01:00:11,007
Why, 'cause you're a bad loser?

1075
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:13,976
Well now, you show me a good loser,
and I'll show you a loser, loser.

1076
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:19,114
It is only fair, we are supposed to be dead.
Think of the forensics.

1077
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,715
Fine, she goes.

1078
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,016
That's it?

1079
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:26,119
- Good for you.
- Way to stick up for yourself.

1080
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:28,955
Save some for the reptiles...
Please.

1081
01:00:29,357 --> 01:00:32,091
You know, I'm thinkin'? I should do it.
Do what?

1082
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:35,194
I'm a professional driver. I drive for a living.
Give me the keys.

1083
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:38,897
No way. There's only one
Joe who flies this bird.

1084
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:05,221
Whoa.

1085
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:09,057
Mark?

1086
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:18,365
Where the hell is he?
He's gone.

1087
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:19,999
Mark?

1088
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:21,233
In the water!

1089
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:31,676
Mark!

1090
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:36,712
Did you see that power roll?

1091
01:01:36,714 --> 01:01:37,746
Off the hook.

1092
01:01:37,748 --> 01:01:40,682
All right, guys, if you don't mind,
we're in Wally Gator's swimming pool.

1093
01:01:40,684 --> 01:01:44,285
You see any?
You gotta look for their eyes.

1094
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:46,086
I don't see any.

1095
01:01:46,755 --> 01:01:50,289
There!
He's got the chicken wings!

1096
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:54,893
One, two, three.

1097
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:21,918
Your sister's ass. What?

1098
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,754
Tell me you got those tickets
out of the glove box.

1099
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:28,223
Oh. There's two words...

1100
01:02:28,225 --> 01:02:31,859
Labor Day party. Sorry,
guys, I didn't think.

1101
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,094
Damn right you didn't think.
I don't get it.

1102
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:37,030
How do you manage to screw
up so many times in one day?

1103
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,733
I get up early.

1104
01:02:41,202 --> 01:02:42,935
You know what this means?

1105
01:02:43,404 --> 01:02:45,804
Somebody's gotta go in.

1106
01:02:46,939 --> 01:02:48,371
I'll do it.

1107
01:02:55,045 --> 01:02:56,711
Pretty ballsy, huh?

1108
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:04,051
Did you see that? Oh, no.

1109
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:05,485
Hey, this is bad.

1110
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,758
Wow!

1111
01:03:13,926 --> 01:03:15,825
Oh, man!

1112
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,797
<i>(LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.</i>

1113
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,125
<i>Just a few minutes to go, and Times
Square is coming to a boil...</i>

1114
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:29,429
I know what we need.
How about it? To, uh...

1115
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:30,797
The afterlife.

1116
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,165
The afterlife, that's good.

1117
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:33,866
You know they say the way you
spend your New Year's Eve

1118
01:04:33,868 --> 01:04:35,067
is the way your
whole year's gonna go.

1119
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:37,402
Really? Is that what
they say? Because I...

1120
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:41,506
I feel great. Honest to God, I'm feeling
liberated, I'm feeling renewed.

1121
01:04:41,508 --> 01:04:44,509
Like Butch and Sundance. Butch and Sundance?
Didn't they get shot?

1122
01:04:44,511 --> 01:04:48,312
Yeah, but with their boots on. Come
on, let's go, I'm thirsty. Today.

1123
01:04:48,314 --> 01:04:51,348
It's stuck. Give me this.

1124
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:54,517
Hey!

1125
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,385
I wanna propose a toast.

1126
01:04:57,821 --> 01:04:59,587
New leaf, we got a clean slate.

1127
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:02,289
I say we take advantage of it and
start living like philosophers.

1128
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:08,495
No more mincin' words or dancin' around.
You see a thing, you name a thing.

1129
01:05:08,497 --> 01:05:10,698
What the hell are you
talking about?

1130
01:05:11,132 --> 01:05:13,492
Yeah, I'm gonna live
more true. More honest.

1131
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:18,002
New me's gonna be a straight shooter.
Oh, okay then. Me too.

1132
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:22,206
Straight shooter. Me too! You
gotta stop being a parrot, man.

1133
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:25,075
You're always doin' that. You can't do that.
You just... You chime in,

1134
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:28,511
you just agree with everybody right away.
All right, that's fair...

1135
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:30,613
That's what I'm talking about.

1136
01:05:30,615 --> 01:05:32,247
Polly want a cracker?

1137
01:05:32,249 --> 01:05:36,417
Okay, now remember when you point that
finger, you got four pointed back at you.

1138
01:05:36,419 --> 01:05:38,085
Take Billy here,
he's the perfect example.

1139
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:42,055
He backs down to everybody. He's got
more footprints on him than a treadmill.

1140
01:05:42,057 --> 01:05:44,891
All right, just give me some
bubbles. No therapy, please.

1141
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:46,158
No therapy, just the truth.

1142
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,129
You tell me right now. What is it gonna take
for you to finally stand up for yourself?

1143
01:05:52,332 --> 01:05:55,333
Thank you for that insightful
counsel, Dr. Freud.

1144
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,868
Now what's it gonna take for you
to shut your know-it-all yap and

1145
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,037
let me enjoy this outstanding beverage?
Pucker up and blow me.

1146
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,940
I knew I should have killed myself alone.
Okay, guys, why don't we...

1147
01:06:04,942 --> 01:06:08,510
Wind it down a little bit, get some sleep.
We got a big game tomorrow.

1148
01:06:08,512 --> 01:06:13,047
Hey, Billy. Think that douche in the shitter
was the only one nailing your wife?

1149
01:06:18,254 --> 01:06:23,423
Okay, Captain Honest, you got something to say?
Finish the thought.

1150
01:06:23,658 --> 01:06:26,859
Let's just say there were other
passengers on that flight.

1151
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,627
Fuck you. What are you saying?
You banged my wife?

1152
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:32,996
Guys, why don't we just...
Shut up.

1153
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:35,097
Did you bang my wife?

1154
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:37,598
Tell me you're lying.

1155
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,399
Or what, Billy?

1156
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:44,937
Are you going to hit me? Tell me
you're lying, or tell me good-bye.

1157
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,106
This is so wrong.

1158
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:13,397
What the hell did you do...

1159
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,199
All the women you could
get, why the hell...

1160
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:19,068
Relax, I never
touched his wife.

1161
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,011
Then why did you...

1162
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:31,379
He's pathetic.

1163
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:35,449
I'm trying to get him to stand up for himself.
I'm trying to help him.

1164
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,552
You're a mess. Help yourself.

1165
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,087
Oh, look, Dweezil, give me a break...
Yeah, I'm a clerk.

1166
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,455
Sells whiteout
and envelopes, okay.

1167
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:46,193
I can't get a girl, my mother's a bitch.
You got me, dead to rights.

1168
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:53,833
And now that that's cleared up, why don't
you have a quick look at yourself.

1169
01:07:57,237 --> 01:08:01,439
You're the coolest guy
I ever met, hands down.

1170
01:08:01,441 --> 01:08:06,410
Could dunk a basketball flat-footed,
could talk a girl down to her Jockeys.

1171
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:09,312
Make anybody think
his jokes are funny.

1172
01:08:11,549 --> 01:08:13,682
The man everybody wanted to be.

1173
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:22,856
With all of that, you throw
your money away gambling,

1174
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:26,492
you let your family slip through
your fingers, and now...

1175
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:29,794
You run off the two best
friends you've ever had.

1176
01:08:31,297 --> 01:08:32,729
I'd ask why,

1177
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:35,564
but then I'm kinda past caring.

1178
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:43,838
Happy New Year.

1179
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:52,712
<i>(CHEATERS & NON-BELIEVERS.</i>

1180
01:08:58,152 --> 01:09:00,752
Two sugars, no NutraSweet,

1181
01:09:00,754 --> 01:09:03,074
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

1182
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:08,258
Hey!

1183
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,726
Oops.

1184
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:12,661
You stupid, little son of a bitch.
Sorry, sir.

1185
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:14,663
Now get down here
and clean this up!

1186
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:18,600
Hey, get down here
and clean this up!

1187
01:09:36,786 --> 01:09:38,318
Whoo!

1188
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:43,222
What are you doing, huh?

1189
01:09:43,224 --> 01:09:47,326
Good catch, buddy.
Ready? Down one, hike!

1190
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:48,593
Kid's got hands.

1191
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:49,794
And he's got heart.

1192
01:09:49,796 --> 01:09:52,563
Loves the game. Who's
he rootin' for tonight?

1193
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:57,367
Ah, we don't have tickets. He just
loves to soak up the atmosphere.

1194
01:09:57,369 --> 01:09:59,689
Says he's gonna play
in this stadium someday.

1195
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:01,502
I hope he gets to.

1196
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:12,445
Yo, who's got tickets? I
need some tickets over here.

1197
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:16,482
Who's selling? Who's selling?
Yo, need two!

1198
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,750
Who's got two?

1199
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:19,784
Oh, my God.

1200
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,953
I'll give you $500 a piece,
right now.

1201
01:10:23,588 --> 01:10:25,888
$1,500, you gotta make a move.

1202
01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:31,326
Why don't you paint that thing?

1203
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:33,461
It's earth tone, one of a kind.

1204
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:35,563
Well, you better wear a
helmet, they'll write you.

1205
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,931
I got a hard head.

1206
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,572
We can't afford these.

1207
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,205
Sure you can, they're on me.

1208
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:49,874
Just leave me one when he comes
back and suits up some day.

1209
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:53,877
Hey,

1210
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:56,345
what's your name?

1211
01:10:56,613 --> 01:10:59,447
For the tickets someday.

1212
01:11:14,863 --> 01:11:17,430
Did you see that?
Nothing but cork.

1213
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:20,933
Two triples and a bull.
This girl is unbelievable.

1214
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:22,401
Talk to her.

1215
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,909
Classic Tudor with a high finish.
You do that beautifully.

1216
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:34,646
I like to think that it's Creole, tutored
by way of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

1217
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:35,847
Hi, I'm Jason.

1218
01:11:35,849 --> 01:11:37,248
Janice.

1219
01:11:37,783 --> 01:11:40,450
May I have the honor
of a match?

1220
01:11:40,452 --> 01:11:43,686
I yield the lane to the challenger.
Hmm.

1221
01:11:44,021 --> 01:11:45,854
I accept the courtesy.

1222
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:53,594
Tungsten Devastators with the
spinning Hammer Head flights.

1223
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,595
Sweet!

1224
01:11:55,597 --> 01:11:57,029
They're not for everyone.

1225
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:59,464
I could do some
damage with these.

1226
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,367
Nice balance.

1227
01:12:04,802 --> 01:12:06,334
The R-182 shafts.

1228
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:07,735
I'm thirsty.

1229
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:09,036
Want a cold one?

1230
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,573
Getting me a beer?

1231
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:22,646
Can't find your seat? I'm looking for my
husband, he's supposed to be right here

1232
01:12:22,648 --> 01:12:24,014
in these seats.

1233
01:12:24,016 --> 01:12:25,448
Is his name Mark?

1234
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:29,051
<i>And now, America,</i>
<i>Miss Vanna White!</i>

1235
01:12:37,026 --> 01:12:41,395
<i>¶ Oh, say can you see</i>

1236
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:44,498
<i>¶ By the dawn's</i>
<i>early light... ¶</i>

1237
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:51,404
<i>The spectacular wreckage</i>
<i>of an ancient Plymouth Fury</i>

1238
01:12:51,406 --> 01:12:54,039
<i>was pulled from the swamp on
Country Road 61, near Beecham...</i>

1239
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,940
<i>No sign of survivors...</i>

1240
01:12:55,942 --> 01:12:57,641
I knew those guys.

1241
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:00,943
Best friends I ever had.

1242
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,843
Cold ones.

1243
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,711
I'll take a beer.

1244
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,945
Keep it.

1245
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,879
Thanks.

1246
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:14,717
Big cats. Melville.

1247
01:13:35,506 --> 01:13:37,572
Hey, more guitar. Up.

1248
01:13:38,374 --> 01:13:41,007
One, two, three!

1249
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,842
One triple away.

1250
01:13:45,478 --> 01:13:46,543
Well struck, grasshopper.

1251
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:51,548
Oh, well I've spent much time snatching
the pebble from the serpent's maw.

1252
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:56,819
Hey, look at that guy over there. He's got
a hearing aid the size of a lawn mower

1253
01:13:56,821 --> 01:13:57,853
stuck to his head.

1254
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,788
And he has it on high.

1255
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:02,556
Oh, shit.

1256
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,559
You again.

1257
01:14:06,561 --> 01:14:09,428
You know what it cost me
to detail that car?

1258
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:10,562
It was an accident.

1259
01:14:10,564 --> 01:14:11,663
Uh-huh.

1260
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:14,065
It looks like we're up next.
Well, uh...

1261
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:16,834
Please go ahead, because
we were just messing around.

1262
01:14:16,836 --> 01:14:18,802
You can have it.
We want a match with you.

1263
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:21,404
We accept. What do you
want to play for?

1264
01:14:21,406 --> 01:14:22,738
How about $10 cricket?

1265
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:23,772
Cricket?

1266
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:27,375
Do I look like I want to spend time with you?
All I want to do is take your money.

1267
01:14:27,377 --> 01:14:29,377
First bull's-eye, 50 bucks.

1268
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:31,579
Okay, I'll lead off.

1269
01:14:32,048 --> 01:14:33,614
I'll call you when I need you.
Hey.

1270
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:36,984
I got a score to settle with your
little comedian friend here.

1271
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:39,686
I wanna see him shoot. Yeah,
shit or get off the pot.

1272
01:14:44,758 --> 01:14:48,426
Bet you 100 bucks he can hit
a dime on my forehead.

1273
01:14:48,428 --> 01:14:49,026
Are you nuts?

1274
01:14:49,028 --> 01:14:51,661
I've seen you shoot. It's like
throwing a rock in the ocean.

1275
01:14:51,663 --> 01:14:55,998
I'll take that bet. Oh, no, uh...
We're not doing this.

1276
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:59,868
What's the matter,
chuckles? Chicken?

1277
01:15:00,904 --> 01:15:03,104
Pedro, where's the ice?

1278
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:04,405
Jason...

1279
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:08,075
I trust you.

1280
01:15:11,046 --> 01:15:12,745
Move.

1281
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:31,429
No cheating. I don't need
to cheat, you clowns.

1282
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:33,830
Lock and fire on it.

1283
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:13,200
Good shot.

1284
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:15,869
Pay the man his hundy.

1285
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,204
Two out of three.

1286
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,705
That's funny.

1287
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:23,775
You know, there's three ways
that I can tell a jerkoff.

1288
01:16:23,777 --> 01:16:27,245
One, was O.J. guilty?
Two, Coke or Pepsi?

1289
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,079
And I forgot the third one.

1290
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:32,215
Bull's-eye.

1291
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,116
- That went well.
- Leave him alone!

1292
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:35,317
Zip it.

1293
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:37,786
Okay, come on if you're comin'.

1294
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:39,220
There's five of us
and one of you.

1295
01:16:39,222 --> 01:16:40,754
Two...

1296
01:16:40,756 --> 01:16:44,124
Of us. And I don't
like your chances.

1297
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:45,892
We're gonna kill you guys.

1298
01:16:45,894 --> 01:16:49,195
Too late, we've already
been dead 11 hours.

1299
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:51,830
Welcome back to the male species.
Nice to have you back.

1300
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,332
What are you talking about? You think
I'm doing this because of you?

1301
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:56,734
Fight!

1302
01:16:56,736 --> 01:16:58,335
Come on, bring it. Come, on.

1303
01:16:58,337 --> 01:17:00,070
Yeah? Billy!

1304
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:01,637
Huh?

1305
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:04,940
Hit him! Billy, hit him!

1306
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:07,742
Go!

1307
01:17:12,647 --> 01:17:13,946
Come on...

1308
01:17:15,149 --> 01:17:17,816
Let go! Bastards!

1309
01:17:19,953 --> 01:17:22,987
Wow, I think it kicks ass.

1310
01:17:23,656 --> 01:17:24,955
Headin' out tonight.

1311
01:17:24,957 --> 01:17:26,356
As fast as you can.

1312
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:27,857
Don't start with me.

1313
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:29,058
Far be it for me...

1314
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,761
You never stop, do you? Okay, come on, guys.
Enough already.

1315
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:36,297
Come on, Billy, we got the motel room
for one more night. Let's just...

1316
01:17:36,299 --> 01:17:40,668
Go out on a good note. No.
I'm gonna get rolling north.

1317
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,102
Back home.

1318
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,103
All right.

1319
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,876
I'm gonna go for a nightcap.
You wanna come?

1320
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:52,978
No, I'm done. I'll go home.

1321
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,112
Okay.

1322
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:59,148
Hey, I was wondering...

1323
01:18:00,317 --> 01:18:03,818
What's it gonna take, huh?

1324
01:18:23,872 --> 01:18:26,192
I'll show you what
it's gonna take.

1325
01:18:40,989 --> 01:18:43,756
Mark! Hey, Mark! Me!

1326
01:18:43,758 --> 01:18:45,090
Congratulations, you win.

1327
01:18:45,092 --> 01:18:49,461
You're making me do something I thought
I'd never do, raise my hand to a friend!

1328
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,897
Well, come on out! Dick!

1329
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:58,468
You know not everybody has the same
definition about what it takes to make a man,

1330
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,037
I mean, sometimes
it takes more guts to...

1331
01:19:01,706 --> 01:19:04,373
Maybe there'd be a little more
peace in the world if...

1332
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:08,042
But not tonight.

1333
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:11,478
You get your know-it-all, control freak,
make-your-friends-Mike-Tyson ass

1334
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,347
out here now!
Let's do what we gotta do!

1335
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:18,417
I am so sick and tired
of this macho bullshit!

1336
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:20,752
Come on!

1337
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:25,990
All right,
we'll do it in there.

1338
01:20:31,455 --> 01:20:35,156
He's testing every
time you give in. I know.

1339
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:38,526
Try taking away a toy, and if
he doesn't stop, it's time out.

1340
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:44,031
I know he's headstrong.
But you have to be firm.

1341
01:20:49,938 --> 01:20:51,337
Here you go, Jason.

1342
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,008
I... I forgot the NutraSweet.

1343
01:20:57,543 --> 01:21:00,410
That's over.
I don't use it anymore.

1344
01:21:01,312 --> 01:21:02,911
Where's mine?

1345
01:21:04,848 --> 01:21:06,147
You were sleeping.

1346
01:21:07,517 --> 01:21:09,383
Weren't sleepin', I'd say.

1347
01:21:12,488 --> 01:21:17,891
It's like... It's like you took
a bullet that was meant for me.

1348
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:23,062
I'm so sorry, Billy.

1349
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:26,498
How's that?

1350
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,166
Enough with the pillows.

1351
01:21:28,835 --> 01:21:29,934
Please.

1352
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:39,609
I never touched Kate.

1353
01:21:40,445 --> 01:21:42,077
I would never do that.

1354
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,413
But this is so wrong.

1355
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:48,416
I'm in a whole 'nother
universe of wrong here.

1356
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:53,053
And I gotta tell you, I gotta...
And you too, Jason...

1357
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,923
I failed you guys
so completely.

1358
01:21:59,259 --> 01:22:00,591
I failed myself.

1359
01:22:01,894 --> 01:22:04,527
I have been a total
horse's ass, and

1360
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:07,162
all you guys do is stick by me.

1361
01:22:07,397 --> 01:22:10,297
They used to think I was
so good under pressure.

1362
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:15,568
And it turns out that I'm the
one who folds it every time.

1363
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:17,903
Like a coward.

1364
01:22:20,908 --> 01:22:23,608
Never wanted anybody's help,
God forbid.

1365
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:27,244
But I was wrong.

1366
01:22:29,514 --> 01:22:31,046
I need you.

1367
01:22:32,582 --> 01:22:34,415
I need you, Jason.

1368
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:38,218
I need you to help me to stop
blaming everybody else for my...

1369
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,957
Disappointments. And all I
can tell you is thank you.

1370
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:48,993
Thank you for helping me
realize what's important.

1371
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:52,162
Being one of you guys,

1372
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:54,492
being a good husband to Sher.

1373
01:22:55,932 --> 01:22:57,464
And a good father to Hayden.

1374
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,367
I am so sorry.

1375
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:10,474
Hey.

1376
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:09,965
Sherry, it's completely over.

1377
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,302
I set up a payment schedule,
and it's done.

1378
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,970
You two are
the center of my life.

1379
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:23,142
Please give me a chance to prove
that I can change. Please.

1380
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:29,347
You think she'll listen to me?
Yes, Daddy, I think she will.

1381
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:34,484
Hey, get in here, you two.

1382
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:38,187
Let's go.

1383
01:24:53,437 --> 01:24:55,570
Hey, Billy. Scarlet.

1384
01:24:56,272 --> 01:24:57,771
New bike, huh?

1385
01:24:57,773 --> 01:25:00,039
Yeah, makin' some changes.

1386
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,341
Traded in 18 wheels for two.

1387
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:04,609
Changes... Huh.

1388
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:08,345
Got some miles on it.

1389
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:09,779
Who doesn't?

1390
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:15,183
Cold?

1391
01:25:19,556 --> 01:25:21,088
Take 'em.

1392
01:25:25,194 --> 01:25:26,560
What happened here?

1393
01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:28,228
It's a long story.

1394
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:35,401
Get on.

1395
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:37,069
I've got work.

1396
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:39,371
Uh-uh. Your shift's over.

1397
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,472
You mean it?

1398
01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:42,773
You bet I do.

1399
01:28:01,945 --> 01:28:04,245
