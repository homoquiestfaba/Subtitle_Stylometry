00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,170
12 I THINK.

352
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,170
WHAT TIME YOU GOING
INTO WORK TODAY?

353
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,670
I WAS THINKING OF CALLING
IN A PERSONAL DAY.

354
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,180
OH YEAH?

355
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,180
YOU HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON?

356
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,690
I WAS KINDA HOPING YOU'D CALL
IN A PERSONAL DAY TOO.

357
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,180
YEAH, I THINK THAT
COULD BE ARRANGED.

358
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,710
DID YOU HEAR
THAT?

359
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,710
JUST THE TREES, RIGHT?

360
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,220
MAYBE WE SHOULD START
HEADING BACK.

361
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,720
THOSE TWO HAVE NO LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER.

362
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,230
ONLY FOR THEMSELVES.

363
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,730
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

364
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,730
EXCUSE ME?

365
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,730
I SAID, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

366
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,230
IT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE.

367
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,740
WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

368
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,740
SPOILING ALL THE FUN
THAT WE COULD BE HAVING.

369
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,230
LOOK, I'M SURE
YOU'RE COOL AND ALL

370
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,740
BUT ME AND DARREN
AREN'T INTO ANYTHING WEIRD.

371
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,750
HOW DO YOU KNOW,

372
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,760
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED?

373
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,760
STOP!

374
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,760
COME HERE.

375
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,270
THERE'S NO
GETTING AWAY, BOYS.

376
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,770
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

377
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,270
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

378
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,780
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

379
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,780
WHAT THE FUCK?

380
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,800
OH!
I'M SO SORRY.

381
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,300
THAT'S OKAY, I WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION EITHER.

382
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,300
I'M DEMETRIUS.

383
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,310
I'M SORT OF NEW
IN TOWN.

384
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,310
TARA. PLEASURE TO BUMP
INTO YOU.

385
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,300
I'M SORRY.

386
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,810
ALLOW ME
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

387
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,310
I KNOW A COFFEE SHOP
AROUND THE STREET.

388
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,820
TOO FORWARD?

389
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,320
JUST A LITTLE.

390
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,810
WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY
MY INTENTION

391
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,820
TO MAKE
THIS UNCOMFORTABLE.

392
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,330
NO, IT'S OKAY.

393
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,330
I'M JUST NOT USED
TO SUCH POLITENESS.

394
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,330
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO BLAME
MY MOTHER FOR THAT.

395
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,830
SHE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO TREAT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

396
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,330
WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT.

397
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,840
AGAIN, I'VE MADE
THE SITUATION AWKWARD.

398
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,330
NO, NOT AT ALL.

399
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,340
THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE
THE COMPLIMENT.

400
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,350
THEN SHALL WE?

401
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,850
I SUPPOSE IT COULDN'T HURT,
COULD IT?

402
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,350
I PROMISE,
IT'LL BE PAINLESS.

403
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,870
SOMETHING BOTHERING
YOU, JASIN?

404
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,870
WHY'D YOU HAVE US MEET YOU
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

405
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,870
I THOUGHT THAT CALEB'S HOUSE
BECAME OUR NEW OFFICIAL HIDE.

406
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,870
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO DISCUSS WITH BOTH OF YOU.

407
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,380
I'D RATHER NOT HAVE
THE OTHERS HEAR ABOUT.

408
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,880
I WAS AWOKEN LAST NIGHT
BY A VERY STRANGE...DREAM,

409
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,380
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD.

410
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,880
IT WAS VERY POWERFUL.

411
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,390
VERY DARK.

412
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,890
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
ANOTHER VAMPIRE BROOD.

413
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,880
OTHERS LIKE US.

414
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,390
I CAN'T BE SURE.

415
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,390
BUT THERE WAS A CONNECTION
IN THE DREAM

416
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,400
AS IF SOMEONE WAS
REACHING OUT TO ME.

417
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,900
YOU SAID IT WAS DARK.

418
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,400
YOU COULDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

419
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,890
THERE WERE TWO MEN KILLED.

420
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,900
AND THERE WERE OTHERS
LURKING IN THE SHADOW,

421
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,400
AS IF TRYING TO CONCEAL
THEMSELVES FROM ME.

422
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,910
OTHER VAMPIRES, LIKE US.

423
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,420
NO, ADAM, I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE ANYTHING LIKE US.

424
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,910
I JUST HOPE
THAT I'M WRONG.

425
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,920
[DEMETRIUS]
SO, TARA, TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELF.

426
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,930
MYSELF, HMM.

427
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,940
WELL, IN A NUTSHELL,
I'M SORT OF THE TOMBOY,

428
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,440
TREE CLIMBING, CAR RACING,
GUNS AND AMMO KIND OF GIRL.

429
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,940
GUNS AND AMMO.

430
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,450
YEP.

431
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,950
I CAN ALSO THROW
A MEAN KNIFE.

432
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,950
SO I BETTER NOT
GET YOU ANGRY WITH ME.

433
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,950
GOOD THING.

434
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,460
SO THIS MORNING YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY WIELDING KNIVES.

435
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,460
NO, JUST OUT
FOR A LITTLE RETAIL THERAPY.

436
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,450
THERAPY?

437
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,460
I'M TRYING TO ERASE
AN OLD MEMORY THAT CAME BACK

438
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,970
TO HAUNT ME THIS MORNING.

439
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,480
I'M SORRY.

440
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,970
YOU HAVEN'T DRUNK
ANY OF YOUR COFFEE.

441
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,480
OH, I GUESS I'M JUST NOT--

442
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,480
NOT IN THE MOOD.

443
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,480
MAYBE, I SHOULD HAVE
ORDERED THAT LATTE.

444
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,980
MAYBE YOU JUST
CAN'T DRINK IT

445
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,490
FOR THE SAME REASON
I CAN'T DRINK MINE.

446
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,490
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN.

447
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,990
YOU HAVEN'T SENSED IT YET?

448
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,500
SENSED WHAT?

449
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
THE CONNECTION.

450
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,500
TARA, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

451
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,500
NO, DON'T GET UP.

452
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,510
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE
OF MY OWN KIND IN YEARS.

453
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,510
YOU'RE A...

454
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,020
VAMPIRE?

455
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,520
FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS.

456
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,020
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS?

457
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,020
BECAUSE, I SENSED
YOUR PRESENCE.

458
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,030
ACTUALLY, I SENSED
OTHERS AS WELL.

459
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,530
WHY WASN'T I ABLE
TO SENSE YOU?

460
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,040
HAVE YOU TAKEN
YOUR FIRST HUMAN YET?

461
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,540
NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO BRING MYSELF TO DO IT.

462
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,040
WELL, THEN YOU'RE A FLEDGLING.

463
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,040
YOU'RE MOSTLY HUMAN.

464
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,550
WHEN YOU TAKE
YOUR FIRST HUMAN LIFE,

465
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,550
YOU'LL BE A TRUE VAMPIRE.

466
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,540
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME?

467
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,050
I'M SORRY, WHO
DIDN'T TELL YOU?

468
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,060
YOU'RE RIGHT.

469
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,060
I AM PART OF A COVEN.

470
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,060
THERE ARE MORE OF US
HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

471
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,560
HOW MANY MORE?

472
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,560
BESIDES MYSELF,
THERE'S CALEB, DANE,

473
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,570
ADAM, AND OF COURSE JASIN.

474
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,570
JASIN, IS HE YOUR MAKER?

475
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,560
ARE YOU HIS CHOSEN?

476
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,070
NO, HE IS NOT MY MAKER.

477
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,080
I WAS TO BE HIS CHOSEN,
BUT HE FOUND ANOTHER.

478
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,080
I'M SORRY.

479
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,580
I'VE MOVED PASSED IT.

480
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,090
CALEB IS A GREAT GUY.

481
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,590
JASIN IS REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE FOUND HIM.

482
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,090
IS CALEB
JASIN'S CHOSEN?

483
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,090
YES.

484
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,100
WE'VE ALL BEEN TOGETHER NOW
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

485
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,100
EVER SINCE THE NIGHT
BOTH CALEB AND I WERE CHANGED.

486
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,600
WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR
TO MEET YOUR COVEN?

487
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,110
I WILL TELL HIM ABOUT YOU.

488
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,110
EXCELLENT.

489
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,110
HOW WILL I GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU?

490
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
WITHOUT TRUE VAMPIRE POWERS

491
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,620
IT WILL PROVE
RATHER DIFFICULT.

492
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,610
OR I COULD JUST GIVE YOU
A CELL PHONE NUMBER.

493
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,120
OF COURSE.

494
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,640
I LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR PHONE CALL.

495
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,650
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

496
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,150
I HAVE A RATHER BUSY MORNING.

497
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,140
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, DEMETRIUS.

498
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,650
NO, THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE.

499
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,160
MAYBE WE CAN DO
THIS AGAIN.

500
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,660
OVER COFFEE.

501
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,160
I KNOW A GREAT PLACE.

502
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,650
TRY NOT TO CRASH
INTO ANYBODY.

503
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,660
I'LL DO MY BEST.

504
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,680
CONGRATULATIONS.

505
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,180
SHE'S THE BREAK YOU'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR.

506
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,190
SHE'S A FRAGILE ONE.

507
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,680
SHE'LL BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

508
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,200
NOAH, WOULD YOU
DO THE HONOR

509
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,200
OF WAKING
OUR GUESTS?

510
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,710
GET UP.

511
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,710
OH, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

512
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,700
I DO NOT RECALL
ASKING YOU TO SPEAK.

513
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,720
LOOK, WHAT DID YOU
DO TO US?

514
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,720
DID YOU ASSUME
PERHAPS THAT

515
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,220
I WANTED
TO HEAR FROM YOU?

516
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,720
DO NOT SPEAK UNLESS
YOU ARE SPOKEN TO.

517
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,730
NOW YOU ARE HERE

518
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,730
FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE REASON ONLY.

519
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,730
I AM BUILDING AN ARMY.

520
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,740
YOU TWO ARE GOING
TO BE FIGHTING.

521
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,230
THE WINNER
BECOMES A VAMPIRE.

522
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,740
THE LOSER, WELL,

523
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,250
THE LOSER WILL DIE.

524
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,750
YOU CAN'T MAKE US
DO THIS.

00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,440
IT APPEARS MY
PREMONITION WAS CORRECT.

705
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,940
THERE'S ANOTHER VAMPIRE
AMONG US.

706
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,950
IS HE DANGEROUS?

707
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,950
I CAN'T BE SURE.

708
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,450
HE HAS SOUGHT OUT TARA.

709
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,940
TARA.

710
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,440
SHE MET HIM YESTERDAY.

711
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,450
SHE'S WITH HIM AS WE SPEAK.

712
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,960
APPARENTLY HE'S LOOKING TO MEET
OTHERS OF HIS KIND.

713
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,460
HE WANTS TO MEET WITH ME.

714
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,460
WE'LL COME WITH YOU.

715
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,950
I APPRECIATE THAT, ADAM.

716
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,460
I THINK HE WANTS
TO MEET WITH ME ALONE.

717
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,460
I'LL BE FINE.

718
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,970
IF YOU NEED US,
JUST SUMMON US.

719
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,970
WE'LL BE THERE.

720
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,970
YOU BOTH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY LOYAL TO ME.

721
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,460
THAT DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED.

722
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,470
NOW, I HAVEN'T TOLD CALEB
ABOUT THIS YET.

723
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,980
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO THIS VAMPIRE IS

724
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,480
BEFORE I INTRODUCE
HIM TO OUR COVEN.

725
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,980
YOU KNOW, WE'LL
NEVER LET ANYTHING

726
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,480
HAPPEN TO CALEB.

727
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,480
I AM CONFIDENT OF THAT.

728
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,490
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

729
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,990
DEMETRIUS, ARE YOU HERE?

730
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,500
DEMETRIUS?

731
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,000
I STARTLED YOU.

732
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,500
YES.

733
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,000
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

734
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,010
I'M ALSO VERY PLEASED
THAT JASIN HAS AGREED
TO MEET ME.

735
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,000
HE WILL MEET YOU TONIGHT
AT MIDNIGHT.

736
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,010
RIGHT NOW HE AND CALEB

737
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,010
ARE SPENDING
THE EVENING TOGETHER.

738
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,520
EXCELLENT.

739
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,020
THAT WILL GIVE US
TIME TO TALK.

740
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,520
SO, THIS CALEB.

741
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:49,030
HE IS THE CHOSEN?

742
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,530
YES.

743
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,030
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

744
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,040
YOUR ETERNAL SOULMATE

745
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,040
HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER

746
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,040
AND PASSED YOU UP.

747
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,550
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

748
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,540
I THOUGHT YOU INVITED ME
FOR A DRINK,

749
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,050
ALTHOUGH THERE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE A BAR.

750
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,560
MY APOLOGIES.

751
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,060
I KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC...

752
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,560
DOESN'T PLEASE YOU.

753
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,570
HOWEVER,

754
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,070
I KNOW YOUR PAIN
ALL TOO WELL.

755
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:36,070
IT EATS
AT YOU EVERY DAY.

756
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,080
EVERY TIME YOU SEE THEM KISS.

757
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,580
AND IT EATS YOU.

758
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,590
I THINK I'M
GOING TO GO NOW.

759
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,080
WHY?

760
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,090
WE'RE JUST HAVING
A CONVERSATION.

761
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,600
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

762
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,100
BETWEEN JASIN
AND I.

763
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,600
EVERYTHING IS AS
IT SHOULD BE.

764
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,600
TARA, I FEEL YOUR PAIN.

765
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,110
WILL YOU LET GO
OF MY ARM?

766
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,610
I'M NOT HURTING YOU,
AM I?

767
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,600
YOU'RE FRIGHTENING ME.

768
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,610
MY APOLOGIES.

769
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,120
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

770
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,620
YOU I CAN'T LET
YOU LEAVE JUST YET.

771
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,120
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THAT JASIN HAS DESTROYED

772
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,630
ONE'S DREAMS OF
HAPPINESS,

773
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,130
BUT IT WILL BE
HIS LAST.

774
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,630
I WANT TO GO NOW.

775
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,130
AND TELL JASIN?

776
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,630
WHY?

777
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,140
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

778
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,640
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO SHOW YOU MY ARENA.

779
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,640
MY COLISEUM, IF YOU WILL.
WHAT?

780
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,650
THERE'S GOING
TO BE A FIGHT,

781
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,150
AND I'VE CHOSEN YOU
TO REPRESENT OUR KIND.

782
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,640
WHAT IS THIS?

783
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,150
ME FIGHTING?

784
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,660
I'M SORRY BUT IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

785
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,660
BUT IT WILL HAPPEN.

786
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,160
WHAT? WHO THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO--

787
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,660
YOU'RE CRAZY.

788
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,660
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

789
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,170
YOU'RE GOOD
AT WIELDING KNIVES.

790
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,680
THAT WILL SERVE YOU WELL.

791
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,180
YOU WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH

792
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,680
AND THE WINNER
WILL BE MY CHOSEN.

793
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,680
I WON'T FIGHT, CALEB.

794
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,680
HE WILL
MAKE IT EASIER.

795
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,190
<i>[DEMETRIUS]
YOU ARE BECOMING ONE OF US. </i>

796
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,700
<i>YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW. </i>

797
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,710
<i>NOW YOU MUST FEED TO COMPLETE
THE TRANSFORMATION. </i>

798
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,220
[JASIN]
I WAS INTRIGUED TO HEAR OF
ANOTHER VAMPIRE IN TOWN.

799
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,220
STRANGELY I COULD NOT
DETECT YOUR PRESENCE.

800
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,730
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN LOS ANGELES?

801
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,230
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

802
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,230
SEARCHING FOR OTHERS
LIKE US.

803
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,720
ACTUALLY, WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

804
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,230
I STUMBLED UPON A COVEN.

805
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,740
A COVEN?

806
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,240
YES, BELIEVE IT
WAS YOURS.

807
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,250
[DEMETRIUS]
I WAS HUNTING DEER
WHEN I HEARD SOME VOICES

808
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,750
IN THE CLEARING.

809
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,250
[VOICE]
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

810
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,250
[VOICE 2]
ARE YOU SURE?
WITH ELO?

811
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,260
I MOVED QUIETLY TOWARDS THEM.

812
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,260
SPEAKING OF WAITING...

813
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,760
A YOUNG LADY WAS SEDUCING
TWO YOUNG MEN.

814
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,770
[JASIN]
MY MEN?

815
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,270
NO, THEY WERE HUMAN.

816
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:53,270
BUT IF I RECALL,
ONE OF THEM WAS HER BOYFRIEND.

817
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,780
THE YOUNG LADY ASKED THEM
TO REMOVE THEIR CLOTHING.

818
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,780
DID THEY AGREE?

819
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,280
WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

820
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,280
IT WAS A VERY
HOT DAY.

821
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:07,290
STILL,
SHE WANTED THEM TO KISS.

822
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,290
SOON THEY ALL WERE.

823
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,290
THEN ALMOST AS QUICKLY
AS IT BEGAN,

824
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,800
THE VAMPIRE BOYS
SHOWED UP.

825
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,300
THE VAMPIRE BOYS?

826
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,310
THAT'S WHAT I CALLED THEM.

827
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,310
OF COURSE I WAS NEW IN TOWN

828
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,310
AND I THOUGHT IT BEST
NOT TO STICK AROUND.

829
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,810
I LOST THEIR TRACKS.

830
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,310
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR THEM EVER SINCE.

831
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,320
UNTIL YOU RAN INTO TARA.

832
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,820
LITERALLY.

833
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,820
SHALL WE?

834
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,820
FUNNY, HOW YOU'VE GONE
COMPLETELY UNDETECTED

835
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,830
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

836
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,830
IT'S A BIG CITY.

837
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,320
YES.

838
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,830
WHEN WERE YOU CHANGED?

839
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,830
I WAS MADE NEARLY 100
YEARS AGO.

840
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,340
MY MAKER WAS AN ELDER VAMPIRE,

841
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,840
HE DISAPPEARED DECADES AGO.

842
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,350
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MAKER EITHER.

843
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,350
HMMM.
HE WAS KILLED A YEAR AGO.

844
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,350
I'M SORRY.

845
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,860
I KNOW THIS PLACE.

846
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,860
JUDAH AND I ARE COUSINS.

847
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,850
DON'T WORRY, HE HASN'T BEEN
KEEPING ANYTHING FROM YOU.

848
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,360
I FOUND HIM THE SAME TIME
I FOUND YOU.

849
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,370
DO YOU INTEND TO STAY
IN LOS ANGELES?

850
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,860
I THINK SO.

851
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,370
I KIND OF MADE A PLAN
FOR MYSELF HERE.

852
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,380
REALLY?

853
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,380
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

854
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,390
WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU?

855
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,380
NOAH, TYLER, KEVIN.

856
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,890
AS YOU SEE, I'M NOT ALONE.

857
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,890
KEVIN IS OUR NEWEST MEMBER.

858
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,900
HE'S ONLY BEEN A VAMPIRE

859
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,900
SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING.

860
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,390
BUT HE SHOWS
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

861
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,410
[SIGHS]

862
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,910
FOR DECADES
I WAS ALONE.

863
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,410
MY MAKER LEFT ME
FOR ANOTHER.

864
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,420
I WAS DEVASTATED.

865
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,920
I WAS TO BE HIS CHOSEN.

866
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,930
I UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU MUST HAVE FELT.

867
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,430
MY MAKER LEFT ME
AS WELL.

868
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,920
IT CAUSED YEARS
OF DEPRESSION.

869
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,430
I WANTED HIS COMPANIONSHIP.

870
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,940
AS DID I.

871
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,440
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT

872
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,440
OR WHY YOU'RE HERE.

873
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,940
WHO ARE YOUR ASSOCIATES?

874
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,950
THIS IS NOAH.

875
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,950
HE'S BEEN WITH ME
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.

876
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,450
WHEN I FOUND HIM,

877
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,960
HIS BODY WAS SO POLLUTED
WITH HUMAN DRUGS...

878
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,960
HE WAS NEARLY DEAD.

879
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,970
AND THEN TYLER.

880
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,460
WE FOUND HIM TOGETHER.

881
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,470
HE WAS AN ORPHAN
ALL HIS LIFE.

882
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,480
HE'S GOT SUCH
WONDERFUL GIFTS.

883
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,480
HE CAN SEE INTO
THE FUTURE.

884
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,980
THE NUNS
THAT HOUSED HIM

885
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,990
SAID THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE
ETERNAL LIFE. [LAUGHS]

886
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,490
NOW WE PROVED THEM WRONG,
DIDN'T WE?

887
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,500
SO YOU'RE BUILDING
A COVEN?

888
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,000
WHERE ARE YOU
FINDING YOUR RECRUITS?

889
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,500
PLEASE, ALLOW HIM
TO SHOW YOU.

890
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,020
YOU'RE KIDNAPPING HUMANS.

891
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,020
WATCH.

892
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,030
THIS IS BARBARIC.

893
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,030
AND WHAT YOU
VAMPIRE BOYS DID

894
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,030
TO THOSE THREE LOVERS
WAS HUMANE?

895
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,030
I CHOOSE
STRONG HUMANS.

896
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,540
THEY DECIDE WHO
LIVES AND WHO DIES.

897
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,540
I WANT THE STRONGEST VAMPIRES
FOR MY COVEN.

898
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,050
ENOUGH!

899
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,050
TO WHAT PURPOSE, DEMETRIUS?

900
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,560
WHY ARE YOU BUILDING
THIS COVEN?

901
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,060
OUR MEETING HERE
IS OVER.

902
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,560
I HAVE MUCH WORK
TO DO.

903
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,570
YOUR WORK HERE
IS DONE.

904
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,570
YOU AND YOUR COVEN
HAVE 24 HOURS TO LEAVE.

905
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,570
AND WHAT IF WE
DECIDE TO STAY?

906
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,580
THEN PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR BATTLE.

907
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,070
NOW IT'S TIME TO ATTACK.

908
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,080
UM, BOSS, NOT TO POINT OUT
THE OBVIOUS

909
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,590
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
TWO NEW VAMPIRES.

910
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,090
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WANTED MORE.

911
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,580
I HAVE A NEW PLAN.

912
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,090
I'M NO LONGER
GOING TO KILL JASIN.

913
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,600
I WILL BREAK HIM.

914
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,600
TYLER!

915
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,100
COME!

916
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,610
[WATER RUNNING]

917
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,110
I'M SORRY.
I MISJUDGED YOU.

918
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,620
AS ONE HYBRID
TO ANOTHER,

919
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,120
YOU HAVE MY WORD,

920
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,110
I WILL DO
WHAT YOU ASK.

921
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,120
FIRST I WANT TO SEE
YOU ONE LAST TIME.

922
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,630
MEET ME IN THE CLEARING
AT NOON TOMORROW.

923
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,630
YOU HAVE
AN IMPRESSION OF ME

924
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,630
WHICH I WOULD LIKE
TO CORRECT.

925
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,130
AFTER, ALL THINGS
WILL BE SETTLED BETWEEN US.

926
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,140
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

927
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,650
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

928
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,150
THERE'S A NEW VAMPIRE COVEN
IN OUR CITY.

929
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,640
I'VE MET THEM.

930
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,650
OTHERS LIKE US?

931
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,650
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

932
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,660
THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE US.

933
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,160
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE

934
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,160
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THIS VAMPIRE

935
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,660
COULD BE NO THREAT
TO US.

936
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,150
AND?

937
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,660
DEMETRIUS IS SOMEONE
WHO CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

938
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,170
I HAVE ASKED THAT HIM
AND HIS COVEN LEAVE.

939
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,670
THEY'VE BEEN USING HUMANS
TO BATTLE ONE ANOTHER.

940
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,670
THE WINNER IS MADE
A VAMPIRE.

941
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,670
DEMETRIUS WANTS
TO CREATE AN ARMY.

942
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,680
HE'S BUILDING AN ARMY?

943
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,180
WHY?

944
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,680
HE DIDN'T SAY.

945
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,180
BUT I'VE AGREED TO MEET
WITH HIM ONCE MORE, TOMORROW.

946
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,680
YOU AREN'T MEETING HIM
BY YOURSELF.

947
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,690
WHAT IF HE TRIES
TO DO SOMETHING?

948
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,190
NO HARM CAN COME TO ME,
DON'T WORRY.

949
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,190
YOU CAN'T
PROMISE ME THAT.

950
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,190
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ADAM
AND DANE WITH YOU?

951
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,200
OR BETTER YET,
DON'T GO.

952
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,700
ALL HE HAS TO DO
IS SUMMON US,

953
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,700
WE'LL BE THERE.

954
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,190
HELL, YEAH.

955
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,700
UNTIL THEN, I'M THINKING
ABOUT HUNTING.

956
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,710
GO.

957
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,720
YOU'RE BEING VERY QUIET
THIS EVENING.

958
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,720
I'M WORRIED.

959
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,720
WHAT IF THIS DEMETRIUS
TRIES TO--

960
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,710
HE WILL TRY NOTHING.

961
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,220
I PROMISE YOU.

962
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,220
JASIN, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO
GODDAMN HARD HEADED?

963
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,730
I THOUGHT YOU'D GOTTEN
USED TO THAT BY NOW.

964
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,220
WELL, I HAVEN'T.

965
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,740
JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

966
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,750
I AM ALWAYS CAREFUL.

967
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,740
I KNOW.

968
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,260
I LOVE YOU.

969
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:02,270
I LOVE YOU.

970
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,260
[BIRD SHRIEKS]

971
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:13,770
I'M GLAD YOU AGREED
TO MEET ME ONE LAST TIME.

972
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,780
I'D NEVER TURN MY BACK
ON ONE OF MY OWN KIND.

973
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,780
EVEN IF I DON'T APPROVE
OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING.

974
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,270
FAIR ENOUGH.

975
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,780
YOU I HAVE MISJUDGED.

976
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,780
YOU ARE TRULY
A VAMPIRE'S VAMPIRE.

977
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,290
I ALREADY HAVE A LOVER,
DEMETRIUS.

978
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,280
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET JERKED OFF.

979
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,290
TELL ME WHY YOU WANTED
TO MEET WITH ME.

980
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,290
I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT JUST THAT.

981
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,300
YOUR LOVER CALEB.

982
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,790
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE WAS THE ONE?

983
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,800
I DON'T RECALL
MENTIONING THAT NAME TO YOU.

984
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,810
TARA?

985
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,820
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS HIM,

986
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,820
AND NOT HER?

987
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,320
IT WAS SOMETHING I KNEW
TO BE TRUE.

988
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,820
I HAD A CONNECTION
WITH HIM

989
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,820
THAT I DID NOT HAVE
WITH TARA.

990
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,320
I TOO HAD A CONNECTION
WITH MY MAKER.

991
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,330
I WAS TO BE THE ONE.

992
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,830
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

993
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,830
HE WAS AN ELDER
VAMPIRE, OBVIOUSLY,

994
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,340
CHANGED ME

995
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,340
AND CONVINCED ME
THAT I WAS THE ONE.

996
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,840
SO HE PASSED YOU BY
FOR ANOTHER?

997
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,350
YES.

998
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,850
DON'T GO.

999
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,850
PLEASE STAY.

1000
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,860
DON'T GO!

1001
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,860
MY LIFE, MY WORLD,

1002
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,860
EVERYTHING CAME
CRASHING DOWN.

1003
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:43,870
DON'T GO.

1004
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,370
I EVEN CONTEMPLATED
ENDING MYSELF.

1005
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,370
THE REJECTION
WAS TOO PAINFUL.

1006
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,890
I COULDN'T BRING
MYSELF TO DO IT.

1007
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,380
I WASN'T EVEN SURE
IF I WOULD DIE.

1008
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,900
I KNEW SO LITTLE

1009
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,400
OF WHAT I'D JUST BECOME.

1010
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,400
SOMETIME LATER
I SAW HIM AGAIN,

1011
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,400
WITH HIS NEW LOVER.

1012
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,930
IT WAS YOU, JASIN.

1013
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,930
[JASIN]
NARAN WAS YOUR MAKER

1014
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,440
AND YOU KILLED HIM.

1015
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,440
NOW YOU'VE COME TO SEEK
YOUR REVENGE AGAINST ME?

1016
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,940
I WANNA HURT YOU
LIKE YOU HURT ME.

1017
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,940
I DIDN'T KNOW OF YOUR
EXISTENCE, DEMETRIUS.

1018
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,950
NARAN ALSO LEFT ME.

1019
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,450
IF YOU'VE COME FOR REVENGE,

1020
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,950
WHY DO YOU NEED AN ARMY?

1021
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,450
TAKE IT NOW.

1022
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,960
NOT NOW.

1023
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,950
NOT THAT EASY.

1024
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,480
SHE'S RETURNING.

1025
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,480
I'M SURE SHE'S FED.

1026
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,480
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT.

1027
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,520
DID YOU DO IT?

1028
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,020
GOOD.

1029
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,020
WHAT'S WRONG?

1030
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,020
SHE WAS PICKING UP HER SON.

1031
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,030
HE'S AUTISTIC.

1032
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,030
SO THE KID CAN PAINT.

1033
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,040
BIG DEAL.

1034
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,040
[CALEB]
SO YOU'RE BOTH
FROM THE SAME MAKER?

1035
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,050
APPARENTLY SO.

1036
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,550
AND HE LEFT
DEMETRIUS FOR YOU.

1037
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,050
IT'S BEEN EATING HIM
UP ALL THESE YEARS.

1038
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,550
WE SHOULD ALL
BE ON ALERT.

1039
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,540
TRUE THAT, BROTHER.

1040
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,550
I IMPLORE EACH OF YOU TO BE
MINDFUL YOUR SURROUNDINGS

1041
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,060
AND KEEP YOUR SENSES SHARP.

1042
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,560
EVEN A BIG GUY LIKE YOU.

1043
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,560
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

1044
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,050
I'D LIKE YOU TO STAY
IN THE HOUSE.

1045
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,060
YOU THINK HE'LL COME
AFTER ME.

1046
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,570
I JUST WANT TO BE
EXTRA CAUTIOUS.

1047
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,070
BESIDES, I NEED SOMEONE

1048
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,070
TO STAY AND LOOK
AFTER TARA.

1049
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,560
TARA, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1050
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,060
[DANE]
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1051
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,070
SHE'S FINE.

1052
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,080
SHE JUST NEEDED A REST.

1053
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,580
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

1054
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,080
I'M GOING OUT TO LOOK
FOR JUDAH,

1055
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,080
FIND OUT
WHAT HE KNOWS.

1056
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,080
WELL, WE'RE
COMING WITH YOU.

1057
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,090
I LOVE YOU
BOTH DEARLY.

1058
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,590
WE'LL BE BACK SOON.

1059
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,620
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
COME TO US JUDAH,

1060
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,630
BUT I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR.

1061
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,630
IF YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE

1062
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,130
THAT MIGHT BE A HELP
TO US,

1063
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,620
YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME.

1064
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,620
UNTIL THEN
THIS FIGHT CLUB

1065
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,130
IS OFF LIMITS
TO EVERYONE,

1066
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,140
INCLUDING YOU.

1067
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,640
I UNDERSTAND.

1068
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,140
JASIN, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING.

1069
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,130
YES?

1070
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,630
THEY'VE TURNED TARA
AGAINST YOU.

1071
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,640
SHE'S WITH
DEMETRIUS NOW.

1072
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,150
CALEB.

1073
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,160
HOW'D IT GO?

1074
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,160
TARA, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
PRIVATELY PLEASE?

1075
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,150
SURE.

1076
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,160
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1077
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,670
ADAM WILL EXPLAIN.

1078
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,670
ADAM?

1079
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,670
JASIN WANTS YOU TO GO
INTO HIDING.

1080
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,670
SO GRAB YOUR STUFF,
LET'S GO.

1081
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,180
[TARA]
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, JASIN?

1082
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,180
I JUST SPOKE WITH JUDAH.

1083
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,180
REALLY?
HOW IS HE?

1084
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,670
NOT GOOD.
NEITHER WAS I

1085
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,180
AFTER HE GAVE ME
SOME INFORMATION.

1086
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,680
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION?

1087
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,690
HE TOLD ME YOU'RE
WITH DEMETRIUS NOW.

1088
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,690
REALLY?

1089
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,190
NOW, WOULDN'T THAT
BE A SCANDAL?

1090
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,190
IS IT TRUE?

1091
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,680
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1092
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,190
I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON

1093
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,200
AND STOP
PLAYING GAMES.

1094
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,700
COVEN AND I LOVE
PLAYING GAMES.

1095
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,690
WE'RE ASSEMBLING ONE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

1096
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,700
ADAM! DANE!

1097
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,200
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

1098
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:25,710
NEITHER IS CALEB.

1099
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,710
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM?

1100
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,210
WHERE DID YOU TAKE THEM?

1101
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,710
COME WITH ME
AND YOU'LL SEE.

1102
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,720
CALEB!

1103
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,220
RELEASE HIM,
DEMETRIUS.

1104
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,220
IN GOOD TIME.

1105
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,220
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

1106
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,730
I SAID WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

1107
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,230
THEY WERE ON TO US.

1108
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,730
WE WERE BARELY ABLE
TO GET THIS ONE.

1109
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:52,230
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
TIPPED THEM OFF.

1110
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,730
JUDAH.

1111
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,240
FIND THEM!

1112
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,740
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

1113
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,240
GET THEM!

1114
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,740
STAY IN THIS SPOT
OR CALEB DIES!

1115
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,250
[DANE]
STAY WHERE YOU ARE, JASIN!

1116
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,750
YOU'RE A TRAITOR,
OLD MAN.

1117
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,750
KEVIN, THIS IS
NOT YOUR FIGHT.

1118
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,250
LEAVE NOW AND YOU
CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE IN PEACE.

1119
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,260
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WILL END, DEMETRIUS?

1120
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,250
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR THIRST FOR REVENGE

1121
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,260
WILL BE SATISFIED?

1122
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,760
I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE,

1123
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,270
AND TONIGHT, I WILL
LEAVE HERE WITH MY CHOSEN.

1124
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:30,760
WE'RE STRONG.

1125
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,270
THEY'RE STRONGER.

1126
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,270
I'M TIRED OF THIS,
OLD MAN.

1127
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,780
LET'S DANCE.

1128
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,290
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU FORGOT HOW TO FIGHT?

1129
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,780
THE MAIN EVENT
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

1130
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,790
YOU KNOW MY MONEY
IS ON TARA.

1131
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,830
I'M NOT GONNA FALL
FOR THAT TRICK, OLD MAN.

1132
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,330
I'M SORRY, JUDAH.

1133
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,820
YOU THINK YOU'VE WON?

1134
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,330
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

1135
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,840
NOW!

1136
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,350
DANE, STAY BACK!

1137
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,340
WHY, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?

1138
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,340
[DEMETRIUS]
FIGHT HER.

1139
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,850
I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT TARA.

1140
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,350
THEN HE DIES.

1141
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,360
CALEB, LEAVE
THIS PLACE NOW.

1142
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,360
AND HAVE YOU KILLED?

1143
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,870
CALEB, GRAB THE BLADE.

1144
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,360
CALEB, YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

1145
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,370
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

1146
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,880
I'M SORRY, JASIN.

1147
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,380
I LOVE YOU.

1148
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,880
CALEB, NO.

1149
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,900
NO!

1150
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,910
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1151
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,920
WHY ARE YOU SO LOVED,

1152
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,420
AND I SO HATED?

1153
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,920
YOU AND I SUFFERED
THE SAME PAIN, DEMETRIUS,

1154
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,420
AND WE FOLLOW
DIFFERENT PATHS

1155
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:05,930
TO DEAL WITH IT.

1156
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:10,430
I CHOSE FORGIVENESS.

1157
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,930
I FORGIVE YOU, DEMETRIUS.

1158
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,450
BE CAREFUL, MY FRIEND.

1159
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:31,440
I ALWAYS AM.

1160
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,950
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE BOYS HERE.

1161
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,950
I'LL KEEP A GOOD EYE
ON THEM.

1162
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,460
I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

1163
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,960
WELCOME TO OUR
COVEN, JUDAH.

1164
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,450
HEY, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

1165
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,460
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

1166
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:44,470
THANK YOU, ADAM.

1167
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,470
YOU AND DANE
MEAN MORE TO ME

1168
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,470
THAN I CAN EXPRESS.

1169
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,970
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

1170
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,470
BE WELL, ALL OF YOU.

1171
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,970
LET'S GO.

1172
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,980
COME BACK TO US SOON.

1173
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,480
YEAH, DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO!

1174
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:05,490
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

1175
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,990
SOMETIMES I JUST THINK
YOU'RE HALF HORSE.

1176
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,490
YEAH, THE LOWER HALF.

1177
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,980
LET'S GO GET SOME FIREWOOD.

1178
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,000
[TARA]
DO YOU THINK DEMETRIUS

1179
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,500
WILL EVER FIND PEACE
WITH HIMSELF?

1180
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,000
I HOPE SO, TARA.

1181
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,500
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE
EVER DECIDES TO COME BACK?

1182
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,510
THAT WILL DEPEND
ON HIS MOTIVES.

1183
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,010
I HOPE WE CAN WELCOME HIM
AS A FRIEND.

1184
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,510
SOMEHOW I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT THAT.

1185
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,500
YOU NEVER KNOW.

1186
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,510
LOVE CONQUERS ALL THINGS.

1187
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,020
LET US TOO SURRENDER
TO LOVE.

1188
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,020
DID YOU WRITE THAT?

1189
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,520
THE POET VIRGIL
IN 42 BC.

1190
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,520
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

1191
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,020
VERY FUNNY.

1192
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,530
"LET US TOO SURRENDER
TO LOVE."

1193
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,530
I LIKE THAT.

1194
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:00,540
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1195
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,030
TO SURRENDER.

1196
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,050
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

1197
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,130
DID I STARTLE YOU?

1198
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,140
YES.

1199
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,150
DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME.

1200
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,670
DON'T EVER GIVE ME
A REASON TO BE.
