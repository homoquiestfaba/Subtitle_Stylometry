18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,710
My guest is psychologist and author,
Dr. Richard Clayton.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,638
He has written a new book titled

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,833
<i>Ready, Set, Let Go:
A Guide To Anger Management.</i>

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,510
Doctor, you first applied the methods
in your book

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,676
to patients in your own private care?

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,714
Yes. I was trying to solve
some of my own issues.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,115
And I discovered something
that worked so well

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,993
I thought I'd use it to help other people.

- Wait. Don't cut him off.</i>

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,196
Caller, what is it exactly about the show
that makes you so angry?

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,550
<i>- That it sucks.
- Good.</i>

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,150
Now, do you onestly think that
slashing Mr. Hyman's tires

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,955
<i>- is gonna make you feel any better?
- Yeah... yeah, I think it will.</i>

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,435
Many things that we do
when we are angry

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,315
don't make us feel better.
They often make us feel worse.

You're white and a son

Some people are born into disadvantage
because of their background or skin color.

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,272
How a son of mine turned into
such a bleeding heart, I don't know.

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,596
Maybe he gets it from his father.

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,268
If that were so,
then I'd have no compassion.

- Not necessarily.
- Mitch, I think you've had one too many.

99

- Mitchell.

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,714

Bear? What bear?
What is he talking about?

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,390
Maybe it's best if I show you.

Where's he going?

106

- Maybe we should just tell him.
- Tell me what?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,790
We didn't want to tell you like this.
I suppose there's no easy way.

- I'm not your biological mother either.

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,229
- Is this a joke?
- It's not a joke, Richard.

115
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,035
I'm afraid you were adopted, son.

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,075
Adopted? But...

117
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,157
- No, that's impossible.
- Not necessarily.

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,229
I was in the attic digging through
our old stuff and I found this.

You're telling me I'm adopted?

124
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,677
- Lower your voice.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,394
It's in the past.
What difference does it make?

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,151
I'm 34! Did it cross your mind
that I would want to know this earlier?

127
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,955
What for? So you could be traumatized?

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,029
They'll come next week.
We'll have a party.

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,117
He found 'em. I don't know how.

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,108
I have to run. I have an appointment
but I'll call you later.

169
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,149
<i>(He hums)</i>

170
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,950
- (Ellen) Any sign of them yet?
- No. Not yet.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,872
I don't know what's keeping them.

172
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,389
<i>(Doorbell)</i>

173
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,157
You must be the Menurees.

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,838
I had no idea I was biracial.
I've always identified

175
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,999
with the struggle of the black man.
Now I know why.

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,998
Dad, Mom, tell me everything
about yourself.

177
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,876
I graduated Berkeley in the summer of love,
where I met your mom.

178
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,551
I was a slogan writer for many
protest movements of the 60s and 70s.

179
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,638
Remember "Save The Whales",
"No Nukes", "Peace"?

180
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,513
- Sure.
- Those were mine.

181
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,312
Wow.

182
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,230
I'm the founder of the Organization for
Rethinking Ethnocentric Opinion. OREO.

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,274
Oh. Such good work.
You two are amazing.

184
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,233
And you're the son
we've always wanted.

185
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,273
I try, Mom. I really do.

186
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,436
But tell me something.

187
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,108
Why did you give me up?

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,039
Well, it was all part
of a sociological experiment.

189
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,438
We wanted to see if the child of
liberal humanitarians like ourselves,

190
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,838
could flourish in a family of narrow-minded
hypocritical individuals

191
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,837
- like the Claytons.
- I always knew it.

192
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,828
And I must say that
you have passed with flying colors.

193
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,952
Congratulations, son.

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,913
(Both) We love you.

195
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,192
(Mr. Menuree) Oh, gosh. Oh.

196
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,791
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,230
Do I look OK?
I wanna make a good impression.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,908
Bunny, you look beautiful.

199
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,237
They're gonna love you.
I don't know how they could not love you.

200
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,876
I should be worried.
What if I'm a disappointment to them?

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,755
You have nothing to worry about
because you are a great man.

202
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,350
You're gonna be the best wife ever.

203
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,391
<i>(Doorbell)</i>

204
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,273
Oh, my God. That's them.
Um, where's my jacket?

205
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,755
- You're wearing it.
- Right. OK.

206
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,679
- Do I look OK?
- You look fine. Relax.

207
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,758
I can't believe I'm meeting them.
Do I call 'em Mom and Dad?

208
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,035
- No, just Mr. And Mrs. Menuree.
- Right, of course. Here we go.

209
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,318
Frank Menure. You must be our son.
How the hell are ya?

210
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,557
How the hell are ya?
This is quite a moment for us.

211
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,834
What was that name again?

212
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,315
- Frank.
- No, the part after that.

213
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,795
Menure. It's French.

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,835
You must have the wrong house.
We're expecting the Menurees.

215
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,077
- Richard.
- Yeah?

216
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,432
- And you must be Frank Junior.
- Frank Junior?

217
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,349
I'd recognize him anywhere.
He takes after my family.

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,755
You call them circus freaks a family?

219
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,916
Better than that white trash
you come from.

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,236
- Shut the hell up.
- You shut up!

221
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,396
I can't believe it's really you.

222
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,434
We sure got ourselves a family here.

223
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,349
<i>How old are you son, anyway? 34?
(He laughs)</i>

224
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,233
It was about then when
I started losing my hair.

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,830
- But don't worry, it's a sign of virility.
- (Agnes) Mm-hm.

226
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,477
When it comes time to shop for a rug,
I know a good place.

227
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,798
You just tell him you're my boy,
he'll cut you a deal.

228
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,236
Well, why don't we all step inside?

229
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,159
Nothing would please us more.

230
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,271
Can I help you with your, er?

231
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,391
This here's a cheese ball.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,034
I made it myself for the occasion.
I hope you like it.

233
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,470
A cheese ball. Very nice.

234
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,515
Back home, I'm famous for
my cheese balls. I can give you the recipe.

235
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,157
Nobody gives a damn what you put in that
rat ball, except maybe the Board of Health.

236
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,319
- The Board of Health might care.
- Why don't you shut the hell up?

237
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,512
<i>- (She whispers) He's an alcoholic.
- I heard that.</i>

238
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,555
We appreciate the gesture, anyway.
Thank you. Don't we, Richard?

239
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,113
Richard?

240
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,110
<i>(Whistles appreciatively) You certainly
have a beautiful place here, son.</i>

241
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,073
<i>It's got a certain je ne sais quoi.</i>

242
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,032
Yes, siree, Bob.

243
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,073
You must be really
raking in the dough, son.

244
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,400
- What's your racket?
- I'm a psychologist and a writer.

245
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,072
Well, how about that? I knew these genes
was good for somethin'.

246
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,793
What do you write, son?

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,956
I... I write books about psychology.

248
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,110
You ever write a book about dogs?
I sure do like a book about a dog.

249
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,472
- No, I can't say that I have.
- Huh. If you do, let me know. I'll buy it.

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,279
I can't tell you how much
we've looked forward to this.

251
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,836
He has a lot of questions for you,
don't you, Richard?

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,635
- (Richard) I don't know where to begin...
- You wore that damn hairnet?

253
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,469
I told you not to wear that
damn hairnet when we meet our boy.

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,717
Do you know how ugly you look
with that damn thing?

255
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,638
Any idea at all?

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,516
I told you, I have to wear it to keep
my hairs out of the cheese ball.

257
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,711
(Frank) Well, I'm gonna
count to three.

258
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,472
When I get to three, you better
have that damn thing off your head.

259
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,232
One...

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,509
Uh...

261
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,439
...two...
- I ain't taking it off.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,149
...three!

263
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,557
<i>- That's it. I'm a-comin' for it.
- (She screams)</i>

264
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,757
All right.
Let's calm down. I'm sure we can...

265
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,270
<i>(He groans)</i>

266
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,117
- (Ellen) Oh, honey.
- Ooh!

267
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,355
Oh, Richard. Oh, honey!

268
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,279
Are you happy now?

269
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,632
We just met our son and you beat him
in the nuts with that damn rat ball.

270
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,478
You gonna be all right?

271
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,150
Of course. He's tough like his old man.

272
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,909
If I had a nickel for every time
I was laid low by one of them damn things,

273
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,997
- I'd be a wealthy man
- Anything I can do?

274
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,270
Ain't you done enough?

275
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,875
You're probably wondering
why we gave you up, son.

276
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,436
It's the same old story.
You probably heard it a thousand times.

277
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,359
Boy meets girl, they fall in love.

278
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,835
Girl gets pregnant.

279
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,999
Boy gets arrested for impersonating
a meat inspector.

280
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,869
What was that last part?

281
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,755
It's a long story. We just thought
you'd have a better chance in life

282
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,474
with a family that could provide for you.

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,356
I hate to say this but I think the meat
in this sauce has gone off.

284
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,152
It don't taste right.

285
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,318
Oh, well, actually, it's not meat.
It's seitan parmesan.

286
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,518
- Satan's what?
- No.

287
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,438
Seitan. Richard and I are vegans.

288
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,835
We don't consume animal products.

289
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,918
Seitan's a form of wheat gluten.
It's kind of hard to explain.

290
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,951
It's very healthy.

291
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,957
If you don't like it we can order out.

292
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,116
We like it fine. Don't we?

293
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,108
Sure. This is probably the best damn
gluten I've ever tasted.

294
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,912
Mm-hm.

295
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,590
What do you do there, for a living?
You?

296
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,031
You can call me Dad, son.

297
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,712
I worked at the rodeo for a spell,
till I got tired of all the bull.

298
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,114
Get it?

299
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,630
- Bull? Rodeo?
- That one's so old it's got a beard.

300
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,989
So do you.

301
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,320
Then I took a job at the Peekaboo Carnival
where I met your mother.

302
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,559
Lately I've been selling
a household pest product door-to-door.

303
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,035
It's called Scoot. Good stuff, that.

304
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,437
I've got a case of it in the car,
if you're interested.

305
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,471
That's very thoughtful.

306
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,114
So, y'all planning on
making us grandparents?

307
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,710
We have been discussing that option.

308
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,710
Gonna take more than discussing.
That ain't gonna get ya knocked up.

309
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,912
Don't embarrass me in front of my boy.

310
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,678
In all seriousness, though,

311
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,553
there are things you should know
about our medical history

312
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,354
if you're fixing to, y'know, propagate.

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,676
- What do you mean?
- There are some things

314
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,110
that could get passed on to your young.

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,074
I myself suffer from a bacterial condition

316
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,953
- called blackfoot.
- Blackfoot?

317
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,628
- Ever hear of athlete's foot?
- Uh-huh.

318
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
It's that times ten.

319
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,637
It's both chronic and incurable.

320
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,037
Aside from that, there's the shrinking.

321
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,110
- Shrinking?
- Yes, ma'am.

322
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,392
The Menure men tend to shrink after 40.

323
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,398
On my side, you got
your mental afflictions such as

324
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,955
Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia

325
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,594
and a rare condition, Cokie's disorder.

326
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,998
It's generally characterized by
dementia, the murder impulse

327
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,636
- and an irrational fear of natural fibers.
- (Richard) Mm-hm.

328
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,469
If Tourette's ain't kicked in yet,
you're probably in the clear.

329
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,309
But I'd still keep an eye out for Cokie.

330
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,957
(Frank) It's our greatest shame
that we weren't there to raise ya.

331
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,835
But we intend to spend
the rest of our lives

332
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,076
making it up to ya.

333
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,429
You really don't have to.

334
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,394
Oh, no. We insist.

- Doc, you wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

338
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,115
I'm fine. Fine.

339
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,190
Let's just go to sleep.

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,151
Look at it this way. Two days and you
never have to see them again.

341
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,033
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,310

Who's yer daddy? Who's yer daddy?

349
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,679
I sail on the Sea of Serenity.

Yeah. Great.

354
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,513
See ya at breakfast.

355
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,548
(Frank) Did you see my tube of?
Oh, there it is.

What're you doing over there?

357
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,429
I'm a Menure.

358
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,269
- No, you're not, honey.
- Yes, I am. I am a Menure.

359
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,679
You're a talented, intelligent man.
It doesn't matter where you came from.

360
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,394
I'm sure they have
many wonderful qualities

361
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,830
that have just yet to reveal themselves.

362
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,033
What about this party? I told everybody
that we had a big surprise.

363
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,277
I can't introduce these people
to everyone we know.

364
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,159
Good God, Mitch'll have a field day.

Those two are humping.

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,838
Look at that.

369
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,429
Look at 'em go.
Hey, that reminds me.

370
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,551
Where's that pretty gal of yours?

371
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,355
Oh, Ellen. She's running an errand.
She should be back in a minute.

Ooh, he's going at it.

374
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,353
Hi. Can I have, er... two tickets to the
Midsummer Night's Smackdown

375
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,232
at the Rosemont Horizon tonight?

377
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,399
Hey, Junior, what are we listening to?

378
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,037
Oh, it's Sea of Serenity.
A meditation tape. It helps him relax.

379
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,838
- So, we have a little surprise for you two.
- For us?

380
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,237
We didn't know if you'd be interested
but there's a wrestling event.

381
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,228
- It's the, er...
- (Both) Midsummer Night's Smackdown.

382
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,637
And, er... we went ahead and got tickets.

383
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,991
- (Both) Whoa.
- How'd you know we was wrestling fans?

384
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,270
Well, who isn't?

385
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,554
- (Frank) Maybe it runs in the family.
- Showtime's at eight. We'll get ya a map...

386
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,150
- You're gonna be coming with us, ain't ya?
- We'd love to...

387
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,315
We're not able to.

388
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,149
- There's this, er... It's like a meeting thing.
- Yeah.

389
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,636
- You wouldn't wanna be there.
- Lots of small talk and schmoozing.

390
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,071
I don't mind schmoozing.
I grew up on a farm.

391
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,158
It's just we, er... only have the weekend

392
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,512
and we was hoping to maximize
our quality time together.

393
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,633
Yeah, but this is just a couple hours,
I think. Right?

You OK, Mom? You look bored.

396
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,069
This is like a funeral home.
You said it would be casual.

397
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,989
Believe me, for these people it is casual.

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,237
We should try that move.

Hey.

402
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,155
- Hey.
- What?

403
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,069
- I'm worried. It's getting late.
- Relax. It's a long programme.

404
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,955
We should speed things along.
Don't these people have homes?

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,788
Do you know what your mother plans
to wear for the wedding?

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,230
Um, no, I don't. Why do you ask?

<i>(She laughs) There surely must be
something in her closet without sequins.</i>

If you feel strongly about it,
why don't you ask her yourself?

409
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,592
There's no need to be defensive, dear.
I was making a suggestion.

410
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,234
Excuse me.

what was this big surprise
that you promised us?

413
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,553
Big surprise?

414
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,797
You said you had a big surprise.

Uh...

416
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,875

Not now. She's not pregnant
but she will be some day.

420
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,353
Maybe tonight, who knows.

421
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,720
- So, who's up for charades?
- (Richard) Cha? Dad, it's kind of late.

I was just being friendly.

428

You've been pushing my buttons all day.

429
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,039
- Well, where's the off button?
- There ain't no off button. I keep going.

430
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,630
Whoa! I don't know what you're selling,
but there's no peddling here.

431
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,879
We're not selling anything.
We've just come here to visit our son.

432

Your son? Richard Clayton lives here.

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,390
Yes. Of course.

- What was that name, again?
- Frank.

441
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,116
- No, no. The last name.
- Menure. It's French.

Richard, I knew you were number two
but I never realized you were... number two.

Swish. Two points! Right, come on.

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,916
Richard, who are those people?

452
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,035
Just a couple of former patients of mine,
schizophrenic, delusional. I'll take care of it.

453
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,956
Your mother and her big mouth
got us thrown out for making a ruckus.

She started mouthing off.
I was just being friendly.

455
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,436
Don't give me that. You were flirting.

456

- I refuse to be a party to your delusion.
- Hah!

457
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,792
Can't even trust you around a plant.

It's a pleasure to meet all you fine
friends of our beloved son, Frank Junior.

That's Richard.
Frank Menure Junior to all of us.

Y'know, Frank Junior told us
you all was a bunch of stiffs.

You all seem like friendly folks to me.

466

(Frank) And any friend
of Frank Junior is a friend of ours.

467
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,395
By the way, if you got any problems
with critters, just let me know.

468
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,716
I sell a fine product called Scoot.

469
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,356
It gets rid of ticks, fleas,
cockroaches, what have you.

470
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,630
Just give me a buzz some time.

471
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,718
<i>Get it? Give me a buzz.

472
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,717
(Mitchell) How very thoughtful of you.

473
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,038
Would you like to meet the nice couple
who raised Frank Junior?

474
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,037
Nothing would please us more.

Excellent. Mom, Dad,
this is Frank and Agnes.

Oh.

478
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,194
Well, I wanna thank you on behalf
of myself and my wife and I,

479
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,551
for doing such a great job
with Frank Junior.

480
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,389
- We just love him to death.
- He is a fine Christian man.

481
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,479
Yes, sir. I myself am from
the Church of C and E.

482
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,309
Go on, ask me what that stands for.
C and E.

483
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,317
- Uh...
- I don't...

484
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,317
What does it stand for?

485
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,590
Christmas and Easter.

486
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,758
Get it? The Church of C and E
is Christmas and Easter.

487
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,915
Oh!

488
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,953
- That's an old joke.
- So's your face.

489
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,390
Hey, Clayton, how about a swap?

490
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,913
She may have a few miles on her,
but she gets you where you wanna go.

491
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,396
Does Arleen get you
where you wanna go? I'll bet she does.

492
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,230
- Oh!
- Looks like she's got great suspension.

493
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,195
Guys, this is Angela Minnola,
Ellen's mother.

494
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,394
- Angela, the Menures.
- Oh, what a pleasure. I love your dress.

495
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,672
- (Angela) Well, thank you.
- When is that wedding, anyway?

496
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,996
We should probably
get back to the game, right?

497
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,589
- Who's... who's up?
- Were you playing a game?

498
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,712
We were playing charades.
You must join us.

499
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,114
Hell, yeah.

500
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,348
Alrighty, then. Prepare, people.
I'm an expert at this game.

501
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,794
<i>- (All) It's a movie.
- Mother, Jugs and Speed.</i>

502
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,274
<i>Is it Mother, Jugs and Speed?</i>

503
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,634
- Would you let him get started?
- Will you shut the hell up?

504
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,028
<i>- (All) Four words.
- One. Rocky I.</i>

505
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,835
<i>- How the West Was Won.
- First word.</i>

506
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,155
That would be "the".

507
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,751
- First word! Is that the first word?
- That's the first word. Is "the".

508
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,949
(All) Second word.
(Woman) He's hearing something...

509
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,628
<i>From Hear to Eternity.</i>

510
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,559
- Listening?
- Listening! Is it listening?

511
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,958
<i>- Is it sound?
- Sound! Is it Mother, Jugs and Speed?</i>

512
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,869
<i>No, no, no, no, American Gigolo.
We saw that one at the drive-in.</i>

513
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,108
<i>Woowee, that Richard Gere.
He is hot to trot. (She pants)</i>

514
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,872
- We are trying to play an intelligent game.
- Maybe you should leave the room.

515
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,918
Oh, a little word.

516
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,758
"Of".

517
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,556
<i>- Oh, that was very nice.
- (Mr. Clayton clears throat)</i>

518
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,637
<i>- (Man) Fourth...
- Is it Yentl?</i>

519
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,868
I think it's the fourth word, Frank.

520
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,150
OK. Fourth word.

521
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,355
What the hell's he doing now?
What is that?

522
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,516
<i>Seven Year Itch!</i>

523
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,120
(Frank) What is that?

524
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,597
(Woman) Giving a speech? Singing?

525
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,759
- He's holding his hands out. Chest!
- Chest!

526
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,313
<i>Jugs! Mother, Jugs and Speed.</i>

527
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,036
<i>It is not Mother, Jugs and Speed!
God!</i>

528
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,639
Clayton, excuse me.

529
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,389
How do you expect us to get
the answer with the quality of your clues?

530
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,878
I don't wanna be the one to say this, but
I don't think you're cut out for this game.

531
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,835
Don't be so hard on the man. Some
people don't have the aptitude for this.

532
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,433
This is ridiculous. You, sir, are an ass.

533
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,189
Richard, I hope
you will enjoy your real parents.

534
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,951
My dear.

535
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,558
Real nice party, Richard.

536
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,033
- Whose turn is it?
- You're dumb as a shovel, ain't ya?

537
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,471
- Things are rarely as bad as they seem...
- (Frank) Who won?

538
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,399
- (Agnes) Not you!
...which makes tonight so unique.

539
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,999
- (Frank) Who's up?
- Goodnight.

540
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,394
Goodnight, Jeffrey.

541
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,478
(Frank) You gonna go?
Bring the hat over here.

542
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,148
<i>I'll do one. Leaving Las Vegas!</i>

543
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,230
Well, guys, I guess this is it.

544
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,433
<i>(Tearfully) We really hate to leave.
I guess we'll see ya at the wedding.</i>

545
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,113
You never told us the date.

546
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,232
Oh, didn't I?
Well, it's all gonna be in the invitation.

547
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
- Oh. OK.
- Oh, good.

548
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,715
- I can't tell ya how proud we are of you.
- OK.

549
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,392
We are so proud of you.
You are a fine, fine man.

550
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,717
<i>- And Ellen, we never had a daughter.
- (She sobs)</i>

551
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,798
But we feel like we got one now.

552
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,073
- Thank you. That's very sweet.
- Traffic backs up right about now.

553
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,193
I can honestly say, that this has been

554
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,676
the best two days of our lives.

555
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,348
We only spent a weekend together

556
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,676
but we've loved a lifetime.

557
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,790
(Richard) Yeah, it feels that way.

558
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,831
<i>(TV) Tornado warning still in place...</i>

559
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,031
You all can come and visit us.

560
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,835
It's only a trailer
but we'll sleep on the sofa.

561
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,431
- I don't think that's gonna be necessary.
- It's true. Remember that.

562
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,789
- Goodbye, you all.
- Bye.

563
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,797
OK, bye-bye.

564
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,116
<i>(TV)... tornado touched down
outside Pekin...</i>

565
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,675
<i>- Drive safe.
- (TV)... worst to hit in many years.</i>

566
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,190
- Did he say Pekin?
- No. Drive carefully.

567
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,590
<i>(TV) A tornado touched down
near Pekin...</i>

568
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,679
<i>- He did say Pekin.
...worst one to hit this area in years.</i>

569
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,079
<i>- We are still waiting for information...
- That's our park! That's where we lived!</i>

570
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,872
- There's our sofa.
- Where?

571
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,479
Up in that tree.

572
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,037
(Agnes) Everything we own is in that trailer.
Everything in the world.

573
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,037
Gone with the wind.

574
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,630
The Dan Ryan really does start to lock up
at about 5.30, so I...

575
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,153
- Richard.
- We have no home to go to, son. That's it.

576
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,272
Oh, God. This is awful.
I hope you're insured.

577
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,995
- No, I'm afraid not.
- We ain't even got a bank account.

578
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,830
I don't believe in insurance.
I kept our money in the home.

579
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,600
Not to mention 50 cases of Scoot!

580
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,759
<i>- Lord, why should this tragedy befall us?
- (Mrs. Menure wails)</i>

581
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,359
What's gonna become of us?

582
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,028
Is there anyone you can stay with?

583
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,912
I'm afraid it's the streets for us.

584
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,955
We've been in tougher scrapes
than this before, honey.

585
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,470
Oh, I don't think I can go through
being homeless, again.

586
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,355
- (Frank) Oh.
- (Agnes) Not at my age.

587
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,038
- Richard.
- Hm?

588
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,357
Richard, can I speak to you for a moment?

589
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,357
OK.

590
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,510
- We've gotta do something.
- Come on, Ellen. I did my part.

591
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,359
I did the weekend. I want my life back.

592
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,994
- What will they do?
- Why not live in their car?

593
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,033
They lived in a trailer home.
That's like a big car.

594
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,356
- I cannot believe you.
- What?

595
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,393
You are being completely heartless.

596
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,398
You're always on about the plight
of the less fortunate

597
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,716
but you'll turn your parents
out on the street?

598
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,957
- Please don't call them that.
- OK. They're obnoxious,

599
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,799
but they care about you unconditionally

600
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,911
unlike Doug and Arleen.

601
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,032
Doug and Arleen Clayton are good people.

602
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,596
- They may be a tad conservative.
- Uh-huh.

603
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,439
The wedding is soon.
This is the worst time.

604
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,714
It'll only be a few days. The wedding
is all set to go. Come on, Richard.

605
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,754
You know this is the right thing to do. Hm?

606
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,795
<i>- Right?
- (He sighs)</i>

607
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,639
Folks, Richard has something
he'd like to tell you.

608
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,674
Ellen and I want you to know
you're welcome

609
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,998
to stay here for a few days. If that
makes you uncomfortable, we understand.

610
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,670
What can I say, son?

611
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,474
You've rescued us in our hour of need.

612
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,479
Um...

613
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,672
I guess family is
the most important bond of all.

614
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,193
Yeah. Nothing on earth
is more important than family.

615
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,870
- (Richard) OK.
- (Frank) Son.

616
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,715
Oh, my. Oh, my God.

617
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,195
<i>(They sob)</i>

618
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,837
- (Frank) I'm so full of emotion.
- You're not uncomfortable with this?

619
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,952
No. This is so good.

620
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,831
Honey, these'll help you sleep.

621
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,031
I refuse to wear earplugs
in my own house.

622
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,549
<i>(Moaning and thudding)</i>

623
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,957
It's sweet that a couple
who've been together so long

624
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,470
- are still attracted to each other.
- Sweet? They're psychotic.

625
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,797
They're oblivious to the effect
they have on others.

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,912
But that's all right because
it's not getting under my skin.

627
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,395
My feet are itchy.
Do you think it's blackfoot?

628
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,192
<i>(Sighs) It's not blackfoot.</i>

629
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,039
How do you know? Are you a podiatrist?

630
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,277
Stop pacing and come back to bed.
You're making me nervous.

631
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,198
All right.

632
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,833
(Agnes) Who's my daddy?

633
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,349
Do you mind?!

634
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,149
<i>(She laughs) Dear.</i>

635
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,955
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen before.

636
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,951
Except a brain.

637
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,395
Hey, honey, are you OK?

638
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,033
Yeah. Yeah.

639
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,549
Think they'll look for a place today?

640
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,193
- Doc.
- Yeah?

641
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,870
Could you try to like them, for me?

642
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,630
Course. You know me.
Of course.

643
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,879
Do I look smaller to you?

644
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,438
If you get a chance, remind her
there's no smoking in the house.

645
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,232
I'll tell her.

646
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,352
- Where you running off to, son?
- Nowhere.

647
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,677
I've got business in town. That's all.

648
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,871
Wanna toss the ball around?

649
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,676
Er, no. I mean I would love to,
but I'm running late, as it is.

650
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,916
Oh, come on, son.

651
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,032
All my life I dreamed about
tossing the pigskin around

652
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,789
- with my only son.
- Huh.

653
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,436
Well, I can't, Frank, I really can't.

654
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,599
I... I've got a bad shoulder, too.
I, er... dislocated it playing lacrosse.

655
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,994
Oh, that's no big deal.

656
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,159
I got bad knees, a bad back.
I got a bad heart.

657
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,920
Let's play a little catch
while I'm still alive.

658
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,877
- I'm in a really good suit.
- Let me toss it to you one time.

659
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,392
OK, all right. One time.
And then I really have to run.

660
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,275
Get the camera.
Woo-hoo. Here we go.

661
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,755
This is a dream come true.

662
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,554
- That's a very fine watch you got there.
- Oh.

663
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,399
- You must be living right.
- Thanks. It was a gift.

664
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,828
A fine watch.

665
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,591
If you ever need another, I know a guy
who sells 'em wholesale from his car.

666
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,836
- I'll do that.
- Come on, let's go, boy.

667
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,393
- Here ya go.
- OK.

668
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,750
Ready. You're looking good, son.

669
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,350
- OK.
- Yes. Go long, son.

670
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,028
Oh. Very good.

671
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,916
- That was pretty good. Here we go.
- All right, son.

672
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,918
Whoa. Very nice.
Do this with Doug?

673
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,989
No. Doug didn't really like
to get his hands dirty.

674
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,556
Stick with me. My hands is always dirty.

675
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,355
Hit me hard. Let's go, right there.

676
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,278
<i>(Crunch)</i>

677
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,674
Ooh, what happened?

678
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,634
- Son? What happened?
- I think I dislocated my shoulder.

679
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,832
- I'll pop it back in.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

680
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,270
- You're not gonna pop anything.
- Trust me.

681
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,710
<i>I've seen Lethal Weapon ten times.</i>

682
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,718
Let him pop it.
He's good at popping it in.

683
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,070
- I can do it.
- Don't pop it.

684
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,998
Come here. Let me pull it out.

685
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,714
Almost got him that time. Come on.

686
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,832
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

687
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,712
(Richard) Stay away from me!

688
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,869
Do I have more hair in this picture?

689
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,435
- What?
- Never mind.

690
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,836
I... just want to thank you, Dr. Clayton.
This book really saved my life.

691
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,393
Could you sign it?

692
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,875
- I'd be honored.
- Great.

693
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,879
There you are.

694
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,830
I can't read this.

695
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,674
Thank you.

696
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,316
Richard, are you gonna be able to do this?

697
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,999
Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,589
That's my boy.

699
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,034
(Man) Come on, already.
It's like a furnace in here.

700
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,953
Oh, they're done early.

701
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,791
<i>Since when do you read the Star?</i>

702
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,798
It's Agnes's. It's very interesting.

703
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,549
Don't they have somewhere to go yet?
I'll gladly pay for a hotel.

704
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,228
They won't take money from us.
They're very proud.

705
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,319
Proud? Of what?
200 years of inbreeding?

706
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,750
I broke my arm.
My book signing was a disaster.

707
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,679
They're not bad
once you get to know them.

708
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,000
Frank is very handy around the house.
Agnes gave me wonderful recipes.

709
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,111
Recipes for what?

710
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,278
Pigs' feet or possum pie?

711
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,832
<i>(Wind howls)</i>

712
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,837
<i>(Thunderclap)</i>

713
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,999
Mm. Ellen, this is delicious. What is it?

714
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,397
Tempeh croquette with a tofu tahini dip.

715
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,478
Do I have the best wife in the world,
or what?

716
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,637
That's not all.
I have a special surprise for you.

717
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,116
A surprise? I love surprises.

718
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,117
(In southern accent) It's a cheese ball.
I made it myself with my own two feet.

719
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,713
What the hell?

720
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,556
No. No!

721
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,154
Your father said you're looking for a rug.
I'll cut you a deal.

722
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,517
- No. This isn't happening.
- Just shut the hell up.

723
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,948
You're not my wife.

724
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,551
Yes I am. And you're my husband.
Lookee here.

725
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,033
Like father, like son.

726
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,070
No! No!

727
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,069
No!

728
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,592
What's the matter, ain't ya hungry?

729
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,274
Run, honey, run!

730
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,713
Oh, Ellen. Oh, I just had the worst dream.

731
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,509
- Son?
- Agnes?

732
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,076
Are you OK?
I thought I heard a scream.

733
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,955
Yeah, I had a nightmare.
But I'm fine. Thank you.

734
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,469
Oh, honey.

735
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,195
- Don't cry. Mommy's here.
- OK.

736
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,277
- Y'know...
- Um...

737
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,359
There was a lullaby I used to
sing to you when you were a baby.

738
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,710
- Uh-huh.
- I bet if I sang it,

739
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,275
- you'd go to sleep.
- That's not necessary.

740
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,516
- Oh, I'd love to.
- I don't... I don't...

741
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,191
<i># Go to sleep my pride and joy...</i>

742
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,516
Very pretty, but I don't wanna wake Ellen.

743
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,669
<i>#... 'Cause your mama's precious boy</i>

744
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,637
<i>- #... Little angel safe in bed...
- OK.</i>

745
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,550
<i>#... Happy thoughts dance in your head...</i>

746
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,909
Agnes, I'm 34 years old.

747
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,634
<i>- #... Go to sleep...
- Very restful. Thank you.</i>

748
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,230
<i>- #... My pride and joy...
- There's another verse?</i>

749
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,431
<i>#... 'Cause your mom...</i>

750
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,232
- Point it toward me.
- Yee!

751
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,398
- Tilt it. There you go.
- There we go. Right there. You happy?

752
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,068
- Have you seen my watch?
- What watch?

753
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,035
- My Rolex. I can't find it. It's just gone.
- When's the last time you had it?

754
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,678
Last night. I put it
on the nightstand like I always do.

755
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,474
Frank was commenting
on it yesterday. Remember?

756
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,033
He was admiring it.

757
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,151
You can't be serious.

758
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,793
He stole my watch.

759
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,797
You been using that thing...

760
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,389
You honestly think Frank snuck in here

761
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,158
and took your watch?

762
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,989
I don't know.
He has a criminal record.

763
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,476
What kind of man impersonates
a meat inspector?

764
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,956
I never met a sane person in your family.

765
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,517
- (Ellen) You probably misplaced it.
- No, I didn't misplace it, Ellen.

766
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,632
My father gave me that watch,
my real father.

767
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,432
You thought it was too flashy.

768
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,792
That doesn't mean it gives him
the right to steal it.

769
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,315
- Bye, honey.
- Be safe.

770
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,318
I will. Thank you.

771
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,955
- Is this the Clayton residence?
- Yes, but we didn't order any meat.

772
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,912
Well, someone did.

773
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,271
Got an order for a Franklin...

774
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,072
Manuria? Manrouee?

775
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,308
Woo-hoo! Ho! My prime rib's here, hey.
Finally.

776
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,752
From the Meat of the Month Club.
I've been waiting three weeks.

777
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,235
Come on, boy. Right in the kitchen.

778
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,115
I moved out all that Satan stuff
to make room for it.

779
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,799
Come on, boy.

780
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,878
<i>(Frank laughs)
That's right.</i>

781
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,991
Ready, set... let go.

782
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,469
Stick it... Wait... Move that tofu.

783
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,434
Um... Frank, you haven't seen my Rolex
by any chance?

784
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,631
No I didn't, son.

785
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,391
<i>- That's good. Let me sign that for you.
- (Quietly) OK.</i>

786
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,832
- I'll be working downstairs in the office.
- Fine.

787
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,397
(Frank) I'll catch you next time.
- (Delivery man) All right.

788
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,753
<i>(Agnes cackles)</i>

789
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,109
- It's hot as a pistol out there.
- I'm sweating like a whore in church.

790
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,799
You know...

791
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,834
all that suntan lotion
and naked flesh gives a man some ideas.

792
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,749
Oh, yeah? What're you getting at,
Franklin Menure?

793
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,997
I'm gonna be getting at you, in a minute.

794
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,872
<i>(Lascivious squeals)</i>

795
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,672
Oh, Frank!

796
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,631
<i>(She squeals excitedly)
Oh, honey.</i>

797
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,030
Oh, Frank, spank me.

798
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,231
Spank it around a little. It likes that.

799
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,556
<i>(Groans) Oh! Oh, Frank.</i>

800
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,716
(Frank) Stop making them damn noises.

801
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,229
(Agnes) Ain't you ever gonna find
my G-spot?

802
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,273
Would you shut the hell up
about your damn G-spot?

803
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,596
(Agnes) It's time to break out the Xcaliber.

804
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,633
(Frank) The Xcaliber? Where is it?

805
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,193
(Agnes) I know I packed it.

806
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,678
Let me look through the stuff.
Hold on, woman.

807
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,359
<i>- Hold on, woman.
- (Agnes moans)</i>

808
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,916
<i>- (Vibrator buzzes)
- (Frank) Sounds like buzzing. Is that you?</i>

809
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,318
(Agnes) That's Xcaliber.
I'd know that sound anywhere.

810
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,112
(Frank) It's coming from the closet.

811
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,471
(Agnes) Oh, Frank,
I think there's somebody in there.

812
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,193
(Frank) I'll go take a look.

813
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,513
Son.

814
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,719
Son...

815
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,630
Son, are you all right?

816
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,673
If you had questions about sex,
why didn't you just ask?

817
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,154
I don't want to talk about it.

818
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,716
- You're our son...
- I don't wanna talk about it!

819
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,070
We're here for you. Son!

820
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,592
Son, your mom and I
are very concerned about you.

821
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,236
You're the pent-up type. You've got
to get in touch with your emotions.

822
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,793
Go away!

823
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,078
- It's beautiful.
- It won't work.

824
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,352
- Of course it will.
- No, it's not gonna to work.

825
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,551
Mom, I'm not talking about the dress.

826
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,320
<i>- What's the matter?
- (Sighs heavily)</i>

827
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,031
I've been reevaluating things lately.

828
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,992
That's only natural, honey.

829
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,195
This is a very big step for the two of you.

830
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,836
I'm just not sure if Richard and I
are right for each other.

831
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,191
Mom, he always seemed so tolerant
and so compassionate.

832
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,799
What do you mean "seemed"?

833
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,231
I don't understand why
he's so hard on Frank and Agnes.

834
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,195
I know they're coarse and come across
a little too strong sometimes, but...

835
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,233
I don't know. It seems like
he wrote them off from Day One.

836
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,228
- Well, he really seems to love you.
- I know he does.

837
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,672
When you love somebody,
you've gotta accept them for who they are.

838
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,832
<i>(Phone)</i>

839
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,517
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

840
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,676
No, I'll get it.

841
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,548
- Hello.
- Hey. Are you sitting down?

842
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,672
<i>- No. Why?
- The Holly Davis Show called.</i>

843
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,472
They want you on the show, Friday

844
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,830
<i>- Holly Davis, this Friday?
- (Shouts) Yes!</i>

845
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,794
- Deepak Chopra cancelled. Appendicitis.
- That's fantastic.

846
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,072
I know. Richard, this is the break
of a lifetime.

847
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,874
Appearing on that show
could put your book over the top.

848
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,392
- I'll call tomorrow with the details.
- Perfect. I'll speak to you then.

849
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,275
- Honey, that's terrific.
- Just wait'll I tell my parents.

850
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,789
No need son, we heard every word.

851
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,479
Just a last-minute thing, fell into my lap,
but it could be a big break.

852
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,036
Congratulations, Richard.
That sounds very exciting.

853
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,189
<i>You'll be a big hit with dissatisfied
housewives everywhere. (Sniggers)</i>

854
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,312
It seems a bit long in the sleeves,
doesn't it?

855
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,876
- Long. Really?
- Your father and I have discussed this...

856
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,073
and we both feel very strongly that
these Menures have got to go.

857
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,636
If you insist on associating
with these horrible people,

858
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,070
your mother and I
will not be at the wedding.

859
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,113
There's only room
for one set of parents in this family.

860
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,312
Either us or them. The choice is yours.

861
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,599
Well... I assure you, they'll be out...
by the wedding, Mother.

862
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,030
Oh come on. They're fun.

Frank, these are all of my friends

Yeah, son, these people
just been passing through...

885
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,038
- How 'bout you sit down and relax with us?
- No thanks. I'd like to speak to my fiancée.

886
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,639
In private.

- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

- I want them out now.
- Not this again.

892
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,436
No! They've overstayed their welcome,
I want them out now.

893
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,119
And all those people.

894
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,517
You had no right to let them throw
a party without consulting me.

895
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,633
They said they were inviting
a few friends over.

896
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,276
<i>A few? The entire cast of Hee Haw
is down there.</i>

897
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,474
They haven't seen their friends in ages.
They'll be finished by 10.

898
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,231
10? I have a live national television
appearance tomorrow morning.

899
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,069
- Fine. I'll ask them to cut it short.
- No! I want them out now.

900
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,032
These people are a plague.

901
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,439
- Why do you hate them so much?
- Why? Why?

902
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,155
I'll tell you why. Because they're rude,
crude, and intrusive.

903
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,115
They're dysfunctional. They're a biological
and sociological mess.

904
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,598
You can't stand it that you might
be the child of such common people.

905
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,588
- That's not true.
- You know what you are? You're a snob.

906
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,438
Are you calling me a snob?

907
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,312
I am calling you a snob.

Son. Son.

914
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,476
It may not be my place to say,
but you shouldn't talk to her like that.

915
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,955
A man's wife should be treated
with respect.

916
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,037
- A man's wife...
- Shut up, you cow.

917
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,913
I'm just saying that
a man's wife is his castle.

918
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,678
- His castle?
- Yeah, his castle.

and you're mixing your metaphors.

921
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,999
- I'm trying to help!
- You can help by shutting up!

922
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,760
Get out of my house! Get out of here!

934
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,032
Welcome back. If you just joined us,
our guest today is Dr. Richard Clayton,

935
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,629
the author of a new self-help book titled

936
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,037
<i>Ready, Set, Let Go:
A Guide to Anger Management.</i>

937
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,196
<i>(Applause)</i>

938
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,516
<i>Ready, Set, Let Go.
It seems kind of simplistic, doesn't it?</i>

939
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,554
I can vouch for this programme,
because it certainly changed my life.

940
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,116
What was your life like
before you developed your system?

941
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,278
<i>Well, I had a very difficult childhood</i>

942
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,313
<i>which led to some destructive tendencies
as an adult.</i>

943
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,078
I was prone to fits of rage.

944
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,956
Things finally came to a head
when I had a nervous breakdown at 29.

945
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,518
After being arrested for disorderly conduct
after some drunken binges...

946
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,358
it was time for a change.

947
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,597
Er... I stopped drinking
and eventually completed my doctorate.

948
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,677
<i>- (Audience applauds)
- That's amazing.</i>

949
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,589
Is it true you haven't lost your temper
in four years?

950
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,754
<i>Er... Well... er...
Yeah, you could say that... that</i>

951
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,509
<i>that since I developed these techniques,
I've definitely...</i>

952
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,075
<i>er... managed my emotions much better.</i>

953
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,953
Richard, we have a little surprise for you.

954
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,039
<i>- A surprise?
- We know you've come a long way.</i>

955
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,913
<i>Your family must be very proud.</i>

956
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,190
So, we've brought your parents
here today

957
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,676
to talk about the past
and how far you've come.

958
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,718
- I beg your pardon?
- In fact...

959
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,388
they're here in the studio audience
right now.

960
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,318

973

I know I don't look it.
A friend said I had the skin of a 20-year-old.

He is a chip off the ol' block.

blood is thicker than water.

<i>Not with all the alcohol in yours.

980

You know, he tried a 12-step programme,
but he got so drunk he fell down the steps.

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,432
You have to pardon my wife.
She's got a mouth like a damn 7-Eleven.

00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,232
It's open 24 hours a day.

983
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,718
I have to set something straight here.
These people... You're not my parents.

984
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,310
<i>- (Audience gasps)
- My parents are Doug and Arleen Clayton.</i>

985
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,590
<i>(Holly) I don't understand.</i>

986
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,951
These people... they're biolog...
They contributed... biologically.

987
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,957
They're biological contributors, yes.

988
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,278
Technically, they're parents of mine.
But they're not my parents.

989
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,358
<i>My staff was informed
that these are your parents.</i>

990
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,232
<i>Informed? Informed by whom?</i>

991
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,158
<i>Your brother Mitch, I believe.</i>

992
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,999
<i>At least, I think he was your brother.</i>

993
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,680
(Frank) Er, you're gonna have to
excuse our boy. He's not himself today.

994
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,871
(Agnes) On account of the trouble at home.

995
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,469
<i>- (Holly) Trouble?
- God, I can't watch.</i>

996
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,636
Trouble with the little lady.

997
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,196
- They're tying the knot...
- (Richard to self) Just stay cool.

998
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,709
They had themselves
a little misunderstanding.

999
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,799
- Last night he was like a man possessed.
- (Richard)... let go.

1000
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,560
(Frank) But they love each other,
and er...

1001
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,558
I'm sure he didn't mean
to scream at her like he did.

1002
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,433
He's a good boy.
We're so proud of him.

1003
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,551
<i>We are so proud of him.</i>

1004
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,954
He's our boy. He's our son.

1005
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,151
He's a good boy. We're so proud...

1006
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,715
<i>- (Holly) Oh, my God!
- (Agnes) Frank!</i>

1007
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,431
- (Frank) Oh, my God!
- (Agnes) Leave him alone!

1008
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,838
<i>(Frank) Leave the boy alone!</i>

1009
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,072
(Mitch) Hey, Jennifer.
Hey, what about tonight?

1010
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,955
What d'ya mean you got homework?
I never did homework.

1011
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,199
Come here, you son of a bitch!

1012
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,118
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1013
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,468
- Come on! I'll kill you!
- It was a joke. It wasn't meant to go this far.

1014
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:08,030
Don't! It's an Italian sweater!
Don't pull on it.

1015
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,319
Go ahead, hit me.

1016
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,308
I've always been jealous of you.
You've done so much with your life.

1017
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,158
I've done nothing. I...

1018
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,909
I guess that's why
I've always been such a prick to you.

1019
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,113
<i>- Swish. Two points!
- (Mitch groans)</i>

1020
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,794
<i>There was chaos on The Holly Davis Show
as a guest went berserk.</i>

1021
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,833
<i>Dr. Richard Clayton,
author of a book on anger management,</i>

1022
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,350
<i>blew his top today
during a taping of the show,</i>

1023
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:47,076
<i>attacking his own parents on camera,
before a live audience.</i>

1024
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,592
<i>I guess he should have called his book
Ready, Set, Go Nuts.</i>

1025
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,916
<i>(Man) And now...
back to Mother, Jugs and Speed.</i>

1026
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,519
Well, there's good news
and there's bad news.

1027
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,829
The bad news is, your publisher wants
to drop you, the book tour's cancelled,

1028
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,271
and Kmart has decided
to stop carrying the book.

1029
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,675
And the good news?

1030
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,950
You've been invited
to be on Jerry Springer.

1031
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,798
I'm really at my wit's end, Dad.
Ellen's gone back to her mother and...

1032
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,596
I'd like to stay for a couple days,
just to get my head straight.

1033
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,713
Richard, this is really not a good time.
We have guests.

1034
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,716
This is your mess, son.

1035
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,798
You're gonna have to deal with it yourself.

1036
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,800
(Angela) Oh, Agnes,
you don't have to do that.

1037
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,958
It's the least we could do,
you lettin' us stay here an' all.

1038
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,119
<i>The least I could do.
All you've done is eat her damn Mallomars.</i>

1039
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,153
Shut yer hole.

1040
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,998
Still no answer.

1041
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,113
We just feel terrible about this.

1042
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,390
Mitch said it was gonna help his career.

1043
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,397
Oh, sugar.

1044
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,958
Is one little argument worth
throwing a whole wedding over for?

1045
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,948
I just can't see myself spending the rest
of my life with him anymore.

1046
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,469
I feel like he's not the man
I thought he was.

1047
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,753
Maybe you oughta go and see if he's OK,
'cause he won't talk to us.

1048
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,399
Oh, honey.

1049
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,038
<i>(Sighs)</i>

1050
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,351
Richard?

1051
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,478
Richard?

1052
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,475
Are you down here?

1053
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,679
Oh, hi, Ellen. I didn't, er...
I didn't hear you come in.

1054
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,714
Er... maybe you can give me a hand.
I'm making a cheese ball.

1055
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,718
It's a lot harder than it looks.

1056
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,196
I tried to call you but you were...

1057
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,277
Richard, is that meat?

1058
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,473
Mm-hm. Barbecued pork.
It's the meat of the month.

1059
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,513
A little red meat's not so bad
from time to time.

1060
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,759
Honey, what are you doing to yourself?

1061
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,118
I'm accepting my heritage, Ellen.
I've had it all wrong from the beginning.

1062
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,074
Why fight it? I'm a Menure.

1063
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,590
- OK, you know what...
- Uh-uh. What's the difference?

1064
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,870
I'm ruined anyway.

1065
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,548
This is not the man I know.

1066
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,910
No. You knew Richard Clayton.

1067
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,953
I'm Frank Menure Junior.
How the hell are ya?

1068
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,549
Richard... this is crazy!

1069
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,149
Well, runs in the family.

1070
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,753
What about our plans?
We were supposed to get married...

1071
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,236
And do what?
Bring more Menures into the world?

1072
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,829
More Cokie's syndrome? More blackfoot?

1073
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,429
<i>(Scratching)</i>

1074
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:40,117
No. These genes stop here.
Excuse me, I have a cheese ball to make.

1075
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,519
Fine. If that's the way you feel about it...

1076
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,836
then you should have this back.

1077
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,833
Goodbye.

1078
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:07,830
That's all right, Ellen. I'll be fine.
I'm in complete control of my emotions.

1079
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,312
Ready... set...

1080
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,478
Mom, he's so far gone,
I don't know what to do.

1081
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,229
- Well, what happened?
- He's a drunken wreck!

1082
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,798
It's like he's... totally given up.
He's even eating meat.

1083
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,719
- Richard's eating meat?
- Yes, red meat.

1084
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,390
Well, he's not himself. It's the fear
of commitment, the pressure...

1085
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:46,994
No, no, no, no, it's not. It's the Menures.
He... he... he blames them for everything.

1086
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,715
<i>- (Ellen sobs)
- (Angela) Oh, baby.</i>

1087
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,232
(Angela) It's all right, now.
It's all right, now.

1088
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,193
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

1089
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,710
<i>- (Doorbell rings again)
- Go away!</i>

1090
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,318
Get off my property.

1091
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,796
We just come to get our things.
We won't be a minute.

1092
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,154
Good news. We're leaving. The
Peekaboo Carnival offered us our old jobs.

1093
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,029
All right. Stay there, I'll get it.

1094
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,869
There's your stuff. Now just go away.

1095
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:50,392
You didn't happen to see my silver locket?
It's shaped like a heart.

1096
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,114
No. Goodbye.

1097
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,710
- Wait just a second, son.
- What do you want?

1098
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,276
We would like to speak to you for a minute,
if we could.

1099
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,517
Then we're out of your hair for good.
I promise.

1100
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,759
I think what we have to say
you'll be very interested in.

1101
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,270
I don't quite know how to say this.
Um...

1102
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,592
- Might as well just tell him.
- Please get to the point.

1103
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,030
We're not really your parents, son.

1104
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,191
You...

1105
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,631
...what?
- See...

1106
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:32,958
we always wanted kids,
but we never could have any of our own.

1107
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,790
Then we saw that ad in the paper
and we figured, let's give it a shot.

1108
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,309
No. You can't be serious.

1109
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,592
We had to do some fancy talking
around that detective,

1110
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,950
but we're smarter than we look.

1111
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,832
We never meant no harm.

1112
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,798
So you mean to tell me... this past week,
this entire ordeal, was all based on a lie?

1113
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,468
We realize now it was wrong.

1114
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,117
- And, we're... we're very sorry.
- Sorry?

1115
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,231
You're sorry?

1116
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,874
You ruined my life!

1117
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,992
- I could have you arrested for this.
- I told you.

1118
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,274
Well, son, that's your choice, but, er...
we would have to stick around for the trial.

1119
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,309
Otherwise, we just get out of your hair.

1120
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,670
Perhaps you're right, Mr. Menure.

1121
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,668
If that is your real name,
which I hope for your sake it is not.

1122
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:33,557
When I think of poor, sweet, trusting Ellen...
defending the two of you.

1123
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,595
Wait till I tell her about this.
You are the lowest people I have ever met,

1124
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,917
and if I see you here again,
I will call the police!

1125
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,953
Goodbye and good riddance!

1126
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,830
(Ellen) I can't believe they'd do that.
They seemed so genuine.

1127
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,112
They seemed like
they really cared about you.

1128
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,352
Can we talk in private, just for a second?

1129
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,872
I was headed upstairs.

1130
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,030
Mom, we'll be down in a minute.

1131
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,438
I guess they fooled both of us, huh?

1132
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,959
This doesn't change your actions.
You didn't know the truth then.

1133
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,151
You really...

1134
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,511
You really betrayed the values
I thought we shared.

1135
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:32,033
You're right. I'm ashamed of the way
I acted, most of all, towards you.

1136
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,274
I couldn't accept the fact that I could've...
come from people like that.

1137
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:45,032
I've paid a huge price. Not my career.
I got what I deserved there, but Ellen...

1138
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,792
I don't wanna lose you over this. You're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1139
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,552
What happened to your watch?

1140
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,997
I... I stopped wearing it. It's too flashy.
It's really not me.

1141
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,356
- Doc?
- Yeah, bunny?

1142
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,469
The rehearsal went great.
It's gonna be a lovely wedding.

1143
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,399
Thank heaven those horrible people
are finally gone.

1144
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,036
(Mrs. Clayton) You should be so glad
they aren't your real parents.

1145
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,509
Can you imagine being stuck with people
like that for the rest of your life?

1146
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,828
(Mrs. Clayton) They're lucky you didn't
have them arrested.

1147
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,556
To the Menures, who could not be
with us tonight, I say, thanks.

I hear the caterer we're using is wonderful.

1150

(Mr. Clayton) The Coolidges used them
for their daughter's wedding.

You seem like you have
something on your mind, Doc.

1154
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,359
- I have?
- You're not having second thoughts?

1155
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,074
- No. Absolutely not.
- Good.

1156
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,630

- Step right up. Win yourself a prize.

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,153
- Tip 'em over.
- Knock over the cans and win a big prize.

How 'bout winning a prize
for the pretty lady?

1163

Oh, no.

- You ain't trying hard enough.

1169

- Oh, too bad.
- This is a rip off!

1170

Oh. You wanna try again?

1171
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,070
I bet I can knock you over easy enough.

1172

Er... since you've been such a good sport,
I'll give you a consolation prize.

- Oh.
- Real smart, pop tart.

1178

First day back
and you're already blowing the profits.

1179
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,359
You could save me money on a costume
by working at the House of Horrors.

1180

You want horrors, monkey butt...

1181

- Monkey butt?

- (Frank) You shut up!

I just wanted to give you
your locket back...

Mom.

1187
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,792
Why did you lie?

1188
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,632
You said that your problems started
when we showed up,

1189
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,991
so we just figured the best thing to do
was to go away.

1190
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,233
So you gave me up for my own good.

1191
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,351
Again.

1192
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,313
Can you ever forgive me?

1193
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,229
- Well of course. You're our son.
- Our baby boy.

1194

Hey!

1195

Hey, er... you still wanna come
to my wedding?

Nothing would give us more pleasure.

1197

Hey, when is that wedding, anyway?

1198
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,514
Er... it's about an hour and a half.

1199
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,156
- Where is he?
- He should've been here an hour ago.

1200
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,636
Er... I wouldn't worry about it.
He'll show up.

That's a good spot.

1202
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,349
- Don't be nervous, son.
- You look so handsome.

1203
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,835
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

1204
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,591
All I can say son is
that if Ellen makes you half as happy

1205

as Agnes has made me
throughout the years...

1206
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,278
- Uh-huh.
...you'll only be half as miserable as I am.

1207
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,835
Don't make me whip your butt
in front of a church.

1208
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,679
Well, I'd better get in there. Wish me luck.

1209
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,519
- Good luck, son.
- Oh, you're gonna be fine.

1210
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,759
- (Frank) Don't forget to say I do.
- All right. I'll see you in there.

Dearly beloved...
we are gathered here together...

about being a grandmother?

- Looks like a Harvard man.
- Oh, no, Yale.

(Frank) Don't hog him, Clayton.
Pass him by.

1245

- I know. Gotta hold his head.

- Wrinkled, short, with his mouth wide open.
