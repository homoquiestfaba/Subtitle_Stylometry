1
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,046
-Be sure to lock the door.
-l'll lock it.

2
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,449
Hi, there. Go on in.

3
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:57,389
-Hi, Ms. Morgan.
-Oh, Alvin. l should have called you.

4
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,222
The kids are having a party.
lt's in full swing.

5
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:04,790
That's okay. l can still clean the pool.
They won't be in my way.

6
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,729
Okay. Okay.

7
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,838
Okay, okay. lt's about time
you made it, man.

8
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,239
Talking all that garbage in school.

9
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,248
That's you, baby. What? What?

10
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,441
Look at you.

11
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,622
There you are.

12
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,124
You know, l've been looking
all over for you.

13
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,425
Come here!

14
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,363
Mama's little baby.

15
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,535
Thank you so much
for watching over the grill.

16
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,266
-No problem.
-Yeah, thanks.

17
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,404
Forget it, man. Chicks like Paris
don't date outside the NBA.

18
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,381
Swim lessons, boy!

19
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,386
All wet.

20
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,853
You need some Floaties.

21
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,985
Get that garbage out of the pool!

22
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,590
Let me give you a tip, punk.

23
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,823
Next time you wanna crash a party...

24
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,833
-...don't fall in the pool.
-He's the pool boy, Ted.

25
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,837
lf he was in the pool,
it was for a reason, l'm sure.

26
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,440
Well, it's more technical than you think.
See, l was just--

27
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,582
Anyhoo! Come on, man.

28
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,912
-Let's get out of here.
-Thinks he's on the swim team or something.

29
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,864
Can you believe she had the nerve to ask
me what it was like being with him?

30
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,932
l was like, "Oh, my God."

31
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,801
Hello? Right now?

32
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,440
Dru's on TV!

33
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,443
A year ago, he was going to his prom.

34
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:17,085
He had his corsage
and that old-school frilly shirt.

35
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,755
Now he's living pro-baller style.
One hell of a jump.

36
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:24,051
-Why did you bring up the corsage?
-Because we all did it.

37
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,057
I bet your peoples
on the West Coast miss you.

38
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,560
-You probably got a girl there.
-Oh, my God.

39
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:33,433
I have a job. I play professional basketball.
That's what I do.

40
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:37,103
Otherwise, you know how it is, Stu.
I'm a free agent.

41
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:41,504
All right. Officially, he is a member
of the NBA.

42
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,341
Let's go back to SportsCenter.

43
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,746
Free agent? Free agent?

44
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,855
Paged him.

45
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,979
l'll see you in homeroom, all right?

46
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,554
Yo. How you guys doing?

47
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,600
-Did you see the update on the GM website?
-What update?

48
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:42,001
Some guy in Kentucky boosted his
power-to-weight ratio by 10 percent.

49
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,639
You have the best design.
New York guy gave up.

50
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,674
The Kentucky guy is desperate.
Don't worry about it.

51
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,073
Except durability. And power-to-weight.

52
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,814
That's where the new camshaft comes in.

53
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,916
lt's lighter and stronger
at the same time.

54
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,917
You're one of the three finalists, Alvin.
You're the man!

55
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,751
Hey.

56
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,519
We're only discussing you getting
a full-ride, four-year scholarship--

57
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,891
She's like a Frappuccino with hips.

58
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:15,636
-lt's like they all saw the interview.
-They did. lt was on SportsCenter.

59
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,530
Grande Mocha Brownie Frappuccino.

60
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,802
With mint hot fudge
and mint whipped cream.

61
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,077
Dream on.

62
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,081
Clearly, Alvin's not masturbating enough.

63
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:32,620
Thank God l don't have that problem.
All right, holler at your people, now.

64
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,086
-l'm not touching that.
-l don't want to.

65
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,122
l don't want to.

66
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,629
Yvonne's right. Act like he called
with a good explanation.

67
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:47,828
He better call, and he better have
a good explanation. Look at me.

68
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,652
Look at them. Not a care in the world.

69
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,188
lf they catch you staring, they'll send
the jocks to kick our asses.

70
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,251
No, they won't.

71
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:15,686
-We're invisible.
-lnvisible?

72
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:19,496
Not "invisible" invisible.
Just invisible to them.

73
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,763
We'd be visible if we'd walk
down that hallway.

74
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,204
Why can't we walk down that hallway?
lt's a hallway.

75
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,170
ln that community, we're immigrants
without green cards.

76
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:36,142
What? Boy, l got on high fashion
just like them. Check this out.

77
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,654
A fake label from the lnternet stuck
on some Wranglers. Very high fashion.

78
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,190
-Man, watch this.
-Walter.

79
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:47,118
-Hey, Walter.
-Walter, no!

80
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,788
Hell, son, you in the wrong hall, man!

81
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
l mean, l'll get you, there.
l breaks it down.

82
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,064
Yeah. Hey, girl.

83
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,173
You like how l do that?

84
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,074
Yo, man!

85
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,310
-Y'all busters stinking up our hallway again?
-No, no, dudes. lt's cool, bro.

86
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,148
Look. Check this.

87
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,081
Oh, what's up with that, Ted?

88
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,053
ls that the gay surrender? You a homo thug?
Man, l ought to kick your ass!

89
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,855
Punk.

90
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,157
Stay out of here.

91
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:29,831
l got on Sean Johns.
l'm gonna make me some Phat Farms.

92
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:33,204
-No, l mean, buy some.
-Don't come down this hallway again!

93
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,077
No, man. No, man. We can't be having that.

94
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,743
lt sounded great.

95
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,578
After you win, we should drop
this in the Galaxie.

96
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,914
lf l win.

97
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,886
No offense, but this baby's going with me.

98
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:52,118
Keep it in my dorm room.
Until l get a car.

99
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,019
No "if." When you win, man.

100
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,224
l sure hope l win.

101
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,769
lt'd be a nice change.

102
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,363
Tired of people calling us losers.

103
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,901
-Who says we're losers?
-What's the matter with you?

104
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,908
Being depressed and cynical is my job.

105
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,738
Man...

106
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,781
...we're about to graduate soon.

107
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,842
We never go on dates.

108
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,284
Never go to any dances.

109
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,223
We have no memories.

110
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,725
l mean, we're settling.

111
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,266
And they're not.

112
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:14,139
Clarence! Dinner's ready!

113
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,141
Can you turn off that music, please?

114
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:21,282
Turn off the music like you been
turning off your loving.

115
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,717
Alvin, honey, turn that game off.
Come on, time to eat.

116
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:29,313
Aretha, come on, honey, time to eat.
Let's go.

117
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,205
Gracious God.

118
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,414
So...

119
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,978
-...Alvin, got a date tonight?
-Dad, you're in denial.

120
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,187
Shut up, you Bride of Chucky-looking
extraterrestrial--

121
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:04,224
That's not even funny, stupid.

122
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:07,226
Well, Alvin, what do you have
planned for tonight, boy?

123
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,194
l'm gonna do some work on the computer.

124
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,028
All the schematics have to be
coded in HTML for the GM website.

125
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,398
Then me and the guys
will bust out some Xbox.

126
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,933
See that? Your son's a healthy,
heterosexual dork.

127
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,910
-Shut up, Lil' Kim in training!
-Both of you, hush now.

128
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,909
Why you always blaming me?

129
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,006
Go straight to the auto yard
when you get that part.

130
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,310
l don't like you walking
with that much cash.

131
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:33,455
-Why not? How much is it?
-$ 1500.

132
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,919
$ 1500?

133
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:41,258
My boy got $ 1500
cleaning swimming pools?

134
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:46,230
Yeah, and he collected it in genuine
currency, not lOUs or food stamps.

135
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,434
Hold on, now.

136
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,102
Food stamps just like money.

137
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:54,106
-Try to buy school clothes with them.
-Watch yourself.

138
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,108
Look, son.

139
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:01,007
Your mama right.
You know, we proud of you.

140
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:04,983
Work on your little engine and
your little school stuff and all that...

141
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:10,082
...but listen to me, son. All that working
like that without no loving?

142
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,387
That drive a man crazy.

143
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:17,025
You hear about students in China,
all jumping out windows...

144
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,566
...because they be under so much pressure.
You know why they jump?

145
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,438
They ain't got enough singing,
and ain't enough loving over there.

146
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,438
You ever heard a Chinese love song?

147
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:30,912
How many Chinese people over there?
Give me a figure. About 25--?

148
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,513
What, about 30 billion of them?

149
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,416
30 billion people ain't got a one
Barry White.

150
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:40,283
Ever seen a big old fat, black, Chinese
Barry White man? Any of them?

151
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,515
Hell, no, ain't gonna see one either.

152
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,427
Dad, l hear you on the whole dating thing.

153
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:50,190
-But sometimes you wanna hang out--
-Let me tell you something.

154
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,436
-Clarence!
-Oh, shut up.

155
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,307
Don't worry, honey, he'll call.

156
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:09,041
Speaking of calling, my cell phone
doesn't work at the resort...

157
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,018
-...so if you need me, call the resort.
-l know, number's on the fridge.

158
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,960
You know what? l'll just be a second.
l forgot to put the car in the garage.

159
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,393
-Can't leave my Escalade--
-You're killing me.

160
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,088
Come on, sweetie.

161
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,631
Mom, go!

162
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,298
-l'll put it in for you.
-Okay.

163
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,371
Park it and leave it.

164
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't even think about cruising around
with your friends, thinking you're cute.

165
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:39,339
-l mean it. You are not on my insurance.
-Mom, stop!

166
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,574
Look, you give yourself no credit.

167
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,179
-You ain't no fool-maker.
-She's right, and we're late.

168
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:46,977
-Love you.
-Love you too.

169
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,353
Don't worry, honey, he will call
on one of those phones.

170
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,139
-l'm balling.
-Girl, your mama's wheels are tight.

171
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:24,057
Take your time. Give everyone
a chance to envy.

172
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,928
-Paris is rolling!
-Yo, that's hot!

173
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,562
-lt's Dru.
-This is perfect.

174
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,167
Stay on the phone with him
while we drive up.

175
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,168
-Too bad we don't have a speaker.
-Do l mention the interview?

176
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:39,569
Hell, yeah, you mention
the damn interview, girl.

177
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,710
-Just be cool.
-And sweet.

178
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,278
No, sweet is weak, Zoe.

179
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,644
-He can't see you through the phone!
-Just answer it.

180
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,110
-Hello, Dru?
-Who's your boo, baby?

181
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,122
You're my boo, baby, but why
did you have to go and dis me?

182
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,191
Why you sweating me?
Come on. Who loves you?

183
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,188
Dru loves you. Never stop, never will stop.

184
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,560
Don't hate the player, baby. Hate the game.

185
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:09,636
Hey, this looks pretty cool. Hopefully,
Russell Simmons doesn't kick your ass.

186
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,135
-Wait until the whole car looks like that.
-Then all the girls will notice us? No.

187
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,974
At least with the Phat Farm, we'll get
some phat booties to rub on. Talk to you!

188
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,515
l hate y'all, man.

189
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,981
Man, l'm telling you,
we'll roll up in this car...

190
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,351
...everybody's head's gonna be turning.

191
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,117
-So, baby, really, it was just publicity?
-Yeah, girl.

192
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,990
Hey, hold on, okay? Hold on.

193
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,397
He's got me on hold.

194
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,762
Feel like popping a cork, sugar?

195
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,109
-Who's that?
-Who's who?

196
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,176
The limo driver popped a tire. l gotta go.

197
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,373
Oh, no, you don't. Then say my name.

198
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,618
-Better say it.
-Say my name!

199
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,119
You better say my name.
He didn't say it.

200
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,258
What do you mean, he didn't say it?

201
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,023
-He didn't say my name!
-Look out!

202
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,398
Oh, she done messed the ride!

203
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,436
-Yo, l got an uncle that could fix that, baby!
-Better get Maaco!

204
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,369
OnStar emergency.

205
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,237
l'll stand anywhere, baby.

206
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:28,606
-Is there an emergency in your vehicle?
-Do you know how much that will cost?

207
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,381
-$3000?
-And about two weeks in terms of labor.

208
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,420
l'm a little backed up.

209
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,559
Can we figure out some kind of
payment schedule?

210
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:42,530
Yeah, sure. Here's what we can do.
You give me 300 now...

211
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,564
...and come back two weeks
from Monday with 2700.

212
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,726
And that's cash on delivery,
not check on delivery.

213
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,705
That doesn't make sense.

214
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:56,704
l just said, my mom's gonna be back
on Monday!

215
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,706
-ln two weeks, l'll be dead!
-Don't worry about it, honey.

216
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:05,411
Kids crash cars all the time.
That's why people get insurance.

217
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,816
You're not on your mom's insurance,
are you?

218
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,857
l'm dead.

219
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:23,399
Hey, Alvin! lt's in.

220
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,403
You gotta check this out.

221
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,542
lt's amazing how light this is.

222
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:31,508
lt's hard to believe it's a camshaft.

223
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,147
You know her?

224
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,850
-That's Paris Morgan.
-Will you explain to her...

225
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:45,287
...that two weeks and 3 grand
is the best she can hope for?

226
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,587
Too bad her mama's
coming home on Monday.

227
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,732
Out of that 3 grand...

228
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,427
-...how much is in parts?
-l don't know. About 1500. Why?

229
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,906
l'll be right back.

230
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,480
Paris?

231
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,813
-Alan?
-Alvin.

232
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,794
You do our pool, right?

233
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,326
Yeah. You know...

234
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,890
...Ben's quoting you a really fair price.

235
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,364
That's what l figured.

236
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,769
l'm dead.

237
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,375
Not necessarily.

238
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:40,270
-What?
-l can have it done by Monday.

239
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:45,218
-You can do it?
-The parts are only $ 1500.

240
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:49,723
-l can have the labor done by this weekend.
-But l don't have $ 1500.

241
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,417
l do.

242
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,794
Let's back up here.

243
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,197
Now, you're saying you're willing
to fix this car...

244
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,703
-...this weekend and pay for the parts?
-Yeah.

245
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,840
That's what I'm saying. Exactly.

246
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,409
And what exactly do you want in return?

247
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:16,309
-What, you think l'm some cheap ho?
-Wait. This has nothing to do with sex.

248
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,310
You don't have to do anything.

249
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,345
Just pretend.

250
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,753
Pretend to be my girlfriend
for a couple of months.

251
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,689
So you think that you can
buy me for $ 1500?

252
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,356
No, no, no. Not buy you, just rent you.

253
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,329
Did l mention this has nothing
to do with sex?

254
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,969
Why would you want people
to think that l'm your girl?

255
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,473
lt would make me popular.

256
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:59,760
All right. One week.

257
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:02,725
l'm your girl for one week.

258
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,030
It has to be...

259
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,995
...a month.

260
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:11,399
-Two weeks! That's my final answer.
-Okay, two weeks. Perfect.

261
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:16,377
-And you better not even think about sex.
-Yeah, yeah. Got it, got it.

262
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,805
-And don't even look at my booty.
-Right. No booty licking.

263
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,943
l mean, looking.

264
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,887
This is a sworn secret, right?

265
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,922
You can't tell anyone about our deal.
Promise?

266
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:34,022
This is one thing I can guarantee
I will never admit to anyone.

267
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:35,821
Pinky swear?

268
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:04,989
You're not late.

269
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:07,520
My dad says all women
are 15 minutes late--

270
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,789
You know what? Zip your mouth.

271
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,563
Do you own an iron?

272
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,863
-Come here. Let me fix this.
-All right.

273
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:21,673
All right.

274
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,441
-Sorry.
-The pressure, the pressure.

275
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,117
Sorry, sorry. l'm really ready to go now.

276
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:34,885
Hold on.

277
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,580
Put this on.

278
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:39,522
Whoa! Real Sean John!

279
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,990
All right!

280
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,823
This rocks!

281
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:49,663
-Okay, Alan, let's do this.
-Actually, Alvin.

282
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:52,739
Like Al Green, because my sister
is actually named Aretha.

283
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,739
Whatever.

284
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,888
Yo, grinder, go home!

285
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:13,550
-Why is he in our hallway?
-Just be cool.

286
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:16,597
-Wrong hall, cornball.
-Come on, boy.

287
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,756
Bozo's lost again.

288
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,504
Girl, you are tripping.

289
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

290
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,137
Hey, guys. You guys know Al, right?

291
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,079
Why is Tito Jackson here?

292
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,142
Come here, girl. We gotta talk.

293
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:44,025
-Why is he rolling with you?
-Look, we're friends, all right?

294
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,626
l'm just hanging with him. Okay?

295
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:51,860
No, we're friends. Have you lost your mind?
Look at him.

296
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:55,630
He looks like a buggawuf.
lt's gonna ruin your reputation.

297
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,129
Hello? l'm the one hanging
with him, not you guys.

298
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,473
Okay, but as the old saying goes:

299
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,670
"Tell me who your friends are,
and l'll tell you who you are."

300
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:07,040
Well, as the new saying goes:

301
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:11,549
"Tell me who your friends are, Yvonne,
and l'll tell you who you wanna be."

302
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,449
-No, she didn't.
-Oh, yes, l did.

303
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,213
Hurry up.

304
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,127
Alvin, did you twist your ankle
or something?

305
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:32,597
No. l'm just walking.

306
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:42,777
Nice job sewing on that Sean John
label, buddy. Let me see that.

307
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,717
Wait a minute. ls this real?
Real Sean John?

308
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:51,484
-Where did you get this?
-Paris Morgan. She let me borrow it.

309
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,093
Give it back!

310
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,263
Paris Morgan?

311
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,894
You expect us to believe
she lent you a sweatshirt?

312
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,892
Why is that so hard to believe?

313
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,866
Because it would imply that
she would speak to you.

314
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,806
Not only did she speak to me,
we walked together. Lingered.

315
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,509
We even had small conversation.

316
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,740
Paris Morgan had this actual sweatshirt
on her actual body?

317
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,275
-Yeah.
-Let me smell it one more time.

318
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,186
Don't be that way, brother!

319
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,190
That's a nice scent.
Wait, it's on fire!

320
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,249
-Hose it down!
-Put it out!

321
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,789
-Turn the water on.
-What's going on, Mr. Johnson?

322
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,102
Okay, it's out!

323
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,873
-"Sean Jo."
-Could be Asian.

324
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,839
Sean Jo.

325
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:51,075
-Smell like burnt Paris Morgan now.
-That's how hot she is.

326
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,152
That was a good one.

327
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,185
Okay, okay. Ladies, look and learn.

328
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,753
Keep it gangster!

329
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,824
-Now, what do you call that?
-High maintenance.

330
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,731
Dang, Ted. Didn't realize
you were so talented.

331
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:13,900
Yo, Paris, you're the one who went
to the Halle Berry School for Driving.

332
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:17,106
-Yeah, how you gonna fix that?
-lt's already fixed.

333
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,711
Oh, come on, Ted.

334
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,211
When homegirl is all quiet
and humble about it...

335
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,949
...it's because her rich
and famous boo, Mr. Dru...

336
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,816
...paid for all that
to be corrected immediately.

337
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:30,756
What's he gonna think
when he finds out...

338
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:35,592
...you're volunteering for special ed,
rolling with that retard, Alvin?

339
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,030
You're the last person to be commenting
on someone's mental health, Kadeem.

340
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:42,192
He's a grinder, not a retard.

341
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,905
But on the real, Paris, he carries a pool net
around town, on a motorized scooter.

342
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,205
You know, l don't believe
l granted an interview today.

343
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,798
Hey. Hey, look.

344
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:18,004
-lt doesn't add up. lt doesn't make sense.
-He cleans her pool.

345
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,971
l wanna clean pools.
Get to hang out with Paris Morgan.

346
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,804
l'll clean the bathtub too.

347
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,007
Yo, check this out, man.

348
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,150
Losers sit over there, to the left.

349
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,146
You feel me?

350
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,982
Then l guess you'll be making a right.
That's the asshole section, Ted.

351
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:03,777
You know what?
l think l'm gonna go get some dessert.

352
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:07,319
You know, the Butterfingers
in the vending machine rock.

353
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,054
You know, y'all don't have to be so rude,
staring at him like that.

354
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,366
Why are you with him?

355
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:23,328
l'm rolling with Al
because l'm with him, okay?

356
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,967
Yeah.

357
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,305
There you are.
Come on, let's bounce.

358
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,939
There's a game tonight,
so scoop me up at 6:30?

359
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:39,951
l will be scooping you like Chunky Monkey.

360
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,553
Slide, hit six...

361
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,360
...and kick.

362
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,891
Pull. Land low.

363
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:54,025
All right. Now shake it out.

364
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,394
Shake it out. Good job, y'all.

365
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,932
-All right. Ready to have a good time?
-Give me my tape.

366
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:04,001
lt's not your tape. lt's Dad's tape.
Take your Wonderbra and get out.

367
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:07,944
And why would you need it anyway?
You know you'll never get to use it.

368
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:11,349
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what.

369
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,920
-Thank you.
-Mom? Alvin's taking drugs.

370
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:18,288
He's hallucinating.
He actually thinks he has a date tonight.

371
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,427
-Why can't he?
-With Paris Morgan?

372
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,286
The most beautiful girl at school?
Dad, you bugging.

373
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,195
-What that supposed to mean?
-Look at him.

374
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,960
Where's the iron?

375
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,938
lt's under the sink.
Are you feeling okay, honey?

376
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:35,498
Mom, l'm great.

377
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,914
See that? Drugs.

378
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,217
-Do you think maybe l should--?
-No. Look here. Let me handle this here.

379
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,257
He probably just needs a good
talking to, that's all.

380
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,461
Take it low.

381
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:02,233
-Son? Come out and talk to your father.
-Shake it out.

382
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:06,032
Shake it out. Good. Have fun with it.
Take it to the side.

383
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:10,974
Take it low. Do what you wanna do.
It's the shake-off.

384
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,918
Come on, take a seat.

385
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:24,081
Come on. Gotta get your sea legs. Might
wanna get yourself a waterbed one day.

386
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,819
There ain't a woman born
that can resist...

387
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,429
...the motion...

388
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,588
...of the ocean.

389
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:35,960
Dad, l gotta iron my clothes.

390
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,002
No, no, no.
Don't worry about that.

391
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,970
Because nothing right now can rob me...

392
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:44,076
...of this rite of passage
between the father and his son.

393
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,338
Me and you right now, it's big.

394
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,112
And kick.

395
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,386
Jump, jump.
And mambo.

396
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:58,514
Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. And punch.

397
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,086
Chop, chop.

398
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,293
This here, son...

399
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,125
...is your hope chest.

400
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:14,397
This is my legacy to you.

401
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,415
A hope chest?

402
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:36,189
They come in all different sizes
and colors.

403
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,063
Let me talk to you, son.

404
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,898
This right here, son--
Look at me, boy. Watch this here.

405
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:49,010
This is the Trojan ribbed, lubricated.
Sturdy, reliable, dependable. Like a truck.

406
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:53,910
When you don't really know what you into,
and it get a little rough for you...

407
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:56,312
...makes you downshift.

408
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,049
This one here, son....

409
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,590
This is the super-size...

410
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,320
...Magnum majestic.

411
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:10,260
The prophylactic Cadillac.

412
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,693
Oh, yeah.

413
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,124
This is when you find yourself
and you're there.

414
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:19,572
You done got so comfortable with yourself
you done built up a reputation.

415
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,568
You feel me?

416
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:24,940
And this one here, son,
be extra careful...

417
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:27,479
...because that's
Mr. Little Extra Sensitive.

418
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,583
You really don't need this,
especially on the first round.

419
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:35,416
You'll enjoy the ride too much, end up on
the curb somewhere out of commission.

420
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:38,956
You don't want that.
Save this for round three.

421
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:42,221
Because believe me,
there's gonna be a round three.

422
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,596
Look at me. Feel me.

423
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,361
All right, now, look strong. Come on, son.

424
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:50,333
Close your mouth. There you go.

425
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,234
Keep it tight. Work with it.

426
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,606
Love you, man.

427
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,477
--seven eight, and chop, chop.

428
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,444
And mambo. Lucy Liu!

429
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,643
Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. And punch.

430
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:09,614
Chop, chop. Yeah. Mambo.

431
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,187
Lucy Liu, now.
Kick him in the back, the face.

432
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,762
Punch. Chop, chop. Mambo.

433
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:22,294
Lucy Liu. Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. Step, punch.

434
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,104
Girl, you know better than that.

435
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:30,005
You better put that chicken wing
down, okay?

436
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:34,478
I see you, girl.
Five, six, seven, eight, down.

437
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,313
And wiggle.

438
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,316
And shimmy.

439
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,148
And five and six and....

440
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,130
Touch yourself, come on.

441
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:55,701
Hold me tight. Yes.

442
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,145
Oh, hell, no.

443
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,509
-Hey, fellas, how you doing?
-Hey, Mr. Johnson. What's going on?

444
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,618
Look, l got a bit of bad news for you.

445
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:16,780
lt seems like Alvin done moved.
He don't stay here no more.

446
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,220
This has ceased to be funny.

447
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,420
Hey, ain't nobody playing with you,
now.

448
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,259
Listen to me. l know you been friends
with Alvin since first grade...

449
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,062
...but Alvin dating a girl now.

450
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:30,466
He don't need to be hanging around
y'all scientific-looking ass...

451
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:32,230
...no more.

452
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,600
Stop all that, now.

453
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,505
-Y'all take it easy, okay?
-Come on, Mr. Johnson!

454
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:40,272
Get your big, wide ass off the door.

455
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,849
You gonna mess around, and l'm gonna
get my Roto-Rooter and stick it--

456
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:47,585
-Come on in!
-All right, yeah. Exactly. Let me in.

457
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,458
Alvin, your dad's funny.

458
00:36:58,366 --> 00:37:00,391
So, what's going on?

459
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,501
l'm not asking him.

460
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:11,711
Okay, look, well, we always sit together
at the games in the visitors section, and....

461
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:14,211
Well, are you going to sit with us...

462
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,579
...or in the home seats
with the popular kids?

463
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:21,744
Yeah, see, we were thinking that we'd sit
in the home section with you...

464
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,317
...so you could introduce us
to Paris Morgan.

465
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,392
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

466
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,291
-Of course you can!
-All right!

467
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:35,131
So did you and Paris, you know, do it?

468
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,296
-Do what?
-lt! lt, it, it! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

469
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:41,398
Yeah! Yeah!

470
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,566
Sorry, guys.

471
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,437
l'm not telling.

472
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:48,137
Dogpile!

473
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,286
These are for you.

474
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,583
They're Arabian roses.

475
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:35,195
Alvin, that's so sweet,
but you shouldn't have.

476
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,865
Girls see a guy being too nice...

477
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:44,965
...and it makes him seem lonely,
desperate, weak.

478
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,534
-Right, right. l should write this down.
-No.

479
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,441
Look, just be a little tougher. You know?
Make like you don't need me.

480
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,377
Like you don't need any girl.

481
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,973
Then girls will want you.

482
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,577
-Okay?
-Okay.

483
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,550
But the flowers, they're nice.

484
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,486
Look, l'll go put them in water,
and then we'll go to the game, all right?

485
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,418
You stay right there. Okay?

486
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,600
Basket!

487
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,638
Assist, Sanders!

488
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,541
-Sit down, clowns!
-Dumb-asses!

489
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:28,739
Sit down, Q-Tip!

490
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:40,891
Jackrabbits! Jackrabbits!
Jackrabbits! Jackrabbits!

491
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:48,493
-Hi, Paris!
-Hi, Paris!

492
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,398
-Hi, Paris!
-Come on.

493
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:52,562
All right, guys, that's enough.

494
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,367
She's working.
Leave her alone.

495
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:59,572
What a wankster.

496
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:10,045
And now, the Jackrabbit drill squad.

497
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,466
Left, right

498
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:32,476
-Chuck, have some couth.
-Yeah, it's just breasts and bottoms, damn!

499
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:35,974
Hey! Hey!

500
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,680
My mom bought those for me!

501
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,787
-One time! One time!
-Why are you like that?

502
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,687
You pretty.

503
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,046
She's perfect.

504
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,956
Move. Move. Move.
What are you doing, sitting in my section?

505
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,995
You hungry? Wanna offer pizza?
Let me offer some for you.

506
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,492
Home is down with your man.
Stay out of my section, all right?

507
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,965
Losers sit over there, to the left!

508
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,381
What are you, a big fake?

509
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,123
Alvin?

510
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:57,991
-Alvin!
-The deal is off.

511
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,592
Just go. Go be with your friends
while they still claim you.

512
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,138
Come down out of that tree.

513
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,937
We still have a lot of time
to pretend we're friends.

514
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,079
And unlike some people,
l keep my promises.

515
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,046
You mean, unlike Dru?

516
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,029
Are you okay? Alvin?

517
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:34,691
You know, these next two weeks,
if it's any consolation...

518
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:38,065
...are probably gonna be
the happiest memories of my life.

519
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,540
You can't be serious.

520
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:47,169
Alvin, we've had one rejection
after another.

521
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,613
Now, are those the kind of victories
you really want in life?

522
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,458
No, not really.

523
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,662
Then l say we do something about it.

524
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,471
Come on.

525
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,853
What happened to your hair?

526
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,754
Probably need to roll your pants up
just a little bit.

527
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,901
Oh, see, these is Sean John.

528
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:52,570
So l gotta get my swing on.

529
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,572
Son, what has happened to your priorities?

530
00:44:57,644 --> 00:45:01,876
Oh, no, see, it was all about
what was under the hood.

531
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:05,917
Now l'm trying to be on top
of the hood.

532
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,256
Because l'm a baller-tician...

533
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:12,989
...on a mission. Holler.

534
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,092
Urkel has gone gangster.

535
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:18,793
Probably need to go in here,
say something to this boy.

536
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,797
Here we go.

537
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:36,238
Your mother wants me to talk to you
about what's gotten into you.

538
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:44,147
But what l wanna talk about
is who you're getting into.

539
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,387
What is that, boy? What is that?

540
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:52,026
You'll need more money
if you're trying to scratch that kitty-cat.

541
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,326
Let me help you out, son.

542
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,795
Thanks, Dad.

543
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,270
Boy, been waiting a long time
for that right there. And that's not all.

544
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,973
Got it for you right here.

545
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:05,742
Yeah.

546
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:10,076
Dad, l think l still have a few left
from the boxful you gave me last night.

547
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,812
Boy, you won't use these cheap suckers
right here. These is for practice.

548
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:18,822
Come here, let me show you what
l'm talking about. Sit down right there.

549
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,794
Listen to me. You gotta be able
to know how to do this...

550
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:25,862
...with the ease of a true player.

551
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:29,835
Because nothing kill a mood quicker
than you sitting up there wrestling...

552
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:32,872
...trying to get your raincoat
on your little rascal.

553
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,408
Now, go on,
open one of them, right there.

554
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,842
Take your time.

555
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:42,042
Work with it. There.

556
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,188
Okay.

557
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,157
That was good, son.
That was real good. Two problems.

558
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,956
Number one, too slow,
girl probably asleep.

559
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,362
Second problem, you used two hands.

560
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,067
You a Johnson.
We one-hand people.

561
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:06,465
Make you look a lot smoother.

562
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:08,238
Here we go.

563
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:18,283
Little rusty, that's all.

564
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,827
Sorry about that, boy.

565
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,900
l want you to practice unrolling one.

566
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,437
No, don't worry about that.
You a Johnson.

567
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:42,372
l got you, right here.

568
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,004
Go on, slide that on there.

569
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:47,169
You practice on that right now.
l'll be right back.

570
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:53,952
Here we go, right here.

571
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:56,888
All the practicing in the world
ain't gonna do you good...

572
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,082
...if you kill too much time
and you lose the mood.

573
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,960
l'm about to give you my number one,
smooth-groove jam...

574
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:10,527
...guaranteed to set the mood
just like you need it.

575
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:14,271
Stay with me, boy. This big.

576
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:24,543
Go on, feel it.

577
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,987
Come on, now,
you're Clarence Johnson's boy.

578
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:30,216
Wet your lips.

579
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:32,551
Gotta get them wet. Go on.

580
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:36,054
You got them wet like that?
Now, there it is.

581
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:38,094
You know what?
She wants you now.

582
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:41,992
You're a Johnson man.
All you got to do is lay back...

583
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,105
...let her come on into your world.
Let her slide right on up on the kitchen.

584
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:48,797
Because you fixed to start cooking.
Oh, yeah.

585
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:52,070
Just go to work. When you hold her,
got to get her like that.

586
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:55,305
She starts sliding right on down
where you got to have it.

587
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,950
Get up under there.
lt's all good for you.

588
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:01,587
Then you make your move.
You slide around on her.

589
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:05,152
Then you're in control.
Lock on. Here we go!

590
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,987
Along for the ride, baby!

591
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:12,394
You gonna learn to scratch that kitty-cat
and you're gonna love it!

592
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:14,363
You can run but you can't hide!

593
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,570
That's why they call you Johnson!

594
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,833
ls that what you're teaching our son?

595
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:28,381
The boy going to get some.

596
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,382
The boy been working hard
trying not to go crazy.

597
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,887
Maybe you ought to just let the boy
have some fun.

598
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,531
ls that our song?

599
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:55,505
Sounds like it to me.

600
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,101
Really?

601
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,176
Watch out, now.
Let me help you with that.

602
00:50:10,657 --> 00:50:14,115
-Hold up, might need a little rope.
-Daddy, don't you do it.

603
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,216
-Paris?
-lt's her mother.

604
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:50,257
God. Get up out of my bushes!
What is your problem?

605
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:54,127
-Are you okay?
-l'm cool.

606
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,031
You were just here.
Did l forget to pay you last week?

607
00:50:57,204 --> 00:50:59,263
-No, actually--
-Hey, Mom. l'm out of here.

608
00:50:59,439 --> 00:51:00,667
Love you, see you.

609
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,672
Sorry.

610
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:05,505
These kids.

611
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:08,213
So you know all this stuff about cars.

612
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:11,714
Now, you mean, you've never thought
about getting one of your own?

613
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,520
Not to brag or anything,
but l was chosen as one of three finalists...

614
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:18,487
...in the General Motors
Young Engineers Competition.

615
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,649
lt's for a full-ride scholarship.

616
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:22,956
Dang! Look at you.

617
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,497
Here l am sweating you, player,
about not having a car...

618
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,157
...and you know how to make one.

619
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:31,467
l hope you win.

620
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:33,737
Yeah.

621
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,375
l think l definitely could have won.

622
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:42,413
You know, the design was great,
it ran awesome.

623
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,651
lt just needed a stronger,
lighter camshaft.

624
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:53,291
What, am l missing something?
How come you didn't go out and buy one?

625
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:56,155
lt cost $ 1500.

626
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,501
Are you serious?

627
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,514
There's still a chance.

628
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:21,310
And if not, hey,
l got all my life to be an engineer.

629
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,788
The last semester in high school...

630
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:27,452
...only comes around once.

631
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:38,459
l haven't really been on too many dates
in the last 16 or 17 years.

632
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:41,565
l hope l do okay.

633
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:46,533
You'll do great.

634
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:52,647
Slide over. You drive.

635
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:27,475
Nice Expo. Problem is, it's a '98.

636
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:30,485
What the hell do you know about cars?

637
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:37,860
Well...

638
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:42,499
...'98s, there's a little shortage
in the battery cable.

639
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,932
lt's nothing a rubber insulation
can't fix, though.

640
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:48,294
Pulling out a condom.

641
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,414
Go ahead, check it out.
Give it a try.

642
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:00,914
You're gonna fix my car with a rubber?

643
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:15,096
Yeah.

644
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:35,782
When you were doing your thizzle earlier,
you were off the hizzle.

645
00:54:35,987 --> 00:54:38,581
Yeah. What kind of car do you drizzle?

646
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:42,484
-Drizzle--?
-He's designing and constructing one...

647
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:43,990
...from the ground up...

648
00:54:44,395 --> 00:54:47,558
...which, as of yet, has no reference
in layman's terms.

649
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:51,033
Yeah, so basically, you don't have a car.

650
00:54:52,103 --> 00:54:55,095
Well, l never had a rich pops
to buy me anything...

651
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,975
...so l'm just a working man
trying to come up.

652
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,976
Yeah, you cool, man.

653
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:05,644
l'm not feeling this cat.

654
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:24,527
So let me tell you about the time
when l was fixing this police car...

655
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:28,603
...on the side of the highway.
She had that outfit on, the brown one--

656
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,504
-Hey, baby.
-l need to talk to you.

657
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:34,042
Now.

658
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,510
Fellas, y'all have to excuse me.

659
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:41,509
You are a genius! This is working great!
You're so brilliant.

660
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:46,656
-You look upset.
-l am.

661
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:49,750
-At what?
-While you were fronting...

662
00:55:49,927 --> 00:55:53,021
...like you're some player,
l was outside waiting for you.

663
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,631
We have a deal.

664
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,726
-We walk the hall together, remember?
-Sorry--

665
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:09,035
Look, Alvin, l think you're starting
to feel yourself a little too much.

666
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:11,545
l do not do that.
My mother said you'll go blind!

667
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:13,081
Whatever.

668
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:18,551
Look, just don't ever
keep me waiting again.

669
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:31,658
-Hey, we'll catch up with y'all.
-All right, guys.

670
00:56:31,836 --> 00:56:33,895
l can't believe this, dude....

671
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:36,766
What's the matter?
l mean, l said l was sorry.

672
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:39,465
l got caught up.
l was hanging with my friends--

673
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,908
The friends who gave you
a pepperoni facial?

674
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,910
Look, we squashed all that.

675
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,811
lt's a lot of work, Alvin.
The whole interior.

676
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:48,815
We wanted you to be there.

677
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:50,146
Okay, look.

678
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:53,490
We'll get together this weekend,
we'll work on the car.

679
00:56:53,624 --> 00:56:56,650
lt'll be like old times.
We'll have a good time.

680
00:56:56,727 --> 00:57:00,959
Great, Friday night. We'll get to work on
reupholstering the inside of the seats--

681
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:03,599
Friday, Friday....

682
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:07,101
-l can't do it. l got plans.
-Well, Saturday, then.

683
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:10,137
Saturday's not good for me either.

684
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,634
You know what?
Sunday afternoon.

685
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:14,838
Yeah. Great. Sunday.

686
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,275
Yeah.

687
00:57:20,184 --> 00:57:22,675
-Gonna introduce me?
-You met them in fourth grade, remember?

688
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:24,778
What's going on?

689
00:57:25,756 --> 00:57:27,747
What's the deal?

690
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:30,289
Life is good. You all right?

691
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,649
Hello?

692
00:58:04,028 --> 00:58:05,586
Paris?

693
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:09,122
Yo, Paris!

694
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,849
What are you doing
just walking in my house?

695
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:32,689
The door was open. My bad.

696
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:35,826
l heard you playing your guitar, though.
lt sound hot.

697
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,986
What are you even doing here?

698
00:58:40,264 --> 00:58:44,257
lt's the last day in our two-week contract.
l thought we'd hang out.

699
00:58:46,137 --> 00:58:48,071
Let me hear you play.

700
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:53,140
Come on.

701
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:57,847
Look, l'm still learning...

702
00:58:58,015 --> 00:59:03,078
...and the lyrics l wrote
don't go with my melody yet.

703
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:11,018
l'll read. You play.

704
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,630
Come on.

705
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:40,384
"And l rise.

706
00:59:41,392 --> 00:59:44,953
ln spite of my fear inside...

707
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:48,163
...caused by those who have burned me
with their lies.

708
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,191
And l rise.

709
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:09,148
And l rise."

710
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,955
Look....

711
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:23,693
Go on, get dressed.

712
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:25,433
Why?

713
01:00:26,203 --> 01:00:30,299
No more questions. Get dressed.

714
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:56,055
To my relationships that didn't work

715
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:58,929
Map of this human heart
Starts at the age of 15

716
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:01,164
When I lost my virginity
To a lady, older

717
01:01:01,372 --> 01:01:03,966
Like most boys
It was based on the lies I told her

718
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:07,507
I had so much to prove
Like I had more experience

719
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:10,175
Than she thought I knew
And though it wasn't true

720
01:01:10,347 --> 01:01:11,507
It was amazing

721
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,213
But it ended because I did
What most young boys do

722
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:17,387
Listened to the lies of a fool
Which led to this girl

723
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:19,915
Getting socked in the jaw
In the middle of school

724
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,251
Even though I didn't do it
I felt to blame

725
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:25,987
Because the girl who hit her was the cousin
Of my man who was salting my game

726
01:01:26,163 --> 01:01:28,131
Nowadays it just don't seem cool

727
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:30,290
Tell me what the hell
Am I supposed to do?

728
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:32,958
And then a wise man gave me a clue

729
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:36,336
He said
"The only way out is the way through "

730
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:40,372
You know, it's silly...

731
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:43,308
...but instead of this whole...

732
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,878
..."drill team/Dru Hilton's girl" thing...

733
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:53,320
...what l really, really always dream about
is just going somewhere.

734
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,554
Somewhere where nobody knows me.

735
01:01:57,928 --> 01:02:00,522
Just being this girl with, like,
crazy cool dreads...

736
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:05,261
...and a guitar and--
Oh, never mind, it's really dumb.

737
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:10,571
You know...

738
01:02:11,475 --> 01:02:13,136
...you could bring your guitar here.

739
01:02:15,379 --> 01:02:18,143
No, l can't.

740
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:24,811
No, you mean you won't.

741
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:44,603
This is beautiful.

742
01:02:49,413 --> 01:02:51,472
You know, Al...

743
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:57,210
...there's something
that we've been avoiding all day.

744
01:02:57,388 --> 01:03:00,186
Something that maybe we ought to do.

745
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:03,417
You know what, you're right.

746
01:03:03,627 --> 01:03:06,425
This might sound kind of silly...

747
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:10,567
...but how do we do it?

748
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:13,092
Well....

749
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:18,134
Just go for it, you know?
Just do it.

750
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:22,135
Okay.

751
01:03:28,919 --> 01:03:32,150
We'll break up first thing
tomorrow morning.

752
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:37,159
ln the hallway, so everybody can see.
l mean, make a big scene.

753
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:42,298
But a dignified scene because,
you know, we gotta protect our reps.

754
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:46,230
Did you hear what l just said?
Our reps!

755
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:50,595
Al Johnson has a rep to protect!

756
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,610
Player, player.

757
01:03:55,946 --> 01:04:00,645
Come on, girl, put a pep in your step.
We got school in the morning!

758
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:45,219
Now, those are the benefits of being raised
in a household with vinyl and 8-track.

759
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:50,128
-You know, old school for real.
-Damn, man, you got all the 411.

760
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,225
l'm talking Earth, Wind and Fire.

761
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:55,269
-"Erf," E with a F at the end of it.
-Al?

762
01:04:55,472 --> 01:04:58,339
-Here comes your girl.
-Al, l need to talk to you.

763
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:01,205
Don't you see grown men
are talking here?

764
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:07,115
Anyway, you know, as l was saying,
you know, Ohio Players--

765
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:09,308
Al, we need to talk.

766
01:05:09,486 --> 01:05:13,616
What's up with this "we, we" stuff?
This ain't French class. Ain't no "we."

767
01:05:14,158 --> 01:05:15,523
l'm a free agent now.

768
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:22,291
-That was cruel.
-Sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind.

769
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:25,759
That's how you keep a lady in check,
you know what l'm saying?

770
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:30,433
You still here?

771
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:33,439
Bounce. Giddyup.

772
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,236
Damn.

773
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:39,246
Too many fish in the sea
for her to be hounding me.

774
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:42,112
-l'm feeling this.
-l hear you, boy.

775
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,150
She gonna be back too. Watch.

776
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:47,619
Did you just see
how he just dogged Paris?

777
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:52,192
-l want a strong brother like that.
-Yep.

778
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:57,427
Look at him, standing there looking
better than a butter-leather Prada bag.

779
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:24,057
You got a lot of nerve dissing me
the way you did.

780
01:06:25,696 --> 01:06:29,291
Yeah, l know, that's why
l came by, to apologize.

781
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:31,559
But, yo, Oscar goes to you.

782
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:39,474
Hey, l just really want to say thank you
for a great couple of weeks.

783
01:06:39,643 --> 01:06:42,237
Well, l was just doing
what l said l would do.

784
01:06:42,312 --> 01:06:43,643
And it worked.

785
01:06:43,814 --> 01:06:47,807
l mean, popularity is so much better
than being treated like a social leper.

786
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:52,286
Popularity's a job, Alvin.
Not a privilege.

787
01:06:52,356 --> 01:06:54,256
lt's nothing but work and worries.

788
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:57,858
Work to get in, work to stay in.

789
01:06:58,228 --> 01:07:00,389
Get a clue.

790
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,400
You're killing them, dog.

791
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:21,882
Morning, dime pieces.

792
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:25,220
Your gear is real tight today, boo.

793
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:30,758
Appreciate it. You know,
Nike, Burberry, Gucci, Scooby-Doo.

794
01:07:31,695 --> 01:07:34,323
You're taking me to Jerry's
Friday night, right?

795
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,427
Sure. l mean...

796
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:42,570
...how could l say no
to a breezy like you?

797
01:07:42,806 --> 01:07:44,364
For real?

798
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:48,671
Real is all l am, baby.

799
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:51,781
l'll holler.

800
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:59,751
Yvonne, he just broke up with Paris
less than 24 hours ago.

801
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:02,725
You just mad l beat you to him.

802
01:08:08,932 --> 01:08:13,699
It's Yvonne.
You're all mine tomorrow night.

803
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:16,833
You know, Yolanda, my big girl,
we're gonna need the whole back seat.

804
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:23,643
Girls are gonna let us. They're gonna let us,
is what l'm saying, when they see this.

805
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:27,339
-Amazing.
-Came out all right, no thanks to you.

806
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,485
Feel the seats, Alvin.

807
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:34,880
All right. Got the Phat Farm hookup...

808
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:39,794
...shag carpet, laptop, minibar. Wow.

809
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:43,830
Wait till you see the routine
we got worked out to get in the car.

810
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,492
Here. Stand in the front.
Come on, hurry up.

811
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:48,534
Look, right there.

812
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,522
Doors.

813
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,472
You know, you guys should really
clean out the carburetor.

814
01:09:34,017 --> 01:09:38,010
Ben's got an old Holley four-barrel
at the shop. l think he'll let me get it.

815
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:41,722
-Cool.
-We're cruising tonight.

816
01:09:42,993 --> 01:09:46,588
l can get right on it. l'll go down there
right now, have it fixed.

817
01:09:47,464 --> 01:09:51,025
-l really wanna roll out with you guys.
-For real? Right on.

818
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,661
We missed you, man.

819
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:56,602
We've been checking the GM website,
hoping to see your update.

820
01:09:57,841 --> 01:09:59,934
Hey, there's plenty of time for that.

821
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:04,872
l'll meet you all at Kenneth's house at 8.
We gonna party. Go put on your good stuff.

822
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:08,546
-l don't have any good stuff.
-lt's all right.

823
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,620
Hey, yo, man. l'm digging the whip, boy.

824
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:24,330
l'm feeling it, man.

825
01:10:24,468 --> 01:10:26,060
You got the hooptie.

826
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:29,728
Look at her.

827
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:35,403
Yeah, l'm like the Renaissance man
of automobiles. You feel me?

828
01:10:35,612 --> 01:10:41,414
This here is my newest work of art.
l call this the "groupie hooptie."

829
01:10:43,954 --> 01:10:45,478
This is hot.

830
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:49,755
Put a microwave
in the glove compartment.

831
01:10:52,863 --> 01:10:55,559
Oh, no. Oh, no.

832
01:10:57,367 --> 01:11:01,360
-He's doing it.
-Get some. Quench your thirst on that.

833
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,939
He's 63 and a half minutes late.
lt's not like him.

834
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,606
Where you going in such a hurry?

835
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:50,676
-No rush.
-l get free long distance on my cell, baby.

836
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:52,377
l don't need it on a date.

837
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,853
ls your foot on the gas?

838
01:12:02,032 --> 01:12:02,999
Sorry.

839
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:04,793
Now...

840
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,569
...where were we?

841
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:11,138
You gotta relax, Al.

842
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:13,508
lt's all right.

843
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:17,806
Now, don't you worry, because
Mama's gonna take good care of you.

844
01:12:44,674 --> 01:12:46,699
-l was just e-mailing you.
-Sure you were.

845
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:51,540
No, seriously, man, l'm telling you, you will
not believe what happened to me tonight.

846
01:12:51,748 --> 01:12:53,443
Give us the keys to our car.

847
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:58,210
Okay, but l'm telling you,
it's coming out like a Penthouse letter.

848
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:05,893
Y'all know how it is when you're
butt-naked with a little cutie, right?

849
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,898
Yeah, right--

850
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:12,863
We were worried. We thought you might
be at Ben's working on our car.

851
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:16,938
-We went down there, but it was closed.
-Took an hour to get his home number.

852
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:19,231
-You talked to Ben?
-Yeah.

853
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:23,943
He says if you don't come in soon,
the camshaft's going back to Germany.

854
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,139
-Oh.
-That's right, "Oh."

855
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,147
Look. Let me explain this--

856
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:36,117
As of midnight, we're officially
excommunicating Alvin from the clubhouse.

857
01:13:36,526 --> 01:13:39,586
The clubhouse from fourth-freaking-grade?
You can't be serious.

858
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:42,664
We shall never again speak to,
nor respond to any words...

859
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:46,268
-...from the aforementioned Alvin Johnson.
-Chuck, man.

860
01:13:46,636 --> 01:13:49,730
Three, two, one.

861
01:13:49,906 --> 01:13:52,170
Walter.

862
01:13:55,545 --> 01:13:56,773
Fine, then.

863
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,813
Dude, l don't need you losers.

864
01:14:01,718 --> 01:14:03,743
Ain't my fault
you guys ain't getting no--

865
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:06,615
Boobie? All you gave him
was a little boob action?

866
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:07,949
That was all he wanted.

867
01:14:08,658 --> 01:14:11,286
-Was it good?
-l was good.

868
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:16,256
Hello. What happened to the pact that we
wouldn't date each other's ex-boyfriends?

869
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:21,194
This ain't Burger King.
You can't always have it your way.

870
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:23,964
Come on, Zoe.

871
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:28,210
Something is rotten in the hood.

872
01:14:28,578 --> 01:14:31,741
At first, l was gonna plan
a sort of blackmail angle on him.

873
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:33,940
Then, after a great deal of research...

874
01:14:34,117 --> 01:14:36,745
...l realized he has nothing of value.

875
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,223
So, here l am. l'm telling you.
He paid that girl to be his friend.

876
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:44,321
Aretha, now, your brother
would never do such a thing.

877
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:48,121
Pops, Moms, what's the deal?

878
01:14:48,331 --> 01:14:52,665
Hey, yo, no time for the victuals,
l gotta do my thug thizzle.

879
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:55,928
Gotta have the pimp juice.

880
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:57,698
l'll holler.

881
01:14:57,774 --> 01:15:02,837
Al, is there something that you want
to tell us about your engine part, son?

882
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:08,109
That engine part
that is so very important to your future.

883
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:12,779
You know what? That's a long story.
l'll put you up on game later on tonight.

884
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:14,617
Let's make a long story short.

885
01:15:14,758 --> 01:15:19,889
Did you or did you not squander
your future on some tramp girl?

886
01:15:20,764 --> 01:15:23,198
Moms...

887
01:15:24,234 --> 01:15:26,031
...nobody uses the word
"tramp" anymore.

888
01:15:26,236 --> 01:15:30,935
You know, it's more like
"chickenhead" or "hootchie."

889
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:33,968
Plus, it's my future.

890
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:36,837
And that's my ride to school.

891
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:41,313
School? Liar. Today is Senior Ditch Day.

892
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:44,880
You know what?
Little biscuithead is right.

893
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:49,152
l'm gonna go to the beach,
check out some breezies...

894
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:52,089
...put my feet in the water
and kick it with my crew.

895
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:57,358
And l could have lied to y'all,
not even told y'all, but y'all my folks.

896
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:01,300
And l ain't got nothing but love for you.
Let me get that.

897
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:08,633
-Peace out.
-l told you so. l told you so. l told you so.

898
01:16:08,812 --> 01:16:13,078
The money he had for the engine,
that's what he used to pay that girl.

899
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:18,386
Well, then that's gonna have to end
right now.

900
01:16:19,322 --> 01:16:21,153
Go on, get your purse.

901
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,860
Yo, what's up, Al?

902
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,090
Hi, Alvin.

903
01:16:38,975 --> 01:16:40,840
Wait.

904
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,205
Let me do that for you.

905
01:16:49,385 --> 01:16:51,182
Good looking out.

906
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:54,846
Why are these B's following us?

907
01:16:55,325 --> 01:16:58,419
Us? Why? We ain't on no date right now.

908
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:03,292
Don't be mad.
l can't bring sand to the beach.

909
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,833
Damn, man.
These shorties is really sweating you.

910
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:09,300
Like gym socks.

911
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,937
-Man, you doing it, baby.
-Yo, pimp, pimp, hooray.

912
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:17,980
l ain't mad at you.

913
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:21,708
Hey, Kadeem. l need to rap with Al.

914
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,292
Handle that.

915
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:37,291
So, what's up, shorty?

916
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:39,367
Shorty, huh?

917
01:17:41,137 --> 01:17:44,265
Look, l was thinking maybe
we should still hang out sometime.

918
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,431
As friends.

919
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:48,401
You're a great listener.

920
01:17:52,549 --> 01:17:56,986
So l guess your boy Anthony's neck didn't
taste as good as you made it look?

921
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,010
Please. He's old and tired.

922
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:02,453
Yeah. And now since l'm the coolest
thing since shoestrings...

923
01:18:03,393 --> 01:18:04,360
...you trying to get laced, right?

924
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:05,858
Al.

925
01:18:06,062 --> 01:18:09,498
lf l'd known you was for sale,
l would've bought you sooner.

926
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:14,065
Now, you need to slow your roll.

927
01:18:14,137 --> 01:18:17,300
How dare you stand in my face
popping that noise? Are you crazy?

928
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:21,240
Look, l made you "Al."

929
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:26,880
l will work overtime to break you, Alvin.
You got that?

930
01:18:29,586 --> 01:18:31,554
You can't break a real man, baby.

931
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:35,420
l'm waiting for you.

932
01:18:38,294 --> 01:18:41,957
You gonna have to excuse me.
l'm all booked up.

933
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:44,192
-Auditioning prom dates.
-Yeah.

934
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,095
Now, there's a real catch.
She's given more rides than Greyhound.

935
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:52,273
Yeah, but l bet you it won't cost me
$ 1500 for a ticket.

936
01:18:57,347 --> 01:19:00,407
Yeah. You don't have nothing
to say now, do you?

937
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:03,545
Whatever.

938
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:05,552
You don't need her no more, boo.

939
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:09,219
-Yeah. That's what l'm talking about.
-Come on, let's dance.

940
01:19:09,592 --> 01:19:11,355
Dance?

941
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:08,134
Do you really care about me?

942
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:10,042
Of course l do, girl.

943
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:12,181
Well, prove it.

944
01:21:14,617 --> 01:21:17,381
l always used to watch you. Yeah.

945
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,350
And you....

946
01:21:19,989 --> 01:21:22,981
You inspired me...

947
01:21:23,126 --> 01:21:24,718
-...to write you a song.
-Really?

948
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:27,425
Yeah. Yeah. lt goes like this.

949
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:32,599
Olivia, me and you
We will rise

950
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,331
Despite our fears inside

951
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:39,231
Rumor has it today's Senior Ditch Day.

952
01:21:42,278 --> 01:21:43,438
Dru Hilton.

953
01:21:44,614 --> 01:21:46,309
What's the deal, baby?
What brings you out here?

954
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:49,212
Came to see Paris, man.
Where she at? Where she at?

955
01:21:49,385 --> 01:21:50,716
Yo. Thirty points last game?

956
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:54,482
l'm balling, baby. What you know?
What you know?

957
01:21:54,724 --> 01:21:58,353
What's up? What's going on, dog,
you know what l'm saying?

958
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:01,595
Dru.

959
01:22:03,299 --> 01:22:06,325
lt's been a while.
l wasn't expecting you in town so soon.

960
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:10,370
You know, team got in a day early,
so l thought l'd surprise you.

961
01:22:11,707 --> 01:22:17,509
What do you say you and l
get out of here, just the two of us?

962
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:22,210
You give me a chance to apologize.

963
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:23,679
All right.

964
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:25,520
Let me get my things.

965
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:32,219
Damn, brother. lt's that easy, huh?

966
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:36,129
Hey, hey, hey. Look, what goes
on the road, stays on the road.

967
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:47,040
Besides, this girl, she's my first love. She
can't even picture being with anybody else.

968
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:50,670
Yo, one of you fools
been trying to get with Paris?

969
01:22:51,347 --> 01:22:55,443
-Which one of you? Which one of you?
-Yo, chill, Dru, all right? lt wasn't me.

970
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:57,711
She was Al Johnson's girl. Not mine.

971
01:22:58,087 --> 01:23:00,715
-Who?
-Al Johnson, man.

972
01:23:01,724 --> 01:23:04,693
See, the only Al Johnson l know
is Alvin Johnson.

973
01:23:05,695 --> 01:23:07,663
Yeah, he getting shorties now.

974
01:23:07,864 --> 01:23:09,661
Aquaman.

975
01:23:09,866 --> 01:23:11,390
All right.

976
01:23:13,502 --> 01:23:15,527
What's wrong?

977
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:17,402
Why you looking at me like that?

978
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:19,833
l hear you got yourself a new man.

979
01:23:22,712 --> 01:23:24,805
-Really, it's not--
-Whatever. Whatever.

980
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:28,410
l didn't come back here
for you to lie in my face.

981
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:29,846
We're done.

982
01:23:30,753 --> 01:23:32,744
-No. No, look. Wait.
-Get off me. Get off me!

983
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:37,286
l swear. Look, l haven't moved on, Dru!

984
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:49,629
-Alvin!
-Yo, Paris, where you going?

985
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:55,374
Al, get out there. l need you
to go tell Dru about our deal.

986
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:57,671
l'm kind of in the middle of something--

987
01:23:57,847 --> 01:24:02,341
Alvin, Dru is about to leave.
Please, just go tell him the truth.

988
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:06,146
The truth is that we were dating,
l got over you, and that was that.

989
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:08,450
-Al! Dru is--
-Paris, stop it.

990
01:24:08,624 --> 01:24:10,854
You're making a fool of yourself.

991
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,426
Oh, so you won't tell Dru the truth...

992
01:24:20,636 --> 01:24:26,666
...because you're afraid that they'll find out
that you paid me to be your friend?

993
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:31,337
Well, guess what. They just found out.

994
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:35,145
He just wanted to be popular.

995
01:24:35,318 --> 01:24:39,618
So he spent 1500 bucks on me
to hang out with him for two weeks.

996
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:43,519
That's the truth.

997
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:49,762
Well, technically,
the money was spent on the car.

998
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:52,434
Olivia. What about our song?

999
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:55,365
We will rise
Despite those who burning us

1000
01:24:55,538 --> 01:24:58,598
-She burning us with the lie--
-Shut up.

1001
01:24:59,342 --> 01:25:00,741
Didn't have to push me.

1002
01:25:00,943 --> 01:25:05,312
That's my song! l wrote those words.

1003
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:16,382
Yeah, what's that old saying?

1004
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:20,293
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"?
Can l get an amen?

1005
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,364
A hallelujah?

1006
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:26,960
l was just trying to quote,
you know, an old philosopher.

1007
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:31,966
l think it was Pimping Ken
or Aristotle or Chris Rock.

1008
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:35,538
Serves him right.
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1009
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:37,679
Hey, y'all, wait up. Anthony. Ted.

1010
01:25:40,483 --> 01:25:43,213
Ted. Anthony.

1011
01:26:05,608 --> 01:26:07,974
Maybe l should just try
and look past all of this.

1012
01:26:08,878 --> 01:26:11,403
Girl, you know Dru loves you.
He'll take you back.

1013
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,605
No, l mean....

1014
01:26:16,052 --> 01:26:18,748
You know what l've been thinking, Zoe?

1015
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:27,354
After graduation, l was thinking
of moving to San Francisco.

1016
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:33,835
You know, take singing lessons. l mean,
l've been learning how to play guitar, girl.

1017
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:35,893
Oh, get real, girl.

1018
01:26:36,072 --> 01:26:39,735
You're never gonna be
Alicia Keys or Norah Jones.

1019
01:26:39,942 --> 01:26:43,434
You're gonna be the wife of an NBA star.

1020
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:46,379
Life doesn't get any better than that.

1021
01:26:46,882 --> 01:26:50,579
Hello? Paris?

1022
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:52,748
Paris?

1023
01:27:32,862 --> 01:27:34,762
l need to talk to you, son.

1024
01:27:40,536 --> 01:27:43,061
Dad, l got all the condoms l could use.

1025
01:27:43,772 --> 01:27:46,104
Probably won't be needing any
in the near future.

1026
01:27:46,976 --> 01:27:48,443
Well, look. Why don't you get up, son...

1027
01:27:48,644 --> 01:27:51,636
...because your future is what l'm here
to talk to you about.

1028
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:59,550
That's right. l got your camshaft.

1029
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:03,888
Now, you probably gonna have
to work like hell to pay this thing off...

1030
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:07,859
...but l don't want you to worry about that
till you finish that engine up.

1031
01:28:08,397 --> 01:28:10,592
lt's probably too late.

1032
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:14,702
And l have to rebuild the engine
to the new camshaft...

1033
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,100
...then retest it.

1034
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:19,573
lt's a lot of work.

1035
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:24,577
Okay, then get off your ass
and handle your business.

1036
01:28:26,882 --> 01:28:29,578
Look, Alvin. Look, man.

1037
01:28:29,752 --> 01:28:34,849
When l was in school, l was one
of the coolest dudes at the school.

1038
01:28:35,057 --> 01:28:39,687
l was something else, man.
l had the whole game working.

1039
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:43,423
And l guess l kind
of just always wanted you...

1040
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:47,627
...to have that same kind
of fun that l did.

1041
01:28:52,808 --> 01:28:55,140
But you know why that was?

1042
01:28:55,778 --> 01:28:57,973
See, it was because, see...

1043
01:28:58,914 --> 01:29:00,905
...l didn't have your brains.

1044
01:29:03,052 --> 01:29:05,043
l didn't have your potential.

1045
01:29:05,688 --> 01:29:07,519
None of that, man.

1046
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:09,951
But you....

1047
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:13,026
From day one, me and your mama...

1048
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:17,791
...we always knew, man, that you was just
gonna achieve some great things for us.

1049
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:22,568
l don't know, l guess maybe l was...

1050
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:26,105
...maybe a little jealous or something.
l don't know.

1051
01:29:26,475 --> 01:29:28,705
But l'm gonna tell you something, though.

1052
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:35,815
l have always...

1053
01:29:35,985 --> 01:29:39,079
...always been proud of you, son.

1054
01:29:46,962 --> 01:29:49,863
l been damn proud of you, man.

1055
01:30:42,551 --> 01:30:44,746
Look who's awake.

1056
01:30:44,887 --> 01:30:46,787
You finished it.

1057
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:49,689
Congratulations, it looks good.

1058
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,219
Yeah, thanks. Hey, guys, look--

1059
01:30:54,063 --> 01:30:54,859
Man, save your breath.

1060
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:58,926
Look, come on, guys. Don't go. l was--

1061
01:30:59,134 --> 01:31:02,934
-What's the matter with the Galaxie?
-lt's none of your concern.

1062
01:31:36,905 --> 01:31:40,966
The scholarship committee's probably gonna
want to look at this engine next week.

1063
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:45,204
Other than that, y'all needed an engine.

1064
01:32:00,095 --> 01:32:02,893
Set the screen! Set the screen!

1065
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:06,897
There it is. There it is.

1066
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:11,104
Thirty seconds remaining in the half.

1067
01:32:16,812 --> 01:32:19,337
Get back, get back.
Come on, Ted. Come on, Ted.

1068
01:32:24,987 --> 01:32:28,150
-Basket by number 32.
-Hey, that was your man.

1069
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:30,154
You got to call a switch.

1070
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,292
See, this is the reason why we're losing.

1071
01:32:34,663 --> 01:32:36,221
Because we're infected with losers.

1072
01:32:36,432 --> 01:32:38,923
Stay focused on the game, man.
Forget them.

1073
01:32:39,134 --> 01:32:40,362
Oh, man.

1074
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:45,363
Attention, losers,
get out of my good-luck seats now!

1075
01:32:46,175 --> 01:32:47,972
No, we're gonna sit where we want.

1076
01:32:48,143 --> 01:32:50,134
Oh, you think it's a game, huh?

1077
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:52,747
Get up or get beat down.

1078
01:32:52,948 --> 01:32:56,884
Yo, Ted, let's go, man. Let's go
to the locker room. We're running plays.

1079
01:32:57,052 --> 01:32:58,314
Move now.

1080
01:33:01,323 --> 01:33:03,382
You wanna beat somebody up,
huh, tough guy?

1081
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:06,022
He just asked for an ass-whupping.

1082
01:33:06,094 --> 01:33:07,789
l've been waiting for this.

1083
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:10,295
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Ted.

1084
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:12,934
l'll beat you like you stole something.

1085
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:15,001
Go ahead.

1086
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,229
Start beating.

1087
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,272
Can't beat me no worse
than l been beating myself...

1088
01:33:20,476 --> 01:33:22,876
...for wanting to be friends with you.

1089
01:33:23,846 --> 01:33:26,076
All this time,
l was just fronting to be cool.

1090
01:33:27,716 --> 01:33:30,947
Because l didn't have the balls enough
to be myself.

1091
01:33:32,187 --> 01:33:34,951
So instead,
l started dissing my real friends.

1092
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:38,149
But, hey, this is who l am.

1093
01:33:38,227 --> 01:33:41,253
Alvin Johnson. Pool boy.

1094
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:49,937
l like blended mocha lattes,
with a little foam on the top.

1095
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:54,007
l like Michael Jackson's Bad album.

1096
01:33:58,413 --> 01:34:00,142
This is me.

1097
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:03,284
And l ain't afraid to admit it.

1098
01:34:05,087 --> 01:34:06,952
So go ahead, Ted.

1099
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:08,914
Do it.

1100
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:11,254
Hit me.

1101
01:34:11,894 --> 01:34:13,452
And l'm gonna show you who's bad.

1102
01:34:14,496 --> 01:34:16,327
-Ted, what you gonna do?
-Yeah, Ted.

1103
01:34:17,266 --> 01:34:18,927
Who's bad?

1104
01:34:19,101 --> 01:34:21,092
You are a freak!

1105
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:26,299
Yeah.

1106
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:28,400
-Take your boy.
-Chill, we got him.

1107
01:34:28,777 --> 01:34:31,143
Yeah, you chill. You chill.

1108
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:34,099
All right.

1109
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:37,775
Alvin.

1110
01:35:38,547 --> 01:35:41,015
Alvin, stop.

1111
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:44,109
Hey. Hey, baby.

1112
01:35:44,386 --> 01:35:48,550
l've been thinking. l'm gonna give you
one more chance to apologize.

1113
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,426
l have other dreams.

1114
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:56,427
Other dreams? l'm your meal ticket.

1115
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:58,259
Pool boy, right? You bugging.

1116
01:35:58,467 --> 01:36:00,332
Alvin, stop.

1117
01:36:01,003 --> 01:36:03,369
-Alvin, l know. l know what you're thinking.
-No.

1118
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:06,473
-You think you know.
-No. l know.

1119
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:10,337
You're all mad at yourself
and feeling like some kind of fool...

1120
01:36:10,512 --> 01:36:14,846
...because you've been fronting
about who you are for two weeks?

1121
01:36:15,017 --> 01:36:17,349
l been fronting about who l am,
who l wanna be...

1122
01:36:17,519 --> 01:36:19,953
...for as long as l can even remember.

1123
01:36:20,122 --> 01:36:22,352
And on the real, l'm tired--

1124
01:41:06,808 --> 01:41:07,775
