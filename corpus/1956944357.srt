1
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,486
ENOUGH ALREADY!

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,529
I'VE HEARD JASON PRIESTLEY

3
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,056
ONLY CARES ABOUT
ONE THING... VOLUME.

4
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,091
IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER.

5
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,334
I'M SURE HE'S DATING
JENNIE GARTH

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,693
OR SHANNON DOHERTY.

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,461
STAR MAGAZINE
SAID HE WAS SINGLE!

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,497
MY MOM READS STAR.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,066
YOU WANT REAL NEWS,
WATCH HARD COPY.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,467
EVERYBODY KNOWS

11
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,203
ACTORS TOTALLY
HOOK UP WITH EACH OTHER

12
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,470
WHEN THEY'RE ON THESE SHOWS.

13
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,738
MM-MM. NOT TORI SPELLING.

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,340
APPARENTLY, SHE'S A VIRGIN.

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,409
SHYEAH! ONLY ON THE SHOW.

16
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,115
HI, TORI.

17
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,383
WE LOVE YOU ON 90210.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,503
IS THIS ON? SO IT IS.

19
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,372
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,
FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,644
TO CELEBRATE THE MASSIVE SUCCESS
OF BEVERLY HILLS 90210!

21
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,117
NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING UP

22
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,652
THE MEN
WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE...

23
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,655
MR. AARON SPELLING
AND MR. DARREN STAR.

24
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,725
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE!

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,228
THIS IS THE MAN OF THE HOUR!

26
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,678
THANK YOU, LARRY.

27
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,812
TRUTH BE TOLD,

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,681
I NEVER THOUGHT
A SHOW ABOUT TEENAGERS

29
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,549
WAS GOING TO WORK.

30
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,518
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM AS PLAUSIBLE

31
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,688
AS A CRIME-FIGHTING TEAM
COMPRISED OF ONLY HOT WOMEN.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,692
BUT IT NOT ONLY WORKED,

33
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,629
OUR SECOND YEAR HAS BEEN
EVEN BIGGER THAN OUR FIRST!

34
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,635
AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

35
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,438
THE MAN WHO DESERVES
THE MOST CREDIT.

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,872
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

37
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,842
THE CREATOR
OF BEVERLY HILLS 90210,

38
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,578
MR. DARREN STAR.

39
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,624
WOW!

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,326
BEFORE I GET STARTED,

41
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,761
I WANT TO THANK THE PERSON

42
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,497
WHO HAS TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
I KNOW ABOUT TELEVISION...

43
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,333
MY PRODUCER,

44
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,601
MY MENTOR,

45
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,869
MY FRIEND...

46
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,939
AARON SPELLING, THANK YOU.

47
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,343
THANK YOU.

48
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,245
YOU DID IT ALL, KID.

49
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,333
LARRY'S BEEN
STALKING ME ALL NIGHT.

50
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,801
I DON'T BLAME HIM!

51
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,636
90210 IS HOT.

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,680
OF COURSE, HE WANTS A SPIN-OFF.

53
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,906
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
JUST DO A COLLEGE VERSION.

54
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,907
I'VE BEEN THINKING

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,310
IT SHOULD BE MORE
LIKE ST. ELMO'S FIRE.

56
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,779
YOU MEAN THAT MOVIE WITH
ALL THE BRAT PACKERS?

57
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,681
YEAH, "LIFE AFTER COLLEGE,"

58
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,416
WHEN EVERYTHING'S
STARTING TO HAPPEN.

59
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,419
20-SOMETHINGS TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE,

60
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,254
WHAT THEY WANT FROM LIFE.

61
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,398
I WANT A GROUP OF CHARACTERS

62
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,391
FROM TOTALLY DIFFERENT
BACKGROUNDS.

63
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:47,261
FIRST, WE'LL START WITH
A MOTORCYCLE-RIDING BAD-BOY

64
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,896
FROM THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE TRACKS...

65
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,936
LIKE A HELL'S ANGEL?

66
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,738
NO, UH...

67
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,674
A "JAMES DEAN" TYPE,
LIKE DYLAN, BUT OLDER.

68
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,310
YOU KNOW? COOL OUTSIDER.

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,483
MUCH BETTER.

70
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:12,553
AND AN ALL-AMERICAN,
GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TYPE...

71
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,827
SOUNDS BORING.

72
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,894
WELL...

73
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,297
WHAT ABOUT
AN INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS

74
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,433
ALL-AMERICAN,
GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TYPE?

75
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,672
NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'.

76
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,374
AND A STRUGGLING WRITER

77
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,309
DESPERATE TO EXPERIENCE LIFE

78
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,578
JUST SO HE HAS SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT.

79
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,888
BUT HE'S NOT
YOUR TYPICAL WRITER...

80
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,714
HE'S ATHLETIC, HAS A SIX-PACK,

81
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:41,849
GOES OUTSIDE OCCASIONALLY.

82
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,050
NO OFFENSE.

83
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,085
THE MAGIC OF TELEVISION.

84
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,064
OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE
AN ATTRACTIVE CAST,

85
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,857
JUST LIKE WE DO ON 90210...

86
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,659
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE

87
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,370
IS THAT THESE CHARACTERS
ARE OUT ON THEIR OWN,

88
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,762
SOME FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

89
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,531
THERE'S NO FAMILY
TO CATCH THEM WHEN THEY FALL,

90
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,899
THEY ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.

91
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,535
ONE OF OUR CHARACTERS
IS AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR.

92
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,471
SHE'S FUN, SHE'S FRIENDLY,

93
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,944
SHE'S ALWAYS
IN EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS.

94
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,774
WE'RE THINKING OF CASTING
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

95
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,741
FOR THAT ROLE.

96
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:08,776
AND HER BEST FRIEND,

97
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,877
A SOCIAL WORKER,

98
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,012
WHO'S A LITTLE TOO NICE
FOR HIS OWN GOOD

99
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,747
AND HAPPENS TO BE GAY.

100
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,484
"GAY" AS IN HOMOSEXUAL?

101
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,918
NO, GAY AS IN "HAPPY-GO-LUCKY."

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,019
YES! HOMOSEXUAL!

103
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,455
THAT COULD BE RISKY.

104
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,491
WHEN THIRTYSOMETHING
SHOWED TWO GAY GUYS IN BED,

105
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,759
ABC LOST A MILLION
DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING,

106
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,895
AND THEY WEREN'T
EVEN TOUCHING, AARON.

107
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,763
COME ON, LARRY!
TIMES ARE CHANGING!

108
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,064
20 YEARS FROM NOW,

109
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,009
BEING GAY IS GOING TO BE
LIKE OWNING A STATION WAGON.

110
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,768
LET'S JUMP ON IT

111
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,605
WHILE IT'S STILL
"NOW" AND "EDGY."

112
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,773
HMM.

113
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,775
OKAY, SO WE'VE FINALLY
LOCKED "JAKE"...

114
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,646
AFTER READING WHAT FELT LIKE
A THOUSAND ACTORS.

115
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,548
AND FOR "ALISON"
WE HAVE IT NARROWED DOWN

116
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,782
TO COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH

117
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:49,783
AND COURTNEY COX,

118
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,519
WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER
FROM FAMILY TIES...

119
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,596
DON'T FORGET
"DANCING IN THE DARK"

120
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,554
WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.

121
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,955
LIKE I COULD FORGET?

122
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,557
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE "BILLY" CHARACTER?

123
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,392
WE HAD
A LOT OF GOOD AUDITIONS...

124
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,528
JASON BATEMAN, PAUL RUDD,

125
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,096
STEPHEN DALE, MATTHEW PERRY.

126
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,399
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK,

127
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,501
AND MY GUT SAYS...

128
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,602
WE GO WITH DALE.

129
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,670
ME TOO!

130
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,838
HE'S CANADIAN,

131
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,973
NOT REALLY KNOWN HERE,

132
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,543
BUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
A FRESH FACE.

133
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,779
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HE'S IN GREAT SHAPE,

134
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,081
WHICH, JUDGING BY THE SCRIPT,
HE'S GOING TO NEED.

135
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,951
GRANT SHOW IS "JAKE"...
OUR SENSITIVE BAD-BOY,

136
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,720
WHO, AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALREADY
INTRODUCED ON 90210...

137
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,489
WE'LL HAVE KELLY FALL FOR HIM.

138
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,090
IT'LL SET UP THE NEW WORLD,

139
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,559
AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE IDEA

140
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,927
OF A YOUNG GIRL
WITH AN OLDER MAN?

141
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,131
ON TELEVISION, OF COURSE.

142
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,967
VANESSA WILLIAMS

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,702
IS GOING TO PLAY
OUR AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR.

144
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,970
SHE'S A GREAT FIND.

145
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,705
AMAZING ENERGY.

146
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,007
HAVING HER IS GOING TO HELP
EXPAND OUR AUDIENCE.

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,009
THAT IS NOT VANESSA WILLIAMS.

148
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,954
YOU'RE THINKING OF
"MISS AMERICA" VANESSA WILLIAMS,

149
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:51,879
SHE'S A SINGER.

150
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,115
THIS IS VANESSA A. WILLIAMS,
THE ACTRESS.

151
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,160
HUH. SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD
BE "MISS AMERICA," TOO.

152
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,318
I AGREE!

153
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,821
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAST
WE'VE EVER PUT TOGETHER.

154
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,690
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT 'EM
TO ACT OR BREED.

155
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:03,757
OR BOTH.

156
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,858
WHOO-HOO!

157
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,596
COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH
WILL BE "ALISON,"

158
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,863
A GIRL FROM THE MID-WEST

159
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,865
DETERMINED TO MAKE IT
AS A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE.

160
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,933
AND SHE'LL ENCOUNTER

161
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,469
ALL THE TEMPTATIONS
OF THE BIG CITY.

162
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,737
DOUG SAVANT PLAYS "MATT,"

163
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,905
THE SOCIAL WORKER.

164
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,906
IS HE STILL GAY?

165
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,041
HE IS STILL GAY.

166
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,010
- I DON'T KNOW...
- WELL, WE COULD...

167
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,579
...MAKE HIM
A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER?

168
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,815
WHO IS STILL GAY.

169
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,517
NOT SURE THAT'S ANY BETTER.

170
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,450
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT...

171
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,486
IT'S GOOD TO COURT
A LITTLE CONTROVERSY.

172
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,754
WHO'S NEXT, DARREN?

173
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,888
NEXT UP IS STEPHEN DALE.

174
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,023
HE PLAYS BILLY,

175
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,825
THE ONE WHO DREAMS
OF BEING A WRITER.

176
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,193
HE'S GOT A STOMACH
LIKE A WASHBOARD.

177
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,496
AND THEN THERE'S
THE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS

178
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,232
AMY LOCANE PLAYING SANDY...
THE SOUTHERN GIRL

179
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,067
WHO WANTS TO BE A MOVIE-STAR

180
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,503
AND WILL DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

181
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,674
WE FOUND A TERRIFIC
NEW YORK THEATER ACTOR

182
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,009
BY THE NAME OF THOMAS CALABRO,
HE PLAYS "MICHAEL,"

183
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,912
THE E.R. DOCTOR WHO ALSO
MANAGES THE APARTMENT COMPLEX.

184
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,082
AND FINALLY, THERE'S
THE RED-HOT JOSIE BISSETT,

185
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,051
PLAYING HIS WIFE.

186
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,819
ONLY 22 YEARS OLD,

187
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,656
YET EVERY SHOW ON TELEVISION
WANTED JOSIE THIS YEAR,

188
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,691
BUT WE GOT HER.

189
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,660
SO, LARRY?

190
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,928
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

191
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,232
WHAT DO I THINK?

192
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,981
TO BE HONEST, AARON,

193
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,249
I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT
YOURSELF A GREEN LIGHT.

194
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,719
CONGRATULATIONS.

195
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,121
YOU'RE A GREAT EXECUTIVE, LARRY!

196
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,189
OH, I AM TODAY.

197
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,824
- THANKS, LARRY.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

198
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,958
GREAT STUFF.

199
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,927
WE DID IT.

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,563
I'VE BEEN SO EXCITED,

201
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,740
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP.

202
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,800
I KNOW A FEW YOGA POSES

203
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,877
THAT COULD
REALLY HELP WITH THAT.

204
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,035
SLEEP IS OVERRATED.

205
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,112
THAT'S SOMETHING
JOHNNY TAUGHT ME.

206
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,270
- JOHNNY?
- JOHNNY DEPP.

207
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,206
I WAS IN CRY-BABY WITH HIM.

208
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,109
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

209
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,777
YOU HAVE TO TELL US EVERYTHING.

210
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,245
IS HE NICE? IS HE FUNNY?

211
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,581
WAIT. IS HE STILL
DATING WINONA RYDER?

212
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,649
DID YOU GET TO KISS HIM?

213
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,750
DIDN'T YOU SEE THE MOVIE?

214
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,585
HE TEACHES HER
HOW TO FRENCH KISS!

215
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,587
THEN THEY RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,

216
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,788
THERE'S THIS CHICKEN RACE...

217
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,256
AND A LOT MORE
HAPPENED OFF-CAMERA,

218
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,125
LET ME TELL YOU.

219
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,227
SO, THE FIRST STORY
IS ABOUT AN ACTING COACH...

220
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,094
I DON'T KNOW,

221
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,863
IT'S DEFINITELY
SUNNIER THAN CANADA,

222
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,864
BUT I FEEL LIKE, EVENTUALLY,

223
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,265
I'M GONNA MISS HAVING SEASONS.

224
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,000
OH, NO. WE HAVE SEASONS.

225
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,136
SMOG SEASON, RIOT SEASON,
EARTHQUAKE SEASON.

226
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,138
YOU CAN USE A POOL FOR
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM.

227
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,006
SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A POOL!

228
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,742
NO, WE HAVE A POOL

229
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,152
BECAUSE IT'S AN EXCUSE
TO GET THE CAST

230
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,778
IN BATHING SUITS AND BIKINIS.

231
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,046
HOPEFULLY, JUST YOU GIRLS.

232
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,881
I AM NOT WEARING
A GRAPE-SNUGGLER.

233
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,017
I JUST THINK, TV...
WHO CAN'T DO THAT?

234
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,319
YOU GET A MILLION TAKES,
AND IF IT STILL STINKS,

235
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,888
THEY JUST FIX IT IN EDITING.

236
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,623
THEATER ACTING, THOUGH...

237
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:50,891
THAT'S THE REAL THING.

238
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,259
I GUESS.

239
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,302
BUT WHO EVEN GOES
TO THE THEATER ANYWAYS?

240
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,696
OLD, RICH PEOPLE AND TOURISTS.

241
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,164
YOU KNOW WHO WATCHES TV?

242
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,365
HOT BABES.

243
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,033
AW, HEY, IT'S ALL
JUST GETTING PAID

244
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,334
TO PRETEND, RIGHT?

245
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,936
WE'RE LUCKY TO BE HERE.

246
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,838
YEAH, YOU GOTTA PAY THE BILLS,
I GUESS.

247
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,373
I COULD THINK OF
WORSE WAYS TO DO IT.

248
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,875
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

249
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,377
I BET DELIVERING PIZZAS
WOULD BE WORSE.

250
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,212
I USED TO DELIVER PIZZAS.

251
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,181
OH. THAT'S GOOD.

252
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,649
I-I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.

253
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,085
PROBABLY BEATS
WORKING CONSTRUCTION, RIGHT?

254
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,653
I USED TO WORK CONSTRUCTION.

255
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,889
OKAY! UH...

256
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,323
WELL...

257
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,092
JUST MESSING WITH YOU, MAN.

258
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,928
OH, HO. FUNNY. FUNNY.

259
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,163
I'M GONNA GET YOU. HILARIOUS.

260
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,699
OH...

261
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,670
OKAY, STEPHEN?

262
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,238
YOU'RE GONNA COME
OUT OF THE BEDROOM

263
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,740
AND HIT YOUR MARK HALFWAY DOWN.

264
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,773
GOT IT.

265
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,312
PICTURE'S UP.

266
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,947
AND ROLL SOUND.

267
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
SOUND SPEED.

268
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,083
AND...

269
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,252
ACTION.

270
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,241
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND

271
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,843
WITH "JIGGLE TV."

272
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,977
WHAT HAPPENED?

273
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,245
HE WENT BACK TO CANADA

274
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,113
FOR TWO MONTHS TO VISIT FAMILY.

275
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,415
APPARENTLY, HE ATE THEM.

276
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,393
WELL, HE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR HIM TO LOSE THE WEIGHT.

277
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,252
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIRE HIM.

278
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,253
MM-HMM.

279
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,722
ME?

280
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,158
THE KEY IS TO DO IT IN A WAY

281
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,126
TO MAKE 'EM STILL LOVE YOU,

282
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,294
BECAUSE, IN THIS BUSINESS,

283
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,897
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE
PEOPLE ARE GONNA END UP.

284
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,131
FIRE 'EM THIS YEAR,

285
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,332
THEY'RE A STAR THE NEXT.

286
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,401
ALWAYS PRESERVE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

287
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,038
LARRY, WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THE BUDGET.

288
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,273
WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED AS IT IS...

289
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,743
HI. HI, STEPHEN, IT'S... IT'S...

290
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,279
OH.

291
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,814
FORGET IT.

292
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,487
HELLO?

293
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,355
HI, STEPHEN. IT'S DARREN STAR.

294
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,024
OH, HEY, DARREN, HOW'S IT GOING?

295
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,158
I JUST GOTTA SAY,

296
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,160
I HAD THE BEST TIME
ON SET YESTERDAY.

297
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,029
I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR THIS SHOW.

298
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,764
STEPHEN...

299
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,866
WE... ACTUALLY, WE NEED TO TALK.

300
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,302
I, UM...

301
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,337
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

302
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,213
DADDY, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

303
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,315
FIRED AFTER TWO DAYS?

304
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,783
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

305
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,352
UNFORTUNATELY, TORI,
HE LEFT US WITH NO CHOICE,

306
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,486
AND NOW WE'RE STUCK

307
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,322
WITH FINDING A REPLACEMENT
FOR MONDAY.

308
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,456
THIS MONDAY?

309
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,791
YES.

310
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,192
AND ALL OUR RUNNER-UPS
ON THAT ROLE

311
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,369
HAVE BEEN CAST ON OTHER SHOWS.

312
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,329
WE'RE IN A REAL BIND.

313
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,497
BUT YOU ALWAYS SAID
THERE'S TONS OF

314
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,033
HOT ACTORS IN THIS TOWN.

315
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,068
I BET I COULD EVEN FIND
A DOZEN AT THE MALL TODAY.

316
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,136
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT

317
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,104
ABOUT THE BRANDON
AND BRENDA ROLES

318
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,205
ON YOUR SHOW, SWEETHEART.

319
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,249
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT AGAIN.

320
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,942
WHO DO YOU LIKE HERE?

321
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,844
HMM...

322
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,379
WHAT ABOUT...

323
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,481
THIS GUY... ANDREW SHUE?

324
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,551
"ANDREW SHUE."

325
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,988
SAYS HERE HE'S
A GRADUATE OF DARTMOUTH,

326
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,557
FORMER ALL-AMERICAN
SOCCER PLAYER?

327
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,961
WELL, WE KNOW AT LEAST
THIS ONE'LL STAY THIN.

328
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,063
OH, AARON! YOU'RE TERRIBLE.

329
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,297
WELL, IT'S TRUE!

330
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,267
ALSO, HE'S THE BROTHER
OF ELIZABETH SHUE.

331
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,071
WELL, CLEARLY, TALENT
RUNS IN HIS FAMILY.

332
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,875
I GOT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL.

333
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,244
TORI, HONEY... I LOVE YOU.

334
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,010
WOW.

335
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,445
ALL THE CLASSICS.

336
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,414
FANTASY ISLAND... HART TO HART.

337
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,016
THE LOVE BOAT.

338
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,922
ANDREW.

339
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,290
THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND.

340
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,292
WELL, KID...

341
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,896
YOU BLEW US AWAY.

342
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,298
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GOT THE PART.

343
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,910
WE'RE THRILLED TO
HAVE YOU ONBOARD, ANDREW.

344
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,435
WOW! REALLY?

345
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,270
WHEN DO I START?

346
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,305
MONDAY.

347
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,174
LIKE THE DAY-AFTER-TOMORROW
MONDAY?

348
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,608
HE KNOWS THE CALENDAR, TOO!

349
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,977
I TOLD YOU

350
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,311
THESE DARTMOUTH BOYS ARE SMART.

351
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,050
COME ON OUT, EVERYONE.

352
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,152
ANDREW, MEET OUR HAIR, MAKEUP,

353
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,920
AND WARDROBE TEAM.

354
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,222
YOU'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS.
WE'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

355
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,191
LOOK AT YOU
AND LOOK AT THAT HAIR.

356
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,192
HERE WE GO.

357
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,236
WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS

THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

361
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,506

00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,112
THIS IS MY PERSONAL CONDITIONER.

00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,506
I WANT YOU TO START USING THIS
UP TO SEVEN TIMES A DAY.

373
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,354
ACTUALLY, IT'S AMAZING

374
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,356
ANYONE CHOOSES TO BE AN ACTOR.

375
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,467
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

376
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,127
THEY MAKE TONS OF MONEY
FOR PLAYING MAKE-BELIEVE.

377
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,262
IT'S THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD!

378
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,563
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

379
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,365
OR JUST NEED TO TALK,
HAVE DINNER,

380
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,068
MY NUMBER'S AT THE TOP OF
THE CALL SHEET FOR YOU.

381
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,008
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BOOKING
THE ROLE OF BILLY, MR. SHUE.

382
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,543
HAVE FUN ON SET.

383
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,387
OKAY, EVERYBODY, SUCK IT IN.

384
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,056
YOU KNOW THE CAMERA
ADDS 10 POUNDS.

385
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,466
I HOPE NOT.
10 POUNDS CAN GET YOU FIRED.

386
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,259
IT CAN?

387
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,660
YOU PLAY SOCCER EVERY DAY.

388
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,705
JUST REMEMBER TO KEEP CHASING
AROUND THE LITTLE BALL.

389
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,040
DAMN, IS IT TOO LATE
TO RETURN THAT, UH,

390
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,099
"WELCOME TO THE CAST"
CAKE I BOUGHT?

391
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,337
BRING THAT
TO MY TRAILER, WILL YOU?

392
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,172
I'LL BRING SOMETHING
ELSE TO YOUR TRAILER.

393
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,274
I'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT!

394
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,018
SO FOX HAS DECIDED
TO SPEND A FORTUNE

395
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,420
TO MARKET THIS SHOW.

396
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,989
I JUST PRAY IT'S A HIT.

397
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,062
YOU AND ME BOTH.

398
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,602
HEY! COME ON!

399
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,437
WE'RE WATCHING MELROSE PLACE.

400
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,572
I'M WATCHING THE GAME.

401
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,140
IT'S NOT EVEN ON...

402
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,175
SHH!

403
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,442
SHH!

404
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,517
OH, GOD...

405
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,886
THAT GRANT SHOW IS SO HOT.

406
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,655
I WANT TO CLIMB HIM LIKE A TREE.

407
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,722
MM-HMM!

408
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,824
WELL, WHAT DOES HE GOT
THAT I DON'T?

409
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,295
SERIOUSLY?

410
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,198
HEY, EVERYBODY.
LISTEN UP. THE REVIEWS ARE IN.

411
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,267
"IT'S LIKE EACH APARTMENT
ON MELROSE PLACE

412
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,135
"CAME WITH A FREE LOBOTOMY

413
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,604
AND A GIFT CERTIFICATE
FROM THE GAP."

414
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,606
OF COURSE, BECAUSE
THERE'S NO DEPTH.

415
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,209
THE STORYLINES
ARE SAFE AND SHALLOW.

416
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,719
HEY, I'LL TAKE
YOUR SAFE-AND-SHALLOW STORYLINES

417
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,412
IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM.

418
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,714
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPECT
THE SHOW TO WIN AN EMMY,

419
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,484
BUT I ALSO DIDN'T THINK
IT'D GET SLAMMED LIKE THIS.

420
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,419
WELL, I HOPE
IT DOESN'T GET CANCELED.

421
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,763
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING PART OF A SHOW

422
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,156
THAT LASTED
MORE THAN ONE SEASON.

423
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,559
IF THIS SHOW GETS CANCELED,
I'LL JUST GO BACK TO NEW YORK.

424
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,396
DO SOME REAL ACTING...
IN THE THEATER.

425
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,601
ALL RIGHT. WHO WANTS TO HELP ME

426
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,769
BUY HIM A PLANE TICKET
BACK TO NEW YORK?

427
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,305
ANYONE?

428
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,609
"MELROSE PLACE...

429
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,378
"THE SUMMER'S
MOST HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SERIES,

430
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,448
"HAS THE ODOR OF
CLONED CREATIVE STALEMATE.

431
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,849
"PUT IT THIS WAY...

432
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,818
"IF YOU LOVE
BEVERLY HILLS 90210,

433
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,686
YOU PROBABLY DESERVE MELROSE."

434
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,255
OUCH!

435
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,389
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

436
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,426
16 MILLION PEOPLE SMELLED
THAT ODOR AND THEY LOVED IT.

437
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,194
16 MILLION WATCHED
THE FIRST EPISODE,

438
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,471
BUT WE'VE SLIPPED
FOR THE SECOND, THIRD,

439
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,496
AND FOURTH.

440
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,964
THEY KEEP DROPPING AND...

441
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,276
OKAY, OKAY. IT TOOK SOME TIME
FOR 90210 TO BECOME A HIT, TOO.

442
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,501
BINGO!

443
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,370
NO "BINGO."

444
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,740
PEOPLE ONLY GAVE 90210 A CHANCE
BECAUSE FOX DOESN'T DO NEWS,

445
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,783
AND WHEN SADDAM INVADED KUWAIT,

446
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,309
WE WERE THE ONLY THING ON-AIR

447
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,645
THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY FOCUSED
ON THE GULF WAR.

448
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,480
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE EPISODE WHERE

449
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,882
BRANDON LAUNCHED THE S.C.U.D.
AT THE PEACH PIT?

450
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,717
EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW YOU GOT HIRED AGAIN.

451
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,386
I HAVE NO IDEA.

452
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,789
I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU SHOULD LET AMY GO.

453
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,424
HER CHARACTER DOESN'T POP

454
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,493
AND HER ACCENT'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

455
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,894
THE CAST NEEDS SOME TIME,

456
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,696
BUT THEY'LL GEL
EVENTUALLY, EVEN AMY.

457
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,764
LOOK AT THAT...

458
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,333
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.

459
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,236
WELL, I'M SURE THEY WOULD'VE
FIGURED IT OUT EVENTUALLY,

460
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,405
LIKE ROUND TABLE,
OR 2000 MALIBU ROAD,

461
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,640
OR EVERY OTHER
CANCELED SHOW THIS SEASON.

462
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,509
AARON, I DON'T
WANT TO GET CANCELED

463
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,378
BEFORE WE'VE HAD A DECENT SHOT.

464
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,545
THIS IS YOUR SHOT.

465
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,447
MY ADVICE IS TO START
THINKING ABOUT

466
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,516
HOW TO INCREASE OUR RATINGS,

467
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,651
OR BOTH OUR CAREERS
ARE IN THE CRAPPER.

468
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,789
WELL, YOURS ANYWAY.

469
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,309
COFFEE FOR YOU? YOU TOO? OKAY.

470
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,645
DAPHNE!

471
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,647
HI. NO, I'M NOT READY,
I'M WAITING FOR A FRIEND.

472
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,317
OH, I'M NOT YOUR WAITRESS.

473
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,751
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

474
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,053
HOW MUCH I LOVED THE SURE THING.

475
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,657
AND... YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY LOST MY VIRGINITY

476
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,827
TO A GUY WHO LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE JOHN CUSACK,

477
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,895
SO YOU AND ME HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

478
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:03,996
OH, OKAY, WOW.

479
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,399
HEY, DAPHNE, SORRY I'M LATE.

480
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,467
DID YOU ALREADY ORDER?

481
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,535
SHE'S NOT OUR WAITRESS.

482
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,837
I JUST CAME TO TELL HER
HOW MUCH I LOVE HER WORK.

483
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,372
WELL, THEN,
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

484
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,341
OH, DON'T TRY AND BUTTER ME UP.

485
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,584
YOU ARE IN THE DOGHOUSE, MISTER.

486
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,544
I KNOW! I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

487
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,312
IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG.

488
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,680
BUT TRUST ME,

489
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,815
I BARELY HAVE TIME
TO SLEEP THESE DAYS.

490
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,317
IS IT THAT CRAZY?

491
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,685
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I HAVE TWO SHOWS!

492
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,520
ONE, OBVIOUSLY, IS STILL
FINDING ITS AUDIENCE.

493
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,088
WELL, I LOVE IT.

494
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,957
MELROSE REMINDS ME
OF OUR COLLEGE DAYS.

495
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,825
WHICH I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN.

496
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:33,960
THAT IS WHY...

497
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,962
I WANT TO OFFER YOU
A ROLE ON THE SHOW.

498
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,029
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

499
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,565
MM-HMM.

500
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,566
DARREN! I WOULD LOVE IT.

501
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,700
REALLY?

502
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,777
YES! DID YOU WANT ME TO BEG?

503
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,845
- I SWEAR...
- ACTUALLY, COULD YOU BEG?

504
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,870
I WAS GOING TO!

505
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,572
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG.

506
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,439
OH, MY GOD! I'M SO EXCITED!

507
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,273
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
BEFORE YOU SAY YES,

508
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,451
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.

509
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,476
OKAY!

510
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,847
HER NAME IS JO.
SHE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.

511
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,749
SHE'S A BIT MYSTERIOUS.

512
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,385
SHE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT HER PAST.

513
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,019
I WANT TO BRING
THIS "EAST COAST EDGE"

514
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,854
TO THE SHOW.

515
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,189
SHE'S ARTY,

516
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,692
AND SHE'S MORE WORLDLY
THAN ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS.

517
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,996
I'M THINKING THAT SHE COMES
FROM NEW YORK CITY

518
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,031
AND I REALLY WANT THE AUDIENCE
TO WONDER ABOUT HER.

519
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,133
HEY!

520
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,069
FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL?

521
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,772
YES! I'M DAPHNE. ZUNIGA.

522
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,741
WELCOME, DAPHNE.
I'M DOUG SAVANT.

523
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,379
COME ON. LET ME CARRY
YOUR BOOKS TO CLASS,

524
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,847
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE OTHER KIDS.

525
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,915
OKAY!

526
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,887
WELCOME TO GLAMOROUS
SANTA CLARITA!

527
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,656
IS THAT WHERE WE ARE?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

528
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,491
THE HIGHWAY CAME OUT THIS FAR.

529
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,826
YOU WANT THE GRAND TOUR,

530
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,161

536
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,441
CHAIR WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH
AND ANDREW SHUE

540
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,415
"REHEARSING" AN INTIMATE SCENE.

541
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,116
32 EPISODES A SEASON...

542
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,185
I GUESS YOU GOTTA REHEARSE
WHEN YOU CAN.

543
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,186
WELL, THEY REHEARSE THAT ONE

544
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,187
PRETTY FREQUENTLY.

545
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,656
OH!

546
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:10,790
HEY, GUYS.

547
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,660
I THINK YOU GOT IT DOWN.

548
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,695
COME MEET DAPHNE.

549
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,699
WE WERE JUST...

550
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,634
GOING OVER
SOME OF THE NEW ADJUSTMENTS.

551
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,902
MM-HMM.

552
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,136
I'M COURTNEY.

553
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,581
I HEAR MY CHARACTER
IS INSPIRED BY YOU.

554
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,839
OH, I DON'T KNOW...

555
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,775
YOU'VE REALLY MADE IT YOUR OWN.

556
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,042
WELL, THANKS!

557
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,578
ANDREW.

558
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,646
NICE TO MEET YOU.

559
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,591
SO YOU AND DARREN REALLY LIVED
IN A PLACE THIS NICE

560
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,016
RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE?

561
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,585
OH! GOD, NO.
THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU

562
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,219
SHOW THE PLACE
WE LIVED IN ON TV.

563
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,021
IT WOULD BE TOO SAD.

564
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,055
CAST AND KEYS!

565
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,224
PLEASE REPORT TO SET
FOR SCENE 14.

566
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,527
HEY, I'LL COME FIND YOU
WHEN WE BREAK FOR LUNCH.

567
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,129
THEY SEEM NICE.

568
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,798
A COUPLE IN REAL LIFE, HUH?

569
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,501
THEY LIKE TO KEEP IT
QUIET, BUT YEAH.

570
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,702
A BUNCH OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE

571
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,003
WORKING LONG HOURS,

572
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,738
IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN.

573
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,739
NOT FOR ME.

574
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,840
I GOT A WIFE AND A KID.

575
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,141
AND ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY.

576
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,743
- OH...
- DOUG!

577
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,746
OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE VANESSA.

578
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,214
"MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU!"

579
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,550
I SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO LOVED YOU...

580
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,519
- ...IN SPACEBALLS.
- YOUR CHARACTER JO'S...

581
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,229
...GONNA HAVE TO GET
HER OWN GAY BEST FRIEND,

582
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,155
'CAUSE MATT HERE
BELONGS TO RHONDA.

583
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,257
JO DOESN'T MAKE ANY
OF HER OWN DECISIONS.

584
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,992
IT'S ALL UP TO DARREN.

585
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,828
HOPEFULLY,
HE'S FEELING GENEROUS.

586
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,462
FINGERS CROSSED.

587
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,798
ACTUALLY, WE WANT

588
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,867
TO TAKE A COUPLE
OF OUR CHARACTERS

589
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,035
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

590
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,136
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING

591
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,771
ABOUT RELIGION, POLITICS,

592
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,981
OR THE PLIGHT OF THE HOMELESS,

593
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,140
I SWEAR TO GOD...

594
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,242
NO. NO, YOU'RE
GONNA LIKE THIS...

595
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,511
WE WANT MICHAEL

596
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,246
TO CHEAT ON JANE WITH KIMBERLY.

597
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,816
MARCIA CROSS HAS BEEN
AMAZING AS KIMBERLY.

598
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,152
IF THE EMMYS TONIGHT,
SHE'D WIN ALL OF THEM,

599
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,030
BUT THIS WILL BE A GREAT ARC
FOR BOTH CHARACTERS.

600
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,288
UNTIL NOW,

601
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,291
MICHAEL HAS JUST BEEN
THIS YOUNG, COCKY DOCTOR,

602
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,160
WHO HAS FLIRTED
WITH BEING A JERK,

603
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,563
BUT WE WANT TO TAKE HIM
FULLY TO THE JERK-SIDE

604
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,665
BY HAVING HIM
CHEAT WITH KIMBERLY.

605
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,633
BELIEVE ME, THOMAS CAN DO THIS.

606
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,769
HEY! YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CONVINCE ME.

607
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:05,538
I'M GLAD
TO SEE YOU SPICING THINGS UP.

608
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,039
MAKING IT A LITTLE SOAPY.

609
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,083
I TOLD YOU FROM THE BEGINNING...

610
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,643
I KNOW, IT'S JUST...

611
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,779
I THINK
I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE MYSELF.

612
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,781
OCCASIONALLY, I'D LIKE TO DEAL

613
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,158
WITH SOME REAL ISSUES
ON THIS SHOW.

614
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,249
DO WHAT I DID.

615
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,852
MAKE SUCCESS YOUR TROJAN HORSE.

616
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,654
I SNUCK THROUGH THE GATES

617
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,890
WITH CHARLIE'S ANGELS
AND DYNASTY,

618
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,257
AND ONCE INSIDE,

619
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,326
I MADE AND THE BAND PLAYED ON.

620
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,096
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE A MOVIE ABOUT A.I.D.S.

621
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,297
WITHOUT ALSO DOING A SHOW

622
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,666
ABOUT THREE BRA-LESS WOMEN
FIGHTING CRIME.

623
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,802
BE EARNEST LATER.

624
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,804
NOTED...

625
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,673
"MAKE THE WOMEN
ON THE SHOW BRA-LESS."

626
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,209
BELIEVE ME,

627
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,812
SOON ENOUGH, YOU'LL BE
CONSIDERING STORYLINES

628
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:49,215
WITH HITMEN AND BLACKMAIL
AND FROZEN EMBRYOS.

629
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,818
HAPPENS TO ALL OF US.

630
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,253
NOW, HOW'S YOUR FRIEND,
DAPHNE, SETTLING IN?

631
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,189
SHE'S DEFINITELY GETTING
THE HANG OF IT.

632
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,593
OF SOME OF IT.

633
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,831
SO, GRANT...

634
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,098
YOU'RE TIRED,

635
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,610
YOU JUST LUGGED
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF

636
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,644
UP THE STAIRS FOR THIS GIRL,

637
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,501
BUT YOU'RE INTERESTED, SO...

638
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,070
SO I'M GONNA ACT LIKE
IT'S NO PROBLEM?

639
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,104
EXACTLY.

640
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:13,305
THEN DAPHNE,

641
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,983
YOU'RE DISTRACTED WITH
ALL THIS MOVING GOING ON

642
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,042
AND YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE

643
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,710
THAT THE POLITE THING TO DO

644
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,384
IS TO INVITE HIM IN
AND OFFER HIM A DRINK.

645
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,283
YOU CAN SAY YOUR FIRST LINES.

646
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,086
OH!

647
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,388
UH, I'M SORRY.

648
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,890
I-I DIDN'T REALIZE...

649
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,391
NO PROBLEM.

650
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,260
AFTER YOUR LINES,
GRANT WILL POLITELY DECLINE,

651
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,261
AND LEAVE YOU STANDING THERE,

652
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,797
FRUSTRATED. OKAY?

653
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,634
GREAT. SO WE'RE GONNA
SHOOT IT THIS WAY,

654
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,779
THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN IT AROUND
AND GRAB GRANT'S REACTION.

655
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,972
OKAY. SECOND TEAM IN.
FIRST TEAM OUT.

656
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,878
HI.

657
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,214
THAT'S MY STAND-IN?

658
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,149
OH, I KNOW, RIGHT?
THE RESEMBLANCE IS EERIE.

659
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,785
COME ON, LET'S GRAB
SOMETHING TO EAT.

660
00:26:58,818 --> 00:26:59,852
DON'T GO TOO FAR.

661
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:00,929
WE'LL BE READY
TO SHOOT IN A MINUTE.

662
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,021
YOU GOT IT.

663
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,155
WE'RE SHOOTING?

664
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,366
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
BLOCKING, NOT REHEARSAL.

665
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,059
ON THIS SHOW,
BLOCKING IS REHEARSAL.

666
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,795
I SHOULD'VE PREPARED MORE.

667
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,929
I'M USED TO A FILM SET.

668
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,030
IT MOVES MUCH SLOWER.

669
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,064
NAH, YOU'LL BE FINE.

670
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,766
THIS IS MELROSE PLACE,

671
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,868
NOT MASTERPIECE THEATRE.

672
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,672
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THE RULES OF SOCCER,

673
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,440
BUT IS IT CUSTOMARY
TO PLAY TWO GAMES

674
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,042
IN THREE HOURS?

675
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,210
KEEPS ME SANE, MAN.

676
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,946
THIS PLACE IS...

677
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,181
YOU OKAY?

678
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,717
YEAH. YEAH.

679
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,952
NOTHING A DAY OF
SOCCER CAN'T CURE.

680
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,792
HEY, COURTNEY!

681
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,193
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

682
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,796
OH. OH, GOD. HI.

683
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,798
SOME OF US
ARE GONNA GRAB DRINKS TONIGHT,

684
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,833
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN.

685
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,234
LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD USE ONE...

686
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,169
- OR FIVE.
- NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

687
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,104
- I'M JUST...
- I'M JUST TIRED.

688
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,305
IT'S BEEN, UM...

689
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,339
DOUG!

690
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,277
THANKS FOR ASKING, THOUGH.

691
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,080
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

692
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,114
WE HAVE TWO SCENES

693
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,716
TOTALING THREE AND A HALF PAGES.

694
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,252
GRANT'S ABS GET
MORE SCREEN TIME.

695
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,720
THEY PROBABLY JUST NEED SPACE

696
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,188
TO SET UP DAPHNE'S CHARACTER.

697
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,090
AND, UH, I WOULDN'T
COMPLAIN TOO LOUDLY

698
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,491
ABOUT GRANT'S ABS.

699
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,127
I HEAR THEY HAVE
A REALLY POWERFUL AGENT.

700
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,264
YOU WANNA COME UP TO MY PLACE?

701
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,032
I CAN POUR YOU A COLD DRINK.

702
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,903
THANKS, BUT, UM...
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

703
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,472
I'M GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE DIP IN THE POOL.

704
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,886
THEY HAVE REAL CHEMISTRY.

705
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,921
YEAH, IF WE CAN EVER
DO ANYTHING WITH IT.

706
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,923
LARRY COMPLAINED THE LAST
SCRIPT WAS TOO RACY.

707
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:44,891
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET VIEWERS

708
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,125
IF WE CAN'T PUSH THE ENVELOPE?

709
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,359
NO RATINGS, NO FREEDOM.

710
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,327
THAT'S HOW IT'S ALWAYS WORKED.

711
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,862
AND NO FREEDOM, NO RATINGS...

712
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,173
THAT'S A NICE CATCH-22
THEY'VE PUT US IN.

713
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,899
TONE DOWN
THE LITERARY REFERENCES.

714
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,133
THEY GIVE ME A HEADACHE.

715
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:57,336
ANYWAY, I ACTUALLY
MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA

716
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,538
TO GET RATINGS
WITHOUT PUSHING THE ENVELOPE...

717
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,873
A SPECIAL GUEST STAR.

718
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,176
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO
ANY MORE 90210 CROSS-OVERS.

719
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,544
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY TIMES

720
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,013
DONNA CAN COME OVER

721
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,147
TO BORROW A CUP OF SUGAR.

722
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,282
OH, IT'S NO ONE FROM 90210.

723
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,051
THEN WHO?

724
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,395
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
TILL I'M SURE I CAN GET THEM.

725
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,787
YOU CAN TELL ME.

726
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,889
LET'S JUST SAY
THEY'RE MY SECRET WEAPON.

727
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,290
OH, COME ON! I GOTTA KNOW.

728
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,092
IF I TOLD YOU,
IT WOULDN'T BE A SECRET.

729
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,193
WELL, IF THIS IS A PRANK

730
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,162
AND YOU SHOW UP
WITH JOE E. TATA,

731
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,231
I'M GOING TO BE FURIOUS.

732
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,033
BY THE WAY,
LAURA LEIGHTON STARTS TODAY.

733
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,034
WHO?

734
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,301
THAT REDHEAD.

735
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,470
SHE'S AUDITIONED FOR US
HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

736
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,172
WE CAST HER FOR A FEW EPISODES,

737
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,974
BUT WE MAY WANT TO
CONSIDER EXTENDING HER.

738
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,176
I THINK SHE'S
REALLY GOT SOMETHING.

739
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,979
WHAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ARE CREDITS.

740
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,448
BUT LET'S SEE HOW SHE DOES.

741
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,820
AND HERE YOU GO.

742
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,521
WAIT. I'M SMOKING IN THIS SCENE?

743
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,923
MM-HMM.

744
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,125
I'VE NEVER SMOKED BEFORE.

745
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,527
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL IT "ACTING."

746
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,932
I'VE ALSO
NEVER BEEN ON TV BEFORE.

747
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,002
OKAY, LET'S WELCOME
MISS LAURA LEIGHTON TO THE CAST.

748
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,072
THIS IS HER FIRST DAY
AND HER FIRST SCENE

749
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,473
AS "SYDNEY ANDREWS."

750
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,278
THANKS.

751
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,981
HI, LAURA.
DO YOU NEED ANY SIDES?

752
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,583
NO, I ATE BEFORE I CAME.

753
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,951
"SCRIPT SIDES"...

754
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,920
I CAN PUT THEM ON YOUR CHAIR
FOR YOU.

755
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,155
OH. SURE, THANKS.

756
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,390
OH, AND WHATEVER YOU DO,

757
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,357
DON'T INHALE, BECAUSE,

758
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,468
WHEN WE SHOOT THIS SCENE
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE,

759
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,495
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE THE SAME NUMBER OF PUFFS.

760
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,496
OH, GOD.

761
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:31,606
DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE.
I'VE GOT YOU COVERED.

762
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,632
I'LL KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING
YOU DO IN THIS SCENE

763
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,501
AND REMIND YOU.

764
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,303
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

765
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,605
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE.

766
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,407
LAURA, LIGHT UP.

767
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,475
AND... ROLL CAMERA.

768
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,218
HOLD THE ROLL.

769
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,123
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LAURA?

770
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,026
OKAY, JUST REMEMBER,
DON'T INHALE, RELAX.

771
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,894
MORE THAN HALFWAY
THROUGH THIS SEASON

772
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:03,529
AND THEY KEEP ADDING
NEW CHARACTERS.

773
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,032
EITHER THEY'RE REALLY DESPERATE

774
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,200
OR SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

775
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,435
OR MAYBE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

776
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,271
INCREDIBLY HOT GIRLS
ON THIS SHOW.

777
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,672
I HEARD SHE CAN ACT.

778
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,541
EVEN IF SHE CAN'T, WHO CARES?

779
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:19,245
THAT BODY ALONE IS WORTH
TWO NIELSEN POINTS.

780
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,279
AW, TRUST ME.

781
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,281
DON'T GO THERE, MAN.

782
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,553
HE AND COURTNEY HAVING PROBLEMS?

783
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,688
NO IDEA.

784
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,157
JUST LIKE MY CHARACTER,

785
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,126
I WANT TO BE INVOLVED
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.

786
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,694
YOU'LL BE FINE.

787
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,464
OKAY! WE'RE READY.
LET'S SHOOT THIS.

788
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,606
DID YOU SEE THAT SMILE?

789
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,382
OH, DAMN.

790
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,457
I CAN'T BELIEVE

791
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,326
THEY JUST GIVE US
ALL THIS STUFF FOR FREE.

792
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,495
SURE, IT'S FREE
ADVERTISING FOR THEM

793
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,997
IF WE USE IT OR TALK ABOUT IT.

794
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,432
UNLESS IT SAYS
IT'S NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS,

795
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,600
I WON'T USE IT.

796
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,405
WHY EVEN BOTHER?

797
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,673
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THREE HOURS OF WARDROBE

798
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,051
IF I HAVE TO GET
MY SHIRT TAKEN OFF

799
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,311
30 SECONDS INTO EACH EPISODE?

800
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,280
NICE TO SEE A MAN
BEING OBJECTIFIED

801
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,049
FOR A CHANGE.

802
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,624
WHAT'S SO FUNNY OVER HERE?

803
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,758
OH, NOTHING.

804
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,327
WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT MAKEUP.

805
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,230
WARDROBE PROBLEMS?

806
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,473
I'M SHIRTLESS IN EVERY EPISODE.

807
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,009
- OHH...
- AMERICA PROBABLY...

808
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,873
...HAS MY NIPPLES BURNED
INTO THEIR TV SCREENS.

809
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,738
YOU KNOW WHAT?

810
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,773
I'M GOING TO STOP WORKING OUT.

811
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,575
THAT WAY, THEY'LL LET ME
KEEP MY SHIRT ON.

812
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,609
- NO!
- DON'T!

813
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,520
MARCIA...

814
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,790
YOU LITTLE HOME-WRECKER, HUH?

815
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,093
FINALLY, WE GET SOMETHING JUICY.

816
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,128
NO KIDDING! NOTHING JUICIER

817
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,496
THAN A MISCARRIAGE.

818
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,630
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

819
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,632
THAT WASN'T GREAT EITHER.

820
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,371
I'M SURE, AS SOON AS
THE AFFAIR GETS BORING,

821
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:28,140
POOR KIMBERLY WILL
CONVENIENTLY DECIDE

822
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,709
TO CLEAN HER HIGH-POWERED
RIFLE COLLECTION

823
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,312
OR TAKE A TRAGIC INTEREST
IN LANDMINE REMOVAL.

824
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,682
OH, WELL, IT WAS FUN
BEING HERE WHILE IT LASTED.

825
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,749
I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE.

826
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:40,686
ONCE THEY SEE YOU GO FULL-TILT
ON THESE SCENES...

827
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,255
I'VE SEEN YOU ONSTAGE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO.

828
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,390
THAT'S SWEET OF YOU TO SAY.

829
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,391
IT'S THE TRUTH.

830
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:46,525
NOW, COME ON.

831
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,662
LET'S SHOW THESE MODELS
HOW REAL ACTORS DO IT, HUH?

832
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,269
IF YOU WEREN'T AN ACTOR,

833
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,570
WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

834
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,515
DO YOU THINK ABOUT GOING BACK
TO PLAYING PRO SOCCER?

835
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,573
I DON'T KNOW...

836
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:02,574
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN THINKING

837
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:03,475
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING

838
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,811
THAT LEAVES THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.

839
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,413
BUT I LOVE THIS JOB,

840
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,748
AND, YOU KNOW...

841
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,683
I'M JUST NOT EXACTLY
CURING CANCER.

842
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,386
NO, WE LEAVE THE CANCER-CURING
TO COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH.

843
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,755
THIS IS DOUG SAVANT,
OUR RESIDENT COMEDIAN.

844
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,724
DO YOU THINK YOUR CHARACTER

845
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,292
WILL EVER GET A BOYFRIEND?

846
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:21,693
EVENTUALLY, I HOPE SO.

847
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:22,837
IS THERE SOMEONE OFF-SCREEN?

848
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,430
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

849
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,831
DO YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OTHER?

850
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,833
LET'S SEE...

851
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,701
THERE WAS ALEX,

852
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,338
AND THEN JAMIE,
AND, UH, NOW PAT.

853
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,373
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

854
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,708
SO YOUR LOVE LIFE OFF-SCREEN

855
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,852
IS ABOUT THE SAME
AS IT IS ON-SCREEN?

856
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,178
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT!

857
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,379
SO YOU'RE NOT GAY?

858
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,614
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT EITHER.

859
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,222
OH... WOW.

860
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,361
OKAY, SO THAT'S OFFICIALLY

861
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,529
A "NO" ON
THE "POLYGAMY" STORYLINE.

862
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:00,499
UH, WHAT ABOUT...
CAN'T WE INJURE SOMEBODY?

863
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,201
WE ALREADY HAD A CAR-JACKING.

864
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,478
YEAH, BUT BILLY
DIDN'T GET INJURED,

865
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,204
HE JUST GOT, YOU KNOW, RACIST.

866
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,538
HE WASN'T A RACIST.

867
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,906
HE JUST NEEDED TO BECOME MORE...

868
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,609
AWARE THAT THERE ARE
RACIAL INEQUALITIES

869
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,877
HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

870
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,745
RIGHT, BECAUSE, APPARENTLY,

871
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,281
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON
NOT AWARE OF THAT

872
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,691
AFTER THE WHOLE
RODNEY KING BEATING.

873
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,293
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
HE'S ALSO THE ONLY PERSON

874
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,494
NOT AWARE OF THAT
LITTLE RIOT THING

875
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:20,619
THAT WE HAD HERE IN L.A.

876
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,763
WELL, YOU KNOW,
NEWS TRAVELS SLOW,

877
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,930
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HITS THE 405.

878
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,523
DARREN'S RIGHT.

879
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,234
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
ONLY CARE ABOUT TWO THINGS...

880
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,769
WHO'S SCREWING WHO
AND WHO'S SCREWING OVER WHO.

881
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,827
"WHOM."

882
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,263
WHO'S SCREWING OVER WHOM.

883
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,440
OH, WE SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT

884
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,699
AS WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WRITERS.

885
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,201
IF WE WERE GOOD WRITERS,
WE WOULD.

886
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,369
YEAH?

887
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,638
PLEASE PUT HIM THROUGH.

888
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,774
HI, AARON.

889
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,244
REALLY?

890
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,547
OF COURSE! SHE IS PERFECT!
SHE'S GOING TO BE PERFECT.

891
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,251
YES, I AM EXCITED.

892
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,785
THIS IS GREAT.

893
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,787
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, AARON.

894
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,259
THAT'S THE BEST
PIECE OF NEWS I'VE HEARD

895
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,927
SINCE THIS SHOW STARTED.

896
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,796
...PROBABLY DO THAT.

897
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,232
I LOVE FILM.

898
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,566
YEAH, ME TOO.

899
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,767
WHAT ABOUT YOU, GRANT?

900
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,202
YOU EVER WANT TO DO FEATURES?

901
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,870
I HAD TO TURN DOWN
THELMA & LOUISE.

902
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,548
I DOUBT I'LL EVER GET
ANOTHER SHOT LIKE THAT.

903
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,541
DON'T SAY THAT!
OF COURSE, YOU WILL.

904
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,808
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

905
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,877
MAYBE THELMA & LOUISE BOMBS.

906
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,255
MAYBE IT'S THE END
OF BRAD PITT'S CAREER.

907
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,281
WHO'S BRAD PITT?

908
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,883
THE NOBODY
THEY'RE REPLACING ME WITH.

909
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,952
MOVIES AREN'T ALWAYS
BETTER THAN TELEVISION,

910
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,354
TRUST ME.

911
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,955
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THIS JOB.

912
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,458
JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
I'M GONNA HAVE IT MUCH LONGER.

913
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,592
WE'VE ONLY GOT

914
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,960
10 OR 12 EPISODES
LEFT THIS SEASON

915
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,329
AND NOT A PEEP ABOUT
GETTING RENEWED FOR A SECOND.

916
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,831
WELL, MAYBE THIS
MYSTERIOUS GUEST STAR

917
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,467
WILL GET THE NETWORK
TO START PEEPING.

918
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,569
IT MUST BE SOMEONE BIG.

919
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,471
LIKE, BILLY RAY CYRUS BIG.

920
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,473
OOH...

921
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,995
WHOEVER IT IS,

922
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,730
HE'S GONNA HAVE BE
A HELL OF AN ACTOR

923
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,465
TO TURN THIS ENTIRE
SERIES AROUND.

924
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:14,800
ACTRESS.

925
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,002
I HEAR THAT "HE" IS A SHE,

926
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,870
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS...

927
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,472
SHE'S GONNA SLEEP
WITH ONE OF US.

928
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,643
WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE SHE'LL TURN MATT STRAIGHT.

929
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,048
WELL, IF ANYBODY COULD DO IT,

930
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,751
I'M BETTING IT'LL BE HER.

931
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,790
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT HEATHER LOCKLEAR?

932
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,726
IN THE FLESH.

933
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,400
DID SOMEBODY ORDER A BITCH?

934
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,541
TOMMY, WOULD YOU RELAX?
YOU'RE A GREAT DRUMMER.

935
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:57,376
MOTLEY CRUE'S MUSIC IS TIMELESS.

936
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,645
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO YOUR SINGER IS.

937
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:01,813
I'VE BEEN HEARING RUMORS
ABOUT YOU AND...

938
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,316
THAT WAS
AN AWFULLY QUICK DENIAL.

939
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,820
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'M GOING TO BE HOME.

940
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:12,057
WELL, YOU CAN WORK ON
YOUR DRUMMING UNTIL I GET THERE.

941
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,401
THERE'S SOMEBODY
AT THE DOOR, TOMMY.

942
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,361
I HAVE TO GO.

943
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,765
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

944
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,502
THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS.

945
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:24,703
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

946
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,538
OH, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

947
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,949
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU GAVE ME MY CAREER.

948
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,809
I OFFERED YOU A ROLE!
YOU MADE YOUR OWN CAREER.

949
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,077
WELL, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL.

950
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,679
YOU BRING YOUR OWN
HEAT TO THIS SHOW,

951
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,747
AND I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO'S FOREVER GRATEFUL.

952
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,483
YOU LIKE THESE FLOWERS?

953
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,685
I'LL BUY YOU
A FULL-TIME FLORIST.

954
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,558
NOT SURE TOMMY WOULD
LOVE HIM AROUND THE HOUSE.

955
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,423
THEN I'M NOT SO SURE
TOMMY'S RIGHT FOR YOU.

956
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,457
MWAH!

957
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,625
KNOCK 'EM DEAD, KID.

958
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,126
I'LL TRY.

959
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,928
SEEYA ON THE SET, SWEETHEART.

960
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,801
FINAL TOUCHES, PLEASE.

961
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,138
OKAY, LET'S SHOOT THIS.

962
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,573
ROLL SOUND!

963
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:02,841
SOUND SPEED.

964
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:04,976
AND...

965
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,044
ACTION!

966
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,080
I NEED THESE
BY 9:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

967
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,483
BUT IT'S 6:00.

968
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,151
I WASN'T ASKING
WHAT TIME IT WAS,

969
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,153
I WAS TELLING YOU
WHAT TIME I NEED THESE.

970
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,287
IS THIS BECAUSE YOU THINK

971
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,132
I'M THE ONE THAT TOLD?
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T.

972
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,125
THIS ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL, ALISON.

973
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,598
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
OR THE INTEREST

974
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,662
TO CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK.

975
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,996
WELL, I DIDN'T.

976
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,998
I WOULD NEVER UNDERMINE
ANOTHER WOMAN LIKE THAT.

977
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,734
OH, BUT YOU'D DO IT TO A MAN?

978
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,769
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

979
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,471
THE IRONY IS...

980
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,573
I PROBABLY WOULD'VE
RESPECTED YOU MORE

981
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,041
HAD YOU SAID IT.

982
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,748
CUT!

983
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,616
THAT WAS SO GREAT!

984
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,684
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

985
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,619
YOU WERE SO GOOD.
CONGRATULATIONS.

986
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:48,654
OH, THANKS, GUYS.

987
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,921
THAT WAS FUN.

988
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,890
OH, WHERE IS CRAFTY?

989
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,163
WONDERFUL. A TOUR DE FORCE.

990
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,898
CAN SHE ACT OR WHAT?

991
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,032
SHE'S LIKE OLIVIER...

992
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,901
BUT SHE LOOKS BETTER IN TIGHTS.

993
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,438
HEROES ARE ONLY AS GOOD

994
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:09,808
AS THEIR OPPOSING
FORCES ARE BAD.

995
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,877
SHE'S THE FEMALE VILLAIN.

996
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,178
THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED.

997
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,681
OTHELLO WAS NOTHING
WITHOUT IAGO.

998
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:20,218
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

999
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,153
BUT HEATHER WAS ELECTRIC.

1000
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,525
FORGET WHAT I SAID ABOUT
TONING DOWN THE SEX.

1001
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,926
GO CRAZY. PUSH BOUNDARIES.

1002
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,927
REALLY?

1003
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,762
WHAT IS THE POINT OF
HAVING THE SEXIEST CAST

1004
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:31,730
ON TELEVISION

1005
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,665
IF WE'RE MAKING THEM
ACT LIKE THE WALTONS?

1006
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,634
GO FOR IT.

1007
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,907
HOW'S THE FOOD AROUND HERE?

1008
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,209
CRAFT SERVICE ISN'T BAD, BUT...

1009
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,944
YOU KNOW, IT COULD
ALWAYS BE BETTER.

1010
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,579
I HAVE A GUY WHO
MAKES THE BEST ESPRESSO.

1011
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:48,623
I'LL BRING HIM IN EVERY FRIDAY.

1012
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,981
OH!

1013
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,951
DOUG. CAN I TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE?

1014
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,786
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

1015
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,725
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP PEOPLE GUESSING

1016
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,692
BY NOT COMING OUT

1017
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,494
AND TELLING THE PRESS
THAT YOU'RE STRAIGHT...

1018
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,530
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT ABOUT
KEEPING PEOPLE GUESSING.

1019
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,164
- OH?
- I JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE...

1020
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,833
...TO THINK
I'M DISTANCING MYSELF

1021
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,100
FROM PLAYING A GAY CHARACTER

1022
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,503
BY ANNOUNCING THAT
I'M STRAIGHT IN REAL LIFE.

1023
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,238
I DON'T SEE A REASON FOR IT.

1024
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,740
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

1025
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,775
YOUR DEDICATION
TO THE GAY COMMUNITY.

1026
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,285
I JUST THINK THAT IT MAKES
FOR LESS CONFUSION

1027
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,377
TO OUR AUDIENCE.

1028
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,714
THE NETWORK DOESN'T NEED
THAT KIND OF... SPECULATION

1029
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:23,782
AT THIS TIME.

1030
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,851
AND WHAT KIND OF
SPECULATION IS THAT?

1031
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:28,754
THE KIND THAT
LOWERS OUR RATINGS.

1032
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,027
OH, COME ON, BARBARA.
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN THE SHOW?

1033
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,162
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN ABOUT?

1034
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,997
I HAVE SEEN
EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.

1035
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,166
OKAY, GREAT. WHO IS JAKE
SLEEPING WITH RIGHT NOW?

1036
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,736
AH! BUSTED.

1037
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,605
YOU GOT ME.

1038
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,007
WHO'S THAT WOMAN WITH HEATHER?

1039
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,208
THAT'S BARBARA.

1040
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,744
SHE MANAGES HEATHER... AND ME.

1041
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:53,979
OH.

1042
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,214
WHO MANAGES YOU?

1043
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,749
I DON'T HAVE A MANAGER YET.

1044
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,720
I GUESS I SHOULD GET ONE, RIGHT?

1045
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,188
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

1046
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,023
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY HARD
TO SURVIVE

1047
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,192
IN THIS BUSINESS WITHOUT ONE.

1048
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,827
YOU SHOULD SIGN WITH BARBARA.

1049
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,096
SHE REALLY KNOWS HER STUFF.

1050
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,164
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU LATER.

1051
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,300
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

1052
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,635
BUT WHEN I FIRST HEARD

1053
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:17,603
YOU WOULD BE ON THE SHOW,

1054
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,870
I WAS KIND OF...

1055
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,639
SCARED? NERVOUS?

1056
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,073
WORRIED I'D SHOW UP COKED OUT

1057
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,184
AFTER PARTYING
FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT?

1058
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,610
BASICALLY.

1059
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,645
BUT I THOUGHT MORE LIKE
TWO DAYS OF PARTYING.

1060
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,780
I THOUGHT FOUR, MAYBE.

1061
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:31,349
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE A WRONG IMPRESSION OF ME.

1062
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,318
I GUESS BECAUSE OF TOMMY,

1063
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,921
BUT, REALLY, I'M JUST
A NORMAL CALIFORNIA GAL...

1064
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,255
I LIKE TACOS, THE BEACH,

1065
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,690
MICK JAGGER'S LEARJET.

1066
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,029
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO SAY TO THE PUBLIC

1067
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,664
"IT'S OKAY WE HAVE A GAY GUY
ON THE SHOW

1068
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,899
BECAUSE HE'S NOT GAY
IN REAL LIFE."

1069
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,701
MAYBE THEY'VE GOTTEN
FLAK FROM ADVERTISERS.

1070
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:50,902
WHO'S THE ADVERTISER?

1071
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,938
PAT ROBERTSON?

1072
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:57,075
I FEEL LIKE THEY MIGHT BE
SETTING UP TO GET RID OF ME.

1073
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,210
THEY'RE NOT GETTING
RID OF EITHER OF US.

1074
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,646
WE'RE THE ONLY EDGY THINGS

1075
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,113
ABOUT THIS SHOW.

1076
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,616
WE'RE THE GAY GUY
AND THE BLACK GIRL.

1077
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,152
SO I WANT TO REWRITE
ALL THE DIALOGUE

1078
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,954
THAT WE HAVE FOR
HEATHER'S REMAINING SCENES.

1079
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,089
I JUST LOVE THE WAY
SHE DELIVERS THOSE LINES.

1080
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,100
IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW.

1081
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,092
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

1082
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,703
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW
SPIN ON THE CHARACTER.

1083
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,304
EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE
A SHOT OF ADRENALINE...

1084
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,965
THAT I THINK I WANT TO
USE AND REWORK

1085
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,233
INTO THE SCENES
WE HAVE GOING FORWARD.

1086
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,835
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

1087
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,671
YOU SHOULD BE WRITING.

1088
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,709
RELAX. HE'S KIDDING.

1089
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,343
LIGHTEN UP, FRANK!

1090
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,847
WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST
TALKING ABOUT THE PLANS

1091
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:37,115
WE HAVE FOR HEATHER'S SCENES.

1092
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,150
SHAME WE ONLY HAVE HER
FOR THREE MORE EPISODES.

1093
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,421
THESE AREN'T MY TACOS.

1094
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,390
WELL, BEFORE YOU GUYS
WRITE HER EXIT...

1095
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:48,660
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I COULD
GET HER TO JOIN THE SHOW?

1096
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:50,395
AARON, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS...

1097
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:53,164
I SAY DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO,

1098
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,200
BECAUSE I THINK WE JUST
FOUND THE MISSING PIECE

1099
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,835
THAT COULD SAVE THIS SHOW.

1100
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,713
HEY! WAIT UP!

1101
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,748
I JUST HEARD!

1102
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:10,858
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FIND ME?

1103
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:14,385
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE DOING THIS...

1104
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:17,022
I WANTED TO LEAVE
MELROSE PLACE WITH DIGNITY.

1105
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,857
LISTEN...

1106
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,926
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

1107
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,128
WHAT'S HAPPENING
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

1108
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,397
IT'S NOTHING
ANY OF US CAN CONTROL.

1109
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,967
IT'S UP TO THE GODS.

1110
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,902
OR, YOU KNOW...

1111
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:32,403
DARREN AND AARON.

1112
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:37,242
WELL, SO MUCH FOR
THE POWER OF PRAYER.

1113
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,011
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITHOUT YOU?

1114
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,147
SERIOUSLY! WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITHOUT ME?

1115
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,349
YOUR CHARACTER WAS
BASICALLY MY SIDEKICK.

1116
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,417
HEY, NOT BEING ON THIS

1117
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:47,886
ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD.

1118
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,888
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT.

1119
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,022
IT JUST...

1120
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:53,091
FEELS LIKE IT RIGHT NOW.

1121
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,029
BUT I NEED A ROLE
WHERE I CAN REALLY SHINE.

1122
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:01,099
THIS WASN'T IT.

1123
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,138
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

1124
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,474
MAYBE THIS IS THE BEST THING
TO HAVE HAPPENED TO ME.

1125
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,945
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, DOUG.

1126
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:15,480
SEE YOU AROUND, VANESSA.

1127
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,929
DARREN, HOW
CAN YOU POSSIBLY THINK THAT?

1128
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,239
THE NUMBERS
HAVE SHOT UP EVERY WEEK

1129
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,832
SINCE HEATHER'S BEEN ON.

1130
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,233
I KNOW, AND I'M THRILLED!

1131
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,002
IT'S JUST...

1132
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,070
IT'S JUST NOT THE SHOW
I SET OUT TO MAKE.

1133
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,472
NOTHING EVER TURNS OUT
THE WAY WE THINK IT'S GOING TO.

1134
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:42,941
THAT'S HOLLYWOOD!

1135
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:46,011
HELL, THAT'S NOT JUST HOLLYWOOD,
THAT'S LIFE, KID.

1136
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,079
BUT YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT,

1137
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:51,149
BECAUSE THIS SHOW
IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE!

1138
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,921
HI.

1139
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:05,290
THANKS SO MUCH.

1140
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,325
OH! HELLO, MISS LEIGHTON.

1141
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,368
LET ME GET THE DOOR FOR YOU.

1142
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,295
WHY, THANK YOU, MR. SHOW.

1143
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,602
I COULD TEAR THIS OFF YOU.

1144
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,504
THE WARDROBE LADY
WOULD KILL YOU.

1145
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,473
AT LEAST I'D DIE HAPPY.

1146
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,343
WHAT IF SOMEBODY
SAW YOU COME IN HERE?

1147
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,344
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA KEEP

1148
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,346
OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET.

1149
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,348
"SECRET" IMPLIES THAT
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG,

1150
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,050
WHICH WE'RE NOT...

1151
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,518
I THINK "PRIVATE"
IS A BETTER WORD.

1152
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,320
I KNOW, I JUST...

1153
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:11,289
WHAT?

1154
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,959
I JUST... I TAKE
THIS JOB SERIOUSLY,

1155
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:16,327
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE IT.

1156
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:17,963
JUST LOOK AT ANDREW
AND COURTNEY.

1157
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,031
I THINK THEY'RE
HANDLING IT WELL.

1158
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,333
THEY'RE PROS... LIKE US.

1159
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,418
AND CUT!

1160
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,126
HEY, LISTEN, UM...

1161
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,260
NO MORE TONGUE, OKAY?

1162
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,261
WHAT?

1163
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,529
OH!

1164
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,663
YEAH.

1165
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,265
NOW THAT WE'RE BROKEN UP...

1166
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,167
YEAH. YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

1167
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:57,535
THANK YOU.

1168
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,137
COURT?

1169
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,207
ARE WE OKAY?

1170
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:05,576
YEAH. OF COURSE.

1171
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:14,485
I LOVE VISITING THE SET.

1172
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:15,696
YOU KNOW,
THE MAGIC OF FILMMAKING.

1173
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,455
THE MAGIC OF A CATERED LUNCH.

1174
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,190
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, TOO,
BUT SERIOUSLY,

1175
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:20,225
I GET INSPIRED, YOU KNOW,

1176
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,635
IT GETS THE CREATIVE
JUICES FLOWING.

1177
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,161
YEAH, WELL, HAVING
THE WRITERS AROUND

1178
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,429
MAKES THE ACTORS CRAZY.

1179
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,572
ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN THEY THINK

1180
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,332
THEY KNOW THE CHARACTERS
BETTER THAN WE DO.

1181
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,709
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
THINK THAT, DO THEY?

1182
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,468
DARREN!

1183
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,170
HI.

1184
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,705
LISTEN, DOING
THAT CAT-FIGHT SCENE WITH LAURA

1185
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,041
WAS SO GREAT FOR ME.

1186
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:39,177
I GOT TO ACCESS ALL THIS ANGER,
RIGHT?

1187
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,511
SO I WAS THINKING,

1188
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,448
BECAUSE MY CHARACTER IS SO SWEET
AND INNOCENT,

1189
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,784
WHAT IF, AFTER BEING CHEATED ON
BY HER HUSBAND

1190
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,187
AND THEN BETRAYED
BY HER SISTER...

1191
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,455
SHE JUST SNAPS!

1192
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,558
AND SHE GETS THIS CRAZY
LOOK IN HER EYE,

1193
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,460
ALMOST LIKE A JEKYLL-AND-HYDE
KINDA THING.

1194
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,596
ONE SECOND, SHE'S ALL...
"HI! HOW NICE TO SEE YOU!"

1195
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,698
THEN SHE'S LIKE...
"I'LL RIP YOUR GUTS OUT!"

1196
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,703
HUH? KIND OF
A SPLIT-PERSONALITIES THING.

1197
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,806
I'M PRETTY SURE NO SOAP
HAS EVER TRIED IT.

1198
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,341
YEAH. NO. BET THEY HAVEN'T.

1199
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,377
YEAH, UM...

1200
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,645
BUT... HUH.

1201
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,514
YOU SEE, THE THING IS,

1202
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,683
EVERY CAST NEEDS
ITS MORAL CENTER,

1203
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,319
AND YOU'RE KIND OF IT
FOR THIS SHOW.

1204
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,154
OKAY.

1205
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,656
- AH!
- OH, JESUS!

1206
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,394
SEE?

1207
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:30,628
AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT.

1208
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,097
YOU'RE A LIVE-WIRE.

1209
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,766
OH... I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

1210
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,103
I FEEL GENUINELY UNSAFE
RIGHT NOW.

1211
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:39,370
THE ARTICHOKES ARE FLOWERS.

1212
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,715
- THE ARTICHOKE IS A FLOWER?
- THE ARTICHOKE ITSELF IS A FL...

1213
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,749
- HEY!
- ...BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS...

1214
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,509
THERE YOU ARE.

1215
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,311
I WANTED TO RUN
SOMETHING BY YOU GUYS.

1216
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,246
- YEAH?
- SURE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1217
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:50,248
SO WE ALL KNOW
JO'S EX-HUSBAND WAS ABUSIVE.

1218
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,717
SO, WHAT IF...

1219
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,319
HE SUDDENLY TURNS UP DEAD

1220
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:57,488
AND WHOEVER DID IT
TRIES TO PIN IT ON ME?

1221
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,358
I DON'T KNOW...

1222
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,260
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY
KILLED ONE EX-BOYFRIEND.

1223
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:03,494
YEAH, WE GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

1224
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,563
WE DON'T WANT YOU
BECOMING A SERIAL KILLER.

1225
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,465
HEY! THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

1226
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,400
I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY
A SERIAL KILLER.

1227
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:12,137
THAT WAY, IF YOU EVER NEED
TO WRITE ANYONE OFF THE SHOW,

1228
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,171
I CAN JUST...

1229
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,672
- OH! WOW.
- ...STAB THEM.

1230
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,407
OR, UM, I COULD DROWN 'EM.

1231
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,210
UH... OOH! I COULD CHOKE 'EM!

1232
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,821
THAT'S, UH...
THOSE ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS.

1233
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,680
I COULD SHANK 'EM.

1234
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:23,714
THERE IT IS.

1235
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,318
I DON'T KNOW IF WE...
IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION...

1236
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:29,120
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT?

1237
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,197
UH, I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT YOU...

1238
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:31,298
- NO! GOOD.
- WE ARE SO LATE...

1239
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,766
...FOR A MEETING
RIGHT NOW WITH AARON.

1240
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,425
- BUT, UM...
- OH, RIGHT!

1241
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,694
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT
WHEN WE WERE IN THE ROOM.

1242
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,563
IT WAS REALLY NICE
SEEING YOU, THOUGH.

1243
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,299
GREAT SWEATER.
YOU LOOK AMAZING. YEAH.

1244
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,700
I COULD SHOOT 'EM!

1245
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,844
- GOOD IDEA!
- ARE YOU WRITING THESE DOWN?

1246
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:45,303
I GOT IT ALL RIGHT HERE.

1247
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,637
HE'S GOT A MEMORY!

1248
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,273
- ALL RIGHT, SEEYA.
- THANKS, DAPHNE.

1249
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,909
HANG ON A SECOND.

1250
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,810
I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD
A MEETING WITH AARON.

1251
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,180
- WE DON'T.
- WE DON'T? OH! YOU'RE GOOD.

1252
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,815
DARREN! I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE PROBABLY BUSY.

1253
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,916
YEAH, WE ARE.

1254
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,318
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU
A QUICK SUMMARY

1255
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:01,728
ABOUT THIS ARTICLE
I READ ON SLEEP-WALKING.

1256
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,322
APPARENTLY, PEOPLE DO
CRAZY THINGS IN THEIR SLEEP.

1257
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:06,195
THEY GET ON BUSES,
THEY GO TO DIFFERENT CITIES,

1258
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,226
THEY START FAMILIES,
THEY ROB BANKS...

1259
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,736
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE ALISON
COULD WAKE UP ONE DAY,

1260
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,930
LIKE, "WHOA! WHAT'S THIS BANK?
THIS BANK ISN'T MY BED!"

1261
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,865
YEAH! TOT... I LOVE THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1262
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,735
WE'RE ACTUALLY... WE'RE LATE
FOR A MEETING WITH AARON.

1263
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:18,936
- WE'RE VERY LATE.
- OH! YEAH.

1264
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,405
WHY DON'T YOU
SEND ME THE ARTICLE?

1265
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:21,639
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL FIND IT.

1266
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,609
- OKAY, GREAT! THANK YOU.
- SEE YOU.

1267
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,511
OHH... YOU WERE RIGHT.
IT'S SCARY HERE.

1268
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:28,213
LET'S NOT COME BACK
TO SET EVER AGAIN.

1269
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:29,646
OR AT LEAST UNTIL
THEY SERVE DINNER.

1270
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,055
THIS IS CRAZY.

1271
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,501
I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE
ON THE COVER OF ROLLING STONE.

1272
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,460
THAT'S, LIKE,
FOR SUPER-FAMOUS PEOPLE,

1273
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,362
LIKE U2 OR THE SPIN DOCTORS.

1274
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,796
I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY!

1275
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,532
WHAT'S CRAZY IS
THAT I CAN'T EVEN

1276
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,534
DO MY OWN GROCERY
SHOPPING ANYMORE.

1277
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,537
I GOT ABSOLUTELY MOBBED
AT GELSON'S YESTERDAY.

1278
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,239
HEATHER, YOU'VE HAD TO DO THIS

1279
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:55,382
SO MUCH LONGER THAN WE HAVE.

1280
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:56,541
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1281
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,254
JUST LOOK AMAZING
WHENEVER YOU RUN ERRANDS!

1282
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,494
HOW ABOUT THIS SIMPLE TANK?

1283
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,862
- YEAH!
- HMM?

1284
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,231
THIS SHOULD WORK.

1285
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:21,366
SERIOUSLY?

1286
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,600
I'LL GO TRY IT ON.

1287
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,503
SHE'S JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR HER CLIENT, I GUESS.

1288
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,778
OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG?

1289
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:36,247
IT'S JUST...

1290
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,782
ALL THE GIRLS LOOK SO GREAT.

1291
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:38,816
AND SO DO YOU!

1292
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,785
I DON'T HAVE ANY BOOBS.

1293
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:43,421
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE USE
A ZOOM LENS ON ME.

1294
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,523
OH, HONEY, BOOBS ARE SO 1993.

1295
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,292
LOOK AT KATE MOSS.

1296
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,527
UGH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE STAYS SO THIN.

1297
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,396
SHE MUST WORK OUT ALL THE TIME.

1298
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,663
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

1299
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:53,964
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

1300
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,966
YOU'RE PERFECT.

1301
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:59,537
HEATHER, HONEY.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

1302
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,541
GREAT CHOICE.

1303
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,575
YEAH. IT LOOKS GOOD.

1304
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,283
EVERYBODY GET IN CLOSE,

1305
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:14,785
I WANT YOU TO DRAPE YOURSELVES
OVER EACH OTHER.

1306
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,056
NO, LEAVE THEM OPEN.

1307
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,959
MAYBE WE'LL MAKE THE COVER
OF ROLLING STONE AND PENTHOUSE.

1308
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,329
NO SMILING. I WANT SEXY.

1309
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,570
UH, HEY, COURTNEY.

1310
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,572
COULD YOU SWITCH PLACES
WITH LAURA?

1311
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,405
I DON'T WANT ALL THE BLONDES
IN THE SAME SPOT.

1312
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,488
OH, THAT IS PERFECT.

1313
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:05,803
DOUG, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE...

1314
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,907
I'M DONE, HUH?

1315
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,542
WHA...?

1316
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:13,344
NO.

1317
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,480
NO, THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

1318
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,615
YOUR CHARACTER FINALLY GETS
TO KISS ANOTHER GUY.

1319
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:19,950
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1320
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:20,951
MM-HMM.

1321
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,119
THIS IS...

1322
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,488
THIS IS GREAT!

1323
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,390
HEY, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
ASK ME

1324
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,800
IF I'M EVER GONNA
GET LAID ON THIS SHOW?

1325
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,027
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE ASK ME?

1326
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,397
DARREN, I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP

1327
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,031
FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY.

1328
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,666
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

1329
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,702
YEAH, WELL, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

1330
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,637
IT'S THE RIGHT TO DO
FOR THE SHOW.

1331
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,971
NOW, THE NETWORK WILL ALWAYS BE

1332
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,774
A LITTLE SKITTISH, BUT...

1333
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,710
IT'S TIME.

1334
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,755
OH, OH, OH...

1335
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,524
OH, HEY, HOT-LIPS!

1336
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,959
DON'T BE JEALOUS.

1337
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,394
A LITTLE BIT!

1338
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:04,629
GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

1339
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,065
TV-KISSING 101...

1340
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,700
ALWAYS HAVE FRESH BREATH.

1341
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:10,801
AND LIP BALM,

1342
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:12,075
IN CASE THERE'S MULTIPLE TAKES,

1343
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,070
WHICH THERE WILL BE.

1344
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,405
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

1345
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:15,506
YOU NERVOUS?

1346
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,441
YES.

1347
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:17,408
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A PART OF HISTORY, MAN.

1348
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:19,410
YOU GUYS ARE STAYING
TO WATCH, AREN'T YOU?

1349
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:20,545
OH, GOD, YES.

1350
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:23,714
OKAY. LET'S
PRACTICE THIS ONE MORE TIME.

1351
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:26,551
AND STAND-INS, KISS.

1352
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,954
AND HEADLIGHTS.

1353
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,125
OKAY, LET'S GET
THE STAND-INS OUT,

1354
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,562
LET'S GET FIRST TEAM IN.

1355
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:38,796
OKAY, EVERYBODY, NO REHEARSAL.

1356
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,598
LET'S GO FOR ONE.

1357
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,733
WE'RE GONNA ROLL
AND TAIL-SLATE IT.

1358
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,606
AND... ACTION.

1359
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,974
I HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

1360
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,443
ME TOO.

1361
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:02,587
AND HEADLIGHTS!

1362
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,590
- AND CUT!
- TAIL SLATE.

1363
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,964
IT'S GONNA BE
THE KISS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD.

1364
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,735
YOUR PACKAGE IS...

1365
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:18,969
THANK YOU.

1366
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,972
OH, MY GOD!

1367
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,974
THE COVER OF
"ROLLING STONE," LADIES.

1368
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:30,748
WHERE ARE WE?

1369
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,983
THANK YOU.

1370
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,152
"THE HOT ISSUE!"

1371
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,654
WE LOOK SEXY. WE DO.

1372
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,489
OH, IT IS HOT!

1373
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:39,557
"THE BOD SQUAD."

1374
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:44,962
WELL, I GUESS

1375
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,497
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ROOM ON THE COVER.

1376
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:48,633
APPARENTLY, IT'S RESERVED
FOR BARBARA'S CLIENTS.

1377
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,640
WE'RE IN THE SAME ISSUE

1378
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,641
AS THE MEAT PUPPETS.

1379
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,042
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

1380
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:07,251
BARBARA?
IT'S LAURA LEIGHTON ON LINE ONE.

1381
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,790
ISN'T THE ROLLING STONE
COVER PHENOMENAL?

1382
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,224
ACTUALLY...

1383
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:15,325
EVERYONE'S UPSET OVER HERE

1384
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,928
BECAUSE COURTNEY AND DAPHNE
WERE LEFT OFF THE COVER.

1385
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:18,963
WERE THEY?

1386
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,931
I ONLY NOTICED WHO WAS ON IT.

1387
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,533
YOU.

1388
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,535
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH ROOM
ON A PAGE.

1389
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,670
WHY ARE YOU UPSET?

1390
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:26,671
YOU MADE THE CUT.

1391
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,206
BECAUSE THIS CAST
IS LIKE FAMILY, THAT'S WHY.

1392
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,942
SURE, BUT SHOWS COME AND GO.

1393
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:35,946
MAGAZINE COVERS ARE FOREVER,
AND YOU'RE ON ONE.

1394
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,815
YOU DON'T GET IT.

1395
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,552
WE'RE WITH EACH OTHER EVERY DAY,
12 HOURS A DAY,

1396
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:43,854
AND WHEN YOU PULL STUFF
LIKE THIS, IT MAKES IT...

1397
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:47,224
ENOUGH ALREADY.
IT'S JUST BUSINESS.

1398
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,594
BARBARA, I'M SERIOUS.
I DON'T THINK...

1399
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:50,728
THERE'LL BE OTHER COVERS.

1400
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:51,896
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

1401
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,164
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING OR SOMETHING.

1402
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,700
MAYBE THEY CAN BE
ON ONE OF THOSE,

1403
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,234
IF IT MAKES THEM HAPPY.

1404
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,103
LISTEN, DOLL, I GOT TO RUN.

1405
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,571
BIG KISSES.

1406
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:05,876
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

1407
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,590
THERE IT IS.

1408
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:20,725
- HERE YOU GO.
- SIGNATURE.

1409
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:21,758
SEE YOU LATER.

1410
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:31,802
YOUR CHARACTER

1411
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:33,013
IS THE SWEETEST
PERSON ON THE SHOW.

1412
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,271
OH, I KNOW.

1413
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,907
EVERYBODY ELSE ALWAYS
GETS TO HAVE THE FUN.

1414
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,384
EXCEPT FOR THE POOL FIGHT
WITH SYDNEY...

1415
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,309
THAT WAS AWESOME.

1416
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,711
THANK YOU!

1417
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,322
YEAH, I HOPE I GET TO DO
MORE THINGS LIKE THAT.

1418
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:44,749
THEY SHOULD LET YOU
PUSH MICHAEL INTO THE POOL.

1419
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:45,816
WELL, AFTER WHAT

1420
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,751
MICHAEL DID TO MY CHARACTER,

1421
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,753
THEY SHOULD LET ME
PUSH HIM OFF A CLIFF.

1422
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,923
WE DON'T NORMALLY COME HERE,

1423
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:54,300
BUT WE HEARD
YOU'D BE HERE TONIGHT.

1424
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,760
AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU

1425
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:58,162
FOR FINALLY PORTRAYING
A GAY MAN ON TV

1426
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,630
THAT'S NOT A STEREOTYPE.

1427
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:00,731
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1428
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,042
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO SAY.

1429
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:03,200
THANKS FOR SHOWING UP.

1430
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,269
I SAW YOU DID THE A.I.D.S. RIDE.

1431
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:07,204
IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE
HIGH-PROFILE CELEBRITIES

1432
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,338
STANDING UP FOR THE CAUSE.

1433
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:09,774
WELL, I'M NO ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

1434
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:10,908
YOU'RE REALLY BRAVE!

1435
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,209
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD.

1436
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,844
NAH. THE ONLY HARD PART

1437
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,155
WAS THE OTHER GUY'S 5:00 SHADOW.

1438
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:16,246
VERY SCRATCHY.

1439
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,848
I HAVE THE SAME
PROBLEM WITH HIM.

1440
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:20,651
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.

1441
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,887
THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO START.

1442
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,064
AND NOW, BACK TO MELROSE PLACE.

1443
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:41,405
GET READY TO MAKE TV HISTORY.

1444
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,109
I HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

1445
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,944
ME TOO.

1446
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,330
THEY CUT THE KISS.

1447
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,134
AFTER ALL THAT...

1448
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,239
COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1449
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:16,592
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY CUT THE KISS.

1450
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:31,822
INTO THE NETWORK WITH THE KISS, I HANDED

1451
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,724
BUT WE ALL KNEW
IT WASN'T A SURE THING.

1452
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,392
THEY GET FINAL CUT, NOT US.

1453
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,270
THEY COULD'VE AT LEAST LET US
KNOW THEY WERE GONNA CUT IT,

1454
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,796
SO THAT
WE COULD'VE FOUGHT FOR IT.

1455
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,898
YOU COULD'VE FOUGHT FOR IT.

1456
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,133
HEY, I FIGHT FOR THIS SHOW
EVERY WEEK.

1457
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:46,470
YOU FIGHT FOR RATINGS
AND CLEAVAGE.

1458
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:49,740
THIS WAS ABOUT SOMETHING MORE.

1459
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,876
YOU KNOW THAT.

1460
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,744
OF COURSE I DO.

1461
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:55,045
THEN WHY DO I FEEL LIKE

1462
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,015
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT SEEMS TO CARE?

1463
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,774
HI, IT'S BARBARA.

1464
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:24,909
I GOT THE SCRIPTS,

1465
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,176
AND I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THEM.

1466
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,045
DID YOU READ THEM?

1467
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,847
YEAH. SOME OF THEM
ARE BARELY IN ENGLISH.

1468
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,849
I'VE SEEN BETTER WRITING
ON BATHROOM WALLS.

1469
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:33,918
THOSE ARE HOT PROJECTS
RIGHT NOW.

1470
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,453
WELL, THAT'S DEPRESSING.

1471
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,089
AND IT'S NOT THE KIND
OF MATERIAL I'M INTERESTED IN.

1472
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:41,125
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

1473
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:43,093
I WANT TO DO MOVIES
THAT SAY SOMETHING.

1474
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,461
WELL, NO ONE IS INTERESTED

1475
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,831
IN MAKING ISSUE
PICTURES RIGHT NOW.

1476
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,799
SO, I DON'T KNOW,
WHY NOT DO SOME

1477
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,936
WHERE YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY
FROM AN EXPLOSION IN SLOW-MO?

1478
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,303
AND IF THEY'RE HITS,

1479
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:56,040
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER ARTSY JUNK YOU WANT.

1480
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:57,207
OKAY?

1481
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,976
OKAY.

1482
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00,077
WELL, THANKS.

1483
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,545
BYE.

1484
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:06,884
OKAY, LET'S SEE IT.

1485
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:09,954
SO AFTER MARCIA
PULLS HER WIG OFF...

1486
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,321
THIS IS WHAT WE SEE.

1487
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,159
WHAT IS THIS?

1488
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,428
KIMBERLY WAS IN
A CAR CRASH AND A COMA.

1489
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,097
SHE'S BASICALLY
RISEN FROM THE DEAD.

1490
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,099
THIS LOOKS LIKE
SHE GRAZED A TREE BRANCH.

1491
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,968
I ASSURE YOU THIS SCAR
IS VERY ACCURATE.

1492
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,170
THIS IS WHAT THEY
LOOK LIKE IN REAL LIFE.

1493
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,439
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT REAL LIFE?

1494
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,941
THIS IS MELROSE PLACE.

1495
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:35,212
I THINK WE SHOULD
START BREAKING STORYLINES

1496
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:36,413
FOR NEXT SEASON.

1497
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,015
YOU WANNA WAIT
FOR A RENEWAL, OR...?

1498
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:39,884
MM. I'M A PLANNER.

1499
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,952
- OH!
- AH. SHOW US.

1500
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,489
THAT LOOKS GOOD. IT'S... CUTE.

1501
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,925
YOU UNDERSTAND TELEVISION'S
A VISUAL MEDIUM, RIGHT?

1502
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,861
I'M SORRY, WAS THAT
A TRICK QUESTION, OR...?

1503
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:53,030
LET'S MAKE IT BIGGER.

1504
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,502
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

1505
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,470
BIGGER IS BETTER.

1506
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,240
SO I'VE HEARD.

1507
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:05,575
I LIKE 'EM BOTH.

1508
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,344
HEATHER, WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?

1509
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:08,879
- LET'S DO THIS.
- OKAY.

1510
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:10,314
YEAH. YOU LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING.

1511
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:13,017
WHOA...

1512
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,885
THAT'S A SCAR!

1513
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:16,453
LET'S MAKE IT TWICE AS WIDE,

1514
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:17,988
AND WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

1515
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,168
DON'T WORRY.
WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.

1516
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,028
THANK GOD!

1517
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:25,896
BUT KIMBERLY SHAW...

1518
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,598
NOW, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

1519
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,628
- OH, MY GOD!
- UGH, GROSS!

1520
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:01,331
I THINK I'M GONNA HURL.

1521
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:02,632
GABLE?

1522
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,268
SILVERMAN?

1523
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,236
BIGGEST RATINGS SO FAR!

1524
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,471
NICE!

1525
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,206
AUDIENCE GOES CRAZY!

1526
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,442
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GIVE UP.

1527
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:14,478
LET'S JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

1528
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,947
GO CRAZY.

1529
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:17,914
NO, NO, NO!

1530
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:18,915
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

1531
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:19,816
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS.

1532
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,952
COME ON, LOOK AT ME...

1533
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,487
WHAT'S UP?

1534
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,256
WHOA!

1535
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,557
MATT GET GAY-BASHED AGAIN?

1536
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,393
KIMBERLY HIRED SOME GOONS.

1537
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,494
WHAT'S NEXT?

1538
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,662
HO, HO.

1539
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:33,964
DANCE PARTY.

1540
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:34,965
YOU KNOW, THERE'S,
LIKE, A DANCE-OFF.

1541
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,066
DANCE OFF.

1542
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,643
THEN MATT SHOCKS EVERYONE
AND COMES OUT AS STRAIGHT.

1543
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,003
THAT'S RIGHT!

1544
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:40,446
WOULDN'T THAT BE
AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY?

1545
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,506
OH, A MYSTERIOUS
OLDER WOMAN ARRIVES,

1546
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,374
BUT SHE'S BILLY'S ACTUAL MOTHER.

1547
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:45,342
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- AND...

1548
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,111
...HIS FATHER.

1549
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:48,712
RIGHT? WHO'S DONE THAT BEFORE?

1550
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:51,648
NOBODY! NOBODY! JUST US.

1551
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,984
LOOK AT THAT HUGE BELLY.

1552
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:57,154
I HOPE NOBODY TRIES
TO STEAL MY BABY.

1553
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:00,257
WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING?

1554
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,663
DID YOU SEE THAT?

1555
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,032
AMANDA AND KIMBERLY

1556
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:10,134
ADOPT THE SAME
CHILD FROM AFRICA.

1557
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,268
FROM AFRICA!

1558
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,536
CATFIGHT.

1559
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,004
"WHOOPS! DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING."

1560
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,406
OH. THAT'S SOME
OUTFIT YOU'VE GOT THERE.

1561
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,641
I KNOW.

1562
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:19,443
I WAS AFRAID IT WASN'T
GONNA BE TASTEFUL...

1563
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,278
BUT THANK GOD.

1564
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,047
I WISH I GOT TO BE A HOOKER.

1565
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,250
I KNOW. IT'S EVERY GIRL'S DREAM.

1566
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,152
SO WE DO A FULL RENOVATION
OF MELROSE PLACE,

1567
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,865
AND WHEN THEY KNOCK DOWN
THE WALLS... BOOM!

1568
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:31,521
EVIL SPIRITS!

1569
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,460
HEY, HEY. CHECK IT OUT.

1570
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,462
I WISH I COULD GET SHOT.

1571
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,297
I KNOW. MAYBE NEXT SEASON.

1572
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,432
DOUG AND BILLY
ARE PLAYING TENNIS,

1573
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:45,035
AND IT'S ALL INNOCENT
UNTIL DOUG WHIPS THE RACKET

1574
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:47,304
AND KILLS BILLY ON THE COURT.

1575
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,338
JUST...

1576
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,174
DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT...

1577
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:52,042
BUT IT'S LIKE A DRIVE-BY.

1578
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,556
"GAME, SET, MATCH"
IS WHAT WE CALL IT.

1579
01:06:58,482 --> 01:06:59,616
IS IT JUST ME,

1580
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,185
OR DOES MY CANCER MAKE-UP

1581
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:02,186
LOOK JUST LIKE
YOUR HANGOVER MAKE-UP?

1582
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,420
IT DOES,

1583
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,323
BUT YOU'RE STILL THE SEXIEST
CHEMO PATIENT I'VE EVER SEEN.

1584
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:10,026
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M A BITCH,
AND BITCHES STAY SEXY!

1585
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,263
SO, KIMBERLY TIES
SYDNEY TO A PLANE

1586
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:14,731
AND CRASHES IT
INTO MELROSE PLACE.

1587
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,133
- IT'S GENIUS.
- GENIUS.

1588
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,135
WE'LL NEVER THINK OF
A CRAZIER FINALE.

1589
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,703
WE NEED TO THINK
OF ANOTHER FINALE.

1590
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,472
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

1591
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:24,341
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

1592
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,785
WE GOT TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

1593
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,611
SERIOUSLY?

1594
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,313
WE'VE ALREADY HAD

1595
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:31,181
A HITWOMAN TRY AND
BLOW JAKE UP ON A BOAT,

1596
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,683
A DRUG DEALER TRY
AND KILL JO ON A BOAT.

1597
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:36,220
PETER TRY AND GIVE
AMANDA A LOBOTOMY.

1598
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:37,597
KIMBERLY RUN OVER
MICHAEL WITH A CAR...

1599
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,823
DON'T FORGET SYDNEY
ABDUCTED BY A CULT.

1600
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,725
RIGHT! SO WE CAME UP
WITH ALL THAT STUFF,

1601
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,527
THERE SHOULD BE MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

1602
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,796
SYDNEY COULD BE
ABDUCTED BY A CULT...

1603
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,232
...ON A BOAT.

1604
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:49,499
OR, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1605
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,211
THERE'S ALWAYS PLUMBING
PROBLEMS AT MELROSE PLACE.

1606
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:53,103
RIGHT? KIMBERLY COULD
POISON THE WATER SUPPLY.

1607
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:54,504
NOT VISUAL ENOUGH.

1608
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,140
WHAT IF WE FILLED
THE POOL WITH ACID

1609
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:57,574
AND PUSHED EVERYBODY IN?

1610
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,152
OH! THAT'S GOOD.
OR, UH, PIRANHAS.

1611
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:01,178
I MEAN,
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT VISUAL.

1612
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,146
DO WE WANT THAT MANY
PIRANHAS ON ACID?

1613
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:03,447
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

1614
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:07,384
YOU KNOW, AS
EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN?

1615
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,686
GUYS, THAT'S OVER-THE-TOP,
EVEN FOR US.

1616
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,521
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

1617
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:13,390
NEW SEASON FINALE.

1618
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,624
SOMETHING AS CRAZY

1619
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,526
AS A PLANE
FLYING INTO THE COMPLEX,

1620
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,663
BUT NOT AS CRAZY
AS DEATH BY PIRANHAS.

1621
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,532
LET'S SHOOT
FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

1622
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,808
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

1623
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,844
NO WORRIES. TRAFFIC IS AWFUL.

1624
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:36,680
I COULD'VE WALKED HERE FASTER.

1625
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,282
WHO AM I KIDDING?

1626
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,684
NOT IN THESE SHOES.

1627
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:42,419
SO WHAT'S UP?

1628
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,289
YOU SOUNDED SO SERIOUS
ON THE PHONE,

1629
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:46,856
WHICH IS SO NOT LIKE YOU.

1630
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,826
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE.

1631
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,829
I CAN BE VERY SERIOUS SOMETIMES.

1632
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,398
OH. WELL...

1633
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:55,732
NOTED.

1634
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,601
WHEN WE FIRST MET,

1635
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,303
I HAD JUST STARTED ON A HIT SHOW

1636
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:00,737
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE.

1637
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,772
YOU HELPED ME NAVIGATE

1638
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,809
THROUGH SITUATIONS
THAT CAME ALONG WITH THAT.

1639
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,944
BUT...

1640
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,248
WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT WAYS
OF DOING BUSINESS.

1641
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,583
AND, UH, WE DON'T
SEEM TO COMMUNICATE.

1642
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,385
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

1643
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,522
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR YOU...

1644
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,290
I DIDN'T ASK
IF YOU RESPECTED ME.

1645
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,660
I'M SUGGESTING
WE PART WAYS PROFESSIONALLY.

1646
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:27,497
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

1647
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,433
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

1648
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:32,669
IT'S "SHOW BUSINESS,"
NOT "SHOW FRIENDS."

1649
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,473
HMM.

1650
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,443
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE...

1651
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:43,680
YOU'RE BUYING LUNCH.

1652
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:45,915
AND I'M HAVING THE LOBSTER.

1653
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,357
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

1654
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,491
THE IRONY IS

1655
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,393
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
RESPECTED YOU MORE

1656
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:58,362
HAD YOU SAID IT.

1657
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,630
LOOKS GREAT.

1658
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,232
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR
WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED

1659
01:10:02,266 --> 01:10:03,500
FOR THE SEASON FINALE.

1660
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,668
I WANT TO HEAR IT,

1661
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,370
BUT FIRST I WANT TO
HEAR THE STORY IDEAS

1662
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,638
FOR THE MODELS, INC.
SPIN-OFF WE TALKED ABOUT.

1663
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,440
I DON'T KNOW...

1664
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:12,576
A SPIN-OFF OF A SPIN-OFF?

1665
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:14,378
OUR AUDIENCE MIGHT GET DIZZY.

1666
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:15,745
DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

1667
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,914
I LOVE 90210.

1668
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,649
I LOVE MELROSE PLACE,

1669
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,251
BUT I'VE TOLD YOU...

1670
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:22,919
I WANT TO BRANCH OUT.

1671
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,854
THIS IS BRANCHING OUT!

1672
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,590
THE FASHION WORLD IS CUT-THROAT.

1673
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,525
THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES THERE.

1674
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,793
I'M SURE THERE ARE,

1675
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:31,295
BUT I FEEL LIKE
IT'S ALL IN THE SAME

1676
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:33,263
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL WHEELHOUSE.

1677
01:10:33,297 --> 01:10:35,399
IT'LL BE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.

1678
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,501
YES, THOSE CHARACTERS
WILL BE SEXY,

1679
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:40,270
BUT YOU CAN DECIDE
HOW AND WHY THEY'RE SEXY.

1680
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,938
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT
THE CHARACTERS.

1681
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,840
EXACTLY.
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING!

1682
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:44,974
I DO, BUT...

1683
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,810
THIS IDEA IS A WINNER, DARREN.

1684
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,279
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT MELROSE,
WASN'T I?

1685
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,548
WE BROUGHT HEATHER ON,
MADE IT A NIGHT-TIME SOAP,

1686
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,283
AND IT'S A HUGE, HUGE HIT.

1687
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:55,285
WELL, THIS WILL BE, TOO.

1688
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,821
I'M SURE IT WILL BE, I JUST...

1689
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,958
MAYBE I NEED SOME MORE
TIME TO THINK IT THROUGH.

1690
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,827
WE'RE ON A SCHEDULE.

1691
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,028
I KNOW.

1692
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,363
I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW.

1693
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,497
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

1694
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,998
UH-HUH.

1695
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:20,977
YOU NEED HELP?

1696
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,413
NAH, I'M JUST CLEANING
OUT THE TRAILER.

1697
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,717
I CANNOT WAIT FOR HIATUS.
ONLY ONE MORE WEEK.

1698
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:29,619
YOU GOT ANY BIG PLANS?

1699
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,622
OF COURSE.

1700
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:34,324
YOUR FOUNDATION.

1701
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:36,660
AND IF YOU GOT SOME EXTRA TIME,
WE COULD USE THE HELP.

1702
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,962
SURE! BUT I WANT A T-SHIRT.

1703
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,497
YOU JUST WATCH.

1704
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,799
IT IS GONNA GO
WORLDWIDE SOMEDAY.

1705
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:48,338
I THINK MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT
THIS WHOLE CELEBRITY THING

1706
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:50,374
IS USING IT
FOR CAUSES I CARE ABOUT.

1707
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:51,908
YOU REALIZE WE JUST SOUNDED LIKE

1708
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:54,344
A PUBLIC SERVICE
ANNOUNCEMENT, RIGHT?

1709
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:56,780
YEAH, WE DID, DIDN'T WE?

1710
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,517
COME ON, LET'S GO
GET PLASTIC SURGERY

1711
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,752
AND ADOPT A FEW ETHNIC BABIES.

1712
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,120
NEW YORK!

1713
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,230
AARON, IT'S
NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

1714
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,791
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE GOING TO NEW YORK?

1715
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,793
NOT RIGHT AWAY,
BUT WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS.

1716
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,060
I TOLD YOU,

1717
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:13,062
THAT IF CBS PICKED UP
CENTRAL PARK WEST,

1718
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,498
I WOULD HAVE TO HEAD OVER THERE.

1719
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:15,799
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

1720
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,067
YOU STILL STUCK ON
MAKING "IMPORTANT" TELEVISION?

1721
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:19,669
YOU WANT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL?

1722
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:22,839
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
THE WHEEL IS FINE THE WAY IT IS?

1723
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,474
I'M NOT TRYING
TO REINVENT ANYTHING...

1724
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,918
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.

1725
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,444
I JUST WANT TO SEE

1726
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:29,779
IF I CAN BUILD A BETTER WHEEL
ON MY OWN.

1727
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,047
BESIDES, I CAN STILL

1728
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,049
CONSULT ON 90210
AND MELROSE PLACE.

1729
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,453
I GIVE PEOPLE THE SHOES
AND THEY USE THEM TO WALK AWAY.

1730
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,054
AARON, I HAVE SPENT
MANY YEARS WITH YOU,

1731
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,056
AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL.

1732
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,761
I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

1733
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:47,597
YOU, MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE,
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

1734
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,973
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY UPSET.

1735
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,079
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

1736
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,649
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN TALK
IN THE MORNING.

1737
01:13:22,599 --> 01:13:24,100
HOW'D IT GO?

1738
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,436
I WAS RIGHT. HE'S LEAVING.

1739
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,838
DARREN'S ALWAYS
BEEN IN MY CORNER,

1740
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:30,440
BUT HE HAS NO CLUE

1741
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:32,676
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO CLIMB INTO THE RING WITH ME.

1742
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:40,450
SO YOU FIRED BARBARA?

1743
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:41,985
WOW.

1744
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,887
WASN'T THAT BAD.

1745
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,154
IT WAS A GOOD LESSON FOR ME,

1746
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,591
STANDING UP FOR MYSELF.

1747
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:48,892
YOU'VE LEARNED A LOT

1748
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,594
SINCE YOUR FIRST DAY
ON SET, HUH?

1749
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:52,629
LIKE, HOPEFULLY HOW TO
SMOKE A PROP CIGARETTE.

1750
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,130
OH, MY GOD!
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

1751
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,632
YEAH. WHOEVER SAID
SMOKING CIGARETTES

1752
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:56,866
MAKES YOU LOOK COOL

1753
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,735
NEVER SAW YOU
ALMOST SWALLOW ONE.

1754
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,872
IT'S, UM, IT'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER HALF HOUR OR SO, GUYS,

1755
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:04,183
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO
GO BACK TO YOUR TRAILERS.

1756
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,975
I CAN HANG OUT?

1757
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,011
WE'LL HANG OUT.

1758
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:13,182
SO HOW'S EVERYTHING BEEN GOING?

1759
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:14,884
I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN...

1760
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:16,620
TOUGH? YEAH.

1761
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:18,488
DIVORCE IS...

1762
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:20,957
IT'S... IT SUCKS.

1763
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,892
BUT WE'RE TRYING
TO KEEP EVERYTHING

1764
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,594
AS POSITIVE AS WE CAN.

1765
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,663
FOR THE GIRLS.

1766
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:31,234
THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN ALL THIS, YOU KNOW?

1767
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,672
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

1768
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,076
I'M JUST DOING THE BEST I CAN...

1769
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,812
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

1770
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,849
LIKE YOU.

1771
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:46,783
I KNOW IT CAN'T BE EASY,

1772
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,686
BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE
THAT YOU WORK WITH

1773
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:52,121
AND HAVE TO SEE EVERY DAY.

1774
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:55,792
I KNOW IT'S FOR THE BEST.

1775
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,963
GRANT AND I, WE JUST...

1776
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,065
WE WEREN'T RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

1777
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,001
YEAH.

1778
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,070
BREAK-UPS ARE COMPLICATED.

1779
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:11,107
OR SO I'VE HEARD.

1780
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,876
MY CHARACTER HASN'T GOTTEN PAST

1781
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:15,078
THE HAND-HOLDING STAGE
OF A RELATIONSHIP.

1782
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:19,949
WOW. THOSE ARE A LOT OF CANNONS.

1783
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:21,851
I MEAN, I WANT IT TO BE REAL,

1784
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:23,687
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SAFE.

1785
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,221
IT'LL BE SAFE,

1786
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,223
BUT WHENEVER YOU HAVE
THIS MANY PYROTECHNICS,

1787
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,692
THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK.

1788
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,827
EXACTLY HOW MUCH RISK?

1789
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,271
I'M NOT PUTTING ANY OF
MY PEOPLE IN DANGER.

1790
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:33,563
I CAN'T TELL YOU

1791
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:35,699
HOW TIRED I AM
OF HIRING NEW ACTORS.

1792
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:36,866
DON'T WORRY.

1793
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,235
THIS IS THE BEST
CREW IN HOLLYWOOD.

1794
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,637
WE'VE HAD BIGGER EXPLOSIONS

1795
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,839
WITHOUT SO MUCH
AS A SINGED EYEBROW.

1796
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,641
I'M SURE YOU HAVE,

1797
01:15:44,674 --> 01:15:46,042
BUT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

1798
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,677
IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST
EXPENSIVE COOKOUT

1799
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,646
IN TV HISTORY.

1800
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:53,316
WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF
GAS LINE THEY'RE LAYING.

1801
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:56,853
I'M AN EXTREMELY
THOROUGH PSYCHOPATH.

1802
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,722
YOUR CHARACTER IS A NUT JOB.

1803
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:00,156
I BET WHEN
YOU SIGNED ON FOR THIS,

1804
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,258
YOU HAD NO IDEA
SHE'D GET THIS CRAZY.

1805
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,860
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T.

1806
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,662
AND YET YOU PLAY HER

1807
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:08,297
WITHOUT MAKING HER
A-A CARTOON CHARACTER.

1808
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:10,166
HOW?

1809
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:13,002
I JUST PLAY HER

1810
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:14,838
AS IF I WERE
READING SHAKESPEARE.

1811
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:17,907
WHEN KIMBERLY STARTED,

1812
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:20,109
SHE WAS SOMEONE
WITH A CONSCIENCE,

1813
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:21,911
A LONELY DOCTOR,

1814
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:24,213
WHO FELL IN LOVE
WITH A MARRIED MAN.

1815
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,149
THEN SHE GOT THE HEAD INJURY,

1816
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,051
AND, WELL... TSK.

1817
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,019
I LIKE TO THINK
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON,

1818
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,621
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING PRESSING

1819
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:33,657
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HER BRAIN.

1820
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,725
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOUR ACTING,

1821
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:38,227
BECAUSE THESE SCRIPTS ARE
NOT EXACTLY SHAKESPEARE.

1822
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,939
NO, BUT HOW GOOD WOULD
THOSE PLAYS HAVE BEEN

1823
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:42,098
IF HE HAD TO WRITE
32 OF THEM A YEAR?

1824
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,634
GIVEN THAT,

1825
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:46,770
THERE ARE SOME GREAT TWISTS.

1826
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,104
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1827
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,906
IT'S NEVER DULL AROUND
HERE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

1828
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,040
- RIGHT?
- NO.

1829
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:57,113
BEST CREW IN HOLLYWOOD, HUH?

1830
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,282
IT'S FINE.
IT'S JUST A FLASH TEST.

1831
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,261
THAT WINDOW'S GONNA BLOW OUT.

1832
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,330
THAT DOOR IS GONNA
COME OFF ITS FRAME.

1833
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,799
FLAMES SHOOTING OUT,

1834
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,333
AND THE WHOLE THING'S
GONNA COME DOWN.

1835
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,435
KIMBERLY'S GONNA
LEAP INTO THE POOL.

1836
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,170
DEBRIS IS GONNA FALL.
"IS SHE ALL RIGHT?"

1837
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:23,773
WE DON'T KNOW.

1838
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,386
THEY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS.

1839
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,888
IT'S THE BEST CREW.

1840
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:40,990
THIS IS WHERE YOU BLOW UP
YOUR NETWORK EXEC.

1841
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,226
YOU'LL BE FINE! DON'T WORRY.

1842
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,894
EVERYTHING IS AS SAFE AS CAN BE.

1843
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,731
OH, MY GOSH!

1844
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:50,976
WITH ALL THESE EXPLOSIONS
AND FLASH TESTS,

1845
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:51,901
I'M GONNA BE A NERVOUS WRECK!

1846
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:53,002
I KNOW.

1847
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,114
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS MANY
PEOPLE ON OUR SET BEFORE?

1848
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,740
NO.

1849
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,441
I JUST HOPE THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

1850
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:00,276
ONE MISSED MARK AND SOMEONE

1851
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,845
IS GONNA END UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

1852
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,255
I THINK THAT'S WHY
ALL THE FIREMEN ARE HERE.

1853
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,981
AND TO BE HONEST,
I WOULDN'T MIND

1854
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,983
A LITTLE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

1855
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,120
LOOK AT THE CREW HOLDING
ALL THAT PROP DEBRIS

1856
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:12,865
THEY GET TO THROW AT US
DURING THE EXPLOSION.

1857
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:13,990
OH, GREAT.

1858
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,259
LOOKS LIKE PAYBACK TIME.

1859
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:19,695
YEAH, THEY SEEM
A LITTLE TOO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

1860
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,433
ANYWAY, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

1861
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:30,106
I'M TELLING YOU,
THEY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS.

1862
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:36,813
ALL RIGHT,
I NEED EVERYBODY ON POINT

1863
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,514
AND PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION.

1864
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,018
PLEASE STAY ON YOUR MARKS
AND DO NOT MISS YOUR CUES.

1865
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,296
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1866
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,932
I'M GOING TO DIE
WITHOUT WINNING A TONY.

1867
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,400
HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!

1868
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:04,440
ACTORS READY?

1869
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,408
PYROTECHNICS READY?

1870
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,475
READY!

1871
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:09,045
AND ROLL CAMERA. SLATE IT.

1872
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:16,219
HEY, CAN I GET A LITTLE MORE
QUIET ON THE SET, PLEASE?

1873
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,021
QUIET ON SET!

1874
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,288
QUIET!

1875
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:25,094
ON MY CALL.

1876
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:29,232
ACTION.

1877
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,523
OKAY. CUT.

1878
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,392
CUT!

1879
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:31,227
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

1880
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,528
CUT THE FIRE.

1881
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,197
COMING AT IT.
EXTINGUISHERS FLYING IN.

1882
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,104
THAT WAS FUN.

1883
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,841
MARCIA?

1884
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:49,345
MARCIA!

1885
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,314
MARCIA!

1886
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,283
OH, MY GOD! MARCIA! MARCIA!

1887
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:58,421
COME HERE, COME HERE.

1888
01:20:58,454 --> 01:20:59,454
PLEASE TELL ME WE GOT IT?

1889
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:04,560
WE GOT IT.

1890
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,262
EVERYBODY'S OKAY.

1891
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:15,604
- WHOO!
- YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

1892
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:19,943
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

1893
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:22,478
GOOD JOB!

1894
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,447
NICE. COME ON. LET'S
GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

1895
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,448
THATTA GIRL.

1896
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:27,183
IT'S OVER.

1897
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,191
RECENTLY, YOU THOUGHT

1898
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,601
YOU WERE GONNA BE
WRITTEN OFF THIS SHOW?

1899
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,027
HEY, THEY STILL COULD.

1900
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:40,063
KIMBERLY MIGHT NOT
COME OUT OF THAT POOL ALIVE.

1901
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,164
SOMETHING TELLS ME

1902
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:45,068
KIMBERLY CAN HOLD HER BREATH
JUST AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

1903
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:47,203
YOU WERE TERRIFIC.

1904
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,337
YOU ALL WERE!

1905
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:50,106
WONDERFUL JOB, EVERYBODY.

1906
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,008
THIS WAS FANTASTIC.

1907
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,043
OUR FANS ARE GONNA LOVE THIS.

1908
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:59,448
I THINK WE CAN TRULY SAY
WE MADE SOMETHING UNFORGETTABLE.

1909
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:03,619
WONDERFUL JOB. WONDERFUL.

1910
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,021
THANK YOU!

1911
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:08,958
WONDERFUL. LAURA, FANTASTIC.

1912
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:13,329
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS
LOCKED UP FOR CLOSE-UPS.

1913
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:15,398
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

1914
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,200
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF.

1915
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,410
REALLY? WE ONLY GOT
A COUPLE MORE SHOTS

1916
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,502
AND WE'RE DONE.

1917
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:20,645
YEAH, I KNOW. I'LL SEE EVERYBODY

1918
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:22,571
AT THE WRAP PARTY,
