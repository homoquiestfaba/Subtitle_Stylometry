do not mistrust each other

5

We are armed

6
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,847

Mr. Gorbachev

00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,429
tear down this wall!

In November 1989, after 28 years,

10
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:04,158
the Berlin Wall fell
and the cold war ended.

- James damn Gascoigne ...

15
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,991
- How did you find me?

16
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,802
"Maybe you're such a good spy."
how much she thinks.

17
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,634
It was Satchel, was not it?

18
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,476
Satchel betrayed me.

19
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:26,633
I always thought that if I got caught,
it would be for the best

20
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:29,554
But are not you the best, Bakhtin?

21
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,785
You're the biggest bastard in the entire KGB.

22
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,102

Where is C.?

29
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:15,591
Given the recent events in the world,
C. will not join us.

30
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,023
Yes of course.

31
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:34,651
The recorded voices are as follows,
I, senior director and officer Eric Gray,

32
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,103
our American guest Emmett Kurzfeld,

33
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:39,470
the CIA,

34
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,533
and returning British operations
Officer Lorraine Broughton.

35
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,571
Before you begin Lord,
I formally request

36
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,143
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed
the meeting.

37
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,206
Request rejected.

38
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:50,340
"What I have to tell you,
is not intended for the CIA.

39
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:53,070
Lorraine, you're the subject of this meeting.

40
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:55,333
You have no control.
- I get it.

41
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:57,055
"I was there in Berlin.

42
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:01,048
I am here with full executive power
of Langley.

43
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:05,137
If it makes you more comfortable, I can stay
behind the mirror with everyone else

44
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:08,033
But it's a little crowded there.

45
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:12,355
Sucks cock

46
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,713
What did you say?

47
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,071
I said nothing.

48
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,102
Sorry, did you say something, Lorraine?

49
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,087
"Did you hear me say anything?"
"I thought you said something."

50
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,175
What she said?

51
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,380
- What?

52
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,849
Good...

53
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,492
Do you want to hear the recording?

54
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,087
Well then,

55
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:43,603
Let's start?

56
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:48,032
Berlin.

57
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:50,460
- What happened?

58
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:51,810
Yes...

59
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,777
Hm, Berlin ...

60
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,784
Shit.

61
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:07,171
THE BEGINNING

62
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,816
Ah, Lorraine,

63
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:12,211
"Sorry for bringing you last minute."

64
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,881
- You know C.

65
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:17,037
- Yes.
- We were looking at your file.

66
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,053
"Your Russian is excellent."

67
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,299
"You're a specialist in running away."

68
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:23,734
Proficient in data collection

69
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,154
and hand-to-hand combat.

70
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,399
It is an impressive set of skills

71
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,507
And knowing the reasons I know

72
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:32,328
Is she going to need all of them?

73
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,368
I think straight to the point

74
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:37,052
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

75
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,126
Enough to greet you.

76
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,234
We work in Instanbul in 85.

77
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,379
He is dead.

78
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:48,333
Gascoigne was killed last night
during a mission in Berlin.

79
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,760
The West German police fished
Spree body this morning.

80
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,792
The coroner extracted a
7.8 mm Tokarev bullet

81
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,142
of the skull base.

82
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,515
Soviets.

83
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:04,262
- Yesterday Gascoigne had a meeting with
a Stasi officer codenamed Spyglass.

84
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,816
We promise Spyglass immunity in
exchange of a document in microfilm,

85
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,515
codename The list.

86
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,579
Hidden in a Swiss watch.

87
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,864
The list contains all the official
active clandestine

88
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,460
all their suspected cases.

89
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,610
It's an atomic bomb full of information

90
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,357
which could extend the Cold War
for another 40 years.

91
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,468
- And we believe that the man who
killed Gascoigne, now he's got it.

92
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,205
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin,

93
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:34,386
a KGB killer with more than a dozen
of confirmed murders.

94
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,035
"So you want me in Moscow?"

95
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,926
- No.
Bakhtin never stepped on the plane.

96
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,810
So he's still in Berlin with the list.

97
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,466
Everyone is hunting her,
the Yankees, the French.

98
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:49,317
"The Soviets, of course.
"And our man, Percival

99
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,921
"Who is Percival?"
- David Percival.

100
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,262
He's our number one in Berlin.

101
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,324
He is your contact there.

102
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,801

103
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,966

104

<i> And you? What do you have for me? </I>

105
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,682
Straight from the breast of the Virgin Mary.

EAST BERLIN

107
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,031
A Jordache was not easy.

108
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,602
It's for my wife's birthday.

109
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,968
- This is really cool, but
Where's the fucking list?

110
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,849
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne
last night.

111
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,317
James did not show up.

112
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:42,856
I did my part.
I gave the list to him.

113
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:46,840
You have to cross me and my family,
it is not safer for us here.

114
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,245
The Russians have an eye on me.

115
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,768
No list, no agreement.

116
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:54,624
- I risked everything.
- No list, no agreement.

117
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,890
Listen to Spyglass well without this list

118
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:59,505
Why should not I take you outside?
and shoot the shit out of your head?

119
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,363
Are you going to kill a Stasi officer?

120
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,555
One that is about to run away
to the west? Yes.

121
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,110
"Without the embassy taking care of him,

122
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,562
Percival became a little native.

123
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,165
- Totally wild.

124
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,269
"Berlin is the wild west."

125
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:15,698
When this cursed war begins,
We do not want to be around.

126
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,500
"If the Russians get this list,
we are all in trouble

127
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:19,627
- On both sides.

128
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:22,879
You're Elisabeth Loyd.

129
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:26,515
Lawyer graduated from Cambridge,
sent by the family of James Gascoigne

130
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,523
to recover the body and the possessions of
his late deceased son.

131
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,896
Your mission is to contact
with Percival

132
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,245
and do whatever it takes
to bring the list home.

133
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,713
"And remember, Lorraine,

134
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,356
This is extremely sensitive.

135

"You told me you made a copy."
I memorized it.

139
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:54,317
- You remember?
Each of the agents on the list!

- Okay, I'll take you across the border.
"You're a good person, Percival.

Fuck you!

Stop now!

00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:50,402
- Faster here!

Beautiful restaurants.

00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,769
Five minutes after landing
and I was discovered.

182
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,331
You were not discovered.

183
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,936
"They knew my name.
- This is worrying.

184
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:04,833
- And yours.
- Hardly surprising.

185
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,546
What an excellent start, Percival.

186
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,479
So what was your first impression?

187
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:20,512
From David?

188
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,873
He was handsome, over 30,

189
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,020
hair disaster Sinéad O'Connor.

190
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,032
Irish singer.

191
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,933
I asked him which
the business, and he told me.

192
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,070
It's mixing.

193
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,443
Do you want to feel?

194
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:42,023
You must blend in the east.

195
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:50,348
By the way, he was stuck at the gate.
I mean, how the hell,

196
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:53,214
the bosses think you can
help me find this list?

197
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:55,279
Once you recover
the Gascoigne body,

198
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,396
Your visa is void and you
back on the first plane.

199
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:00,625
- I will find out.
- This is Checkpoint Charlie.

200
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,918
My office is back there.

201
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:04,831
- I'm not here to collect
Postcards, Percival.

202
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,144
Just take me to my hotel,
in the corner.

203
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,611
I thought you said never
to have come to Berlin.

204
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:11,270
I can read a damn map!

205
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,199
This will only take a minute.

206
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,771
SOVIET COMMERCE MISSION

207
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,427
What are you doing?

208
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,134
Sending a message
for a fascist pig.

209
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:34,259
Send my regards to Comrade Bremovych.

210
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:45,042
BACK TO THE EAST

211
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,125
<i> So what do we have here? </i>

212
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,864
<i> Mr. Bremovych, </i>

213
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:53,006
<i> we arrest them doing
party last night. </i>

214
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,181
<i> - The future of West Germany. </i>

215
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,944
<i> You. </i>

216
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:04,137
<i> Get up.
Get up, I said! </I>

217
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,016
<i> Come here. </i>

218
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,184
<i> So you want to have fun, right? </i>

219
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:23,049
<i> Let's have fun. </i>

220
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,897
<i> What we have here. </i>

221
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:44,511
Come on, dance for me.

222
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,669
<i> The song is playing, right? </i>

223
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,190
<i> Give him a round of applause! </i>

224
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:08,292
<i> There was a man here last night ... </i>

225
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,546
a traitor

226
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:13,523
<i> Tell me where he is! </i>

227
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,404
<i> Where is Bakhtin? </i>

228
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,153
<i> Where is the list? </i>

229
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:38,603
<i> He never showed up,
Comrade Bremovych. </I>

230
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:44,389
<i> Capitalist bastard,
it will sell the list. </i>

231
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:48,112
<i> Find it! I want this list. </I>

232
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:50,470
<i> - Boris, give me that picture. </i>

233
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,802
Pay attention! </i>

234
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,638
<i> This man is a traitor. </i>

235
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,682
<i> Do you know him? </i>

236
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,592
<i> Tension is high in East Berlin </i>

237
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,401
<i> while civil disobedience
continues to increase. </i>

238
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,775
<i> These youth leaders in Berlin protest
through tear gas and water pistols </i>

239
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,331
<i> And there are countless
police reports </i>

240
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:24,221
<i> attacking peaceful demonstrators
with batons. </i>

241
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:59,824
I was sent to arrange the
return of a British citizen.

242
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,991
- The body is identified
by his attache.

243
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,459
"Yes, I believe that, too."

244
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,371
This was not a question,

245
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,619
was a statement

246
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,483
Was he your colleague?

247
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,126
Different departments.

248
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:19,467
Which department?
 - A different one.

249
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,237
Do you have the transfer papers?

250
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:41,883
You know the movies in which
images start to get slower

251
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:44,436
and melt ...

252
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,461
And then they catch fire?

253
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:50,929
Good...

254
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,612
this is Berlin.

255
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:58,585
- The passport number is not correct.

256
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:01,599
I will not release this body
without the correct information.

257
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:03,275
It's a simple mistake.

258
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,092
Miss Loyd, we're in Germany.
we do not make simple mistakes.

259
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,808
I will not lie. I'm impressed.

260
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:08,236
You have a lot of balls
to invade here.

261
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,720
You should see my balls and stay
truly impressed.

262
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:12,814
I'll take your word for it.

263
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,861
I see you've figured out a way to stay,

264
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:17,268
You write 16 miniatures at 76.

265
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:18,473
That's right.

266
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,536
 I'm not going anywhere.

267
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,985
I stay here for at least another week.
- Lucky me.

268
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,204
They will not release the body now, not until
investigate the whole bureaucratic nightmare

269
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,063
How the hell did you get in here?

270
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:34,453
You know, I'm in Berlin for a long time.
and I believe, that I know every doorman

271
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,658
each decent bathroom

272
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,484
on both sides of the wall.

273
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,848
So you know Spyglass.

274
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,968
I never talked to the guy.

275
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:47,253
He heard about James.

276
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:52,459
What do you know about the woman who
Follow me from Tempelhof.

277
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:57,714
I'd say you're a
attractive woman and ...

278
00:25:57,752 --> 00:25:59,872
and should imagine the rest.

279
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:04,664
If I followed you, I mean,
how it should be,

280
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,878
You'd never know.

281
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,988
It's a piece of art, right?

282
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,806
Just like walking, playing or bagpipes ...

283
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:16,654
You can do it or you can not.

284
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,899
Your party.

285
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,357
I would like to buy a watch.

286
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:52,595
I need access to
a network in East Berlin.

287
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,134
Come back tomorrow before we close.

288
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,912
East Berlin is with short wick
tonight

289
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:05,785
while members of the Communist Party
have trouble maintaining order.

290
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,237
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

291
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:09,372
He is dead.

292
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:13,252
<i> The coroner has found
Tokarev 7.62 mm bullet </i>

293
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,594
<i> at the base of the skull. </i>

294
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,117
Soviets

295
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,212
We know who Satchel is.

296
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,703
We have to get away.

297
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,644
You hoped to find the list
in the Gascoigne apartment.

298
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,907
Did you realize that I was
late for the party

299
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,336
The Russians before anyone
they should have ransacked the place.

300
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:42,577
- Yes.

301
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,524
But the list was not our only problem.

302
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,410
Before I leave,
he told me one more thing.

303
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:57,008
That's why I did not want the CIA
was present.

304
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,020
Spyglass revealed that this list

305
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,190
would unmask a dual agent
called Satchel.

306
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:09,702
- I want Satchel, dead or alive.

307
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,432
This traitor has been a thorn
on our side for years.

308
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,810
He is a point of shame
to the Crown.

309
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:19,548
And the biggest point of leaked information
in the history of MI6.

310
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:22,960
You're going to expose that bastard, Satchel.

311
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,619
And we'll hang you for treason.

312
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:29,903
Who knows, you find yourself drinking
tea at Buckingham Palace.

313
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,492
- Then no.

314
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:36,690
I did not just look for the list
in the Gascoigne apartment.

315
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,689
- <i> Go ahead, bring it back. </i>

316
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:56,921
- <i> Action! </i>

317
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:01,935
Percival and I apparently had one
different definition of cooperation.

318
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,293
- ... on third floor.
"Climb up the stairs quickly!"

319
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:06,206
- What do you mean by that?

320
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,355
He was the only one who knew that I had gone
to the apartment of Gascoigne.

321
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,807
If I had known he would call the police,

322
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:15,214
I would have worn a different outfit.

323
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:23,110
Different clothes ...

324
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,652
<i> Fast. I heard something. </I>

325
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,223
- Hey! Stop it!

326
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,286
<i> With repeated calls for change
on the streets </i>

327
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,829
<i> and the protesters every time
more confident </i>

328
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:50,353
<i> Time is running out for
Government of East Germany. </I>

329
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,872
<i> Public opinion is that the communist party </i>

330
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,754
<i> can not maintain leadership
for much longer </i>

331
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,451
<i> And if there is no change soon </i>

332
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,647
<i> today's calm protest </i>

333
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,180
<i> can be seen as the
calm before the storm. </i>

334
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,100
<i> It is not only by new faces that
they ask </i>

335
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,063
<i> but perhaps the complete demolition of the wall. </i>

336
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,984
May I take your coat?

337
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:48,589
Make yourself at home.

338
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:57,902
Holy shit ...

339
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,972
"You want Gin?"

340
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:03,349
- Feel free.

341
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:19,305
His library includes Larry Flint.

342
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,091
Freedom Champion
of expression.

343
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:29,214
What did you think about Bakhtin?

344
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,857
If Bakhtin wanted the Russians
get the list

345
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,341
he would have delivered it.

346
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:36,777
We just have to wait.
until it comes into play.

347
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:38,284
I can not wait.

348
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:39,916
This is your city, Percival.

349
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:43,046
You only know janitors and toilets.

350
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,129
And what you found
in the Gascoigne apartment?

351
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:52,129
What the German brand.

352
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,562
Passports in white, travel visa,

353
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:59,230
and a picture of you two together,
some years ago.

354
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,824
I did not mention that we were friends.

355
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:06,857
- No.
- No?

356
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,381
"I must have forgotten to say

357
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,117
OK dear.

358
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,865
I'm going for a walk.

359
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:27,229
Look, we are all
exposed by this list.

360
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,468
Save the world is cool and everything,

361
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,667
but my main goal is
keep me alive.

362
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,929
I'm now ten years old.
the location of Berlin.

363
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:36,866
You know that I'm the only one here
which can help you get that list.

364
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,499
Yes, I read your file.

365
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:40,428
I also read your DOG file.

366
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,635
So, let's cut the crap?

367
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:47,738
This hangover game,
I do not know what is up or down,

368
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,310
I'm not buying it.

369
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:52,135
I trust you so far.
as far as I can throw you.

370
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:55,160
"It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver."

371
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:59,763
Niccolò Machiavelli.
It's on your bookshelf.

372
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:04,240
-Oh my God. I think I love you.
- It is a pity.

373
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:09,047
If Percival was telling the truth
about Bakhtin,

374
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,991
I had to find out what the Russians knew.

375
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,999
Stoney with ice.

376
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,102
<i> Good evening, miss. </i>

377
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,246
"I'm not speaking German tonight.

378
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:23,674
So you're British.

379
00:37:23,872 --> 00:37:26,387
<i> Did you expect me to be Swedish? </i>

380
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,626
Very impressive.

381
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,318
"This can not be your only talent.

382
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:38,087
Talents are sometimes overrated.

383
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:43,500
But devotion and loyalty are
very rare nowadays.

384
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,217
Everyone here is looking for something.

385
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,341
- What are you looking for?

386
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,237
All well considered,

387
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:02,550
you would not say that deep down we are
looking for the same things?

388
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,864
I leave you alone for a moment.

389
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,952
 and you start attracting admirers?

390
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,119
Sir, three are not always too many.

391
00:38:17,524 --> 00:38:20,392
But tonight, it is.

392
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:22,066
French women

393
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:26,264
What about the British?

394
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,421
Maybe we can come to an agreement?

395
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,966
We have not seen each other for a long time,

396
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,015
and we really have to talk about it.

397
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:38,468
Alone.

398
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,674
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.

399
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:45,683
I'm sure we'll meet
again.

400
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,429
Excuse me.

401
00:38:58,745 --> 00:39:00,655
It seemed like you needed to be saved.

402
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,770
I appreciate the gesture, miss.

403
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,278
Lasalle ...

404
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:08,468
Delphine Lasalle.

405
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:10,666
Nice to meet you.

406
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:14,899
And what do you do, Delphine?

407
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,101
I am part-time interpreter,

408
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:18,378
who really wants to be a poet

409
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,447
 or maybe a rock star.

410
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,737
My friend has a club nearby.

411
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:28,816
You want to meet?

412
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,562
Now?
- Of course.

413
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:33,377
I can not.

414
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,237
"Well, I'll give you the address anyway.

415
00:39:37,504 --> 00:39:40,111
Then we'll see you there tomorrow night.

416
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:43,762
You will come?

417
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,389
Perhaps?

418
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:48,313
You are ruthless.

419
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:50,810
- Yes.

420
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,299
David Hasselhof is in town.

421
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:57,046
- Lucky us!

422
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,881
Berlin is really doomed.

423
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,249
Your watch is ready.

424
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:25,921
He is at the desk
on the blank envelope.

425
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,377
I believe you will find my
very helpful contact.

426
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,546
- <i> Your watch is ready. </i>

427
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:55,205
<i> He is at the counter.
on the blank envelope. </i>

428
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:59,801
<i> I believe you will find my
very helpful contact. </i>

429
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,976
<i> East Berliners invaded
Embassies of West Germany </i>

430
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,659
<i> in Czechoslovakia
earlier this week, </i>

431
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,438
<i> now the Czech government
began to pass refugees </i>

432
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,800
<i> without many questions for
control points. </i>

433
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:15,219
<i> You have to ask how long
the government of East Berlin </i>

434
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:18,412
<i> can stand the tide of workers
which continue to come out. </i>

435
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:39,242
Bakhtin and the list had not yet
appeared in the west.

436
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,289
I had to talk to my new contact

437
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:45,421
and find out what I was up against
in the east.

438
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:54,738
You should have requested a
visitor card.

439
00:41:55,937 --> 00:41:57,452
- What kind of job do you do?

440
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:58,920
- Legal Affairs.

441
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:09,744
If you do not return before 6 am,

442
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:13,294
You will be arrested.
Did you understand that?

443
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:15,371
I get it.

444
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,552
Right now I'm not much.
convinced of its history.

445
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:28,988
- Why did not you use the contacts
of Percival in the east?

446
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:31,408
- You told me...

447
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,535
to trust no one.

448
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,634
<i> - Hello. </i>

449
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:43,254
<i> I'm not sure, but
I believe it to be her. </I>

450
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:45,810
<i> She's on her way to Alexanderplatz. </i>

451
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:03,793
Bring it to me.

452
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:52,179
<i> You're coming with me. </i>

453
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:31,480
<i> Are you crazy? </i>

454
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,927
<i> He just wants to talk. </i>

455
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:59,809
- Come on, on the side!

456
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:45,595
You're late.

457
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:47,683
And it is being followed.

458
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm late because I was followed.

459
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:54,556
I missed them 20 minutes ago
near the Platz of Republik.

460
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,594
You're as good as your reputation.

461
00:46:57,132 --> 00:46:59,949
Are you sure this is the best
to meet us

462
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,521
Keep your enemy close.

463
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:06,108
I'm an effort now
for them.

464
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:11,543
The Watchmaker said that there is a lot of
black market interest

465
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:13,991
on this list in the last few days.

466
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:15,742
"Any sign of Bakhtin?"
- No.

467
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:20,477
This figure of Satchel leaves people
on both sides of the wall worried.

468
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:21,937
Yes.

469
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:24,969
What network did you gather?

470
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:28,658
There are many dissatisfied young

471
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,119
on this side of the wall.

472
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:35,973
They are like ...

473
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,023
new books.

474
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,054
If you find the right spark ...

475
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,285
Continues.

476
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:26,387
I want to sell a watch.

477
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:28,585
What do you have for sale?

478
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,634
It is extremely valuable,

479
00:48:31,873 --> 00:48:33,785
the highest quality and ...

480
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:36,651
full of secrets.

481
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:47,637
Would you mind if I inspected
the merchandise?

482
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:52,452
Of course I would mind.

483
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:55,914
Tell only potential buyers,

484
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:59,214
Bakhtin is open to business.

485
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,958
- <i> Ladies, Berlin is a small place. </i>

486
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:20,164
<i> - I'm sure we'll meet
again </i>

487
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:24,634
<i> Sorry. </i>

488
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:26,832
<i> It seemed like you needed to be saved. </i>

489
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,205
<i> My friend has a club nearby.
</i>

490
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,752
<i> Do you want to meet? </i>

491
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:54,833
I did not think you'd come.

492
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:59,397
Stoney with ice.

493
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,921
You're paying attention.

494
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:08,932
I seek pleasure in the details.

495
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:15,476
Now that we're talking about it ...

496
00:50:15,556 --> 00:50:18,881
I really want to ask you something.

497
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,584
Let's find a quiet place.

498
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,460
Why the gun, Delphine?

499
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,570
You're not so well disguised.
How much do you think?

500
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:05,213
I know who you are.

501
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:07,547
You are Lorraine Broughton, MI6.

502
00:51:07,587 --> 00:51:10,332
And you're here because of the
 death of Gascoigne.

503
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:14,277
What do you know about Gascoigne?

504
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:18,214
Anything.

505
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:21,062
When someone is killing
allied officers

506
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:22,634
Should not we all care?

507
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,633
Whatever you have on this list ...

508
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:29,571
people are willing to kill for it.

509
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,323
- It's my first job.
of the French secret service.

510
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:47,873
I'm only here for a year.

511
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:51,864
- I'm scared, okay?

512
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:54,681
I went into it because it was exciting,

513
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,984
but this was never the case in Berlin.

514
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:02,920
You should have become a poet.

515
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:08,799
Or a rock star.

516
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,349
So you made contact
with a French agent.

517
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:11,452
- Of course.

518
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,183
- Because?

519
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:18,484
I thought they would have information
which I could explore.

520
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,042
Nothing else.

521
00:53:21,017 --> 00:53:22,420
"And she had?"

522
00:53:26,816 --> 00:53:29,201
Did she have information, Lorraine?

523
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,397
"I need to tell you something."

524
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,197
It has to do with your friend, Percival.

525
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,407
Lorraine ...

526
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:00,864
Did she have information, Lorraine?

527
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:07,912
Did she give you information?

528
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:10,882
She did not give me anything.

529
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:21,246
David Percival!

530
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,261
- Are you following me?

531
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:30,204
"Maybe you're not such a good spy."
as she thinks.

532
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,911
That was for James, you fucking bastard.

533
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:39,340
And now give me that damn list.

534
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,185
We had to send a message, Lorraine.

535
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:07,104
-For several days on a mission without a
single track

536
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:08,922
and with many distractions.

537
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:12,404
- You had to be reminded of what was
in Game.

538
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:15,119
Oh I got your message.

539
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:30,048
- What vision!

540
00:55:31,183 --> 00:55:33,523
110 km of barbed wire,

541
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:37,563
310 guard dogs, 65 anti-vehicle trenches,

542
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:42,905
40,000 trained Soviets,
heavily armed borders.

543
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,412
All this

544
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:49,658
and still five thousand Citizens of the GDR
they had the courage to escape.

545
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,792
You left MI6 so worried

546
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,459
that they called the CIA to put
Judgment on you.

547
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:01,206
Eric Gray called me.

548
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:03,212
Of course.

549
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:06,370
I do not have to remind you.
How fast does time go by?

550
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:08,165
When this list is made public,

551
00:56:08,246 --> 00:56:11,006
a lot of good working people,

552
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:14,405
brave men and women,
will appear dead.

553
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:16,561
Including you and me.

554
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:21,380
I swear to you that in the last weeks
I'm afraid to wake up every morning.

555
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:27,348
I understand the gravity of the situation, sir.

556
00:56:27,373 --> 00:56:28,734
and the pressure of time.

557
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:35,389
See, I did not come up here just to give you
a vibrant speech.

558
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,969
So I get right to the point.

559
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:40,255
Last night you met a woman.

560
00:56:41,112 --> 00:56:44,635
- Delphine Lasalle is in debt

561
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:48,770
Given the weather, I'd hate to see an order
businesswoman

562
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,659
which is not in their interest.

563
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:53,533
Of her disinterest?

564
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,769
What do you mean, her disinterest?

565
00:56:56,794 --> 00:57:00,667
Do not offend my intellect Lorraine
You know exactly what I mean.

566
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,464
I hope you can get a picture.

567
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:06,901
Next week, it could be a photo
totally different.

568
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:10,792
<i> This call can change your life! </i>

569
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,690
<i> - Satchel was compromised. </i>

570
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:36,872
<i> PERSONAL PROFILE </i>

571
00:57:51,562 --> 00:57:53,404
<i> SATCHEL
Double Agent </i>

572
00:58:23,872 --> 00:58:27,158
- <i> Come to the Rough Trade Bar, Oranienstrasse. </i>

573
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:29,301
<i> - We need to talk. </i>

574
00:58:44,308 --> 00:58:46,730
"Look at all those lovers of life.

575
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:49,848
Just a beautiful woman who
went wrong. Great!

576
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:54,369
Yuri Bakhtin emerged again.

577
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,523
The police found him with a
hole in the skull.

578
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:59,527
In any case, we have
that deal with Spyglass.

579
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,110
Come to think of it, he has little time there.

580
00:59:02,135 --> 00:59:04,094
- Our priority is with the list.

581
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:05,936
"We must not make mistakes.
- Come on. say it!

582
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:09,864
He is not the most trustworthy person.
that I have met or the most intelligent.

583
00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:12,523
Wait, you said you did not know him.

584
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:16,134
I lied.

585
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:21,038
He says he memorized the whole list.

586
00:59:22,404 --> 00:59:24,180
He's ready to make the leap.

587
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:28,135
"He believed he had recorded the thing
all in memory?

588
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,349
All.

589
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:34,499
If I had known this before,
I would have prioritized Spyglass.

590
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:37,762
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

591
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,465
I could grab it any second.

592
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,727
but Percival kept it a secret,

593
00:59:42,752 --> 00:59:45,315
putting us in a delicate situation.

594
00:59:51,843 --> 00:59:56,579
The KGB will have some very brave bastards.
out there looking for Spyglass

595
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:59,206
we can not trust any of the
paths or methods.

596
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:01,697
- It is not so difficult to cross
frontier today.

597
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:04,731
It is if you are as wanted as Spyglass.

598
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:06,855
We need to cross the border
in full view

599
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,822
with him personally
to ensure their safety.

600
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:11,769
- Or use tomorrow's rally.

601
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:12,594
This is crazy.

602
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:15,529
- All those demonstrators will be a
great distraction.

603
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:20,833
Spyglass is my face, we're going
do it my way.

604
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:24,118
OK.

605
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:27,754
But we used my contact to put
the papers in order.

606
01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:29,024
Right.

607
01:00:30,516 --> 01:00:31,643
We have a deal?

608
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,549
I consider that to be the case.

609
01:00:44,285 --> 01:00:46,080
You know...

610
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,102
I got a call from David Percival.
That night, Lorraine.

611
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,403
He said he had the list.

612
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,896
<i> - I had little time
to finish. </i>

613
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,143
"And he knew Satchel's identity.

614
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:13,182
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.

615
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,157
And no one thought to tell me?

616
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:47,683
Shit!

617
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,235
You brought a lot of friends.

618
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:59,114
"I heard that Bakhtin had
a small accident.

619
01:01:59,251 --> 01:02:02,052
I heard he slipped and
fell on a stick of ice.

620
01:02:02,084 --> 01:02:06,233
"Berlin is a cruel teacher.
"Especially for traitors like Bakhtin."

621
01:02:06,258 --> 01:02:08,762
Do not be such a damn Communist.
You have a problem.

622
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:10,198
- Yes I know.

623
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:12,124
"You have the bloody list."

624
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,533
We've been in the trench long enough.
to know that in

625
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:18,982
in times like these, Berlin has
their own rules.

626
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:20,833
Can I give you information

627
01:02:20,857 --> 01:02:23,023
which will maintain the balance.

628
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:26,103
So, are you in or out?

629
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:35,905
Percival is trying to arm me.

630
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:41,191
Are you surprised?

631
01:02:43,016 --> 01:02:44,421
Not really.

632
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:47,022
These relationships are not real.

633
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:49,238
 They just means to an end.

634
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:54,901
When you tell the truth, it's different.

635
01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:57,180
Your eyes change.

636
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,896
Thank you for the warning.

637
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,133
- What do you mean?
"I'd better not do it again."

638
01:03:12,158 --> 01:03:13,166
Because?

639
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:19,878
Because it will be my death someday.

640
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:55,266
NO ENTRY

641
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,840
EAST

642
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,164
Well, I'm impressed.

643
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:44,126
Marco here was just
a good bartender.

644
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:57,071
You smell like a Stasi officer.

645
01:04:59,793 --> 01:05:01,570
Scratch your mustache.

646
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,760
Use soap and perfume.
They are from the west

647
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,943
You can not bring anything from the east.

648
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:07,696
Marco will give you clothes.

649
01:05:08,182 --> 01:05:09,982
This is Mr. Spyglass.

650
01:05:15,018 --> 01:05:18,462
<i> Bremovych says
that the traitor is in that building. </i>

651
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:21,524
<i> Stay alert. </i>

652
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:49,659
That should have been easy.

653
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,332
The plan was good.

654
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:55,611
What went wrong happened
because someone wanted to.

655
01:05:55,688 --> 01:05:57,275
Someone inside.

656
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,315
"You were betrayed by a colleague."

657
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,101
"You mean Satchel.

658
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:03,601
Would not that be unprecedented?

659
01:06:04,778 --> 01:06:06,398
Upon your request.

660
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:13,626
"You will not need it."

661
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,212
It only gets worse
if they meet you.

662
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,687
Is everything better prepared?

663
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:21,957
Yes, everything you asked for.

664
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,419
- I'm ready.

665
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,888
What do you think of your shirt?

666
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:32,070
I would not want to die in it.

667
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:35,133
But for him it's perfect.

668
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,583
Come here.

669
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:41,037

He told you that I memorized the list
all in my head?

01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,200
Yes.

Some people want me.

676
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,360
What choice do I have?

677
01:07:15,213 --> 01:07:16,880
"You have no use for me dead.

And ... I've never lost a package.

I know that.

- It's his family.

681
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,414
That was not part of the plan.

682
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:37,635
Part of mine.

683
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:40,994

We have to go.

693
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:35,419

Good luck.

This was not part of the plan.

701
01:09:32,064 --> 01:09:33,467
It was part of mine.

<i> No visual, we need to move. </i>

Stay down.

711
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:43,953
We have to solve this now.
Otherwise, we will never cross the border.

- You're not going to die.

713
01:10:51,524 --> 01:10:52,865
Stay here.

714
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:31,459
<i> Call on the radio! </i>

715
01:11:31,713 --> 01:11:32,784
<i> I'm trying! </i>

716
01:11:33,062 --> 01:11:34,070
<i> Fast! </i>

717
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,919
<i> She's here. Quick! </I>

718
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,331
Shit.

719
01:14:04,118 --> 01:14:05,608
- Two more.

720
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:29,924
<i> Wait! </i>

721
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:31,201
<i> Do not shoot! </i>

722
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,261
Go!

723
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:58,108
You need to stop this bleeding.

724
01:14:58,303 --> 01:14:59,486
Look for anything,

725
01:14:59,511 --> 01:15:02,040
alcohol, rags.

726
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:29,165
<i> Take this, bitch! </i>

727
01:17:37,976 --> 01:17:39,388
Am I your whore now?

728
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,277
<i> Stop, what are you doing here? </i>

729
01:18:24,302 --> 01:18:26,055
<i> One moment, please. </i>

730
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,500
<i> Hands behind your head! </i>

731
01:18:27,878 --> 01:18:29,213
<i> On the ground! </i>

732
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:30,458
<i> Now! </i>

733
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:31,706
In between.

734
01:18:33,134 --> 01:18:34,333
In between!

735
01:18:42,478 --> 01:18:44,785
You need to do something about your German.

736
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:50,200
It's terrible.

737
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:54,071
You fucking bitch!

738
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:44,852
Put on your seat belt.

739
01:20:32,903 --> 01:20:34,903
Are you alright?

740
01:20:35,157 --> 01:20:36,157
Yes.

741
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:38,557
We fear that ...

742
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,245
- It's so cold!
- Open your door!

743
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:56,288
- My foot ... is trapped!

744
01:21:04,747 --> 01:21:07,260
- I can not move.
Just breathe.

745
01:21:07,285 --> 01:21:09,459
... my leg.

746
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,010
"You want to take a break?"
- No.

747
01:22:33,175 --> 01:22:34,183
So...

748
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:37,858
Yes, I believe I understand everything.

749
01:22:37,883 --> 01:22:39,271
You made your plan.

750
01:22:39,499 --> 01:22:40,795
You failed

751
01:22:40,978 --> 01:22:44,566
in bringing a valuable asset from the west.

752
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:47,468
You sent me to a
damn wasps nest

753
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:53,285
I was discovered by the KGB
the moment I stepped on the ground.

754
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,729
Maybe even before.

755
01:22:56,857 --> 01:22:59,175
But you did not know that.

756
01:22:59,332 --> 01:23:02,115
You had doubts about Percival.

757
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:06,063
And you used me to grab it.

758
01:23:06,555 --> 01:23:08,151
Ready when you are.

759
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,935
It's me, it's me.

760
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:43,522
- He is dead.

761
01:23:43,754 --> 01:23:45,778
Spyglass is dead.

762
01:23:48,438 --> 01:23:49,976
"And you live."

763
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,952
You're not understanding me.

764
01:23:58,088 --> 01:23:59,357
They knew.

765
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:02,707
"The KGB knew everything.

766
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:06,032
I have to cross the border.

767
01:24:07,801 --> 01:24:09,127
- Jan.

768
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,468
<i> I need the car. </i>

769
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:27,348
<i> Good morning, ambassador. </i>

770
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:33,516
<i> Thank you. </i>

771
01:24:42,188 --> 01:24:44,111
<i> - My condolences. </i>

772
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:54,715
I expected more from the British
than a real fiasco.

773
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:55,761
I know. Sorry.

774
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:58,745
Do not wait. You do not have your own
Stasi agent, is not it?

775
01:24:58,784 --> 01:25:01,18
Not one with a photographic memory.

776
01:25:09,252 --> 01:25:11,239
We should see Broughton.

777
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,315
Let's agree.

778
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,622
We need that list.

779
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,336
Now, more than never.

780
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:18,106
Broughton.

781
01:25:18,597 --> 01:25:20,168
She managed to escape.

782
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:23,241
Oh really?

783
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,317
Do you know

784
01:25:26,349 --> 01:25:28,828
A beautiful Italian girl said
for me once, David

785
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:32,523
You can not let go of what was screwed.

786
01:25:34,434 --> 01:25:37,643
Women are always on the road to
progress, is not it?

787
01:25:40,896 --> 01:25:44,690
<i> What nobody in Germany believed
be possible happened tonight. </i>

788
01:25:44,714 --> 01:25:47,342
<i> The wall is falling.
The wall fell. </I>

789
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:51,103
<i> We have lived here with the wall since 1961, and ... </i>

790
01:25:51,128 --> 01:25:54,939
<i> and I think it's time to take down
the wall, you know. </i>

791
01:25:54,964 --> 01:25:56,630
<i> The wall is crumbling. </i>

792
01:25:56,662 --> 01:26:01,955
<i> The hammer hits the hands of men who
they were born with him, they overthrow him. </i>

793
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:06,377
<i> From him, Eastern soldiers try
for the wave </I>

794
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:10,626
<i> water guns were used, but
the West Berliners are determined. </I>

795
01:26:10,651 --> 01:26:13,132
<i> In the west, Berliners use
jets of champagne. </i>

796
01:26:13,157 --> 01:26:15,603
<i> If I followed you, I mean,
as it should be, </i>

797
01:26:17,235 --> 01:26:18,958
<i> You would never know. </i>

798
01:26:19,546 --> 01:26:23,808
<i> It is the moment that Berliners
have waited 28 years. </I>

799
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,927
<i> Even the East Germans
they look animated. </i>

800
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:29,869
<i> A symbolic crack in the structure
which cost hundreds of lives </i>

801
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:34,401
<i> and separated friends, families and couples
for decades. </i>

802
01:26:34,426 --> 01:26:39,181
I found a French UHF device on the
my coat after Spyglass's death.

803
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:42,897
I believe now that it was Percival
who installed it

804
01:26:42,922 --> 01:26:44,943
and made it look like it was Lasalle.

805
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:09,421
Why are you here?

806
01:27:11,249 --> 01:27:13,182
You need to get out of Berlin.

807
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:17,794
"When I did not hear anything about you,
I was worried.

808
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:20,167
How naive can you be?

809
01:27:21,322 --> 01:27:23,386
"We chose this life, Delphine.

810
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,070
It just ends in a way.

811
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:28,719
What are you talking about?

812
01:27:32,712 --> 01:27:34,966
- He betrayed us.

813
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,021
You have to leave while you can.

814
01:28:03,015 --> 01:28:04,023
<i> - Yes. </i>

815
01:28:04,048 --> 01:28:05,579
Do not underestimate me, Percival.

816
01:28:05,735 --> 01:28:08,036
- <i> Lasalle, listen to me carefully. </i>

817
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:10,322
- <i> You have no idea with
who is dealing. </i>

818
01:28:10,469 --> 01:28:11,754
<i> - You set me up. </i>

819
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:12,492
You...

820
01:28:12,517 --> 01:28:14,000
Come on, this is the game.

821
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:15,628
<i> - I know your secrets, David. </i>

822
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:18,866
- <i> And I can play this game
better than you think. </i>

823
01:29:11,175 --> 01:29:14,270
- <i> Percival is tempted
arm for me. </i>

824
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:16,499
<i> - Are you surprised? </i>

825
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:17,532
Not really.

826
01:29:17,976 --> 01:29:20,316
<i> These relationships are not real. </i>

827
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:22,198
<i> They are only means to an end. </i>

828
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:25,745
- <i> When you tell the truth,
It's different. </i>

829
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:28,071
<i> - Your eyes change. </i>

830
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:29,960
<i> Thanks for the warning. </i>

831
01:29:32,531 --> 01:29:36,167
<i> - What do you mean?
"I'd better not do it again."

832
01:29:36,555 --> 01:29:37,563
<i> Why? </i>

833
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:40,714
- <i> Because it will be my death someday. </i>

834
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:47,463
<i> - I need to tell you something. </i>

835
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:57,991
<i> -It's about your friend, Percival. </i>

836
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,024
- <i> He ... </i>
<i> - Ssh. </i>

837
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:35,232
- Sorry dear.

838
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:39,080
This is how it is.

839
01:32:30,648 --> 01:32:32,037
Shit!

840
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,598
<i> Celebrations continue on the streets
tonight. </i>

841
01:32:36,647 --> 01:32:39,717
<i> At the moment the first wave of
East Germans crossed to Berlin </i>

842
01:32:39,742 --> 01:32:43,772
<i> they were bathed in champagne and
applauded by a crowd of thousands. </i>

843
01:32:43,797 --> 01:32:47,689
<i> It's clear. This will be one of the
most dramatic days in Berlin. </I>

844
01:32:47,714 --> 01:32:50,577
<i> East Berliners are surprised
when crossing the border </i>

845
01:32:50,602 --> 01:32:52,744
<i> which was closed for 28 years. </i>

846
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:57,649
<i> West Berliners are changing
the wall that marked his city and climbing it. </i>

847
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:15,943
<i> No more police interference </i>

848
01:33:15,968 --> 01:33:18,631
<i> Unified, Berliners make the
symbol of peace </I>

849
01:33:18,664 --> 01:33:22,164
<i> Millions look to the east
singing, "down the wall". </i>

850
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:47,165
There's just one more question ...

851
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,673
Who won?

852
01:33:50,984 --> 01:33:53,726
And what was the damn game?
after all?

853
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:58,571
<i> I thought the wall
would never fall. </i>

854
01:33:58,618 --> 01:34:03,081
The German peaceful revolution

855
01:34:03,126 --> 01:34:04,840
Let's take a little break, and we'll be back.

856
01:34:04,865 --> 01:34:08,515
and talk in detail about the controversy
musical of the year, "sampling"

857
01:34:08,563 --> 01:34:12,063
Is it art or is it just a plagiarism?
Stay with us.

858
01:34:18,454 --> 01:34:19,651
To win...

859
01:34:19,675 --> 01:34:22,414
you need to know first
Which side are you on

860
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,190
In our line of work ...

861
01:34:31,215 --> 01:34:33,690
That's right, darling, there were black holes.

862
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:35,810
or exists or does not exist.

863
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,412
You are doing the fair and
so you wake up one day

864
01:34:40,437 --> 01:34:43,634
and realize that you were only
a helper of the devil.

865
01:35:03,347 --> 01:35:05,300
<i> - Ironic. </i>

866
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:08,992
<i> News reports will not say
there will be more secrets. </i>

867
01:35:10,015 --> 01:35:13,325
<i> But we both know
This is not true. </i>

868
01:35:14,093 --> 01:35:17,704
<i> The world is commanded in secrets. </i>

869
01:35:23,889 --> 01:35:27,015
<i> Whoever has this list has power. </i>

870
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,632
<i> And without that, you're just
another fucking target. </i>

871
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:40,131
<i> So, what I learned,
after all? </i>

872
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:42,761
<i> After all the sleepless nights.
</i>

873
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:46,192
<i> Lying to friends,
lovers, myself. </i>

874
01:35:46,412 --> 01:35:49,706
<i> Play this miserable game
in this miserable city </i>

875
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:52,976
<i> full of traitors
and four-faced liars. </i>

876
01:35:53,008 --> 01:35:57,222
<i> I'll tell you what I learned,
just one thing. </i>

877
01:35:57,357 --> 01:36:00,936
I love Berlin, damn it!

878
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,288
You did not have to kill her.

879
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:31,425
- Suddenly you decided
develop an awareness

880
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:33,222
After everything you've done?

881
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:36,328
Did you notice that everyone
who you are approaching

882
01:36:36,353 --> 01:36:38,325
they end up dead?

883
01:36:38,373 --> 01:36:40,995
"You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.

884
01:36:41,761 --> 01:36:44,429
You wanted the KGB to catch me.

885
01:36:45,992 --> 01:36:48,959
- Yes.
You were too cowardly to do it yourself.

886
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:51,491
Smart, actually.

887
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:55,483
If those KGB shit had
made apart from them

888
01:36:55,508 --> 01:36:58,090
I would be on my way to a
masturbation with the Queen.

889
01:36:59,452 --> 01:37:01,222
- I read that list.

890
01:37:01,468 --> 01:37:02,920
Lorraine.

891
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:11,484
Actually, you were a girl.
very disobedient.

892
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,322
Spyglass was a risk
for all of us.

893
01:37:16,347 --> 01:37:18,610
I could not risk leaving him with you.

894
01:37:18,642 --> 01:37:19,650
Where's the list, David?

895
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:21,944
I do not have it.

896
01:37:22,492 --> 01:37:25,504
He's on his way to MI6,
where it belongs.

897
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,740
"Are you going to lie to the end?"

898
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,288
Truth and lies ...

899
01:37:53,613 --> 01:37:55,620
people like us do not know the difference.

900
01:37:55,645 --> 01:37:57,470
Oh, we know the difference, David.

901
01:37:58,157 --> 01:38:00,292
We chose to ignore it.

902
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,116
Is not that right, Comrade Satchel?

903
01:38:06,067 --> 01:38:08,432
So, this is how it works for you?

904
01:38:08,457 --> 01:38:11,463
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver. </i>

905
01:38:11,527 --> 01:38:13,020
Well played.

906
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:32,350
Did you kill David Percival?

907
01:38:34,896 --> 01:38:39,740
The papers are in order for the
bodies of James Gascoigne and David Percival.

908
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:46,701
You killed the head of our office,
an officer of the Crown.

909
01:38:46,726 --> 01:38:50,216
You'd better have a valid proof
or a good statement.

910
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:53,265
"Who are you to judge my actions?"
- I'm your superior.

911
01:38:59,992 --> 01:39:01,994
My superior ...

912
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,506
This was never about stopping the war.

913
01:39:06,531 --> 01:39:09,108
It was about saving her ass.

914
01:39:09,775 --> 01:39:12,889
You could not bear the shame

915
01:39:12,921 --> 01:39:15,901
of sins committed in the Cold War.

916
01:39:16,394 --> 01:39:19,491
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

917
01:39:19,516 --> 01:39:20,703
- Yes well...

918
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,632
- This is your job, right?

919
01:39:22,657 --> 01:39:24,524
I did my job.

920
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:31,270
Despite their efforts
and incompetence

921
01:39:32,573 --> 01:39:34,713
I succeeded where you failed.

922
01:39:36,756 --> 01:39:39,081
I unmasked your traitor, Satchel.

923
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:42,325
I gave him the only justice he deserved.

924
01:39:46,096 --> 01:39:47,437
A bullet.

925
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:53,126
Percival with Bremovych. On the day
Spyglass was killed.

926
01:39:54,404 --> 01:39:57,476
- <i> Maybe we can do some
kind of agreement. </i>

927
01:39:57,556 --> 01:40:01,023
<i> You must know that I'm the only one in this
city that can help you have the list. </i>

928
01:40:01,048 --> 01:40:02,371
<i> Very impressive. </i>

929
01:40:02,514 --> 01:40:06,600
<i> Dedication and fidelity
are rare things nowadays. </i>

930
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,927
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver. </i>

931
01:40:14,672 --> 01:40:16,312
<i> Do we have an agreement? </i>

932
01:40:18,793 --> 01:40:20,380
<i> What about the British? </i>

933
01:40:20,405 --> 01:40:23,556
<i> - Do you trust Gray?
- No. </i>

934
01:40:23,635 --> 01:40:24,635
- What about C.?

935
01:40:24,675 --> 01:40:29,888
<i> C. is an arrogant puppy that
does not leave the desk. </i>

936
01:40:33,246 --> 01:40:35,293
Percival was Satchel.

937
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,167
Where's the list?

938
01:40:44,367 --> 01:40:46,033
Where's the list, Lorraine?

939
01:40:46,937 --> 01:40:48,332
I do not know.

940
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:53,782
Ah, balls!

941
01:40:53,807 --> 01:40:56,214
The prime minister will pass
Bad bits of it.

942
01:41:01,162 --> 01:41:03,333
We chose to bury this Broughton

943
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:06,150
"Your mission never occurred.

944
01:41:06,503 --> 01:41:08,185
- This conversation...

945
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:11,998
never happened.

946
01:41:15,055 --> 01:41:17,611
"You immediately leave on leave.

947
01:41:18,062 --> 01:41:21,421
- Let's start the next decade, easy.

948
01:41:23,419 --> 01:41:24,427
- W.

949
01:41:26,838 --> 01:41:28,562
- What should I use?

950
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,592
In my tea with the Queen?

951
01:41:57,148 --> 01:42:01,028
THREE DAYS LATER
PARIS

952
01:42:25,517 --> 01:42:27,866
<i> Comrade Satchel. </i>

953
01:42:28,382 --> 01:42:30,167
<i> Comrade Bremovych </i>

954
01:42:47,896 --> 01:42:49,880
<i> The list! </i>

955
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:52,372
<i> Good girl. </i>

956
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:01,03
<i> Can I? </i>

957
01:43:05,491 --> 01:43:08,121
<i> Tonight, we celebrate. </i>

958
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:14,450
<i> Seriously? </i>

959
01:43:31,563 --> 01:43:35,393
<i> For a moment, I thought that you
wanted to kill me. </i>

960
01:43:48,256 --> 01:43:51,399
<i> Percival told me who you are. </i>

961
01:44:10,951 --> 01:44:13,419
Be professional ...

962
01:44:14,074 --> 01:44:15,792
stand on the plastic.

963
01:45:48,086 --> 01:45:51,077
- You really thought that I would
would you give the list?

964
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:56,372
Before I die, I want you to
Put this on your primitive hard head.

965
01:45:58,753 --> 01:46:00,973
I've never worked for you.

966
01:46:01,451 --> 01:46:03,689
You worked for me.

967
01:46:10,047 --> 01:46:14,428
Every false information I gave you
was a feature on the Iron Curtain.

968
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:20,658
All the information you gave me
It was a bullet in my fucking gun.

969
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:23,215
- I want my life back.

970
01:47:11,386 --> 01:47:13,238
Good trip.

971
01:47:39,095 --> 01:47:42,675
- <i> Estimated flight time for
Langley, 11 hours and 37 minutes. </I>

972
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:44,514
<i> - Ready for departure. </i>

973
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:46,681
- Let's go home...

974
01:47:46,904 --> 01:47:49,079
It sounds good.

975
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,213
Let's go home.

976
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:00,738
Sucks cock

977
01:48:01,435 --> 01:48:03,007
- Oh really?

978
01:48:05,452 --> 01:48:08,309
Glad to have been convincing.

979
01:48:08,334 --> 01:48:10,917
Translation:Maranatha;

980
01:48:10,942 --> 01:48:12,476
FINAL
