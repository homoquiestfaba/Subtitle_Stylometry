52
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,749
He's yours.

53
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:30,999
You want to hold him?

54
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,259
Here you go.

55
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:01,556
His name's Jason.

56
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,845
Hey.

57
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,679

- Good? Great.

59
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,188
What are you doing here?

60
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:42,493
Anything you wanna tell me?

61
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:48,893
Anything you think I might wanna
know before I leave here?

62
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,549
Forever and I never come back?

63
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,563
Let's go outside.

64
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:56,445
Come on.

65
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:10,993
You weren't gonna tell me?

66
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:14,131
It was just a fling right?

67
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,965
That means you don't have to tell me?

68
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,849
Just as a common courtesy or...

69
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:33,933
There might even be a law you know.
You gotta fucking tell somebody.

70
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:36,838
I haven't heard from you for over a year.

71
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,973
You just took off.
Never called me.

72
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:49,990
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.

73
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:54,579
You do whatever you need to do.

74
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,006
What are you gonna do?

75
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:01,372
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

76
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,249
I'm going to school.

77
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,869
I take care of Jason.
I work here.

78
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:10,799
I have a man.

79
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,138
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.

80
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:16,939
You're busy?

81
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,829
Yeah, yeah I'm real busy.

82
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,599
I don't wanna keep you.

83
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,519
Okay.

84
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,169
Alright.

85
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:57,724
When does this pay period end Jack?
On Friday?

86
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:58,742
Why?

87
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,805
Cause I gotta get paid.

88
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,739
Just pay me for half the week alright?

89
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,838
I don't give advances out.

90
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:08,089
I'm not asking for a advance Jack.

91
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:10,889
I'm quitting.

92
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,385
-You can't quit.
-I just did.

93
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,599
- Hey.
- Hey.

94
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:34,724
Wow.

95
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,652
You look like a princess.

96
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,889
What are you still doing here?

97
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,112
I stuck around.

98
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,719
This is really not a good time.

99
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:47,825
-No.
-No.

100
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,852
I was just gonna take him to the park or...

101
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,199
maybe see if I can just sit on the porch.

102
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,139
Say hi to him.

103
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,645
We're on the way to church.

104
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,192
You're going to church?

105
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,492
This is Kofi.

106
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,205
-We need to go.
-Yeah.

107
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,959
You should call. You just can't show up, you know.

108
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,662
-You ready?
-Yeah.

109
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,509
Hey.

110
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,419
You live here?

111
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,839
Yep. This is my house.

112
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:22,812
How long you in town?

113
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,409
I'm going to stick around.

114
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,091
What are you looking at?

115
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,339
Are you really gonna do this shit today?

116
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:40,599
Do what?

117
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,849
By Gods gift through water and the holy spirit

118
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,929
we are reborn to everlasting life.

119
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:10,769
In his goodness may he continue to
pour out his blessings...

120
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,059
upon these sons and daughters of his.

121
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:18,129
May he make them faithful members
of his holy people.

122
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,905
Jason I baptize you in the name of the father...

123
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:28,709
and of the son and of the holy spirit.

124
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:33,479
This child of yours has been enlighten by Christ.

125
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,022
He is to walk always as a child
of the light.

126
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,952
By the father of our lord Jesus Christ
I free you from sin.

127
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,579
We now anoint you with
the prism of salvation

128
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,729
As Christ was anointed priest, prophet, and king.

129
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,839
So may you always live as a
member of his body

130
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,479
sharing everlasting life.
Amen.

131
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,279
In the name of this child.

132
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,445
In the spirit of a common sonship,

133
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:04,408
let us pray together in the words
our lord has given us.

134
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:07,159
Our father who art in heaven

135
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,657
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come

136
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,319
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

137
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:19,579
Give us this day, our daily bread, and
forgive us our trespasses

138
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,925
as we forgive those who trespass against us

139
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:28,165
and lead us not into temptation but
delivery us from evil.

140
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:31,529
The almighty God, the father, the son,

141
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,533
and the holy spirit bless you.
Amen.

142
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:39,119
Now as we receive our new member

143
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:44,109
into our parish, let us all welcome
him with great joy.

144
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,071
You ride that thing really good.

145
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:26,467
Really good.

146
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,369
You ride good man.

147
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,709
You like a ride into town?

148
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,617
Save you some gas man.

149
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,559
Just passing through?

150
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,605
I'm just settling in.

151
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,549
-Where you staying?
-Some fucking motel.

152
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:07,065
Yeah they're no good around here.
Whole towns gone to shit man.

153
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,692
So you got a job?

154
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,172
No.

155
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,959
You know your way around an engine?

156
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:14,919
Yeah.

157
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:19,879
Cause I got a, I got shop.
A repair shop on Marsha Road.

158
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:23,869
Come check it out man.
I could always use a good worker.

159
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,265
Alright.

160
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,705
It ain't much. It's...

161
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,149
what it is you know. It's mine.

162
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:35,698
No one can kick me out of it.

163
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,599
So it's a workshop in there.

164
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,205
This is Tour.

165
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:46,619
I don't get a whole lot of work here you know.

166
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:49,929
But if you want you can look for
other jobs or whatever you know

167
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,836
if it's not enough for you.

168
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,032
I do everything.

169
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,752
Everything there is to do to a car
I know how to do.

170
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:01,739
Anything you don't know,
I can teach you, you know.

171
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,132
And I got a trailer down here.

172
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,145
Stay there if you want.

173
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,115
See she's shy.

174
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:19,932
Where is it?
Where's the ball?

175
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:21,929
There's the trailer.

176
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:26,302
Did she get it?
No she ain't gonna get it.

177
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:29,179
-Do you live out here all alone?
-Yeah, I live alone...

178
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,835
but sometimes people come stay for
awhile, you know.

179
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:37,049
That's it.
It's not much, but you know...

180
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,859
its got whatever you need in there.

181
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,625
You must get lonely.

182
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,812
Look Rob I don't want to be ungrateful...

183
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,572
I really appreciate what you're doing
for me and shit...

184
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,569
but I got to make more fucking money.

185
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:25,408
Hey man, if I could pay you more
I would you know you're...

186
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,155
good at what you do man.
Really good.

187
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,972
I could fix up that old Mack truck that's sitting
there like your goddamn lawn ornament.

188
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,685
That's good you can go ahead and fix it up
but I don't have the money to pay you.

189
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,090
You know, there are other things that
can be done you know.

190
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,449
Like what?

191
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,025
We could rob a bank.

192
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:51,031
-You're full of shit.
-I'm not full of shit.

193
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,552
I've done it four times myself and
stopped twelve years ago.

194
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,405
It was getting too hot.

195
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:02,533
As long as you don't do it too
many times, your fine.

196
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:06,946
You got a kid?
You want to provide for that kid?

197
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:10,199
You want to maybe edge out your competition?

198
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,744
You got to do that using you're skill set.

199
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,085
And your skill set...

200
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:20,671
very unique.

201
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,589
What do you say?

202
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,643
-Go fuck yourself.
-Okay.

203
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:32,545
Well, good luck supporting your family
on minimum wage.

204
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,659
He's my son and I should be around him.

205
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,199
I wasn't around my dad and look the
fucking way I turned out.

206
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,569
Look I wanna take care of you.

207
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:51,508
I want to take care of my son.
That's my job.

208
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,605
Let me do my job.

209
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,485
Okay, how how are you gonna
take care of us?

210
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,779
Don't say it like that.

211
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,908
-But how are you gonna take care of me?
-Don't...

212
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,291
Don't talk down to me.

213
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,139
It's a question.
I'm not talking down to you.

214
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:19,289
-It's just a question.
-I'll find... find a way to do it.

215
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,000
You want a house?
I'll get you a house.

216
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:27,293
You wanna get the fuck outta here?
Get outta here.

217
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:29,045
I got that trailer.

218
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:31,512
I'll get a truck.
We'll hit the road.

219
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,059
You pick a place you like?
We'll stop.

220
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:38,152
You don't wanna be there?
Fuck you we're outta there.

221
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:43,369
-What about my mom?
-She can come.

222
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,245
-What about Kofi?
-He can stay.

223
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:50,829
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.

224
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,325
-Sounds like a nice dream.
-Ro.

225
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:41,999
You can umm... use this if you wanna.
But keep in mind that...

226
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:45,829
I did four banks with a note.
In other words you don't need the gun.

227
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,772
I never liked guns man.
They're vulgar.

228
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,685
But you may want to take it.
I don't... whatever you wanna do.

229
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,899
How do we do it?

230
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,519
Okay, first thing is we're gonna go
in there nice and early.

231
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:01,085
Just when the doors open okay?
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers...

232
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,299
Go for the oldest woman you can alright.

233
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,779
Failing that, go to the most meek.

234
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:10,039
Get her to put the money out on the table.
Why?

235
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:13,039
So that way you can see if there's
a dye pack.

236
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,119
You put it in your pocket.
You don't hand anything over to them.

237
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:19,119
You don't show them the gun.
And you go.

238
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,759
Get on your bike.
I'll be about four blocks away.

239
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:27,579
Ride it into the truck.
Bam we're home, we're done, we're rich.

240
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,959
What happens if you get stopped sitting by
the side of the road with a open cube truck.

241
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,415
What are you gonna say?

242
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,517
-What do you mean what I'm gonna do?
-I'm a officer...

243
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,405
Excuse me sir what are you doing with
a open cube truck?

244
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,579
What are you doing?
Why are you sitting here like this?

245
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:47,385
Oh I'm broken down.
I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs.

246
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,730
Thank you for asking officer.

247
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,339
-That's a nice touch.
-Right.

248
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,745
What are you gonna do if you
get jock itch and you know you...

249
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:58,312
you're riding ninty miles a hour down the street.
You're gonna keep riding right?

250
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,205
Yeah?
I mean we do what we do.

251
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,457
But when we do it together?
Pssshh... Shazam.

252
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:09,622
I'm just saying.

253
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,809
Not since Hall and Oates, has
there been such a team.

254
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,419
Which one do you... oh I know.
So I got to be the dark curly hair guy?

255
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:20,992
You got to be the good looking one?
I guess that's about right.

256
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,419
This is going to be good.
You're going to like doing this.

257
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,899
Biggest rush of your life.

258
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:56,589
Everybody who wants to live
put your hands in the fucking air!

259
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,999
Get over here!
Get over here now!

260
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:03,964
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!

261
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,762
Alright, what's your name?

262
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,279
- Max.
- Max is my little fucking dog.

263
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,045
If by get your fucking money and he's going to fetch.

264
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,799
Get it out and put it on the table right now!
Get it out!

265
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,125
Pray!

266
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:17,899
Pray!

267
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,292
Let me here you fucking pray!

268
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,179
Got that money out boy?

269
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,472
Go fucking fetch.
Fast!

270
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:31,227
Get it up.
Put it in that bag.

271
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,546
They're not turning!

272
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:05,591
How much did you get?

273
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,659
Bag.

274
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,690
Oh baby.
Oh.

275
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,973
Beautiful.
Fucking baby boy!

276
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,472
Are you okay man?
You good?

277
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,485
You did it man!

278
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:27,939
You did it!

279
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,792
Yeah!

280
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:35,849
Yeah man!
We fucking did it!

281
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,899
We fucking did it!

282
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:33,745
Tell me about him.

283
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,895
Whats he like eat?

284
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:42,359
He like, really likes apples.

285
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,985
Though I kind of have
to chew it up for him.

286
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,232
-You chew up his apple?
-Yeah.

287
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:51,619
It sounds gross but it's
not when I'm doing it.

288
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:04,139
Has he ever had ice cream?

289
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,239
Not yet.

290
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:09,205
You fucking kidding me?

291
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:12,605
-He's still a baby.
-Bullshit.

292
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,792
What kind of house are you running?

293
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:16,469
No ice cream.

294
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:20,879
Why can't he have that?

295
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:24,665
It's not like he can't have any.
He just hasn't had it.

296
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,389
Can I give it to him?

297
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,472
-You want to give him ice cream?
-Yeah.

298
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:33,489
I want to do something with
him that's his first time.

299
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,305
I want to look at his face
when he tries ice cream.

300
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,129
Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life,
he's going to see my fucking face.

301
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:59,925
- Okay come on.
- Ah he's really funny.

302
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,679
Come on.

303
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,359
Want to hear it on?

304
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:36,639
Okay, surprise.
He cries alot.

305
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:38,785
Hola senor, you want the bike
in it too?

306
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,599
Yeah, just all, you don't say.
Just capture the mood.

307
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:47,009
-It's a nice bike.
-Bike's part of the family.

308
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,659
You want another one?

309
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:57,059
You sure I should take
it when she's crying?

310
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,119
Okay.

311
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,032
That's a good trick.

312
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:14,009
Put that fucking money on the counter.

313
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:17,259
Give me the real stuff. Don't give me the
fucking fake stuff. I know what it is.

314
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,565
Shit. Come here. Come here.

315
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,065
What is this?

316
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,432
-What is this?
-It's presents.

317
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:10,572
-Oh my God. What is that?
-It's a crib.

318
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:13,445
Easy, easy, easy.

319
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:18,304
Boss, you gotta stay.
You're gonna fall of this bed.

320
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:23,349
There you go.

321
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,619
Your mom's home.

322
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:43,739
-Hi mama.
-You think she's gonna be mad?

323
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,059
-Hey.
-Hey.

324
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:58,009
What are you doing?

325
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,065
I got him a crib and some toys.

326
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,132
You know this is really nice and all,
but you gotta,you gotta get this outta here.

327
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:10,532
You can't just show up like this.

328
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,232
-Why?
-Cause this is Kofi's fucking house.

329
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,332
Just get it out, please.

330
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:17,029
He can't be sleeping in a bed.

331
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,865
He's going to roll out and bust
his head open. He needs a crib.

332
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,619
What's going on?

333
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:26,297
You okay with this?

334
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,459
I'm talking to you.
You okay with this?

335
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,439
- Kofi, it's his father.
-In our house?

336
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,845
He's gonna roll up in here even
when your not in the house?

337
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,399
-What are you doing here man?
-Shhh.

338
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,919
-I'm making him pr...
-Don't shhh me, your in my house man.

339
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,459
You need to pack all this shit up
and get out the house man.

340
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,679
I don't know who you think you are
just coming up in our life and...

341
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,839
changing shit around but this ain't going to work.

342
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,232
-You gotta lower your voice man.
-Excuse me?

343
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,920
-Lower your voice.
-Romina can you, can you step outside please?

344
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:57,119
Pack all this shit up and take it out man.

345
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:01,593
-You're making the baby cry.
-You're making the baby cry.

346
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:06,129
Pick this shit up and get it out of the
house now man. I'm not fucking with you.

347
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:13,772
Pick up all this shit.
Fuck you man.

348
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:24,237
Kofi.

349
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,839

357
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,339
Call an ambulance.

358
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:58,789
Okay.

359
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:27,299
It's okay.

360
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:52,319
It's over.

361
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:07,770
-Is your name Luke Glanton?
-Yes.

362
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:10,649
Mr. Glanton a complain has been filed...

363
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:15,062
it alleges assault in the second degree
which is a felony in the state of New York.

364
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:20,219
When such a complain is filed, you have the right
to an adjournment to obtain a lawyer.

365
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:24,045
Counselor do you wish to waive any
further reading of the arraignment?

366
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:27,729
Would your honor, on behalf of my client,
I enter a not guilty plea.

367
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,732
Given the history that I am aware of this defendant
and as well the allegations...

368
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,692
I'm going to set bail in the amount of $2,500.

369
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:39,799
Bail may be posted either in cash
or by bail bondsman.

370
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,732
In the mean time I will issue the temporary
order of protection

371
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:47,105
requiring this defendant to refrain from
violent, offensive, assaultive, or...

372
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:51,369
harassing conduct, and to remain away from the complainee.

373
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:03,649
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.

374
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,519

376
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,545

00:39:18,552 --> 00:39:21,845
I'm going to split out the back.
I wanna go down to Rotterdam...

378
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,839
and I want to do that First National.

379
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:31,819
You know something Luke,
if you ride like lightning...

380
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,979
you're going to crash like thunder.

381
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:38,099
I'm not going to let you bring us both down.

382
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:42,559
-Fuck that, don't be such a fucking pussy.

392
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,292

You don't love me.
You don't like me.

397
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:48,572

I'm a piece of shit.

398
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:49,419
Okay?

399
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,799
I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.

400
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,032
I got this for him.
Just give it to him.

401
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:56,719
Tell him it's from me.

402
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,805
You're never going to see him again.

403
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:25,985
Please give that to him.

404
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,765

-Thanks for coming down. How are you?

521
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:43,092
- Bill Killcullen, D.A.
- Avery Cross, nice to meet you.

522
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,752
-Yeah of course. I know who you are.
-I know your father, you know.

523
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:47,249
-Long time now.
-I apologize.

524
00:53:47,272 --> 00:53:48,872
No, no, no, he's a great guy.

525
00:53:48,899 --> 00:53:50,592
I wouldn't have expected anything
less from his son.

526
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,705
This was ah, above and beyond.

527
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:54,625
Ah no, I just did what anybody would do.

528
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,739
-Yeah.
-That's right. And better.

529
00:53:56,805 --> 00:53:58,579
-I don't know if I could...
-The whole force is pulling for you man.

530
00:53:58,605 --> 00:54:01,252
Don't you forget that. They're all outside.
Banners and everything.

531
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,969
-What happened to that guy?
-That guys gone. He's dead. It's over.

532
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,162
It's the way it happens.

533
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,500
-Right?
-Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind?

534
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:12,146
That's not, it's not for you to
worry about right now.

535
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:14,239
We got people who are going
to talk to you about that.

536
00:54:14,605 --> 00:54:16,232
There's people talking to his family.

537
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:19,729
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.

538
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:21,659
-Alrighty?
-Yeah.

539
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:25,259
-Bill wants to ask you a few questions. That alright?
-Just your first impressions, that kind of thing, you know.

540
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:27,125
-I just wa....
-Formalities, you know?

541
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,199
-Yeah, it's pretty simple.
-Sure.

542
00:54:28,225 --> 00:54:30,412
-Yeah.
-Alright I'll leave you to it, get to know each other.

543
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:31,819
-Alright.
-Alright.

544
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:36,005
So what happen when you were
just outside the door?

545
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,059
Um, I said "Police uh, drop your weapon."

546
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,249
Um, "Face down on the ground
with your hand spread."

547
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:46,379
-And uh, nothing.
-Nothing?

548
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:47,452
Nothing.

549
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,932
-Did you announce yourself again or not?
-No.

550
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,249
No. That's all we need to do is
make ourselves known right?

551
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:59,425
Yeah. But it's sometimes not easy to tell whether
if they've heard you making yourself known.

552
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,792
You know what I mean?

553
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:05,252
Anway, you were yelling,
is that right?

554
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:08,299
-I was making myself known as we were trained, correct.
-Okay. Alright.

555
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:13,091
Okay.
Then what?

556
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,424
At that point I knew I had to make
entry and I kicked the door down.

557
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:20,039
-Was the door, was the door locked?
-Correct.

558
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,819
And you knew that because?

559
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,825
-What do you mean?
-Did you assume that the door was locked?

560
00:55:24,899 --> 00:55:26,739
-How did I know it was locked?
-Yeah.

561
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:30,112
Is that a trick question?

562
00:55:30,172 --> 00:55:32,299
No, no. I'm just wondering why
you didn't turn the thing.

563
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:33,805
That's how I know it was locked.

564
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:35,925
Did you tell me that?

565
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:37,952
-No.
-Okay.

566
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:41,685
-Alright so you kick it in?
-Right.

567
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:43,532
Why are why... why did you come down here?

568
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:47,332
-I'm sorry, why did I come down here?
-Yeah, why wasn't it somebody else?

569
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,329
Slow day at the office?

570
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:53,821
No.

571
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:00,419
-What happened after that?
-What would you like me to tell you?

572
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:03,306
-I just need you to tell me what happened?
-You do?

573
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:05,739
I don't want you to misremember
so tomorrow...

574
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,265
you're trying to match what have
you have thought today.

575
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:12,172
I only want you to tell me what you saw.
What you remember?

576
00:56:12,845 --> 00:56:15,669
I shot the perpetrator.
He fell out the window.

577
00:56:16,279 --> 00:56:18,339
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?

578
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:23,598
Did you shoot him first or
did he shoot first?

579
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:30,669
Don't fuck with me. Do the right
thing. Tell me what the fuck happened.

580
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,300
It was pretty quick.

581
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,039
Who shot first?

582
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:42,046
His hand comes up. You fire.

583
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,508
His hand comes up.
He fires. You fire.

584
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:47,717
-Right.
-Like that?

585
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,142
-Yeah.
-Like pop, pop.

586
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:54,039
That sounds like he shot first.

587
00:56:54,765 --> 00:56:56,452
Yeah.

588
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:59,659
It's just a triumphant day for
officer Avery Cross.

589
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:04,129
He left Ellis hospital well enough to go
home and happy to be alive.

590
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,889
With supporters from his Schenectady PD
family cheering him on...

591
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:12,999
His father, State Supreme Court Judge Al Cross
says he's very happy his son is alive today.

592
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:17,765
It's the life of a cop.
A life my son chose.

593
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,679
Twenty nine year old Cross hasn't
even been on the force for a...

594
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:24,829
full year before he ran head on
into the alleged Moto Bandit.

595
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:29,089
Pursuing Luke Glanton through the streets
of Schenectady after a bank robbery.

596
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:33,339
Glanton ran into a home.
Then he came face to face with Officer Cross.

597
00:57:33,392 --> 00:57:36,339
Glanton fired at Cross,
hitting him in the knee.

598
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:39,879
Cross fired back. Killing Glanton
and saving the hostages.

599
00:57:39,912 --> 00:57:43,709
Glanton was a drifter and at
times a motorcycle stunt rider.

600
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:46,339
Police say he had a very violent past.

601
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:49,999
The guy had a long track record, you know.
He was a professional criminal.

602
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,419
He moved here last spring and it hasn't been a full
month before he started robbing banks here.

603
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,633
He leaves behind an infant son.

604
00:57:59,059 --> 00:57:59,939
Coming up....

605
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,878
Was it scary, honey?

606
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:08,805
It happened so fast.

607
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:11,639
I don't think there was time
to be scared.

608
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:14,878
Scary for me.

609
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:20,798
I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Nobody does.

610
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:25,669
Doing what?
What...what... what am I doing?

611
00:58:28,178 --> 00:58:31,157
I was speaking with your father and we...

612
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:36,499
-We both agree.
-Of course...of course... of course he does.

613
00:58:37,052 --> 00:58:40,099
-I'm sorry I just saw...
-I'm a cop Jen, I'm a cop.

614
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:44,089
-I just thought maybe after this maybe you would have
had enough. That's all.
-Hey, there's no more to discuss.

615
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:46,878
I just thought maybe it
would have been enough.

616
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,869
That's it.
Okay?

617
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:53,459
-You...you can't expect me not to think that.
-You guys just don't get it.

618
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:01,632
-I'm sorry. We're just worried. We're just worried about you. That's all.
-Stop saying that.

619
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:05,339
Stop fucking saying that.

620
00:59:14,973 --> 00:59:18,431
Have you been replaying the
incident in your mind?

621
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:20,459
Not really.

622
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:24,549
Nah, I just try to... I'm trying to uh
put it out of my mind I think.

623
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:27,025
Does that work?

624
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,672
Yeah.

625
00:59:31,129 --> 00:59:34,425
You think you're ready to go back to duty?

626
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:35,439
Yes.

627
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:39,252
Would you want yourself as a partner?

628
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:41,319
Absolutely.

629
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:46,039
What have you been thinking
about since the shooting?

630
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,812
Not much um...

631
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,569
Have... has... everything's been so crazy
you know.

632
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:57,805
With the rehabilitation and the...

633
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,819
work and everything at home.

634
01:00:01,152 --> 01:00:02,612
Everything at home?

635
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:04,065
What's happening at home?

636
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,812
Well, I'm there now.

637
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,932
-It's just much different.
-Who's at home with you?

638
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,865
Well, ah my mother in law ah.

639
01:00:14,205 --> 01:00:16,619
My wife and my boy.

640
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:18,559
So there's um...

641
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:22,029
You know its been hard on my... my wife.
It's a shock.

642
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:27,225
And an um... it doesn't help
that there's a baby around.

643
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:28,732
But it's okay.
I mean it's okay.

644
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,525
What do you mean that it doesn't
help that there's a baby around?

645
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:38,579
Well I just mean that with everything
that's... that's going on...

646
01:00:39,919 --> 01:00:43,065
We're justing trying to...
to get all this in order.

647
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:45,972
Before I can take care of that.

648
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:49,065
It... it's been hard it... it... it...

649
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:53,032
I've just been so busy that its been...

650
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:56,325
hard to uh...

651
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:07,365
I've... I've hard time...

652
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:15,464
looking at my son.

653
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,999
-And that's something new since the shooting?
-Mmhm.

654
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,639
You know I... I saw in the police record that
this perp also had a one year old son.

655
01:01:29,892 --> 01:01:33,749
His name is Jason.
You been thinking about this?

656
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:41,132
This you mean...

657
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:47,149
-The fact that he had a boy?
-Yeah.

658
01:01:47,592 --> 01:01:49,025
Do you think...

659
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,452
You're having a hard time looking
at your son because...

660
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:55,779
you're thinking about this other
little boy that won't have his father?

661
01:02:31,872 --> 01:02:34,019
-You expecting somebody?
-No. You?

662
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:37,132
-Hey.

01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:38,452

01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:21,245
-Want some salad?
-I'm glad we decided to do this.

683
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:23,445
Oh good. I'm glad you guys came to visit.

684
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:25,732
Thanks.

685
01:03:25,965 --> 01:03:27,785
So how's it feel to have the hero home?

686
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:29,659
Probably can't wait for him to get back to work huh?

687
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,932
No. It's... it's great having him home, I just...

688
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:35,352
Thank God he's okay, you know.

689
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,405
God bless that.
I think we should toast on that.

690
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:40,645
-To our hero.
-To hero boy.

691
01:03:40,872 --> 01:03:42,405
-Hero boy.
-Here you go.

692
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:44,809
Glad you're okay.

693
01:03:44,845 --> 01:03:48,719
I've been on the force for twenty two years,
pulled the trigger maybe three, four times.

694
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:51,959
You're on for six months,
you already got one in the bag.

695
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:53,459
And he was white.

696
01:03:54,919 --> 01:03:56,959
That's an extra fifty.

697
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,199
-Better him than me right?
-You got that right.
-Absolutely.

698
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:02,699
You guys have any plans for tonight?

699
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:05,999
-Um.
-No, we're just um...

700
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:07,912
-This is it.
-Yeah?

701
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,585
This is the big plan.
Having you guys here for dinner.

702
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:17,139
Would you mind if we stole the hero
for a little police work, after this?

703
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,832
-Tonight?
-And we'll have him back by curfew.

704
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:29,579
I don't know honey. You should probably
rest tonight. Maybe tomorrow night.

705
01:04:29,605 --> 01:04:31,889
Yeah... we kind of need him tonight.

706
01:04:31,939 --> 01:04:34,845
-Is there a problem?
-What about your... your leg?

707
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:38,269
Well, we're not going to be running.
We'll carry him.

708
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:39,819
What are you gonna do?

709
01:04:39,965 --> 01:04:43,772
We just want to introduce him to a bunch of people
who really admire him for what he did.

710
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:47,591
They just want to congratulate him in person.

711
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:49,079
Good, it sounds good.

712
01:04:49,465 --> 01:04:51,699
We leave in about twenty minutes.

713
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:54,932
Not that we want to eat and run
but, we are on duty.

714
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:58,939
No you should go. That's a great idea.
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.

715
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:01,932
-There you have it.
-You're a hero.

716
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:05,599
I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.

717
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:06,765
-Me?
-Yeah.

718
01:05:06,939 --> 01:05:08,265
-He is a hero.
-Yeah.

719
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:10,785
-He's a hero around here, that's for sure.
-You don't mind if we take him than, do you?

720
01:05:10,812 --> 01:05:13,279
-Not at all. I think it's a great idea.
-Yeah. Alright.

721
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:15,465
There you have it.
You're released.

722
01:05:15,852 --> 01:05:18,005
-Release the hounds.
-Yeah.

723
01:05:26,545 --> 01:05:27,452
Hey Avery...

724
01:05:27,899 --> 01:05:31,829
Does she sometimes like to tuck her
balls up at least at night?

725
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:36,719
Hey, Pete.
Pete.

726
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:38,079
-What?
-Can you pop the trunk?

727
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,472
Sure it's okay with her?

728
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:48,592
-Scott, you know I"m not on active duty right?
-Yeah, we're aware.

729
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,932
It's a little gift I got going for you.

730
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:53,765
Lets go.

731
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,659
Police.

732
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:02,485
Hi.
Romina Gutierrez please.

733
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:05,705
-That's Romina right there.
-Yeah.

734
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:12,172
-Hi. Hi I'm Officer Deluca. Romina Gutierrez?
-Yeah.

735
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:14,259
Yeah, we're here to search your house.

736
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:15,499
What for?

737
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,492
-For evidence.
-Evidence for what?

738
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:21,079
We're looking for the money that Luke Glanton
may or may have not given to you.

739
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:23,592
Yeah, we don't have anything thing that that...

740
01:06:24,572 --> 01:06:26,425
Ah you can't just walk in here.

741
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:27,152
Yeah I can.

742
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,685
-No you can't.
-Whys that?

743
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:30,592
Cause it's my house.

744
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:32,212
Look...

745
01:06:32,265 --> 01:06:36,539
You assume that I have a warrant and I'll
assume that your mother has papers okay?

746
01:06:38,212 --> 01:06:39,619
This won't take long.

747
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:41,585
Come on.

748
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:42,139
Kofi.

749
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:44,172
Can we just start upstairs okay?

750
01:06:44,192 --> 01:06:46,625
No, no, no, no.
No, no, my baby is upstairs.

751
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:48,425
-My baby, my baby is upstairs sleeping.
-Baby's upstairs?

752
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:51,465
-Yeah my baby is upstairs sleeping, so we're not going to start...
-Alright. Well we won't rustle your baby.

753
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,052
No, no, no.
Don't go up there.

754
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:54,899
-Romina...
-Hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

755
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:56,919
-He can't go up there.
-Yeah, he can.

756
01:06:56,985 --> 01:07:00,292
You can go up there if you want, but if we
find evidence while you're up there...

757
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,785
-Your under arrest.
-Why?

758
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:05,365
We've done this a lot of times okay.
It'll be quiet.

759
01:07:05,952 --> 01:07:07,832
Go on Scotty.
Be quiet.

760
01:07:11,732 --> 01:07:13,532
-How about a cup of coffee?
-Yes, yes, yes.

761
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:14,525
That'll be great.

762
01:07:17,272 --> 01:07:19,339
-Go into your living room here?
-Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

763
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,205
Thanks.

764
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:28,989
Sorry for your loss.

765
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:37,739
Romina, lets go.
Come on.

766
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,052
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

767
01:07:57,259 --> 01:07:59,699
Hey, this is crazy.

768
01:08:00,525 --> 01:08:03,889
-Wait outside.
-I don't want to. We gotta go. This is fucked up.

769
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,952
-Why the fuck are we here?
-Let go of my arm man.

770
01:08:05,979 --> 01:08:08,592
-What the fuck are we doing here?
-Let go of my arm.

771
01:08:08,632 --> 01:08:11,259
-Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
-Shutup.

772
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:19,612
-About how long did you know Luke?
-A couple of years.

773
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:22,599
-Did you know he was robbing banks?
-No.

774
01:08:22,652 --> 01:08:24,329
-You didn't know that at all?
-No.

775
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:28,525
Let me just ask you one more time
because this is... this is what we do.

776
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:32,699
-You have no knowledge to this money?
-No.

777
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:35,439
-Officer I swear to God.
-It's not here?

778
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:38,389
-No
-It's not outside?

779
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,222
If I was gonna hid something
I would hide it closest to my heart.

780
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:50,679
Scott.

781
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:58,259
Pick him up.

782
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,785
-Pick up the baby.
-I don't think we should.

783
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:04,969
-I don't want to wake him. I don't wanna pick him up.
-Pick him up, pick him up.

784
01:09:44,533 --> 01:09:45,871
I'm good.

785
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,999
Put him back.
Lets go.

786
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:23,612
-What's up?
-Yeah, they're clean.

787
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,352
Alrighty, lets get out of your hair.

788
01:10:31,552 --> 01:10:35,012
You got this Scotty, cmon.
Help him out will you.

789
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:37,619
-Scotty stop, stop.
-Give me a chance to count it.

790
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:40,025
You... you going to count like that,
we're going to be here till five in the morning.

791
01:10:40,059 --> 01:10:42,832
-How are you gonna count it?
You got a money counter there asshole?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
01:10:43,229 --> 01:10:45,725
-Fourteen grand.
-$14,000?

793
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:50,449
Well it's not going to be a even split because
the lion's share is going to our hero.

794
01:10:51,132 --> 01:10:54,109
Consider it unofficial hazard pay.

795
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:58,219
From us to you.

796
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:00,692
Enjoy it.

797
01:11:01,459 --> 01:11:03,619
Cause you're not going to get
it from the department.

798
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:06,929
Don't spend it all on one place.

799
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:09,592
You fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.

800
01:11:10,285 --> 01:11:13,619
Not bad huh?
Not bad for a nights work.

801
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:41,349
We're gathered here to celebrate a
cop who makes other cops proud.

802
01:11:41,519 --> 01:11:45,829
We can all rest a little easier tonight
now that he is on the path to recovery.

803
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:49,355
Ladies and gentleman, Officer Avery Cross.

804
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:57,612
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Thank you for your support.

805
01:11:58,425 --> 01:12:01,889
When I was in law school,
we used toalways talk about...

806
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,559
Justice.
We had discussions about justice.

807
01:12:07,792 --> 01:12:09,459
That's just what they were.

808
01:12:10,345 --> 01:12:11,679
Discussions.

809
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:15,292
I joined the police force because I
wanted to work alonside the...

810
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:19,259
brave men and women who know some
problems can't be solved by talk.

811
01:12:20,122 --> 01:12:23,678
But no one wants to be in the situation
I found myself in a couple of weeks ago.

812
01:12:24,499 --> 01:12:27,569
I certainly wish it had turned out differently.

813
01:12:27,912 --> 01:12:31,849
I'm not going to lie.
Sometimes I haven't wished that...

814
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,559
maybe it wasn't me that was called
upon that house that day.

815
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:38,227
But that's the job.

816
01:12:39,249 --> 01:12:41,692
But I can't think of another line of
work I would rather be in.

817
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,472
Thank you.

818
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,852
How does it feel?

819
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:08,072
I'm not sure it's doing much good.

820
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:12,559
-How's the spotlight?
-I'm ready for it to end.

821
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:16,079
Don't worry.
It will.

822
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:21,352
You know the police always put on a big
show when something like this happens because...

823
01:13:21,925 --> 01:13:24,231
the hero card is the only
one they have to play.

824
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:27,349
I'm not really thinking about that Dad.
I'm just trying to get back to work.

825
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:31,199
You know if you planned this
it couldn't have turned out any better.

826
01:13:32,192 --> 01:13:35,489
You're not going to make it work for
you in the police department.

827
01:13:35,705 --> 01:13:36,912
I promise you that.

828
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,139
I didn't come here to be lectured Dad.

829
01:13:39,312 --> 01:13:43,319
You tricked me.
You said the pool would be good for my knee.

830
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,839
-Sorry.
-You know, I'm not as calculated as you are.

831
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:50,389
My life is not a campaign.
It's much simpler.

832
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:51,452
Yeah.

833
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:55,629
Though for somebody who's not campaigning,
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.

834
01:13:55,872 --> 01:13:57,889
You certainly have my vote.

835
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:01,765
Plus that knee is a gold mine.

836
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:07,549
No I mean it.
A limp goes a long way in politics.

837
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:12,319
Look at Roosevelt.

838
01:14:46,012 --> 01:14:47,672
I got to go see the chief.
I got to go see the chief.

839
01:14:47,705 --> 01:14:49,505
-Where you going brother?
-I don't know. I don't know.

840
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:52,439
Is it bad news?
Is it gonna be bad news?

841
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,165
Oh Jesus Christ.

842
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:04,549
Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.

843
01:15:11,873 --> 01:15:14,660
I got a call today from D.A. Killcullen.

844
01:15:15,305 --> 01:15:16,252
Close the door.

845
01:15:20,332 --> 01:15:24,959
The state internal investigation into shooting of
Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.

846
01:15:25,712 --> 01:15:27,185
Congratulations officer.

847
01:15:27,332 --> 01:15:30,549
You can put it behind you.
Get back to police work.

848
01:15:30,919 --> 01:15:33,985
The question is can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon?

849
01:15:34,019 --> 01:15:36,809
And if you could, can you be effective?

850
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:38,492
I don't think that I can.

851
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:43,052
That's okay. You know what there's a lot
of jobs to be done around here.

852
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:44,659
That in ways and you know that.

853
01:15:44,692 --> 01:15:47,399
In ways that are much more important
than what happens out on the street.

854
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:51,292
I'm so glad that you said that. Because Chief I've
thought a lot about this and the...

855
01:15:52,545 --> 01:15:57,979
I... I think I can be best utilized as... as lieutenant
in... in charge of special investigations.

856
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:01,485
There's a lot of restructuring ah within
the division that I've actually formally...

857
01:16:01,499 --> 01:16:03,219
I can't fucking do that.

858
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:06,492
Well yeah, of course... of course you could.
I mean...

859
01:16:08,132 --> 01:16:11,825
Cross come on.
You paid too much for your education to act so stupid.

860
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:14,685
But I think it is the very fact that I do
have a education like this that perhaps...

861
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:17,652
the reason why I thought about
how restructuring the... the unit...

862
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:22,312
-Um, the division can actually benefit you, me, and a couple...
-Cross, I appreciate you ambition. I really do.

863
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:26,172
Uh and uh I think... you know...you..
I think you are going to be a great cop.

864
01:16:26,205 --> 01:16:28,169
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.

865
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:31,869
But at this point. Right now.
You gotta get back to real life.

866
01:16:31,892 --> 01:16:34,532
-And in real life you got two choices.
-Which are?

867
01:16:34,559 --> 01:16:38,045
-You can retire on disability.
-I don't want to do that.

868
01:16:38,085 --> 01:16:40,685
Alright, good. I don't want you to do that either.
Or...

869
01:16:40,732 --> 01:16:43,959
You can be reassigned at your current rank.

870
01:16:45,145 --> 01:16:46,469
That's it.

871
01:16:47,025 --> 01:16:49,009
You gotta work your way up man.

872
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:56,079
Hey man.
I heard you were down here.

873
01:16:56,405 --> 01:16:57,499
Hey.

874
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,409
What are you doing?

875
01:17:01,385 --> 01:17:02,779
What are you doing on plain clothes?

876
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:04,912
Oh you didn't hear?
I made Vice.

877
01:17:06,172 --> 01:17:09,405
-Get the fuck outta here.
-Yeah man, I'm actually paired up with Deluca.

878
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,619
Good.
What have you got for me?

879
01:17:11,845 --> 01:17:16,292
Oh yeah. A couple of mutts left this in the back
seat of their car with a leaky substance.

880
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:17,365
Oh nice.

881
01:17:17,905 --> 01:17:20,819
So when are we going to get together?
Grab a little bite.

882
01:17:20,992 --> 01:17:22,159
I want to talk about some things.

883
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,639
-Sounds great.
-Alright man.

884
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:25,019
-Page me.
-Okay.

885
01:17:25,165 --> 01:17:26,012
Thanks.

886
01:17:27,945 --> 01:17:30,329
What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.

887
01:17:30,425 --> 01:17:32,645
The only reason I'm asking you is
because you're my friend.

888
01:17:32,992 --> 01:17:34,292
Well I don't know what I can do to help...

889
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:36,289
-but yeah. What do you need?
-Alright. Right on.

890
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:38,772
Deluca and I have been working
on this case right.

891
01:17:39,385 --> 01:17:43,692
And uh... I'm going to need you to
keep this to yourself. It's a little private.

892
01:17:44,379 --> 01:17:48,512
And uh... I don't want anybody
to know about it, okay?

893
01:17:48,592 --> 01:17:49,672
Okay.

894
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:52,605
Deluca and I have been working
with this fucking hooker.

895
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:55,125
We gotta fucking head her off
with some coke.

896
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:58,265
So Deluca and I thought that you know, if...

897
01:17:58,765 --> 01:18:00,985
We need some temporary access
to the evidence room.

898
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:03,805
We need you to get some shit. We
gotta hit this bitch off. That's what he need.

899
01:18:05,152 --> 01:18:07,845
I really tried to look out for you
with that seven grand.

900
01:18:08,285 --> 01:18:09,832
Now I need you to look out for me.

901
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:13,919
I'm serious bro.
This is how it works.

902
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:05,829
Hey.

903
01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:08,159
Hey don't worry.
It's okay.

904
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:13,129
So I didn't mean to startle you.

905
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:15,639
It's okay.
I just want to give you something.

906
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,305
Alright.
Listen.

907
01:20:18,352 --> 01:20:21,492
This is the money we recovered from your house okay.
I want you to have it.

908
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,165
I don't know what that is.

909
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:27,333
You don't have to ever see me again.
Just take the money.

910
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:30,706
I'm not here as a police officer.
I'm here as a regular guy.

911
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:31,999
Listen, listen, listen.

912
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:33,725
-Get the fuck away.
-Listen to me. Listen.

913
01:20:33,772 --> 01:20:36,185
You fucked up my son's life.

914
01:20:36,452 --> 01:20:40,419
Therefore you fucked up my life.
Get the fuck away from me.

915
01:20:54,092 --> 01:20:57,339
I should have brought this to you sooner.
I apologize.

916
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,492
This was recovered from...

917
01:20:59,539 --> 01:21:00,879
a house during a search.

918
01:21:01,059 --> 01:21:05,772
-No, what, what, wait a minute.
-That's just a small fraction of what's going on.

919
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,252
Wait a minute, Cross.

920
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:11,249
Don't say another word.

921
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:13,999
-What do you mean?
-No, no, no. Don't say another word.

922
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:24,779
What do you expect me to do with this?

923
01:21:25,112 --> 01:21:26,779
-You're joking right?
-This is shit.

924
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:27,885
Chief.

925
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:30,005
This ain't my problem.
Alright.

926
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,199
This is your problem.

927
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:36,299
This is our problem of the fucking police department
and I'm bringing it to your attention..

928
01:21:36,339 --> 01:21:38,299
because that's what I should fucking do!

929
01:21:38,345 --> 01:21:39,672
Oh yeah?
-Is that right?

930
01:21:39,772 --> 01:21:41,665
-Yeah!
Is that what you should do?

931
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:43,525
-Rat out other fucking cops?
-Chief...

932
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:45,459
This is unfucking believable alright.

933
01:21:45,912 --> 01:21:47,545
Get this shit outta here.

934
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:14,299
Fuck.

935
01:23:33,645 --> 01:23:34,492
Hey.

936
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:43,212
Where are you going?

937
01:23:47,752 --> 01:23:48,499
Going home.

938
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:54,512
You know that thing...

939
01:23:54,712 --> 01:23:57,272
you and Scotty been talking about?

940
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:01,959
Yeah.

941
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:04,719
Sure.

942
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:07,999
Well you and I have to talk about it.

943
01:24:09,592 --> 01:24:10,739
Follow me.

944
01:26:02,105 --> 01:26:03,839
Hey!

945
01:26:32,412 --> 01:26:33,552
Hey Pop.

946
01:26:37,345 --> 01:26:38,799
Avery.

947
01:26:44,979 --> 01:26:46,219
There's a way out of this.

948
01:26:49,492 --> 01:26:53,019
You're not going to like it.

949
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:54,892
You want to hear?

950
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,599
Yeah, I wanna hear it.

951
01:27:04,945 --> 01:27:06,719
We'll start with the precinct.

952
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:09,052
Anybody there still trust you?

953
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,719
Scott.

954
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:14,805
We'll start with Scott.

955
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:24,772
Playing shortstop.

956
01:27:25,945 --> 01:27:28,739
Looks good. Looks bigger.
Jesus Christ.

957
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:34,985
He's ready to dump you.
The whole thing.

958
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:36,799
Enough with these fucking tests alright.

959
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,099
Either ask me to help you or
just leave me the fuck alone.

960
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:45,725
I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

961
01:27:45,752 --> 01:27:49,039
It's a... it's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

962
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:51,539
I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

963
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:53,532
I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

964
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:57,152
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

965
01:27:57,185 --> 01:27:58,519
"I made a mistake."

966
01:27:58,645 --> 01:28:01,285
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

967
01:28:01,299 --> 01:28:03,505
Nobody's going to question you, okay.

968
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:07,812
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

969
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:10,879
No problem.

970
01:28:13,072 --> 01:28:14,932
Alright.
I know I can count on you.

971
01:28:15,685 --> 01:28:16,659
Yeah.

972
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:20,665
Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.

973
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:27,565
I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

974
01:28:27,672 --> 01:28:30,752
It's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

975
01:28:30,825 --> 01:28:33,319
I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

976
01:28:33,365 --> 01:28:35,505
I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

977
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:36,145
Alright?

978
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:40,192
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

979
01:28:40,225 --> 01:28:41,639
"I made a mistake."

980
01:28:42,272 --> 01:28:44,799
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

981
01:28:44,839 --> 01:28:46,799
Nobody's going to question you, okay.

982
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:50,845
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

983
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:53,192
No problem.

984
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:00,579
Shown this to I.A.?

985
01:29:01,105 --> 01:29:02,352
Of course not.

986
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:04,739
Handing it to you on a sliver platter.

987
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:10,572
Got any idea what this means?

988
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,499
Are you ready do it?

989
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:15,559
Are you son?
Are you really ready?

990
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:18,699
Cause they're going to fucking
tear you in half.

991
01:29:19,912 --> 01:29:22,932
I'm going to need you're assurance
that you're gonna follow through.

992
01:29:24,585 --> 01:29:25,625
Really?

993
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:30,065
And I'm going to want full immunity when you do.

994
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:34,165
You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do.
You understand?

995
01:29:34,212 --> 01:29:36,252
And when you do...

996
01:29:36,432 --> 01:29:39,625
I want to be made assistant district attorney.
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.

997
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:44,719
-I don't have a spot for you right now.
-Make a spot.

998
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:45,885
I won't do that.

999
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:49,239
-I can't just snap my fingers and make you assistant D.A.
-You can say no.

1000
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:51,239
You can say no.
I'll walk out this door.

1001
01:29:51,365 --> 01:29:53,719
I walk over to the Gazette.
I'll tell them everything I know.

1002
01:29:53,799 --> 01:29:55,725
-Including this conversation.
-You're not, listen. You're not going anywhere.

1003
01:29:55,769 --> 01:29:57,105
Don't.
Listen.

1004
01:29:57,352 --> 01:29:59,892
Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.

1005
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:05,191
-All three things?
-Alright.

1006
01:30:06,389 --> 01:30:09,072
I'm not going to promise you how
long you're going to stay there.

1007
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:11,832
You're not going to shake my
fucking hand pal.

1008
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:14,905
I'll make you assistant D.A.

1009
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:16,899
I'm never going to shake your fucking hand.

1010
01:30:19,005 --> 01:30:21,289
You're too smart for your own good.

1011
01:30:24,145 --> 01:30:26,269
Get right in there for a good shot.

1012
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:30,099
Detective, how do you respond to
these allegations?

1013
01:30:33,799 --> 01:30:35,552
Drugs, corruption, and gangs.

1014
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:38,699
It's not an investigation by the
Schenectady Police Department.

1015
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:42,159
It's an investigation into the
Schenectady Police Department.

1016
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:45,149
Earlier today, D.A. Killcullen announced...

1017
01:30:45,192 --> 01:30:49,359
that his office, along with the FBI,
will be handing down indictments...

1018
01:30:49,392 --> 01:30:52,459
that would lead to the arrest of
these Schenectady police officers.

1019
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:57,159
The D.A. is making allegations today that the
Vice officers were acting like the gangs...

1020
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,139
that they were suppose to be hunting.

1021
01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:05,305
Officer Deluca stole drugs and money,
even guns from inside the evidence room here.

1022
01:31:05,812 --> 01:31:09,525
Officials say that with that stolen evidence,
the cops paid criminals...

1023
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:14,505
to help set up their rivals. Which then
led to those headline robbing arrests.

1024
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:17,705
The D.A. announced a star witness
in the case today...

1025
01:31:17,812 --> 01:31:22,325
Hero cop Avery Cross, who less than
a year ago was shot in the line of duty...

1026
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:26,789
while trying to save two Schenectady residents
from the alledged Moto Bandit.

1027
01:31:26,925 --> 01:31:30,445
-In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, News Channel 13.
-It's going to be alright.

1028
01:31:30,472 --> 01:31:34,229
Thanks Jess. It's the largest case of
fraud this region has seen.

1029
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:28,089
You know when I was a kid, I used to
look at my Dad dressed in judge's...

1030
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:32,399
robes and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.

1031
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:35,839
And I don't think I was far off.

1032
01:32:36,325 --> 01:32:41,499
He had that quality that judges have
where they have tremendous compassion.

1033
01:32:41,878 --> 01:32:44,771
But they are also ferocious
at the same time.

1034
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:47,005
He wasn't afraid of making enemies.

1035
01:32:47,165 --> 01:32:49,539
I think that's probably why
he had so many friends.

1036
01:32:50,785 --> 01:32:53,225
I had the chance right before he
fell into the coma to tell him that...

1037
01:32:53,269 --> 01:32:55,672
I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.

1038
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:57,299
And...

1039
01:33:00,072 --> 01:33:03,589
He shook his head no and
I didn't understand why.

1040
01:33:05,232 --> 01:33:09,329
So I leaned in close that he can
whisper and he said to me...

1041
01:33:09,739 --> 01:33:11,999
"I'll take the win, not the run."

1042
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:17,365
That was my dad.
That was Al.

1043
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:25,629
-Son, you want to come with me?
-Sure.

1044
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:36,992
-Avery.
-Yeah.

1045
01:33:37,092 --> 01:33:39,539
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure.

1046
01:33:41,172 --> 01:33:42,172
Close the door.

1047
01:33:46,225 --> 01:33:47,545
What's wrong?

1048
01:33:48,179 --> 01:33:50,609
We have to talk about AJ.

1049
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:52,765
He wants to come and live with you.

1050
01:33:52,905 --> 01:33:54,845
He won't stop asking me about it.

1051
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:57,779
Really?

1052
01:33:59,799 --> 01:34:02,039
I guess that's uh...

1053
01:34:02,385 --> 01:34:04,305
a good idea at some point.

1054
01:34:04,985 --> 01:34:05,972
I think he needs you.

1055
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:10,125
I think if he doesn't come and live with you,
he's going to... completely go off the rails.

1056
01:34:11,665 --> 01:34:13,939
It's just that right now, you know,
with the campaign and everything...

1057
01:34:13,969 --> 01:34:16,039
It's just not an ideal time.

1058
01:34:16,205 --> 01:34:19,489
I mean, what am I going to do with him?
I don't know what he likes or...

1059
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:22,832
I just don't think it will be
good for him or anybody.

1060
01:34:23,692 --> 01:34:25,139
I mean, come on.

1061
01:34:25,339 --> 01:34:25,632
Okay.

1062
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:27,629
-You know that.
-Well you can tell him that.

1063
01:34:28,992 --> 01:34:30,885
-Jennifer.
-What am I suppose to tell him?

1064
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,559
I just don't...
Why, why, why are you doing this right now?

1065
01:34:35,538 --> 01:34:37,708
You can tell him now.

1066
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:40,825
Tomorrow we're going to head
to Buffalo in the morning.

1067
01:34:40,859 --> 01:34:43,879
Wednesday outer boroughs in New York City.
Then the Al Smith dinner at night.

1068
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:44,719
Do we have time to get there?

1069
01:34:44,739 --> 01:34:47,092
We do, absolutely.
We'll get... we'll have our last event,...

1070
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,892
close in Queens. We'll hit the Upper West Side...

1071
01:34:48,919 --> 01:34:51,125
-Then we have to be at the Waldolf.
-How about Youseth that driver we have from Manhattan?

1072
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,305
-We can use Youseth totally.
-What's going on in Queeens?

1073
01:34:53,352 --> 01:34:56,739
In Queens, he's going to do an
event on environmental issues.

1074
01:34:56,779 --> 01:34:59,959
Um... talking about some of the,
protecting the...the Sound...

1075
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:01,959
and doing some of the environmental stuff...

1076
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:05,579
And Thursday at the Rochester for lunch
you're going to go to a place...

1077
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,419
where you are going to order something
called the Garbage Plate.

1078
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,099
I just want you to be prepared for it.

1079
01:35:09,885 --> 01:35:12,619
-Did you see that?
-Yeah, no, I just...

1080
01:35:12,652 --> 01:35:15,092
-Then Sunday morning black churches.
-Oh perfect.

1081
01:35:15,112 --> 01:35:16,985
Alright. I think we can get...

1082
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,433
Avery Cross?

1083
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:26,869
Yeah.
AJ

1084
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:27,785
AJ?

1085
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,505
-Yeah.
-Hi AJ.

1086
01:35:29,892 --> 01:35:31,505
So what high school are
you coming from?

1087
01:35:31,545 --> 01:35:32,259
From Troy High School.

1088
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:33,425
-You're coming from Troy?
-Yeah.

1089
01:35:33,472 --> 01:35:36,285
Okay, so not too far away.
What brings you to Schenectady?

1090
01:35:36,592 --> 01:35:38,245
Um, my dad wanted me here.

1091
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:42,319
-You're dad wanted you here?
-Yeah, for my senior year he wanted me to move.

1092
01:35:42,385 --> 01:35:44,892
What about you?
Did you want to come here for you're senior year?

1093
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:47,352
I don't know.
Yeah... eh....

1094
01:35:47,605 --> 01:35:50,392
Nah, I guess not.
Not really.

1095
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:53,319
-Do you know anybody here at the high school?
-Nah.

1096
01:35:53,385 --> 01:35:55,285
No, don't know anybody?

1097
01:36:21,099 --> 01:36:25,199
Just peak over you're shoulder.
Peak over you're fucking shoulder.

1098
01:36:25,259 --> 01:36:27,845
There you go.
Hello there, hello.

1099
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:29,092
Hello.

1100
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:35,399
You don't like them girls?

1101
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:38,639
I don't know.
Maybe you're just used to it.

1102
01:36:38,669 --> 01:36:41,339
They ain't got girls like that where I come from.
You feel me.

1103
01:36:41,959 --> 01:36:43,372
Where are you from?

1104
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:44,665
Troy.

1105
01:36:45,772 --> 01:36:46,909
Troy?

1106
01:36:47,239 --> 01:36:49,519
-Yeah. You heard of Troy?
-Yeah, I've heard of Troy.

1107
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:52,412
-Where's Troy at?
-It's fucking right next door, dude.

1108
01:36:52,459 --> 01:36:53,759
Right next door?

1109
01:36:53,845 --> 01:36:56,412
I would have guessed you
were from Long Island.

1110
01:36:56,579 --> 01:36:58,259
Why's that?

1111
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:04,059
It's where people that talk
like you come from.

1112
01:37:04,252 --> 01:37:05,952
Ah ha ha, see.

1113
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:09,839
I'm bored as a motherfuck around here dude.
I've been here for like fucking three days.

1114
01:37:09,885 --> 01:37:11,592
I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

1115
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:13,405
Well school can do that to you.

1116
01:37:13,432 --> 01:37:16,125
Well what you dudes do for fun?
Nothing?

1117
01:37:16,385 --> 01:37:18,872
This is it? This is what I got?
For a year?

1118
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:21,499
-No, we got somethings.
-What?

1119
01:37:22,325 --> 01:37:25,719
Don't say like a mall.
If you say a fucking mall...

1120
01:37:25,852 --> 01:37:27,305
I swear to God.

1121
01:37:30,759 --> 01:37:32,139
What do you do?

1122
01:37:32,425 --> 01:37:34,139
I get high.

1123
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:38,159
Well we can do some of
that around here.

1124
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:41,299
I can tell you smoke.
I've seen you from back there.

1125
01:37:41,345 --> 01:37:44,919
You're one of them loner... loner
stoners is what I call them. Right?

1126
01:37:45,139 --> 01:37:49,345
You like to get high and like chill in
your room and draw and shit.

1127
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:55,425
Whatcha trying to do with the rest of this day than?
You trying to go to math class?

1128
01:37:57,012 --> 01:37:58,785
You don't want to go get high?

1129
01:38:02,992 --> 01:38:05,232
-Lets go.
-Alright, lets go.

1130
01:38:12,712 --> 01:38:15,399
You know what this reminds me of?
The Goonies.

1131
01:38:15,465 --> 01:38:19,279
You know that movie?
Where like they're all in a cave.

1132
01:38:19,905 --> 01:38:22,699
You want a cigarette, just ask homie.

1133
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:24,732
I'll take a cigarette.

1134
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:28,149
I like smoking cigarettes
when I'm high.

1135
01:38:28,312 --> 01:38:30,799
You like smoking when your smoking?

1136
01:38:33,219 --> 01:38:37,049
You smoke menthols man?
Like a breath of fresh air.

1137
01:38:37,112 --> 01:38:39,812
Like a breath of fresh air
which you don't care...

1138
01:38:39,839 --> 01:38:44,009
You got the smoke puff glowing everywhere.
I swear.

1139
01:38:44,549 --> 01:38:45,739
Yo, here we go.

1140
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:48,805
I say my spit is my ammo.
My mouth is my gun.

1141
01:38:48,825 --> 01:38:53,172
And I shoot up your whole squadron with
one flip of my tongue and you're done.

1142
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:54,779
When did you write that?

1143
01:38:54,945 --> 01:38:57,279
Nah I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.

1144
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,472
Fucking quiet around here.

1145
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:05,598
Shit though, when I was a kid, there
was always kid playing here, you know.

1146
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:07,532
Oh you came here
when you was a kid?

1147
01:39:07,839 --> 01:39:11,212
Yeah man.
I come here with my parents sometimes.

1148
01:39:11,762 --> 01:39:14,931
-Your parents still together?
-Yeah.

1149
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,239
That's cool.

1150
01:39:18,192 --> 01:39:20,479
-That they're still together.
-Yeah, it's alright.

1151
01:39:21,959 --> 01:39:23,669
It's not my real dad though.

1152
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,179
Where's your real dad at?

1153
01:39:28,099 --> 01:39:32,259
Um... he died actually.
Like in a car accident or something.

1154
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:34,159
Shit.

1155
01:39:37,085 --> 01:39:39,129
Hey this is kinda bud dude.

1156
01:39:40,412 --> 01:39:43,069
But umm, do you know where I
can score some X?

1157
01:39:49,959 --> 01:39:50,792
Yeah.

1158
01:39:51,645 --> 01:39:52,972
For tonight?

1159
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:55,459
Well we just did a downer.
We gotta get up.

1160
01:40:03,292 --> 01:40:06,899
-Remember to come back by yourself alright?
-Yeah man, you got it.

1161
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:16,499
Lets go.

1162
01:40:20,372 --> 01:40:22,145
-Let me see it.
-What?

1163
01:40:22,232 --> 01:40:25,959
-Let me see the fucking drugs.
-You fucking seriously man?

1164
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:29,069
Let me see my fucking drugs.

1165
01:40:34,792 --> 01:40:35,839
What the fuck?

1166
01:40:35,872 --> 01:40:39,019
-I gave you five hundo.
-Yeah, that's twenty pills.

1167
01:40:39,065 --> 01:40:42,065
Yo that's inflation or something right?

1168
01:40:45,759 --> 01:40:51,485
Oh yo what the fuck son.
Dead ass it's the fucking five-o.

1169
01:40:51,559 --> 01:40:52,725
-Oh fuck!
-Fuck!

1170
01:40:52,759 --> 01:40:55,879
-Police! Let me see your hands!
-Police! Get on the ground!

1171
01:40:55,929 --> 01:40:57,632
-Down, on the ground!
-Fuck you alright!

1172
01:40:57,659 --> 01:41:01,105
-Get on the ground!
-Interlace your fingers.

1173
01:41:07,425 --> 01:41:10,712
He scored Ecstasy from some Schenectady kid.

1174
01:41:10,919 --> 01:41:14,799
-Who arrested them?
-A couple of beat cops. McCracken and Potter.

1175
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:18,999
-You know these guys?
-Mmhmm. They'll sit on it if I ask them to.

1176
01:41:20,499 --> 01:41:24,492
-Did anybody else see anything in there?
-No, I made sure of that.

1177
01:41:30,452 --> 01:41:34,065
-Didn't you get any sense that the knew this kid or?
-Huh, friends.

1178
01:41:34,559 --> 01:41:36,329
-Just the two of them?
-Yeah.

1179
01:41:36,733 --> 01:41:37,578
Okay.

1180
01:41:38,352 --> 01:41:40,099
Whats this other kid's name?

1181
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:41,719
Jason Kancam.

1182
01:41:42,085 --> 01:41:44,519
-I busted him a few years ago for some shoplifting.
-What's his name?

1183
01:41:45,012 --> 01:41:46,379
Jason Kancam.

1184
01:41:56,512 --> 01:41:59,132
-Gordon, can we kill the mic on three.
-Yeah.

1185
01:42:09,752 --> 01:42:12,845
Dad. I fucked up, I know and....

1186
01:42:12,912 --> 01:42:15,252
And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now.

1187
01:42:15,285 --> 01:42:16,912
Not him.
Okay?

1188
01:42:17,572 --> 01:42:20,819
-What?
-I want you to leave him alone.

1189
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:23,319
Alright?

1190
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:25,925
-Okay?
-Why?

1191
01:42:27,225 --> 01:42:30,739
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me!

1192
01:42:31,772 --> 01:42:33,639
I want you to leave that fucking
kid alone, alright?

1193
01:42:33,672 --> 01:42:35,999
Look at me!
Look at me!

1194
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:38,909
You want to come live with me right?

1195
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,149
You think this is easy for me?
During this time? Huh?

1196
01:42:47,305 --> 01:42:52,109
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it... for you.

1197
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:56,292
You can have anything you want.
But I don't want you to touch that kid.

1198
01:42:56,839 --> 01:42:59,652
You leave him alone.
You underfucking stand me?

1199
01:42:59,899 --> 01:43:02,239
-Say yes!
-Yes.

1200
01:43:03,412 --> 01:43:06,459
-Look at me and say yes.
-Yes.

1201
01:43:25,292 --> 01:43:28,612
-Can you state your name for the record?
- Jason Kancam.

1202
01:43:28,912 --> 01:43:31,532
-Jason, how old are you?
-Seventeen.

1203
01:43:31,952 --> 01:43:35,519
-Are your parents here today?
-Yes. Yes.

1204
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,485
Can you come up please?

1205
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,345
-You're Jason's parents?
-Yes.

1206
01:43:45,412 --> 01:43:48,999
Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession
of a controlled substance in the third degree.

1207
01:43:49,292 --> 01:43:51,232
Counselor, do you waive a formal
reading of the charges?

1208
01:43:51,299 --> 01:43:54,112
Yes, please your Honor. In regards to my
clients status there has been a discussion...

1209
01:43:54,139 --> 01:43:55,179
with the District Attorney.

1210
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,532
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case tentatively resolved today.

1211
01:43:57,559 --> 01:44:00,892
-So i ask if you could put it on for Second Call?
-Second Call.

1212
01:44:00,932 --> 01:44:05,252
This is a C felony, so Jason could do
anywhere between five and fifteen years.

1213
01:44:05,459 --> 01:44:08,712
But I'm getting the impression from the
Prosecutor that they may be willing...

1214
01:44:08,745 --> 01:44:10,865
to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

1215
01:44:10,939 --> 01:44:13,232
The offer on his particular case...

1216
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:16,612
would be time served. Which is the
day he spent in jail. And a fine.

1217
01:44:16,672 --> 01:44:17,559
And that would be it.

1218
01:44:17,739 --> 01:44:19,739
-Can he come home with us today?
-He can.

1219
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:22,019
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody is looking out for you.

1220
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,519
Look, I didn't mean to get you
busted the other night, alright.

1221
01:44:57,985 --> 01:44:59,132
I'm sorry.

1222
01:44:59,952 --> 01:45:02,365
Yeah, that was a pretty shitty fucking night.

1223
01:45:03,532 --> 01:45:05,359
But don't worry about it.

1224
01:45:06,392 --> 01:45:09,339
I was outta there in five fucking minutes still.

1225
01:45:10,559 --> 01:45:13,872
You think I'm going to sit there and
get fucked up the ass all night?

1226
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,819
What happened when you got home?

1227
01:45:19,339 --> 01:45:20,245
Huh?

1228
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:23,552
Went upstairs.

1229
01:45:25,259 --> 01:45:28,769
Tried to go to sleep but I was
still tripping like a motherfucker.

1230
01:45:29,759 --> 01:45:32,125
Why?
What happened to you when you got home?

1231
01:45:34,512 --> 01:45:35,832
I'm cool man.

1232
01:45:36,139 --> 01:45:38,652
Ah your moms was all worried and shit?

1233
01:45:39,105 --> 01:45:41,032
Ah man, my moms...

1234
01:45:43,769 --> 01:45:45,039
I'm cool man.

1235
01:45:45,379 --> 01:45:46,772
Really?

1236
01:45:48,139 --> 01:45:50,285
Cause I saw that guy today.

1237
01:45:52,292 --> 01:45:53,685
What guy?

1238
01:45:54,272 --> 01:45:55,679
Your dad.

1239
01:45:57,479 --> 01:45:59,659
Nice of your fucking dad.

1240
01:46:00,819 --> 01:46:02,432
When did he move in?

1241
01:46:07,085 --> 01:46:09,299
What the fuck are you talking about AJ?

1242
01:46:09,525 --> 01:46:10,319
Huh?

1243
01:46:10,372 --> 01:46:12,749
-I just wanna know. Don't freak out...
-What the fuck is your problem?

1244
01:46:17,919 --> 01:46:19,379
What the fuck is your problem?

1245
01:46:19,599 --> 01:46:22,039
-Chill dude. Chill.
-What's your problem AJ?

1246
01:46:23,372 --> 01:46:24,959
Just fucking around.

1247
01:46:26,659 --> 01:46:28,099
Be so serious.

1248
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,485
You got a fucking temper B.

1249
01:46:34,799 --> 01:46:36,645
You need to watch that shit.

1250
01:46:36,872 --> 01:46:39,005
It's gonna get you in fucking trouble.

1251
01:46:42,232 --> 01:46:46,929
-How's school Vanessa?
-It's okay. I had trouble with math.

1252
01:46:47,419 --> 01:46:50,072
Hey, what's the deal with my dad?

1253
01:46:54,852 --> 01:46:56,185
What?

1254
01:47:00,385 --> 01:47:03,299
What? Did you like really
hate him or something?

1255
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:07,349
What was his name?

1256
01:47:08,432 --> 01:47:10,092
-God damn it.
-What was his first name?

1257
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:11,999
I'm not doing this.

1258
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:22,369
How come Mom never talks
to me about my dad?

1259
01:47:23,792 --> 01:47:25,739
I'm your father.

1260
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,809
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1261
01:47:35,185 --> 01:47:38,459
It's her business to talk about it.
Not talk about you.

1262
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:42,779
Grandma used to tell me something.

1263
01:47:42,952 --> 01:47:44,479
Yeah?
What she used to say?

1264
01:47:45,652 --> 01:47:47,292
She said like...

1265
01:47:48,532 --> 01:47:51,359
Just that he was like an outlaw.

1266
01:47:52,272 --> 01:47:53,372
You know.

1267
01:47:53,872 --> 01:47:55,805
Sound cool to you?

1268
01:47:57,592 --> 01:47:58,832
I don't know.

1269
01:47:59,979 --> 01:48:01,939
He's not your father.

1270
01:48:02,199 --> 01:48:03,612
Not really.

1271
01:48:03,845 --> 01:48:05,609
Just some guy with a baby.

1272
01:48:07,392 --> 01:48:08,792
I'm your father.

1273
01:48:12,232 --> 01:48:15,599
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.

1274
01:48:16,312 --> 01:48:18,252
Can you at least tell me his name?

1275
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:53,139
Hello?

1276
01:50:02,445 --> 01:50:03,399
Yeah?

1277
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:07,512
I'm looking for Robin.

1278
01:50:08,672 --> 01:50:11,265
Yeah I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?

1279
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:16,978
I was hoping to talk with
you about Luke Glanton.

1280
01:50:18,265 --> 01:50:19,772
I'm his son.

1281
01:50:24,425 --> 01:50:26,385
Luke Glanton's son?

1282
01:50:27,012 --> 01:50:27,992
Yeah.

1283
01:50:32,432 --> 01:50:35,729
Well.
Come on back, get a beer.

1284
01:50:36,485 --> 01:50:39,929
Bet he's down here in this box.

1285
01:50:41,065 --> 01:50:43,409
If I remember rightly...

1286
01:50:43,899 --> 01:50:44,985
Well...

1287
01:50:45,799 --> 01:50:46,785
Yeah.

1288
01:50:58,659 --> 01:51:02,059
That guys your dad.
That's him there.

1289
01:51:02,105 --> 01:51:05,769
And that's the pig there.
The one that pegged him.

1290
01:51:06,759 --> 01:51:08,272
What happened to him?

1291
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,212
Who?
The cop?

1292
01:51:10,445 --> 01:51:13,812
Ah forget about him man.
Don't, don't start there.

1293
01:51:14,372 --> 01:51:17,419
I'll show you good things.
I'll show you good things.

1294
01:51:17,779 --> 01:51:19,125
Come on.

1295
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:25,459
You are standing right where your dad
used to stand when we used to talk.

1296
01:51:26,785 --> 01:51:29,219
He's a good guy.
Your dad.

1297
01:51:30,332 --> 01:51:31,572
Oh wow.

1298
01:51:31,612 --> 01:51:34,352
Yeah those glasses.
I haven't seen them in a long time.

1299
01:51:34,379 --> 01:51:37,032
Them, them. They're his.
Those goofy glasses.

1300
01:51:37,165 --> 01:51:38,445
-These were his?
-Yeah.

1301
01:51:38,539 --> 01:51:41,672
You keep those.
He would have wanted you to have them.

1302
01:51:42,199 --> 01:51:43,525
Was he good at anything?

1303
01:51:43,639 --> 01:51:47,359
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle
rider I've ever seen in my life.

1304
01:51:47,692 --> 01:51:48,439
Best.

1305
01:51:48,552 --> 01:51:50,099
-Yeah?
-Best.

1306
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:52,919
Never see another one like him.
Best.

1307
01:51:53,539 --> 01:51:54,745
He was like...

1308
01:51:54,812 --> 01:51:57,032
Nothing.
We're here.

1309
01:51:58,012 --> 01:51:59,705
You guys good friends?

1310
01:52:02,605 --> 01:52:04,712
Yeah, I think we were.

1311
01:52:05,665 --> 01:52:07,552
You still got his bike?

1312
01:52:11,692 --> 01:52:14,539
No his bike is gone.

1313
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:17,699
Police took it.

1314
01:52:18,632 --> 01:52:20,459
I think they cut it up.

1315
01:52:21,912 --> 01:52:26,419
They were angry with him. I know that.
They were real mad with him.

1316
01:52:27,339 --> 01:52:30,579
I can show you some other things too.
If you want to see more.

1317
01:52:30,632 --> 01:52:31,985
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1318
01:52:37,565 --> 01:52:40,159
-Why don't you put the glasses on?
-Nah.

1319
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:43,605
For sure, he would have said
they were left there for you.

1320
01:52:44,445 --> 01:52:45,839
No doubt.

1321
01:52:48,485 --> 01:52:50,832
Put em on, if you want.
Go on.

1322
01:52:51,219 --> 01:52:54,005
-Yeah?
-Put em on. Come on. I'll tell you.

1323
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:56,079
Yeah.

1324
01:52:56,619 --> 01:52:57,519
Yeah.

1325
01:52:57,839 --> 01:53:00,739
-Yeah?
-Yeah. You're calling him back.

1326
01:53:19,472 --> 01:53:20,299
You.

1327
01:53:20,652 --> 01:53:21,732
Jason!

1328
01:53:22,452 --> 01:53:24,099
Jaaaasooon.

1329
01:53:26,839 --> 01:53:28,305
Let me talk to you.

1330
01:53:28,825 --> 01:53:32,699
Look man, I want to say I'm sorry
about what happened earlier alright.

1331
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:34,639
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.

1332
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:37,899
You lost my money.

1333
01:53:38,169 --> 01:53:42,059
Alright. Like that's, I think that's
all I need to do to fucking say, alright.

1334
01:53:42,292 --> 01:53:44,599
But I'm willing to fucking squash it, okay.

1335
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:47,709
If you need to squash it.
I need to squash it.

1336
01:53:48,172 --> 01:53:51,409
I said I'm sorry brother.
I meant that shit.

1337
01:53:51,819 --> 01:53:53,159
Whatcha thinking?

1338
01:53:53,719 --> 01:53:54,499
Okay.

1339
01:53:54,565 --> 01:53:57,085
-You dig?
-Okay.

1340
01:53:57,639 --> 01:53:59,679
-We good?

01:54:55,282 --> 01:54:56,479
Yo J!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:59:57,412 --> 02:00:00,332
-Is that AJ's dad?
-I think so.

1377
02:00:13,945 --> 02:00:16,499
Are you feeling alright?

1378

You got something you need to tell me.

02:00:52,445 --> 02:00:54,545

02:01:52,352 --> 02:01:53,865

1388
02:01:53,992 --> 02:01:56,179
Can you hear me baby?

1389
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:00,079
Vanessa, get your father.

1390
02:02:04,005 --> 02:02:05,339
Baby.

1391
02:02:10,459 --> 02:02:12,492
You're a liar.

1392
02:02:20,532 --> 02:02:22,025
He woke up?

1393
02:02:24,539 --> 02:02:25,932

1394
02:02:29,332 --> 02:02:30,459
Hey, Jason.

1395
02:02:36,572 --> 02:02:39,139
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm going to get the car.

1396
02:02:39,712 --> 02:02:41,045
Okay?

1397
02:03:33,419 --> 02:03:36,779
-What the hell happened to you?

You need a gun?

1401
02:03:43,739 --> 02:03:45,079
Come on in.

1402
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:44,905
What the fuck?

1403
02:04:47,485 --> 02:04:51,165
-Get on the fucking floor!
-Alright, stop! Fuck!

1404
02:04:56,839 --> 02:04:58,169
It's alright.

1405
02:04:58,799 --> 02:05:00,919
-Alright, see you tomorrow.
-Alright.

1406
02:05:51,492 --> 02:05:54,532
-Are you alone?
-What's going on?

1407
02:05:54,979 --> 02:05:57,592
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

1408
02:06:00,585 --> 02:06:02,565
We're going to get in your car...

1409
02:06:03,339 --> 02:06:05,539
and you're just going to keep driving.

1410
02:06:07,389 --> 02:06:11,065
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot you
in the back of your head.

1411
02:06:11,752 --> 02:06:12,879
Go.

1412
02:06:51,579 --> 02:06:52,899
Turn around.

1413
02:06:57,819 --> 02:06:59,219
Turn around.

1414
02:07:23,365 --> 02:07:25,985
How did you get into my house?

1415
02:07:30,739 --> 02:07:32,659
AJ let me in.

1416
02:07:35,485 --> 02:07:36,792
Is he okay?

1417
02:07:43,572 --> 02:07:44,939
Is he?!

1418
02:07:53,912 --> 02:07:55,459
Give me your wallet.

1419
02:07:55,925 --> 02:07:57,139
Where's your wallet?

1420
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:01,432
-It's in my jacket.
-Give me your jacket.

1421
02:08:01,532 --> 02:08:04,489
You want my wallet?
Take the fucking wallet.

1422
02:08:04,645 --> 02:08:07,229
You want my jacket?
Jacket.

1423
02:08:11,319 --> 02:08:13,959
Get on your knees.

1424
02:08:14,165 --> 02:08:15,659
What did you do to my son?

1425
02:08:15,759 --> 02:08:17,872
Get on your fucking knees!

1426
02:08:29,319 --> 02:08:30,652
Close your eyes.

1427
02:08:31,059 --> 02:08:32,719
Close your eyes.

1428
02:08:33,099 --> 02:08:35,445
Please, just tell me my son's alright.

1429
02:08:37,565 --> 02:08:39,649
This isn't about your fucking son.

1430
02:09:10,565 --> 02:09:12,472
I'm sorry Jason.

1431
02:09:15,932 --> 02:09:17,412
I'm sorry.

1432
02:10:54,205 --> 02:10:58,665
It was a tight race for over a
year between Cross and Kellerman...

1433
02:10:58,699 --> 02:11:03,759
and then unprecedented events over the last
month will lead to threaten Cross's election bid.

1434
02:11:03,805 --> 02:11:06,559
First allegations of underage drinking at his house...

1435
02:11:06,592 --> 02:11:10,059
and then a violent robbery
from a yet unidentified intruder...

1436
02:11:10,099 --> 02:11:13,479
that left his son hospitalized with a concussion.

1437
02:11:13,539 --> 02:11:16,899
Remarkably Cross has managed
to right his campaign...

1438
02:11:16,939 --> 02:11:21,925
And now as you see, the District Attorney
has just won the election for Attorney General.

1439
02:11:21,959 --> 02:11:26,879
We will go live now as Senator Farley
prepares to address the crowds of supporters.

1440
02:11:27,759 --> 02:11:32,192
I've had the honor of knowing
Avery Cross since he was a boy.

1441
02:11:39,932 --> 02:11:45,545
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest honor to introduce

1442
02:11:45,579 --> 02:11:50,092
the next Attorney General of the state of New York.
Avery Cross.

1443
02:11:50,759 --> 02:11:53,472
AJ you gotta go. You gotta go out there.
You gotta go out there.

1444
02:11:53,512 --> 02:11:56,352
There's a flag. Go.
Go where the kid is. Go.

1445
02:12:14,625 --> 02:12:16,179
Thank you.

1446
02:12:16,825 --> 02:12:18,265
Thank you.

1447
02:12:19,952 --> 02:12:21,172
Thank you.

1448
02:12:23,612 --> 02:12:25,019
Thank you.

1449
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:29,839
Thank you.

1450
02:12:31,885 --> 02:12:33,699
Thank you so much.

1451
02:13:03,011 --> 02:13:05,012
Ibu
Ahern Drive 714
Schenectady  NY 12305

1452
02:13:55,625 --> 02:13:56,485
Yeah?

1453
02:13:57,305 --> 02:13:59,365
-Mr. Renfend?
-Yeah.

1454
02:13:59,899 --> 02:14:02,272
Hey I ah, I called you.

1455
02:14:02,812 --> 02:14:04,772
Said I was going to be out here today.

1456
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:06,959
Oh right of course.

1457
02:14:07,585 --> 02:14:08,959
Well you're early.

1458
02:14:09,079 --> 02:14:12,645
Yeah, um.
There's only like one bus headed out here.

1459
02:14:14,959 --> 02:14:17,079
So you're not from around here huh?

1460
02:14:17,819 --> 02:14:19,312
No, I'm heading out west.

1461
02:14:20,499 --> 02:14:21,545
So you ready?

1462
02:14:21,885 --> 02:14:23,359
-Want to go take a look at it?
-Yeah.

1463
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:24,459
-Let me just get my coat.
-Alright.

1464
02:14:35,205 --> 02:14:36,965
Runs great.

1465
02:14:37,652 --> 02:14:41,019
It got a lot of miles on it.
But I kept up with the maintenance.

1466
02:14:42,952 --> 02:14:44,359
How much you want for it?

1467
02:14:46,065 --> 02:14:47,999
Well I was thinking I need...

1468
02:14:48,172 --> 02:14:49,345
Five.

1469
02:15:05,305 --> 02:15:07,372
You ever ridden one of these before?

1470
02:16:18,369 --> 02:16:23,369
