1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,635
Oh my God! Jeff Woods?

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,702
My man.
Yo-- straight up? No homo.

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,475
But I got love for the man.

4
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,609
This guy was the architect
of comedy as we know it today.

5
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,381
Brilliant mind, comedic genius,

6
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,116
quick-witted,
improvisational skills,

7
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,556
crowd work!
He was the master of ceremonies.

8
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,924
He made other comics
sit down and take note.

9
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,724
He was a comic's comic!

10
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,288
Jeff Woods.

11
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,665
I mean beyond question,

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,762
if you're talking about
somebody who is the best,

13
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,967
then I think
that the name says it all.

14
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:07,911
I mean, you encompass
comedy and performance

15
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,506
and brilliance, and you take it
and you shake it up

16
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,179
and what you create is the expression
that he was able to give to the world.

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,415
He's just so--

18
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,252
he's so funny!

19
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,089
You-- I wanna...

20
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,459
I actually wanna
break him off somethin'!

21
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,158
'Cause he's so funny.
I mean, I ain't it.

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,257
He's just that funny!
He's that funny!

23
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,098
I don't know what to give him!
But some--

24
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,434
you know,
some chubby pussy!

25
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,200
Hey, man, listen,

26
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,139
Jeff Woods was GOAT.

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,870
That's what I used
to call him: GOAT!

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,468
Greatest Of All Time.

29
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,140
If you don't know
what that mean. Yeah.

30
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,677
What a shame what happened
to Jeff Woods.

31
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,380
It's a damn shame.

32
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,583
Naw. See, what had
happened was--

33
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,725
From the first time I saw Jeff Woods

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,828
I knew he was going to be a star.

35
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,241
Born on the Southside of Chicago

36
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,243
in the early '70s,

37
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,940
Jeff displayed natural comic
talent at a very young age.

38
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,885
He was the funniest
child in the world.

39
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,649
He would-- he could stand-up
in front of anybody

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,522
and make jokes! Even when the family
members would come over,

41
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:31,085
or the members of the church.
He used to talk about me and my husband.

42
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,358
- That got a little embarrassing.
- That wasn't funny though.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,559
No no. Sometimes he used
to tell too much!

44
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,762
- I didn't like that.
- Now we didn't spare the rod, baby!

45
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,736
- We could beat his li'l ass.
- Oh-- ohhh!

46
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,432
We didn't have
no problem with that!

47
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,066
Can we say that
on camera? Ass?

48
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,838
No no no. I don't know.
But anyway--

49
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,537
oooh, it just came to me.
Excuse me.

50
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,582
But anyway, um, no,
he was-- he was somethin.

51
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,379
I always knew he was
gonna be something.

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,215
- We are so proud of him.
- Yep.

53
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,516
Yes! Put that down, please.
Down, put it down.

54
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,057
- Yeah, we're proud of him. I'm-- I'm--
- Put it down.

55
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,285
- I'm proud of him.
- Yes!

56
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,555
Yeah, shit, I knew Jeff. Yep.

57
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,291
Sho' did. His ass--
he used to crack me up.

58
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,765
That motherfucker,
he knew all the records!

59
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,201
He knew Bill Cosby, Eddie Pryor!

60
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,205
I mean--
that's not Eddie Pryor.

61
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,138
That's Eddie Murphy!
Eddie Murphy.

62
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,733
Eddie Murphy,
Richard Pryor,

63
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,110
Bill Cosby.
I mean he would have us crackin' up!

64
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,615
We'd be on the floor, and I be like
"Damn, nigga, you are funny!"

65
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,050
I knew he was gonna be a comedian
'cause that motherfucker had me rollin'.

66
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,644
And it's hard to make me laugh.

67
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,817
Oh yes, I remember Jeffrey Woods.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,123
He sat in the third row,
fourth seat from the back,

69
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,961
but he spent more time standing
in the corner and missing recess.

70
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,900
Jeffrey was an intelligent child,

71
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,564
but he was always trying
to be the class clown.

72
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,938
I think it was because he wanted
the other children to like him.

73
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,841
Once he set fire to my wig

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,074
by shining sunlight
through a magnifying glass.

75
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,673
Little bastard!

76
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,241
See this hole in the chalkboard?

77
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,151
Jeffrey Woods!

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,816
After growing into young adulthood,

79
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,790
Jeff started to make his rounds

80
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,522
at the open mikes
in the local comedy clubs.

81
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,690
Jeff quickly became the hottest name

82
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,961
on the Chicago comedy scene.

83
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,868
I just smoke these--

84
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,203
'cause it helps me cut down
on my coughing, see?

85
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,470
But anyway,
Jeff Woods?

86
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,773
Yeah, I know that motherfucker.
Known him a long time.

87
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,814
Taught him every
goddamn thing he know!

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,147
Every-fucking-thing. You know
that little bullshit saying he got?

89
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,516
The one that-- "Naw.
See, what had happened was"--

90
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,885
the motherfucker stole
that shit from me.

91
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,185
See, I used to say
"What had happened was this."

92
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,386
I'ma sue the motherfucker
if I see him!

93
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,520
And I'ma shoot him!
You know what I'ma do?

94
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,894
I'ma shoot him
and then I'ma sue his ass!

95
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,991
Like millions of dreamers
from around the world,

96
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,196
Jeff came to the place
of palm trees,

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,797
sunny days and fame.

98
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,809
But the cutthroat stages of Los Angeles

99
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,243
weren't showing him any love.

100
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,042
When Jeffrey Woods first started out,

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,379
they used to flash the "time's up" light

102
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,509
before a nigga could even
finish saying his name.

103
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,214
After a while, his name started buzzing.

104
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,086
"Did you hear about
this dude Jeff Woods?!"

105
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,887
"Did you hear
about this dude Jeff Woods?"

106
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,554
And I'm like,
"Man, who da fuck is Jeff Woods?"

107
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,190
So then I caught his act one night.

108
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,359
Yeah, and the nigga was funny.

109
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,528
I mean he was all right.

110
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,766
Couldn't fuck with my act though.

111
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,742
Jeff started making memorable cameos

112
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,972
in low budget
straight-to-video comedies.

113
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,417
Naw. See, what had
happened was...

114
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,394
See, I'm telling you, it was that

115
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,592
"Naw. See, what happened was"
line that blew him up.

116
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,727
See, most comics don't know
how to market themselves.

117
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,363
He had a franchise line.
Think about it.

118
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,964
It wasn't that funny.

119
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,975
I mean, but if you hear
something enough times,

120
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,875
it'll grow on you.
Now I got a franchise line

121
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,039
and it's actually funny.

122
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,606
"Damn. I'm sho' glad
that wasn't me!"

123
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,309
Maybe y'all didn't
get it the first time.

124
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,653
Damn. I'm sho glad
that wasn't me!"

125
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,760
Wasn't me!

126
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,297
Wasn't me-- no?

127
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,004
In what seemed like a short time,

128
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,009
Jeff became one of the hottest comics

129
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,840
in town.

130
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,677
Having finally tasted success,

131
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,775
Jeff began to live the Hollywood life.

132
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,716
Hollywood life.

133
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,657
- Don't stick me, man.
- No, you got it.

134
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,785
Jeff Woods is my man, man.

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,160
Came out here from Chi-town,
did his thing.

136
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,790
I remember he used to be broke.
We used to get coffee together.

137
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,426
You know what I'm saying? We didn't
have two little pennies to do nothin'.

138
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,971
And then all of a sudden he blew up,
made his little money,

139
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,007
got to hanging around
with the wrong folks!

140
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,803
Now personally, me,
I told him, man.

141
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,207
You know what I'm saying?
If you get yo money,

142
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,835
just still act like you broke!

143
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,278
He went out there,
hanging with the wrong folks.

144
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,145
White folks, that's who
he was hanging with.

145
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,650
Hanging with them white folks,
got the wrong drugs,

146
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,051
and now he blew his little mind.
I told him that, man!

147
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,646
You see, wh-- when--
when you're black,

148
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,623
you can't do all them
type of drugs, man!

149
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,627
You gotta be like me. Chill out,

150
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,459
smoke your little weed,
have a little drink, that's it!

151
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,863
You get to doing them drugs--
white folks'll do anything.

152
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,867
You're gonna wake up
buck naked in the bathtub

153
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,836
with your kidney missing,
your asshole wet and your mouth hurt.

154
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,134
Ohhh Jeff...

155
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,904
Jeff and I would do all kinds of things.

156
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,003
Drugs, alcohol,

157
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,376
SEX-.

158
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,416
Whips, chains,

159
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,815
asphyxiation.

160
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,582
You name it.
We was nasty.

161
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,022
But that was
before I found the Lord.

162
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,083
I am now a Christian-

163
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,925
born again, saved, sanctified
and filled with the Holy Ghost.

164
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,556
Hallelujah!

165
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,499
Talking about when I was
on the road with him one time,

166
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,868
I got to see him-- ughh!
I walk in the room, the door open.

167
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,498
I see him there-- he didn't know--
I'ma tell this story.

168
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,941
He was in there,
had his underwear down,

169
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,878
sticking 8-balls
up his ass. Yeah!

170
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,178
Freak! Talking about
it hit ya harder that way!

171
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,447
I don't know what it did for him,
but it scared the shit outta me.

172
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,887
As fast as Jeff's star was rising,

173
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,916
it was falling.
Then it happened.

174
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,065
After spending months
in the hospital and rehab,

175
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,128
Jeff has all but totally faded
from the spotlight.

176
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,039
He was very reluctant to let us
film a documentary about him,

177
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,135
but after months
of begging and stalking,

178
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,703
I finally convinced him
that his story

179
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,808
would be an inspiration
to those coming behind him.

180
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,547
Yesterday he finally called

181
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,112
and agreed to do the documentary.

182
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,558
But he made me promise
that if he decides to do stand-up again,

183
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,756
I can't ever film his act.

184
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,561
Jeff is being released today.

185
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,796
We're on our way to pick him up now.

186
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,804
Yeah, I work for the post office,

187
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,840
but let me tell you what make me mad.
What make me mad

188
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,172
is people always assume
just 'cause you work at the post office

189
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,575
that you're gonna lose
your mind and go off sometime!

190
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,137
I never go off! I never tell
people that I'ma kill 'em!

191
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,649
Or run 'em down there!
Guess what? Your mail ain't coming!

192
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,049
No mail for your ass! Ha ha!

193
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,320
Jeff was one
of the first guys I met

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,416
when I got to LA.

195
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,087
We met at like at an open mike
or something, you know.

196
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,596
We clicked right away.

197
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,929
We clicked.
It was crazy.

198
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,628
Before I knew it, we were
tighter than Preach and Cochise.

199
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,503
We played the circuit,
all that stuff, man.

200
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,032
But the thing is
he was actually funny.

201
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,670
I wasn't.

202
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,648
And then she said, "it's wet"?

203
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,356
Hubie, take your arms
off the table!

204
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,986
See, Jeff and I were
in the comedy trenches together.

205
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,030
And we always said

206
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,498
when we blew up,
we would keep it real--

207
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,331
with comedy and each other.

208
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,235
My Hubert loves comedy!

209
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,037
He's been dreaming about being
a comedian since I've known him.

210
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,545
And I told him, I want you
to pursue your dreams,

211
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,082
but you better take care
of your responsibilities.

212
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,882
And he does!
My Hubert always seems to know

213
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,482
who and what is important to him.

214
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,221
Now Jeff on the other hand?

215
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,819
Huh!

216
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,489
Don't even ask me about him.

217
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,499
<i>Mmmm.</i>

218
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,762
After all that's happened, Hubert,

219
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,430
why are you still Jeff's friend?

220
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,270
I learned something about
friendship a long time ago:

221
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,776
Dealing with people is hard.

222
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,370
I mean they-- they fuck up.

223
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,608
They make mistakes.

224
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,675
They do some
of the dumbest shit imaginable.

225
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,881
But you accept your friends
for who they are--

226
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,924
good or bad!

227
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,823
That's what real friendship
is all about.

228
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,561
And that brother Jeff?
He my friend.

229
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,299
Yeah.

230
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,133
My man.

231
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,279
I don't know what I would have
done without Hubert.

232
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,383
He was the only one--

233
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,590
the only one to hold me
down the entire time.

234
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,200
I don't even think they make
friends like Hubert anymore.

235
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,676
Get in there, yes sir.
Get in there, boss.

236
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,982
How do you feel, Jeff?

237
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,682
It feels good to just have
a clear head, you know?

238
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,092
Yo, you know he from Chicago
like me-- Southside!

239
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,924
Go way back.
And let me tell ya something else--

240
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,430
I understand his situation.

241
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,092
I'm an addict myself-- Michael Coylar.
I don't mind admitting it.

242
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,931
Crackhead. Once you're an addict,
you're always an addict.

243
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,630
So I know what it's like
to get into recovery,

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,434
how to bring yourself back.
Oh man!

245
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,873
I was out there so bad.
I remember I was so high one night,

246
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,969
I broke into my own damn house!
I ain't lying.

247
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,106
I was halfway out the door with the TV
before I realized it was my damn place!

248
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,208
So I know what the brother is
going through, so I'm proud of him

249
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,776
'cause he's coming back, man.

250
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,515
He went into his li'l rehab thing,

251
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,682
now he's coming on back
and getting hisself together.

252
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,090
They gonna be glad to see you!

253
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,126
Told y'all somebody is going
to be staying with us!

254
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,193
- Uncle Jeff.
- Uncle Jeff!

255
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,247
When you're making money the way I was--
so much money, so fast?!

256
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,409
You really think it's gonna
keep coming like that forever.

257
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,584
Now I'm crashing with Hubert
till I get back on my feet.

258
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,886
I admire Hubert, man.

259
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,756
I really really do.

260
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,261
Family--

261
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,527
that's what it's all about.

262
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,363
Man, if I could have my comedy tight,

263
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,927
a wife,

264
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,768
kids at home...

265
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,799
I'd be the happiest dude
on the planet.

266
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,405
Donna, this is the best food
I had in a long time.

267
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,382
For real, for real.

268
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,419
Thank you.

269
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,021
Now Jeff was supposed to be
my Hubert's best friend.

270
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,964
But after he blew up, he wasn't even
returning Hubert's phone calls.

271
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,524
I guess he was out,
too busy getting high.

272
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,231
Now he's all saved,
sanctified and cleaned up.

273
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,274
Ha! Yeah right.

274
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,242
I told Hubert-- and I mean it--

275
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,610
Jeff's got three days
in my house-- three days!

276
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,018
I don't do crackheads
around my kids.

277
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,960
Who are you writing to?

278
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,623
Iris.

279
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,926
Oh, Iris?

280
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,971
Now that was Jeff's girlfriend.

281
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,940
Cute little schoolteacher
from Chicago.

282
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,806
She came out to LA with Jeff.

283
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,073
And while Jeff was trying
to get noticed,

284
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,172
Iris took care of all the bills.

285
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,342
I mean she was really
down for that brother.

286
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,444
I mean really!
She was a soldier.

287
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,582
I started writing to Iris

288
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,286
my first week in rehab.

289
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,195
I write her or mail her
a letter every day.

290
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,172
She never responds.

291
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,143
I understand.

292
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,307
Ladies, there some drawbacks to messin'
with these dudes on that Viagra.

293
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,318
I mean his penis is incredible,
but his hip ain't no damn good.

294
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,183
You understand me?

295
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,779
Hip be clicking.
Click click! Click click!

296
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,189
Hip be clicking!

297
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,955
And I tell you what, you don't wanna
mess around and have no baby

298
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,998
with no old penis like that.
You mess around and have a baby,

299
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,795
baby come out
seven or eight years old!

300
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,836
Step out like, "Ah!

301
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,802
Where my cigarettes at?

302
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,841
God damn.
And where are my shoes?

303
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,433
Where my clothes at?"

304
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,542
I'm killing this bitch, ain't I?

305
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,746
I'm terrified.

306
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,053
It's been so long

307
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,922
I can't even remember

308
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,053
the last time I actually
did any stand-up.

309
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,324
You know what the worst part
for me might be?

310
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,198
The expectations.

311
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,171
'Cause I know whatever
I say might not be enough, you know?

312
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,369
Once I get in the club,
it's like, everybody's like,

313
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,572
"Oh, girl, he outta rehab, girl.
Let's see how funny he is now, girl.

314
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,842
He ain't funny.
They were smokin'."

315
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,215
You know, I-- you never know.
They wanna see you fall on your face.

316
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,447
That's kinda scary.

317
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,684
As a comic, you know,

318
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,192
you like to think you can just walk
into a comedy club

319
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,128
at anytime and be
the motherfucking man!

320
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,062
Now I used to feel like that.

321
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,905
Now I don't know.

322
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,604
That's scary.

323
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,253
Hey, Joyce.

324
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,984
He got a lot of nerve
showing his face around here.

325
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,128
That boy was nobody
when Grant found him.

326
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,357
Grant put his heart and soul
into guiding that boy.

327
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,333
Grant was gonna take him
to the top!

328
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,103
And then what'd he do?

329
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,145
Like a nigga, he fucked it up!
Piece of shit!

330
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,315
Now? Okay.

331
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,884
Right to the camera-- okay.

332
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,295
Um, well.

333
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,698
You know, every--
every manager

334
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,861
dreams of having

335
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,700
that special client.

336
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,001
You know--
the one with a spark,

337
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,475
with that touch of magic!

338
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,979
And, uh, that's what
I found in Jeff.

339
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,879
Man, there's a whole lot
of stuff that I wanna tell Grant.

340
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,654
I wanna tell him
I'm ready to get back-

341
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,022
the right way.

342
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,187
I wanna tell him
I'll do whatever it takes!

343
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,328
I wanna tell him
I know I can't do it without him.

344
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,202
And most importantly,

345
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,002
I wanna tell him I'm sorry.

346
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,537
Grant, don't believe
this motherfucker!

347
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,209
That nigga's crazy, Grant!

348
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,080
Oh no.

349
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,890
Oh no, he gonna hit him.

350
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,596
Oh my God!

351
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,696
Oh.

352
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:21,762
Oh! God damn it!

353
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,671
I think it's particularly
hard in this town

354
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,610
when you've had
a "fall from grace."

355
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,410
Especially-
and I'm gonna say it--

356
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,279
for a black actor,

357
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,580
it's very difficult to get back.

358
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,520
You know, the pressure
from the media,

359
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,420
the fans, it's-.

360
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,425
Hmm, I don't know.
It's very difficult.

361
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,427
It's three times as hard
as anybody else.

362
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,962
Four.

363
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,191
No.

364
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,792
It's six times as hard.

365
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,236
So I flushed
that shit down the toilet

366
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,865
just as the po-pos were
comin' through the door.

367
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,375
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

368
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,878
Proud to say it--

369
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,778
I ain't smoke none of it!

370
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,215
We love you, Marcus!

371
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,810
I love y'all too.

372
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,913
Thank you for sharing
that with us, Marcus.

373
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,448
Thanks for your strength
and resilience.

374
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,495
Congratulations.

375
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,090
Cornelius!

376
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,601
Would you like to share with us?

377
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,865
Give us your latest testimony?

378
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,968
Okay.
How about you, Jeff?

379
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,842
Would you like to share?

380
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,006
Oh, man.

381
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,448
I'm not gonna lie.

382
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,747
I think about getting high every day.

383
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,118
You know what I mean, Machete?

384
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,748
They say once you're an addict,

385
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,815
you're always an addict.

386
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,488
Which is not the most
encouraging thing you ever heard!

387
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,397
But to sum up my week...

388
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,301
I'm lucky to be alive.

389
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,003
I used to do it all--
coke, "X," heroin.

390
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,974
But O.D.ing
and damn near dying?

391
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,517
That's a wake-up call
like a mother.

392
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,079
It forces you to put things
in perspective.

393
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,216
Best thing for me now
is just to stay active.

394
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,320
What's the saying?
"The idle mind

395
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,126
is the devil's playground"?

396
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:31,066
I believe that.
I really believe that.

397
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,502
It's best for me to just keep
nurturing my mind and my spirit.

398
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,999
That's why I got back into church.

399
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,824
Man, I don't even speak Spanish.

400
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,020
Not a word-- maybe uno.
That's it.

401
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:01,327
But one night I was walking by

402
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,993
and the spirit

403
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,866
was just calling me.

404
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,202
I been going ever since.

405
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,504
Most of the time I don't understand
a word that preacher saying-

406
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,704
"Okay, all right."

407
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,373
But I feel what he's saying.

408
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,780
That's what's important.

409
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,014
It's like in a weird way
he's speaking in tongues

410
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,148
just to me, like only I can hear it.

411
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,557
I don't know.

412
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,278
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message after the tone.

413
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,908
Hey, Iris.
This is Jeff.

414
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,610
Um,

415
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,882
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by.

416
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,720
Uh, if you got my letters,

417
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,284
you know I'm outta rehab.

418
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,923
Um, I hope you got the letters, um.

419
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,960
It feels weird
calling you Iris, babe.

420
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,365
Look, this is what I--
I just wanna say--

421
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,213
When I first started getting high...

422
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,323
she asked me if I needed to get help.

423
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,892
I told her I had it under control,

424
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,365
just now and then.

425
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,871
Classic okie-doke.

426
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,178
She hung around for a long time.

427
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,851
A lot longer than she should have.

428
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,514
All right, y'all.
Y'all ready for your next comic?

429
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,991
Make some noise?

430
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,891
All right,
y'all know how we do it.

431
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,328
We like to give some love
to the young comics in the game.

432
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,559
So let's show some love to my man as
he come to the stage from Gary, Indiana.

433
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,898
Let him hear it, y'all. F.U.

434
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,461
F-you! F-you!

435
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,201
F-you! F-you!

436
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:27,005
F-you, nigga!

437
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:31,014
Nigga trying to take my shine.
What's up, motherfuckers?!

438
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,142
Naw, gimme some more energy!
I mean, what's up, motherfuckers?

439
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,346
Me and Jeff, we studied
all of the old school comics.

440
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,413
I'm talking Carlin,
Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor.

441
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,085
See, we wanted to have
some substance to our comedy.

442
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,391
We didn't just wanna be willly-nillying
our way through the comedy world.

443
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,433
So these young bucks nowadays,
they kill me

444
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,934
'cause they-- they don't
do nothing but cuss.

445
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,834
Every time I turn around
there's a shit joke,

446
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:57,033
a dick joke,
a fuck-you motherfucker,

447
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,440
shit, pussy, dick.
You can't-- you can't do that!

448
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,102
That ain't comedy.

449
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,409
Shit, motherfuckers know, nigga,

450
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,111
when when I get on the goddamn stage,
I'm bringing that fucking realness.

451
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,052
You know what I'm sayin'? Niggas be
like "That nigga coming to the stage,

452
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,115
he bringin' that fucking real hard,
nothing-but-God-damn- that funny shit!"

453
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,023
That's all I do!
I'm that nigga!

454
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,891
You know what I'm sayin'?
Motherfuckers look to me

455
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,124
for the real shit.
They can't get it nowhere else.

456
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,063
I'm bringin' it.
I'm packaging this shit up.

457
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,193
It's what the fuck it is.
You know what I'm sayin.

458
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,533
Niggas don't understand, son.
They don't fuckin' understand!

459
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,573
I'm F.U., bitch. I'm F.U.

460
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,767
Shit.

461
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,915
Oh that's fucked up.
That's the light?

462
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,145
Y'all gonna give a nigga the light?
I'm up in here killin' this bitch.

463
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,050
Motherfucker started doing good,
y'all wanna get a nigga offstage.

464
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,214
That's fucked up though.
You know what?

465
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,588
Fuck y'all niggas! Y'all should
be glad I was on this bitch

466
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,561
in the first goddamn place, but before
I walk off this motherfucker tonight,

467
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,895
I wanna know one thing!
What bitch in here

468
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,868
is fuckin'
this nigga here? Huh?

469
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,607
F-you, nigga.

470
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,374
F-you.

471
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,613
Oh yeah, and for anybody
that's interested,

472
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:19,144
F.U. is also available
for birthday parties and church gigs.

473
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,252
Enough of that!
It's time to really kick this show

474
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,798
into third, fourth, fifth gear.

475
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,425
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

476
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,868
to give y'all
a special treat tonight.

477
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,338
Coming to the stage-
oh my God!

478
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,103
We 'bout to hit y'all
with somebody

479
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,838
y'all already know,
somebody y'all already love.

480
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,346
We about to go celebrity
on you. That's right.

481
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,111
A man who cut his teeth
right here on this stage.

482
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,277
He been away for a minute,
he coming back.

483
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,548
Ladies and gentlemen,
start clapping right now.

484
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,021
Start clapping right now!

485
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,614
Show some love for my man,

486
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,887
Mr. Jeff Woods!

487
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,266
What up, LA?

488
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,698
What's going on?

489
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,871
You know what?
It wasn't good, man. That shit was--

490
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,243
it wasn't-- it wasn't
about nothing, man.

491
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,647
I mean he saying the same old jokes
he said two years ago.

492
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,084
I mean it's good to see him
back out there, man,

493
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,179
but, you know, talk about
something new, you know?

494
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,349
This dude up on stage
that I came to see--

495
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,723
I thought he was funny
'cause I saw his old shit.

496
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,523
But he didn't do the Old shit I liked!

497
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,029
What happened to the "Naw.
See, what had happened was"?

498
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,329
He picked some old old shit
like some Moms Mabley old shit.

499
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,892
I mean I like her,
but this is fucked up!

500
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,428
It's such a shame! You know that's what
happens when you mess with those drugs.

501
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,944
I'm telling you, dog, Jeff is one of the
funniest comedians out there right now!

502
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,378
Don't get me wrong.
He messed up, you know what I'm saying.

503
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,881
This how funny--
this how funny he was to me--

504
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,282
C'mon, dog.
It wasn't that bad.

505
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,287
Okay, it was bad.
It was, it was.

506
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,688
But it's like-- it's like
not working out in a while.

507
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,091
You know?
You're just a little outta shape.

508
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,755
For me to watch him

509
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,459
doing whatever that is
on stage right now--

510
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,728
it-- it-- it just makes me weak.

511
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,428
It makes me wanna cry,
you know?

512
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,938
It's like watching your dad
get his ass kicked.

513
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,440
You know what I mean?
Like, this is the guy you look up to,

514
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,239
all of a sudden now
the neighbor is whooping his ass.

515
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,009
And you're like,
"Daddy, what-- what happened?"

516
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,810
Maybe it's time

517
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,752
that you write some new material.

518
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,958
Hubert's right, man.
I gotta write some new material.

519
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,254
I'm coming back,
I gotta come back different.

520
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,489
I'm done with that old shit. I don't
even wanna hear that shit no more.

521
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,462
Naw! See, what had
happened was--

522
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,796
Guess who I just saw, bro.
Guess who I just saw!

523
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,927
Like I said, I don't wanna hear
that shit, all right?

524
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,437
I'ma get me a pad and a pen
like back in the day,

525
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,134
write some new shit.
It's gonna be funny.

526
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,368
Okay. Love you too. Bye.

527
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,678
Well. Ahem.

528
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,117
Somebody has
an audition tomorrow

529
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,847
for a cameo role

530
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,255
on that new hit show
"Baby Mama's House."

531
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,391
What?

532
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,364
Why the long face?
This is a cameo on a hit show!

533
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,560
I'd say that's a pretty good start.

534
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,128
I don't know, Grant.

535
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,971
I mean I knew we were
starting all over again

536
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,204
and I knew it was gonna
be harder than before,

537
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,769
but-- damn!

538
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,245
You know,

539
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,758
when this guy first
came into my office,

540
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,489
he had an energy
that could not be denied!

541
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,531
He had drive.

542
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,895
He had purpose.

543
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,902
He knew what he wanted!

544
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,533
Hey!

545
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:34,044
Has anybody ever told you you look like
Jeff Woods, you handsome devil you?

546
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,714
Now come on.
Let's hear it.

547
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,850
Come on, say it!

548
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,649
Say it!

549
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,756
- Don't make me beg.
- Naw. See, what had happened was--

550
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,419
Oh, I knew it. I knew it!

551
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,196
Joyce, he said it.
You owe me lunch.

552
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,460
Okay, now look look, Jeffrey!

553
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,935
Listen up.
I want you to go there tomorrow

554
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,132
and I want you to nail it!

555
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,733
-Okay? Okay!
-<i>I</i> got you.

556
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,400
I'ma kill this audition, dog.

557
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,243
See there.
This nigga sucks.

558
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,806
Look at them cheap
bargain-basement shoes he got on.

559
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,215
- Trash, dog.

560
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,513
And word on the street,
he's still smoking.

561
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,661
I don't think there
is any other job

562
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,823
where you experience as much
hate as stand-up comedy.

563
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,766
Y'all think we're like
the Kappas or some shit,

564
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,394
it's one big fraternity.
It's not!

565
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:38,271
It's all jealousy, hate and envy.

566
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,140
Fuckin' crazy, man.

567
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,009
Larry Laughs, what's up, baby?

568
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,106
What's up, baby?

569
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,515
What's up, dog?
Good set the other night

570
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,280
about yo mama and stuff.

571
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,016
Check out Jeff over there,
trying to steal our shine.

572
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,087
Yo, Jeff!

573
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,458
Jeff, what's up, man?

574
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,519
- How's it going, bro?
- Larry!

575
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,930
Larry Laughs!
I'm a comic too.

576
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,662
Oh! Nice to meet you, man.

577
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,633
What they filming you for?

578
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,868
- Oh, it's a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?

579
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,841
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool, man.

580
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:17,278
I'm surprised to see you here
auditioning with us.

581
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,976
I thought you were big time.

582
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,279
Naw, man, I ain't big time.

583
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:24,651
Not no more you ain't!

584
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,452
You still messing around
with them drugs, man?

585
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,459
Heard you used to get
fucked up back in the day.

586
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,359
Hey, Larry, no disrespect, man,
I just wanna focus on my sides,

587
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,399
you know, so I can be prepared
when I go in, if you don't mind.

588
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:40,733
Well, fuck you then, nigga!
Fuck you and this damn documentary.

589
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,170
That's why you fell the fuck off!

590
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,868
Fucking wannabe arrogant up in here.

591
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,309
Go back to open mike, motherfucker.

592
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,906
You guys, I need, um...
Jeff Woods!

593
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,848
- No!
- Hey-

594
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,182
- I was next.
- Oh God, it's good to see you.

595
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,348
- I been here like two hours.
- What the fuck is this?

596
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,551
Guys, stop stop!

597
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,560
Stop!

598
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,698
How did it go, Jeff?

599
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,070
Fallen off!
He's fallen off!

600
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,700
- Go back to your crib.
- Okay, guys, settle down.

601
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,042
I need, um... Larry.

602
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,739
This from y'all?

603
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,672
No.

604
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,694
It's from Iris.

605
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,502
I can't believe she still has this.

606
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,778
"Dear Jeff,

607
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,841
every time you look
at this little man,

608
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,410
I want you to remember that
you are a very special person...

609
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,321
who has others
that believe in you.

610
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,753
Most importantly,

611
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,263
always remember to believe in
and love yourself.

612
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,766
Never forget who you are

613
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,803
and what you can do.

614
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,032
Love lris."

615
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,890
Oh man.

616
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:46,010
So, shit, I told the bitch
"it ain't my fault you ain't cum,

617
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,389
So, shit, I told the bitch
"it ain't my fault you ain't cum,

618
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,824
'cause I'm about to go.
You hear me, ho?"

619
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,260
You get it?
Shit, fuck y'all! Anyway, nigga,

620
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,026
they gave me the light 'cause there some
bitch-ass niggas in this club.

621
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,693
But before I walk off this motherfucker,
my normal routine is

622
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,896
to ask what bitch
in this motherfucker

623
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,872
is fuckin' this nigga
right here tonight? Huh?

624
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,635
Talk to me in the back!

625
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,644
- There you go.
- Fuck you, nigga.

626
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,582
All right, y'all, uh--

627
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,214
let's get back to real comedy.

628
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,055
Are you nervous, Jeff?

629
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,220
It's like they say:
if you're not nervous,

630
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,355
then you're really in trouble.

631
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,765
All right, y'all. Ladies and gentlemen,
coming to the stage,

632
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,895
my dog, my brother,
my friend and yours.

633
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,304
Ladies and gentlemen,
show some love

634
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,171
for my man Mr. Jeff Woods!

635
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,742
What up, LA?

636
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,750
Oh, he was--

637
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,291
oh my God.

638
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,793
The thing with the bed sheets--

639
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,556
I just couldn't--
he was so funny!

640
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,567
And the letters-

641
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,967
oh, we felt so sorry for him,

642
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,869
but I couldn't stop laughing.

643
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,670
Jeff was amazing tonight!

644
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,733
I mean I don't know where
he's been this last year.

645
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,075
He kinda disappeared
off the face of the earth,

646
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,979
but, I mean I'm glad he's back. The joke
about the Mexican pigs had me rolling!

647
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,814
You know, I don't
know Jeff personally,

648
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,616
but I'm very proud of him.

649
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:29,284
Very inspirational.

650
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,528
And very funny!

651
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:51,875
Whew!

652
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,538
Hey, Jeff?
Jeff Woods, is that you?

653
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,050
Hey, brother,
I love your work, man. I love your work.

654
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,983
- Thank you.
- Naw, what had happened was!

655
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,850
All right.

656
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,422
Is that her?

657
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,837
Can you--
can you stop filming?

658
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,604
Hey, give us a second, fellas.

659
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,953
Hustle some mo'
Panama raw

660
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,792
Name Malone breaks laws,
I'm kinda hot dog

661
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,094
Like stolen credit cards,
hella flaws

662
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,101
Chameleon dipped
with the triple gloss

663
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,637
Y'all niggas lost,
my cup full of the sauce

664
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,264
H2 move like
old-school mob underboss

665
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,401
Might stop row,
my living room filled with my folks

666
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,308
Watching "Afro Samurai"

667
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,369
Getting high,
high-definition screen

668
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,040
1080pi, c'mon

669
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,084
5.3 Dolby Surround Sound

670
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,813
How we get down, clown

671
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,786
Brandish the pound,
disperse the plastic

672
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,754
They making love
to the ground

673
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,224
My vernacular spectacular,
oh, watch the sack

674
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,921
And if Opie be blowing,
you know the five and town

675
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,624
Pressed to bark with the muscles,
though I must confess

676
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,394
That getting caught
with depression brings tons of stress

677
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,902
At least the thing is,
so get your dough, right?

678
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,302
C'mon, hustle
productions, why not?

679
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,170
I keep my bitch...

680
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,274
So this gen' be
in the show, right?

681
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,780
Oh yeah!

682
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,613
Well, like I was saying,

683
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,677
I don't give a damn
how famous he used to be.

684
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,155
Iris is with me now.

685
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,488
I didn't like the way
he was looking at me

686
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,755
when I came to pick her up
the other day either.

687
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,296
He was looking like
he wanna do something.

688
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,958
Now dat is really
motherfuckin' funny.

689
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,143
We have got to start mingling!

690
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,347
I don't even know anybody here, G!

691
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,149
Look, you know how
the game is played, Jeff.

692
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,781
If they don't know you,
they can't hire you!

693
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,849
We're not here to have fun, remember?
We are here to work.

694
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,589
Work it, girl!

695
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,099
Oh-- uh, Sergio!

696
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,132
Hi! Grant-- Grant Flowers.

697
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,298
- Oh, Grant Flower. How are you?
- Hi.

698
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,832
40 and fabulous!
How are you?

699
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,073
- Fine.
- Somebody's been working out.

700
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,048
Oh listen!
You remember Jeff Woods?

701
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,051
Jeff, this is Sergio Weinberg,

702
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,519
"Movie Times" senior editor.

703
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,317
I mean senior.

704
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,858
Jeff Woods.
You know what? It's funny,

705
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,518
I thought you were dead.

706
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,426
Oh no!
Oh, you are so funny.

707
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,864
No, actually Jeff is on the verge
of a huge comeback!

708
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:34,335
Kind of a phoenix
rising from the ashes!

709
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,202
Which I thought would make
kind of an inspiring story

710
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:42,041
for your magazine-
kind of a Lifetime, kind of Oprah thing.

711
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,047
Sorry, but honestly, had he died,

712
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,208
that would make a great story.

713
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,445
Bye!

714
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,421
- Oh please-- snap!
- Had I died, G.

715
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,458
Oh listen, please!

716
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,959
I remember when he was the cabana boy
at the Chateau Marmont.

717
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,462
Ignore him. There's plenty
of other people here.

718
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,623
Oh my God!

719
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,564
That's Preston Stone.

720
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,693
Who the fuck is Preston Stone?!

721
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:10,137
Only the most influential
exec at ADO.

722
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,640
Somebody you should know,
and more importantly

723
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,438
somebody
who should know you!

724
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,479
Come on.
How's my breath?

725
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,071
- Go head, I'm following you!
- All right, come come come.

726
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,915
Excuse me.
Hi, Mr. Stone.

727
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,786
I'm Grant Flowers
of Flowers Management.

728
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,418
We've actually met about five times.

729
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,462
Okay.
Yes yes, of course.

730
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,759
- Of course! Great to see you.
- Great to see you again.

731
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,734
Oh hey, listen, have you met my hottest
client, the comic genius Jeff Woods?

732
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,431
- How are you, sir?
- Uh, Jeff Woods?

733
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:46,066
Jeff Woods, aren't you
the guy that used to say...

734
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,474
"Yes, what I meant
to say was"?

735
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,605
No, actually it's "Naw.
See, what had happened--"

736
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,740
Yeah okay,
that's close enough.

737
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57,275
That's amazing, that's amazing!
I had no idea you were a fan.

738
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,152
I have to tell you, Preston--
can I call you Preston?

739
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,316
--That is a huge honor for us.

740
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,190
A real talent is hard to ignore.

741
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,788
You know, I couldn't agree more.

742
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:11,026
In fact, Jeff and I
were just talking

743
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,695
and we were saying
it would be fabu--

744
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:18,434
uh uh, incredibly smart idea
for him to have an ADO comedy special.

745
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:22,444
Oh, that might be
a remote possibility.

746
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,504
Of course you'd need
a few more credits to your name.

747
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,050
- Oh well, yeah of course!
- A successful tour.

748
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,451
- We're working on that actually.
- A few memorable cameos

749
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,614
- in some big-budget stuff.
- Wasn't I tell--

750
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,453
Breakout performance
in some sleeper indie.

751
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,993
- Absolutely.
- You know, little things like that.

752
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,461
- Absolutely right.
- He needs some real buzz!

753
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,963
Buzz buzz, right? Was I--

754
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,397
- Yeah yeah.
- Absolutely!

755
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,331
You know what?
You are so right.

756
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,836
And I'm gonna be
buzzing around like crazy

757
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,839
getting some buzz for you.
So when I do,

758
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:54,172
this buzzy little bee is gonna
come buzzing back to you

759
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,712
and we can discuss business--
uh, "buzzness."

760
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,214
- Well, I'll look forward to that.
- All right, great.

761
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,216
- Nice talking to you. Take care.
- Take care.

762
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:03,183
Hey, how 'bout those Lakers, huh?

763
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,415
Oh my God, was that fabulous or what?

764
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,888
That was "or what," G!

765
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,982
All right,
I was a little over-the-top butch.

766
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,029
But listen, I am gonna get
some buzz for you, okay?

767
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,256
We're gonna get a lot of buzz!

768
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,992
- And then-- and then--
- Buzz?

769
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,159
We're-- ADO, it's like,
"Here we come, ADO."

770
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,668
They're gonna be our bitch.

771
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,762
He said buzzing, he said a tour!

772
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,068
My act's not even together, G!

773
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,043
That is why you have moi.

774
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:31,570
Smile.

775
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:34,344
Oh hell motherfuckin' no!

776
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,614
Is that my nigga J to the E to the F
to the motherfucking F?

777
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,552
What's up, brother!

778
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,715
- What up, Rick?
- What's goin' on, brother?

779
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,781
- I'll just...
- Everything good, man.

780
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,953
- How you doin'?
- Life is good, man. Life is good.

781
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,089
I got my TV thing going here,
I got my movie thing going there.

782
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,225
Man, they're even thinking
about putting me in my own reality show!

783
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,032
But you know what, man? Fuck all
that shit. What's up with you, man?

784
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,563
Word on the street is you just
got outta rehab. What's up with that?

785
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,075
Yeah yeah, you know.
Like they say, one day at a time.

786
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,941
I hear ya, I hear ya, brother.

787
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,412
- Check this out: I'ma pray for ya.
- Thank you.

788
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,108
But I need for you to pray
for yourself too, brother.

789
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,414
- Yes sir, yes sir.
- 'Cause God is good! God is good.

790
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:13,786
- All the time.
- I know how the devil can be out in LA.

791
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,257
- I know how it can be!
- Yeah.

792
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:19,261
Well, check this shit out, man.
On some real devilish shit?

793
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:22,491
You wanna step back to the car
with me and do a little bit of this?

794
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,157
You with me?

795
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:29,168
And the one night I was at, uh...

796
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,468
"The Comedy Crib."

797
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,476
And Grant has some
network execs there to see me.

798
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:38,139
And I was tired.
I was just tired!

799
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:43,015
And I just knew I was about to get up
there and bomb in front of them people.

800
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,680
And this other comic--

801
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,349
I'm not gonna say his name.

802
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,450
It was like, "Yo, Jeff,
try this shit right here,

803
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,894
you gonna go up there
and kill that shit!"

804
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,366
I just knew that no drug
could hook me, you know.

805
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,403
So I just--

806
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,407
Man, next thing you know...

807
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,433
I was the funniest
motherfucker on the planet.

808
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,502
I was the baddest
motherfucker in the world.

809
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:14,175
I was the coolest motherfucker
in the world, you know?

810
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:19,184
Every time
I got high after that,

811
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,723
I was trying to get back
to that feeling.

812
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,761
I lost everything I had
trying to get back to that feeling.

813
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:33,031
Everything-

814
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,228
Man, that's the holy grail
of comedy!

815
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,206
Uh-huh!

816
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,504
You know all my success,
I owe it to you, Hugh.

817
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,544
You were the one that kept
encouraging me to get back on stage.

818
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,413
I'm not gonna forget that.

819
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,782
Pause it.

820
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,586
When I get my special,

821
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,421
I want you to be the opening act.

822
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,387
Man, you're bullshitting, man.

823
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,522
Naw, I'm serious, man.

824
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,897
You know how we do.

825
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,697
I appreciate that, dog,
for real.

826
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,569
- I love you, man.
- Pick your shit up

827
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,609
and let's finish
this goddamn game!

828
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,008
On the real?
For real, between me and you, man?

829
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,274
You don't owe me nothin'.

830
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,782
That's what friends do for each other.
You know what I'm saying?

831
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,375
- Yes sir.
- They do stuff like help each other,

832
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,216
put people on an ADO special,

833
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,688
and whip their ass! Ugh!

834
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,725
Touchdown, bitch!

835
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,292
I knew I was about
to bust your ass on that play!

836
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,592
- Mine's broken.
- You see the motherfucker

837
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,862
go up the sideline?
Ass whoopin'! Yeah, it's broke,

838
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:41,130
just like this foot I broke in your ass.

839
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,468
You know Donna don't
let me play at the house?

840
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,734
We gonna have a footrace next.
I bet you I'll win that.

841
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,106
Oh, you gonna win that.
You're better than me in that.

842
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,145
Iris called me.
We're going to meet at a coffee shop.

843
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,741
You seem excited.

844
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,717
- I am, man.
- Oh snap!

845
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,051
Naw. See,
what had happened was!

846
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,556
- What up, brother?
- All right!

847
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,421
Hey look,
I told her when we got there,

848
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,552
I wouldn't have cameras
all up on her face.

849
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,563
So y'all gotta fall back
just a little bit, all right? Cool!

850
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,621
Feeling the way we thought

851
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:13,498
We flow,
just wanna let you know

852
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,059
Wanna let you know

853
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,231
Never thought I'd fall

854
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:20,299
Never thought I'd fall,
the magic of it all

855
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,775
<i>Mmmm</i>

856
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,676
Let's take it nice and slow

857
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,408
Slow...

858
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,609
She says she still has
all my letters.

859
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,448
She broke it off with dude too.
That was cool.

860
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,591
She got everything
off her chest.

861
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,957
She really let me have it.

862
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,691
She said she wasn't sure
if she ever wanted to see me again.

863
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,135
So we'll see what happens.

864
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,811
Hello, Iris.
If you don't mind us asking,

865
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,318
how do you feel about Jeff?

866
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,515
That's a broad question.

867
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,354
I love Jeffrey.

868
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,656
We've known each other
a long time.

869
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,823
We'll always be friends.

870
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,958
Do you believe that Jeff can make
a comeback in his career?

871
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:21,503
I believe that the only thing

872
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,233
that can stop Jeffrey is Jeffrey.

873
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,402
Do you think that you could
see Jeff again romantically?

874
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,674
You know this is my stop.

875
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:34,216
Um, it was really nice
talking to you guys.

876
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,614
Thank you.

877
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,057
Because of you

878
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:46,323
I learned what love is

879
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,693
You taught me how

880
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,665
To give all that I am

881
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:55,363
Stretched out your hands

882
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,600
Told me don't fear

883
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,507
Because you'll be there

884
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,909
To help me through

885
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,841
And now I've fallen

886
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:11,910
Fallen in love with you

887
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:17,085
With the woman of my dreams

888
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:23,895
This day I give to you my heart

889
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:29,896
I pledge my life to only you

890
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,372
Only you

891
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,774
Only you, only you"

892
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:38,245
Will have my heart
to the end of time

893
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,145
Only you

894
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,775
I dedicate my life to you

895
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,583
And you alone, only you.

896
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,686
Man, I'm so happy
right now and it's scary.

897
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,472
Damn, man!

898
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,636
I dropped the ball, y'all.

899
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,772
The casting director asked me
to improv some lines and I just froze!

900
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,679
I don't know what
the fuck happened, man!

901
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,912
I just was-- shit!

902
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:19,750
It's for that new
sitcom too, "Before Obama."

903
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,154
I fucking-- damn it!

904
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:25,160
They were smiling when I left,
but that don't mean shit.

905
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,957
Damn, I just thought I was
getting it back together too, man.

906
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,033
This Grant right here.

907
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,628
Yeah, G.

908
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,799
Man, the casting director
asked me to improv.

909
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,372
What?

910
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,311
Get the fuck--

911
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,645
you serious?
Yo, G, don't play with me!

912
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,709
I got the part?
I got the part!

913
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:54,188
I got the part, baby!
I got the part, yes!

914
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,450
I got the part!

915
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,324
Yes! Jeff Woods, boy!

916
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:03,888
What you know! Jeff Woods!
Come on now!

917
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,059
I got the part!

918
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,071
G, G, we back, baby!
Are we back?

919
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,038
Yes!

920
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,042
I know I'm lactose intolerant,

921
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,544
but this cheeseburger
is worth the gas.

922
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:19,340
You gonna eat all that?

923
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,747
Every last artery-clogging bite.

924
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,683
But don't worry,

925
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,516
Kenny will be here
with your lunch soon.

926
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,291
Six lines and I stole the show.

927
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,574
Hey, dude, I see you got a real problem
staying away from my woman.

928
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,734
Let her go, let her go...

929
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,313
Come on, let's get closer.

930
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:56,450
Then you gotta let her go,
let her go

931
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,544
- Let her go...
- All right, all right.

932
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,452
I got something for you, dude.

933
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,082
I got-- you-- you wait right there,
dude. You wait there.

934
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,053
Business as usual,
buying you designer things...

935
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,256
Yeah, what's up now, partner?

936
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,597
- Who's gonna mess with Luther now?
- He's got a gun!

937
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,243
Looks like you're going to have
to do a little time, Luther.

938
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:25,644
- Are you afraid of prison?
- Man, hell no!

939
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,047
I'm from the motherfucking streets!

940
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:29,880
These fools in here can't handle me!

941
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,079
I'm running shit!

942
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,678
Yeah.

943
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,163
I want my mama!

944
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,889
Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

945
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,300
What am I gonna do
with you, hmm?

946
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,839
You could have been hurt!
You could have been...

947
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,840
killed, okay?

948
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,742
Now if you're not gonna think
about yourself, think about me.

949
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay, anyway,

950
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,912
remember I told you I was going

951
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,418
to buzz up a little buzz?

952
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,978
Well, I wasn't "buzz-shitting."

953
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,757
What are you talking about, Grant?

954
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,658
Oh, guess who's going on tour?

955
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,027
- On tour?! For real?
- Mm-hmm.

956
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,794
- For reals, for reals.
- Yes, baby!

957
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:22,269
- How'd you pull off a tour?
- If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

958
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:25,307
Sit down.
The important thing is it's a tour!

959
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,603
Yes! Okay, so where
we going first?

960
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:31,111
New York? Atlanta?
Chicago, baby!

961
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,273
Slow your roll, kemosabe.

962
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:36,784
Gotta learn how to crawl again
before you can saunter.

963
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,343
Now you're starting off

964
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,357
in Wet Beaver Creek, Mississippi.

965
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,622
Wet Beaver Creek,
Mississippi?

966
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:47,526
Mm-hmm.

967
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:51,054
Then let's see,
Cotton Plant, Arkansas-

968
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,192
The Ha Ha Hut.
I heard it's good.

969
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,635
And then we're finishing up
at Laughs and Farts

970
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:57,798
in Sunrise, Louisiana.

971
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,899
That's the sweet potato capital.
I'm just saying.

972
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,910
Look what can I say, Jeffrey?

973
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,505
It's the chitlin' circuit,
but it's still a tour.

974
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,744
You're right. It's still a tour.

975
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,844
- That's the spirit.
- It's still a tour!

976
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,048
- That's the spirit! Gimme--
- Okay, so when am I leaving?

977
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:17,752
Ow. Oh well, lemme just--
come on.

978
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,386
Let me just cross the "I"s
and dot the "T"s

979
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,728
and then we can-- oh listen,
we do need an opening act.

980
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,858
Do you have anybody in mind?

981
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,403
Yeah, heh heh.

982
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,938
I can think of somebody.

983
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,669
How am I supposed
to deliver mail and go on tour?

984
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,940
You can't!
That's why it's time to quit this.

985
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,243
Look, it's always been
a dream of yours to go on tour,

986
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:42,545
to be able to do
stand-up full time, right?

987
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:45,109
Well, here it is!

988
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,086
Look, Jeff,

989
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:49,124
I appreciate the offer.

990
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,456
Man, I love you for the offer,

991
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,553
but I got a family to support.

992
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,792
I'm talking food on the table,
clothes on their backs.

993
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:01,200
As much as I want to,

994
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,967
dude, I-- I can't see me

995
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,441
leaving a good-paying job,

996
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,775
benefits for my family

997
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,304
to go on some chitlin' circuit tour
where I don't know what's gonna happen.

998
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,147
I can't see it.

999
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,125
I don't know, I don't know.

1000
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,753
Go Mommy!
Go Mommy

1001
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,991
Uh-huh uh-huh!

1002
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,003
I'm outta this bitch

1003
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,404
I quit, I quit

1004
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,464
I'm outta this bitch.

1005
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,974
Hey hey!

1006
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,848
Yeah yeah?

1007
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,617
How do you feel Hubert?

1008
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,621
I don't know how I feel.

1009
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:03,324
I mean when you want
something for so long,

1010
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:06,425
and then it's right here--

1011
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,027
I mean it's real...

1012
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:14,476
I wish I could take Donna
and the kids with me.

1013
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,906
My son--

1014
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,845
my son said
he was proud of me.

1015
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,251
I'm just really thankful right now,

1016
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,820
especially to my boy Jeff.

1017
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,186
What can I do?

1018
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,184
What can I do?

1019
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:34,272
Since the boys have been on tour,

1020
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:37,478
I've spent a lot of time with Iris.

1021
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,919
I've always liked Iris.

1022
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:42,821
She's a real sweetheart,
you know?

1023
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:48,288
But I've often found myself
feeling sorry for her.

1024
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,854
I don't know how she does it.

1025
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:58,935
I don't trust Jeff as far
as I can throw him,

1026
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:02,239
and I can't throw Jeff
from me to you.

1027
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,444
I worry.

1028
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:11,247
I worry a lot.

1029
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,422
I worry about him relapsing
on the road with my Hubert.

1030
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,153
I trust Jeffrey.

1031
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,222
He's worked really to get
to where he is right now.

1032
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:28,167
And I know that
he won't do anything

1033
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,172
to jeopardize
the second opportunity that he has.

1034
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,985
HEY, guys.

1035
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,358
Um...

1036
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,694
he said it's okay
for y'all to come in,

1037
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:00,291
but he's going through
a thing right now.

1038
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,730
So just be cool.

1039
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:21,319
I see you.

1040
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,157
I love you, man.

1041
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:35,069
Every step you take,

1042
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,934
I'm with you.

1043
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,342
You're not alone.

1044
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,114
This is me and you on this ride.

1045
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:48,376
Me and you on the world tour.

1046
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,942
When they see you, they see me.

1047
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,915
It's our time.

1048
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,259
It's our time.

1049
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,134
Damn!

1050
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,136
I fucking got high, man!

1051
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,604
I said I wasn't fuckin'
with that shit no more!

1052
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,607
Then I fucking--

1053
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,371
what the fuck is wrong
with me, man?

1054
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,507
Damn, they say everybody
relapses at least once.

1055
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,607
That was my one
and only fucking time!

1056
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:25,084
I ain't fucking
with that shit no more.

1057
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,621
I'm glad my brother Hubert
was there to catch me

1058
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,521
before I fucking fell
all the way off.

1059
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,857
I told Hubert and I'm telling y'all,
I don't nobody saying nothing to Iris.

1060
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,363
The last thing I want is
her worrying about me, man.

1061
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,161
I'ma fuckin' get right.
My fuckin' head is on straight.

1062
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,634
I'm back to business, man.
Fuck that.

1063
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:44,263
Oh, he don't
get high no more? Ha!

1064
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,467
We'll see.
We'll see how long that last

1065
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,636
'cause he likes the stuff!
I'm just sayin'.

1066
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,873
I mean I-- hey!
To each his own.

1067
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,882
- He could do his thing--
- Ow.

1068
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,145
--But getting clean
ain't one of his things.

1069
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:58,880
In fact I wish he
would call me back.

1070
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,047
I do comedy too.
I'm kinda funny.

1071
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,489
Ain't this funny,
when I'm combing your hair?

1072
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,150
- It's funny right?
- Ow.

1073
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,196
Ha ha ha!
I mean I wish you well, Jeff,

1074
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,322
but good luck, boo.

1075
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:15,202
Did you really make enough
money from the tour

1076
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,636
- to buy this house?
- No.

1077
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:20,402
But it was time to step it up.

1078
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,238
It's good for morale.

1079
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,643
Iris is moving in with me.

1080
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:27,340
The way I see it,
with her here,

1081
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,475
I know I'll stay
focused and clean.

1082
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,212
She's a no-nonsense type
of sister.

1083
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,276
You know, where I'm silly,
she's serious!

1084
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,816
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

1085
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,053
God is good, baby!

1086
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,891
God is good!

1087
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,363
The comic that was supposed
to be on "The Talk Show" tonight,

1088
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,058
he got strep throat,
so Grant got me in.

1089
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,102
I don't know how he did it,
but he did it, man.

1090
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,398
God is good! I'm gonna be
on "The Talk Show" tonight!

1091
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,200
Oh shit!

1092
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,673
Whoa-- sorry! Sorry!

1093
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,210
I'm Jeff Woods. I'm gonna be
on "The Talk Show" tonight!

1094
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,507
I would have hit that bitch
and kept going. Fuck that.

1095
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,878
That would have been my intro.
"He killed a bitch on the way here."

1096
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,974
Fuck that! I'm goin'
to "Talk Show," baby! Let's do it!

1097
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:06,751
It's "The Talk Show,"

1098
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,053
with comic guest Jeff Woods.

1099
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,505
It's, um-- it's scary.

1100
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,977
I really-- I don't know
how Jeffrey deals with it.

1101
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,673
I mean 'cause having cameras
in your face all of the time...

1102
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,614
I mean he says
that he appreciates it.

1103
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:42,585
And-- and he keeps me away
from it for the most part,

1104
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:46,354
except for you guys, of course.

1105
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,326
I'm really proud of Jeffrey.

1106
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,762
'Cause he's really-- he's really staying
grounded through all of this.

1107
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,546
Stop.

1108
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:13,484
My daughter sees my heart,
you know what I'm saying?

1109
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,580
But my boys-- oh my God.
These two are just--

1110
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,091
they're always fighting.
They're always damn fighting.

1111
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,923
And that's the thing.
I don't mind their fighting,

1112
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:22,463
but I'm trying to figure out
where it come from.

1113
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,465
'Cause I don't fight like that,
their Mama don't fight like that.

1114
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,365
But I realized one day

1115
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,335
me and my wife,
we were giving in.

1116
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:36,872
Now it's time to bring
a brother to the stage

1117
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,539
that has proven that
no matter bad shit gets,

1118
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,015
you can always turn
everything around.

1119
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:45,178
Ladies and gentlemen,
my hero, my brother, my friend.

1120
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,017
Show some love
for Mr. Jeff Woods, y'all. Jeff Woods!

1121
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:04,830
Is he gonna watch this?

1122
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,840
'Cause, you know, if he is,
I got a message for him.

1123
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,672
Dude, get it together!
Go back to rehab

1124
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:12,679
and go meditate!
Figure out who you are,

1125
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,682
- 'cause this was some bullshit!
- It wasn't shit, okay?

1126
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:19,049
We wasn't happy.
The crowd was booing.

1127
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,986
This shit--
the house was coming down.

1128
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:23,046
It was not going on at all.

1129
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:26,925
He was so high. And believe me
I know high when I see high.

1130
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,396
Jeff, we fans, man,
we love you,

1131
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,024
but that wasn't
a good look, man.

1132
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,000
I thought you go
to rehab to get better.

1133
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:37,265
You-- you got worse
in everything-

1134
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,500
with the drugs, with your jokes.

1135
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,838
God damn!

1136
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:44,276
I mean the funniest thing
is when you walked off the stage!

1137
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,926
Jeff?
He's gonna be okay.

1138
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:06,126
He's under a lot
of pressure right now.

1139
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,260
And when you're under
that type of pressure

1140
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:11,032
that's when it's hardest
to leave that shit alone!

1141
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,971
But all we gotta do

1142
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:17,273
is show him a little more love.

1143
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,504
Yeah.

1144
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,648
<i>Mmmm!</i>

1145
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:28,213
He gonna be all right. Yeah.

1146
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:31,088
We love you, Jeff.

1147
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,923
I love y'all too.

1148
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,129
Thank you. Thank you!

1149
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,762
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Hey, sweetie.

1150
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:45,807
Thanks for coming out.
I appreciate it.

1151
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,399
- My man still. What's up, homie?
- Yes sir, you know how it goes.

1152
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,273
- Come on now, come on!
- I'm sorry, can I just--

1153
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,574
Not at all. Not a problem at all,
not a problem at all.

1154
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,480
- Can you get my heels?
- Make sure you get the shoes.

1155
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,415
It's amazing, man.

1156
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:01,115
Everybody's your fucking friend
when shit's going good.

1157
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,454
Everybody wanna work with you.

1158
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,619
Phony motherfuckers!

1159
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,993
- What up, man?
- You blowin' up since I seen you.

1160
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,123
- How you doing? Good to see you, man.
- Good, dog.

1161
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,167
Yes sir!
You know it, you know it!

1162
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,930
- Jeff Woods.
- What's up, brother?

1163
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,699
- Big fan of your work, dog.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1164
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,604
The name is Roosevelt Steele.

1165
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,337
- Okay.
- Roosevelt Steele Management.

1166
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,505
- Roosevelt Steele Management.
- I know you might have

1167
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,980
some representation,
but our motto is

1168
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,176
"We'll kill a motherfucker
for our client!"

1169
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,980
All right.

1170
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,021
Understand?
Up-and-coming superstar like yourself

1171
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:37,149
needs a real nigga representing him.
Ya understand?

1172
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,386
Well, I have a manager.
This is my manager Grant Flowers.

1173
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,055
Grant Flowers, Roosevelt Steele;
Roosevelt Steele, Grant Flowers.

1174
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,359
- Enchante.
- Yeah, what's up?

1175
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,661
Oh my! Ha ha ha.

1176
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:48,896
- That's cool. That's cool.
- Word!

1177
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,302
- Holla at your boy.
- All right.

1178
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,034
- All right.
- Be cool, brother.

1179
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,639
- Roosevelt Steele would kill...
- What was he wearing?

1180
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,373
...a motherfucker for a client.

1181
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:02,645
The '80s called,
they want their suit back.

1182
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,185
You gotta always watch out
for the sharks, man.

1183
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,482
They're always swimming
around your ass,

1184
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,751
talking about all the shit
they gonna do for you.

1185
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,917
Only thing they gonna do
for you is bring you down!

1186
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,425
I got a little something for you.

1187
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,399
Hey, y'all,
I'ma catch up with y'all.

1188
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,161
Jeff Woods is starting to do
the same dumb shit

1189
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,605
he did before all over again.

1190
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,576
This past weekend, he and I were
presenters at the "Soul Awards."

1191
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,738
Jeff comes out on stage
with a little white clump of cocaine

1192
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,213
on the tip of his nose.

1193
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,682
On stage,
cameras rolling,

1194
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:39,777
in front of an audience
of hundreds of positive black people.

1195
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,915
Coo-coo right there.

1196
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:44,424
Coo-coo!

1197
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,420
Can you be honest
with yourself, Jeffrey?

1198
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,188
I am being honest with myself!

1199
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,895
Are you?

1200
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:01,536
'Cause I-- I know that you're under
a lot of pressure right now

1201
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:04,101
and I wanna support you

1202
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,147
and I wanna encourage you,

1203
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,079
but I can't go through
that again, Jeffrey!

1204
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,411
Go through what?

1205
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,578
You know what I'm talking about!

1206
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,781
Don't try to play me like I'm a fool!

1207
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:17,415
- Girl, you tripping!
- I am not tripping!

1208
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,461
Jeffrey, it's like
the same thing all over again!

1209
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:23,589
Do you-- do you want
this to happen again?

1210
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,060
Why do you keep sabotaging
yourself, Jeffrey?

1211
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:31,833
Jeff Woods?
Aw, no way, Jeff Woods!

1212
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,431
Hey, I'm a comic too, man.
I saw you--

1213
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:35,476
I saw you way back in the day.
Ohh, Jeff Woods!

1214
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,170
- Not right now, man.
- What's up, man? What's up?

1215
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,235
I gotta take a picture
with you real quick.

1216
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,680
- Real quick, I'm sorry.
- No, now is not a-- excuse me!

1217
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,810
- Excuse me! Now is not a good time.
- This is Jeff Woods right here.

1218
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,150
Look at me-- now is not--
now is not a good time!

1219
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,918
- Jeffrey, move him now!
- Not right now!

1220
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,755
The only one that
can stop Jeff is Jeff.

1221
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:55,092
He's the only one
that can stop him.

1222
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:57,688
You know, and with
the egos in Hollywood

1223
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,995
and the egos in the business
that we're in--

1224
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:02,536
there's a lot of laughter,
there's a lot of ridicule

1225
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,233
and I know exactly how he feels.

1226
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,202
Every time I get high,
I tell myself this is the last time.

1227
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:15,648
That shit wear off and then I'm...

1228
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:18,015
fucking tripped out!

1229
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,230
Yo, when I was a kid--

1230
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,594
when I was a kid,
me and my friends we would run...

1231
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:38,728
sun up to sundown.

1232
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,402
I had a ball, man,
some of the happiest times in my life!

1233
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,041
Man.

1234
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,104
I damn sure
didn't need it then.

1235
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,430
I'm going to
the support group tonight.

1236
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,693
That'll solve everything!

1237
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,518
Yeah, we were really hoping
to see Jeff tonight.

1238
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:31,957
But, um, you know,

1239
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,755
Jeff's not gonna get clean

1240
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,228
until he decides that
he really wants to.

1241
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,128
It's just that simple.

1242
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,929
Maybe he needs to hit
rock bottom again

1243
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:43,732
before he makes that decision,
I don't know.

1244
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:46,296
But whenever that is,

1245
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,103
we're here for him.

1246
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,940
I was really hoping
Jeff would make it tonight.

1247
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,742
Just to give him a big hug.

1248
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:58,980
I'm not gonna lie,
we're pretty worried about him.

1249
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,147
We all know how Jeff feels.

1250
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,555
We've all been there before,
you know what I'm saying?

1251
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,093
That's why you gotta stay in touch
with people that want to stay sober.

1252
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:08,789
Shit, that's why I keep
coming to meetings, man.

1253
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,661
Otherwise I'd be out there with Jeff.

1254
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,930
And that wouldn't be no good.

1255
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,631
I don't know where you are,
Jeff, but we love you.

1256
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:20,264
And I know you think
the drugs love you,

1257
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,434
but they don't.

1258
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,116
I don't believe this,
I don't believe this!

1259
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,245
I don't believe this.
Where-- where the hell is he?

1260
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,585
He's supposed to be on stage-
oh, right now!

1261
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,784
Right now is when he is supposed
to be on stage. I cannot believe this!

1262
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:40,760
I've got some very very important
people in the crowd tonight.

1263
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:44,026
Very very important! This is--
this is not-- this is not funny!

1264
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,294
It's not funny, Jeff,
wherever you are.

1265
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,302
It's not funny, Okay, I don't--
I don't think we actually need to--

1266
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:53,033
to film this part, okay? This is about
Jeff, not about-- not about me, okay?

1267
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,976
Uh, I-- do either of you guys
have a-- have a-- have a--

1268
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,343
have a Rolaid
or something? Xanax?

1269
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,382
Anything?

1270
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,179
Oh God, oh God! I don't believe
he's doing this to me again!

1271
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,685
I don't believe it!

1272
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,063
I was sick, Grant.

1273
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:23,070
I was coughing
and sneezing and shit.

1274
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:27,101
Took some strong-ass medicine.

1275
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,241
And that shit knocked me out, man.
Fuck, man,

1276
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,838
I didn't even wake up
till this morning, man. I was gone.

1277
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,582
Sick?

1278
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,817
Sick.

1279
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,087
Trust me, Jeff, when I tell you

1280
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,323
you could not possibly
have been one fraction

1281
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:51,831
as sick as I was last night.

1282
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:55,700
I had Hollywood heavyweights
there to see you.

1283
01:14:55,758 --> 01:15:00,366
I had the people from ADO
there to see you,

1284
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,534
to see if you were good enough

1285
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,874
to have your own comedy special.

1286
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,039
And you didn't show!

1287
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:09,413
I told you the medication
knocked me out.

1288
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,782
Oh right, yes. I believe
you were on medication,

1289
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,219
but it sure as hell
wasn't Nyquil.

1290
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:21,091
You promised, Jeff.

1291
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,393
You promised me this would
not happen again!

1292
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,132
I think you're very talented

1293
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:34,869
and I care about you.

1294
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:37,935
L-- I really do.

1295
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:42,715
But I refuse to let you
do this to me again.

1296
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:47,050
Now if you wanna destroy yourself,
that is your choice,

1297
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:50,717
but I will not let you
destroy me as well!

1298
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,727
Damn, is you my manager
or my mama?

1299
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:57,321
If I say the medication knocked me out,
that's what happened, God damn it!

1300
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,833
If you expect me to believe that,
then you must be high--

1301
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,267
oh, what am I saying?
Of course you're high!

1302
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:05,067
- Fuck you, man!
- No no, there is no need to fuck me.

1303
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,437
You are doing a very good job
of fucking yourself--

1304
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,237
without protection!

1305
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,505
Yo, who the fuck you think
you're talking to, Grant?

1306
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,604
- Excuse me.
- Who you think you talkin' to?!

1307
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,273
- You know who I am?
- Now you're in my space.

1308
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:16,316
You know who I am?

1309
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:18,181
- Leave my office! Get out of my office!
- I'm Jeff Woods, motherfucker!

1310
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,016
- I'm Jeff Woods, nigga!
- How dare you!

1311
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,579
No, stop stop!
Okay, this is enough.

1312
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:24,852
No, you hear me,
I've had it-- stop!

1313
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,967
What's up, y'all?

1314
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,162
This your boy Roosevelt Steele

1315
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,000
hollering at ya.

1316
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,041
Yeah.
You know what time it is.

1317
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,442
Yeah, that's fucked up
what happened with Grant,

1318
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,537
but that's Hollywood.

1319
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,878
Sometimes you get to a point

1320
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,179
where you just don't see
eye to eye no more.

1321
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,856
I mean,

1322
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:58,483
I got love for Grant,

1323
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,357
but we were just outgrowing
each other, okay?

1324
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,693
That's why I like Roosevelt.

1325
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:06,029
He picked up the ADO negotiations

1326
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,726
right where Grant left off.

1327
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,861
And he ain't kissing ass
like Grant was!

1328
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:13,203
Now we on some new shit!
Now we on some gangster shit!

1329
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:17,674
This is an important time
in my career-

1330
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,242
time for me to go to another level.

1331
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:31,315
I'm about to come with some new shit.

1332
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,361
Yeah, I'ma come up
with some shit nobody was expecting!

1333
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,106
Sorry, fellas,

1334
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,907
we're gonna need some privacy.

1335
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:58,108
I swear, man,
I'm not messing with that stuff.

1336
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:04,090
I need to just shut the fuck up.

1337
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,423
I keep saying I'm not gonna do it,
then I end up right back.

1338
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:14,135
I need to start saying it,

1339
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,500
believin' it and doing it.

1340
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,134
It seems like the intervention
was a success.

1341
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,344
Jeffrey's been doing
so much better.

1342
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:35,118
I just think that he needed
to know that he was hurting

1343
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,555
more people than just himself.

1344
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:39,957
Jeffrey has a really good heart

1345
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,929
and he just needed a little
extra motivation.

1346
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,692
Trust me, my nigga.

1347
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:53,233
I know this motherfuckin' business

1348
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,202
like the back of my
motherfuckin' hand, ya understand?

1349
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,670
And you know what you need?

1350
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:02,675
You need an openin' act!

1351
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:06,305
A motherfucker that's gonna get
the crowd all charged up.

1352
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,975
Get 'em ready for the main event,

1353
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:11,416
- which is you!
- Yeah.

1354
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:14,148
- Motherfuckin' Jeff Woods, baby!
- Yeah.

1355
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,316
You need somebody
that's gonna compliment your style,

1356
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:20,690
your caliber and your
motherfuckin' finesse.

1357
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,922
And of course, baby,

1358
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,761
I got the best
motherfuckin' nigga for ya!

1359
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,892
- My nigga!
- Nigga, who else, nigga?

1360
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:30,096
Who else gonna fuckin'
hold you down?

1361
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,402
Nigga, let's go out here and get this
goddamn money! Fuck all dat dumb shit!

1362
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:35,942
You know what da fuck I'm sayin'?
Me, you-- huh?

1363
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,875
And this motherfucker here? Shit.

1364
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,607
Nigga!

1365
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,242
- Yo, let's toast.
- Fuck what you sayin.

1366
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,946
To success, money,

1367
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:51,185
- and mo' bitches!
- More motherfuckin' bitches!

1368
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:52,725
Who can't use mo' bitches?

1369
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:55,284
Yeah, nigga! I know I can't.

1370
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:57,964
F.U., nigga!

1371
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,567
So Iris is gone-- for real?

1372
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:07,737
That's what it seems like.

1373
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,572
I don't know.

1374
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,946
Maybe it's for the best, man,
I don't know.

1375
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:19,316
Man, for-- what?
What is going on?

1376
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,419
I got a new manager.

1377
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:29,122
A real manager!

1378
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,660
We're about to sign
the deal for the special.

1379
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,999
ADO?

1380
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,002
But you haven't been
doing any stand-up, Jeff.

1381
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:49,444
Like how do you expect
to be sharp for an ADO special

1382
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,610
and you haven't been going up?

1383
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:55,815
Okay, forget that!

1384
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,154
Why don't we go to the club tonight?

1385
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,857
You can do a set, I can do a set.

1386
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,523
Shoot, I got some-- I got
a new one I wanna do anyway.

1387
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,625
These jokes are so funny.
What do you say, man?

1388
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,801
Hey, speaking of the special,
lemme talk to you, man.

1389
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:23,315
What's up?

1390
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:31,983
So I've been talking to my manager...

1391
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,530
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

1392
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,896
I had a good little run.

1393
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:43,704
I got a family to take care of.

1394
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:48,736
Put food on the table,

1395
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,107
clothes on their backs.

1396
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,542
And who am I?

1397
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:58,744
Who am I to think that

1398
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,344
I could be a full-time
comic anyway?

1399
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,221
Hey!

1400
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:09,262
Uh...

1401
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:12,197
thank God they always
got a job for a brother

1402
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:14,029
at the post office, right?

1403
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:16,330
I got a bag full of mail

1404
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,702
and some people to give it to.

1405
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:23,399
I might have your shit in here.

1406
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,586
I swear to God,

1407
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:36,213
when I see Jeff Woods,

1408
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,417
I'm gonna beat his ass!

1409
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:43,794
I'm sorry!

1410
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,838
Y'all don't love me!

1411
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,785
Y'all don't even know
who the fuck I am!

1412
01:24:07,843 --> 01:24:09,754
Huh?

1413
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:14,487
You wanna know? You wanna--
you wanna know really who I am?

1414
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,826
You wanna know who
the fuck I am?

1415
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:19,093
Yes! We really want to know.

1416
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:22,363
Who the fuck is Jeff Woods?

1417
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,467
Listen closely, you motherfucker!

1418
01:24:29,031 --> 01:24:30,635
Listen closely.

1419
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,878
I'm motherf--

1420
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,682
Yeah, what ya need?!

1421
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:48,990
We want to ask Jeff
how he feels right before

1422
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:51,258
the biggest performance
of his life!

1423
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,130
Hey, tell them motherfuckers
Jeff is in the zone right now

1424
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:57,534
and he ain't tryin' to be bothered
with no motherfuckin' documentary!

1425
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,130
In fact, y'all are bullshit!

1426
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,642
I don't think we interested
in doin' that little bullshit no more!

1427
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:06,270
You heard the man.
Kick rocks!

1428
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:08,372
But-- but we--

1429
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:16,386
Tonight, ADO is proud to present,

1430
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,722
starring in his first,
very own comedy special,

1431
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:22,592
Jeff Woods!

1432
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:40,030
Baby, I'm trying to creep low

1433
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:42,939
Don't want to be the po,
forge some credentials

1434
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:45,774
I tinted my windows,
baby, just get in here

1435
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:48,041
You be there,
get in, girl

1436
01:26:48,103 --> 01:26:50,743
Ain't no empty space,
just that look in that face...

1437
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:53,582
Jeff, now that you've finally

1438
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:56,316
reached the place that
you've dreamed about

1439
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,824
and worked for for so long,

1440
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,055
what do you want
to tell the world?

1441
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:03,994
Man.

1442
01:27:08,023 --> 01:27:10,162
Life is a motherfucker.

1443
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:25,617
After that, I lost contact with Jeff.

1444
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:29,019
Once again,
at the peak of his career,

1445
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:32,787
Jeff disappeared from the spotlight.

1446
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:36,318
It was as if he had
vanished into thin air.

1447
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:39,195
I was worried about Jeff.

1448
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,292
Would Jeff pull himself up
by the bootstraps again?

1449
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:45,201
Or had he fallen off for good?

1450
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:50,104
Months went by.
I assumed the worst.

1451
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:52,941
Then, nearly a year later,

1452
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,311
I received an invitation
to a ceremony

1453
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,044
being held
at a small Spanish church.

1454
01:27:58,107 --> 01:28:01,054
Yes, I do, I will

1455
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,353
Share each moment
with you

1456
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:07,690
Our love will fly

1457
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:12,027
Yes, I do

1458
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:15,830
Yes, I do

1459
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:18,872
l do

1460
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:25,242
I believe in you

1461
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,144
And everything you do

1462
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:31,412
Through fire, the rain

1463
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,215
And the pain we've been through

1464
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:38,748
Hand in hand we'll walk together

1465
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,818
As we face this world forever

1466
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:45,593
One we'll always remember

1467
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,931
So I do and I will

1468
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,937
Go the distance with you

1469
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,531
Our love will fly

1470
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,581
Yes, I do, I will...

1471
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:03,583
I's married now, y'all!

1472
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:05,619
Said I's married now!

1473
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:09,055
How does it feel to be married?

1474
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:12,388
- You first.
- Why I gotta go?

1475
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,358
- Go!
- Uh...

1476
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,953
it feels different

1477
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,590
and the same
at the same time, you know?

1478
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:21,134
I mean,

1479
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,898
I always knew Iris had my back.

1480
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:26,269
And now if we break up
I get half her shit!

1481
01:29:29,264 --> 01:29:31,266
I think it's safe
to say that we're both

1482
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:34,371
very happy and grateful that things
worked out the way they did.

1483
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:38,578
Very happy and grateful that
things worked out the way they did.

1484
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,213
Can we expect any little ones?

1485
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:45,451
Well, I mean I wasn't
gonna mention it,

1486
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:48,495
- but--
- Oh!

1487
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,757
- Yeah! Ugh ugh ugh!
- Oh stop!

1488
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,524
I figure I'd just go ahead
and knock her up real quick, you know.

1489
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:03,435
What now, Jeff?

1490
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:11,417
I'm just grateful, man,

1491
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:14,317
'cause this could have
turned out so differently.

1492
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,622
I'm blessed. I'm blessed.

1493
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,956
I feel blessed!
Man, I'm doing stand-up comedy.

1494
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:22,654
I love that.

1495
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:25,254
I got people behind me
that love me and support me

1496
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,665
no matter how many times
I fuck up.

1497
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:31,397
Man, I don't even think I would have
given myself that many chances.

1498
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:35,801
If I learned anything it's

1499
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:38,470
nobody reaches success
by themselves.

1500
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,009
You reach it by standing
on the shoulders

1501
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,949
of the people that love you
and support you the most.

1502
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,213
You know, so when you
get to that point

1503
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,051
that you've been praying
and begging and crying to get to,

1504
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,559
you owe it to them
to make them proud.

1505
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:57,358
Last and final question, Jeff:

1506
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:59,990
what advice would you give to anyone

1507
01:31:00,055 --> 01:31:02,729
who is willing to listen?

1508
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:06,204
Man.

1509
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,211
Just love and believe
in yourself.

1510
01:31:15,103 --> 01:31:17,515
It took me a long time
to learn that.

1511
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,951
Pshaw-- shit,
I'm still learning.

1512
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,856
Thank you, Jeff.
Thank you.

1513
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:27,359
Thank you.

1514
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:36,035
Hey, Jeff,
how about one more?

1515
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:38,093
For-- for the road.

1516
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:42,041
Naw. See, what had
happened was--

1517
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:01,925
As I watched Jeff disappear
in the distance,

1518
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:04,521
I was hopeful.

1519
01:32:04,586 --> 01:32:07,795
Hopeful that Jeff had finally slain

1520
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,598
his demons once and for all,

1521
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:13,469
hopeful that he'd raise his family

1522
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,134
and become the superstar
that so many

1523
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:18,405
always knew he should be.

1524
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:21,743
I'm very proud to say,

1525
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:24,443
Jeff kept his promise.

1526
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:27,316
He never did drugs again.

1527
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,605
You know I think it's a damn shame.

1528
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,662
I mean, first he kicks the shit,

1529
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:50,005
then his heart gives out?

1530
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,170
It hurts, it hurts.

1531
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,406
I miss you so much, Jeff.
I don't even think--

1532
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:58,349
I know he's up there,
laughing at us all crying about him.

1533
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,317
Shut up,
I know you up there!

1534
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:04,323
We miss you, man!
We miss you, we miss you.

1535
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:08,452
We're gonna miss you, Jeff.
Naw. See, what had happened was--

1536
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:10,326
The day is long

1537
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:12,092
and it's real dark

1538
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,190
'cause today we lost
a great pioneer of comedians.

1539
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:16,497
Right here,
the number one comic in my mind,

1540
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:18,970
Mr. Jeff Woods!
We love you, brother!

1541
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:22,474
And I don't care what nobody say.
He will go down as one of the greats!

1542
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,032
- Yep.
- Like a Redd Foxx,

1543
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,976
- Richard Pryor...
- Yeah. Bro, talk.

1544
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:28,275
...Bernie Mac, Robin Harris.

1545
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,407
We really cared about him!

1546
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,019
- He was good.
- He was a good boy!

1547
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:37,057
A good, good man.

1548
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:39,524
We just want the world
to know that this family

1549
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:42,061
- is proud of our son.
- Yes yes.

1550
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,597
- And, uh...
- Yeah.

1551
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,661
And, uh...

1552
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:51,226
look, can-- can-- can you turn
that thing off, please?

1553
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,554
When I first decided

1554
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,496
to film a documentary
on Jeff Woods,

1555
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:22,592
my intention was
to capture the story

1556
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:25,228
of a person
who had fought his way up,

1557
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:27,500
had fallen hard

1558
01:34:27,562 --> 01:34:30,168
and endeavored to fight
his way up again.

1559
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:33,440
Luckily, I managed
to get that story

1560
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,345
and so much more!

1561
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,441
It's funny--

1562
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:40,350
during my time with Jeff,

1563
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:43,116
I felt that I really got to know him,

1564
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,421
and barely knew him
at the same time.

1565
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,961
Jeff that rare ability

1566
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,396
to make you love him,
hate him,

1567
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:55,196
then love him again!

1568
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:58,237
That was his charm.

1569
01:34:59,594 --> 01:35:02,336
It was also his curse.

1570
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:06,103
Maybe if we look close,

1571
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:09,148
we can all learn something
from Jeff's journey.

1572
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:12,777
As a very special person
once told me,

1573
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:16,311
life is a motherfucker!

1574
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:25,824
Hey, I'm dedicating tonight's show

1575
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,891
and the rest of the shows of my career
to my man Jeff Woods, y'all!

1576
01:35:28,957 --> 01:35:31,460
Give it up for Jeff Woods!

1577
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:37,465
And since we're giving it up
to Jeff Woods,

1578
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:40,138
let's talk about
this nigga right now!

1579
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,346
Jeff Woods got
this special one time--

1580
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,613
nigga left me at home
watching this shit on TV.

1581
01:35:47,676 --> 01:35:49,781
I was so goddamn mad.

1582
01:35:49,845 --> 01:35:51,950
My daughter gave
this nigga the finger so hard,

1583
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:54,960
I was like, "Bammm!" I was like,
"God damn, go ahead, baby girl!"

1584
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,092
His girl Iris is
in the house tonight.

1585
01:35:58,153 --> 01:35:59,826
Give it up for Iris, y'all.

1586
01:35:59,888 --> 01:36:02,027
That girl--
know you're looking good.

1587
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,434
Yeah. All jokes aside,

1588
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:06,335
man, Jeff is somewhere
laughing at us

1589
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:07,896
and high as hell.

1590
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:12,141
Jeff got high off everything!

1591
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,908
I seen Jeff smoke
some bleach one time.

1592
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:24,418
I once seen-- I once seen
Jeff high on cocaine, heroin...

1593
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:29,556
and taco sauce!
I'm like, "Nigga!"

1594
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,842
Like one time I saw
the motherfucker-- pow!

1595
01:37:21,903 --> 01:37:24,850
Right to the vein!
Right before he went on stage

1596
01:37:24,906 --> 01:37:26,180
the motherfucker was like--

1597
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:28,118
Then they was like,
"Jeff Woods!"

1598
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,588
And he popped up
and went on stage.

1599
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,784
Fucked me up.

1600
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,758
I couldn't do it like him.

1601
01:37:34,816 --> 01:37:37,456
I mean he took it to the edge.

1602
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,293
Boy was crazy!

1603
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:41,300
I remember one time, we were on the 101

1604
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,233
in Jeff's Bentley.

1605
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,362
I think we were going
to our friend Jamie's house

1606
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:47,463
who was having a party
in the valley or something.

1607
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:50,236
Anyway, Jeff is high
as a kite, misses the exit,

1608
01:37:50,298 --> 01:37:53,245
does a U-turn on the freeway
and goes up the down ramp.

1609
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:55,907
One time, he stood on the stage

1610
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,211
for a whole hour, didn't say nothin',

1611
01:37:58,273 --> 01:37:59,775
just stared at the audience.

1612
01:37:59,841 --> 01:38:02,549
I mean, no-- no talking,
no cracking jokes,

1613
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,648
no nothing, just stood there like
a coked-out zombie and shit.

1614
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,715
Just starin' at 'em!
For a whole hour?

1615
01:38:07,782 --> 01:38:10,991
Come on, man!
And the tripped-out part about it was

1616
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:13,828
the audience still laughed!

1617
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,562
They wouldn't let me backstage, right?

1618
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:19,264
So I waited outside until they
brought him out to his limo.

1619
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:22,399
And when he came out,
I just ran up to him

1620
01:38:22,464 --> 01:38:24,501
and grabbed him
and gave him a big hug!

1621
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,012
And he looked at me and was like,

1622
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:29,241
"Do I know you?"

1623
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:32,410
Can you believe he said
some shit like that to me?

1624
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:34,851
Sol looked at him and I said,

1625
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,287
"Does this jar your memory?"

1626
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:40,349
I used to beat that nigga Jeff's ass
everyday after school.

1627
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:42,326
He was one
of them motherfuckers

1628
01:38:42,384 --> 01:38:44,125
who could really make
fun of you though--

1629
01:38:44,185 --> 01:38:46,756
talk about your clothes,
the shape of your head,

1630
01:38:46,821 --> 01:38:48,767
shit like that.
He was good like that.

1631
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:50,700
One of them witty niggas.

1632
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,261
Couldn't fight
worth a damn though.

1633
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:55,035
He was amazing, man.

1634
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,440
I seen him kill this dude
for like an hour straight.

1635
01:38:57,499 --> 01:38:59,638
Man, one time he said
the dude teeth were so yellow,

1636
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:01,271
he looked like
he had a urine tint.

1637
01:39:01,336 --> 01:39:03,873
Jeff had the shit.
Special guy, special guy!

1638
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,645
I told him, "Dude, you got it!

1639
01:39:05,707 --> 01:39:07,618
You gotta go to LA
and make that money."

1640
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:10,155
Sometimes he come, we see him
in front of a comedy club,

1641
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:12,817
passed out.
You know what I mean? Just high.

1642
01:39:12,881 --> 01:39:15,555
Not even off liquor.
"Yo, get up, man!

1643
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:18,223
What's wrong with you?"
"it's none of your business!"

1644
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:21,290
That was Jeff's thing. "it's none
of your-- it's none of your business."

1645
01:39:21,356 --> 01:39:24,565
So I just made it
none of my business.

1646
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:26,731
We just hope that Jeff
really does it this time.

1647
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:29,502
Jeff, we love you
and we're praying for you

1648
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:31,373
and make it, baby!

1649
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,742
Excuse us, madam,
why are you leaving so soon?

1650
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,680
No no, I am outta here!
It is too goddamn wild up in there!

1651
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,309
People are getting high,
sucking dicks,

1652
01:39:39,374 --> 01:39:41,354
waving titties everywhere,
doing anal, no!

1653
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:43,389
Fuck this!
I am an actress.

1654
01:39:43,444 --> 01:39:45,890
And side note:
I can play anything. IMDB me.

1655
01:39:45,947 --> 01:39:48,484
So sure yeah, I came here
thinking that I could get put on,

1656
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:50,859
but this is too much.

1657
01:39:50,919 --> 01:39:53,866
Oh God, and then Jeff's
shady-ass manager Roosevelt Steele

1658
01:39:53,922 --> 01:39:55,595
gave me his card:

1659
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:57,933
"Will kill a motherfucker
for a client."

1660
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:00,734
Really?
I'm gonna give him a call,

1661
01:40:00,795 --> 01:40:03,901
but right now, I am outta here.
So, deuces!

1662
01:40:03,965 --> 01:40:08,072
Hollywood has definitely
lost a talent, a huge talent.

1663
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:10,274
It's a crime that
I'm selling this book

1664
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,682
for only $49.99.

1665
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:15,187
What would you say to your critics

1666
01:40:15,243 --> 01:40:17,223
who question your sources
and accuse you

1667
01:40:17,278 --> 01:40:20,350
of exploiting Jeff's death
for financial gain?

1668
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:22,588
I'd say fuck 'em!

1669
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:49,682
Naw. See, what had happened was--
