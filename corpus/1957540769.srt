1
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,584
<i>If you ever disrespect me,</i>

2
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,792
<i>I will skin you alive.</i>

3
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,209
Macca! Hurry now!

4
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,125
Grab the end.

5
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:13,728
So, we'll start

6
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:14,792
with the Millers.

7
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,144
I told them we'll - be
done by 10:00 o'clock.

8
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,602
They have

9
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:20,000
a party at 11:00.

10
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,227
And then, we'll go

11
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:22,417
right over to Sarah's.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,852
You know, she has the place

13
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,250
with the big pool.

14
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,227
The one by - the embassy.

15
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,477
Then, we'll make a
stop - over at Suzanne's.

16
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,209
She owes me two checks,

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,665
but we have to make it

18
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,083
there before sundown.

19
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,832
If we don't get those checks,

20
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:37,542
we'll be short on the mortgage.

21
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:39,417
Help me with the ladder.

22
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,334
Macca. Enough with this now.

23
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:56,894
You'll be going

24
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,417
And meanwhile,

25
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,499
to medical school.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,667
You're working with me.

27
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,957
So while we're

28
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,209
still here, please,

29
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,665
stop it with this

30
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,083
drawing-drawing. Focus.

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,561
I just brought it

32
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,082
to pass the time.

33
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,977
Pop the hood and fill
it - with antifreeze.

34
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,957
I left it by the curb.

35
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,876
Fill it till it's level, okay?

36
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,686
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,542
I heard you. I got it.

38
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,763
You still haven't opened it?

39
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,686
I got it. Just give me...

40
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,209
Hand me the antifreeze.

41
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,042
Here.

42
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,667
<i>Music, which, to this day,</i>

43
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,540
<i>reminds him of his ancestors,</i>

44
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:31,959

48
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,584

<i>The conflict ended in 2002...</i>

00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,102

- Hm?

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:48,209
<i>can still be found strewn</i>

54
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,626

00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,791

Aye, Africa.

62
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,207
What?

63
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,000
Sierra Leone.

64
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:06,082
Ah, I'm just remembering

65
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,751
War is not good.

66
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,644
Yeah?

67
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,500
Those rebels were cruel, man.

68
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:15,042
I still remember your grandma.

69
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,811
- Your grandma would come running.
- She'd open the door and say,

70
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,353
<i>"The rebel dey can!</i>

71
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:20,834
<i>The rebel dey can!"</i>

72
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,812
You still

73
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,751
understand the Krio, right?

74
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:27,375
Yeah. Of course, I do.

75
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,832
Then, we would just

76
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,250
take off running,

77
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,125
through the fields.

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,876
Me and my brothers.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,853
The RUF was led by

80
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,751
this guy, Foday Sankoh.

81
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,434
- The diamond fields 
- were in the east,

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,665
But the government

83
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,876
was in the west.

84
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,103
They would send those

85
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,292
diamonds to, to Europe,

86
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,959
and send back guns and cocaine.

87
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,832
So, this guy, Sankoh,

88
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:54,626
was just killing people.

89
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,498
Those guys would go from village

90
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,667
to village, just killing people.

91
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,186
They would come into

92
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,667
our homes, raping women,

93
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,209
taking kids. Kids!

94
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,895
- They would take the kids' hands.
- They wouldn't kill them.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,459
Just chop it. Bam!

96
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,518
- This is where they would
- cut it, right here.

97
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,998
And then send them to the next

98
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,500
village to scare the people.

99
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,873
If Guinea and Britain

100
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:24,667
didn't intervene,

101
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,959
they would've finished us, man.

102
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,876
I knew it, but...

103
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,626
when I hear it, it's just...

104
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,584
it's just sad.

105
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,792
Africans, man.

106
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,165
Africans can be

107
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,500
cruel to each other.

108
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,626
Africans can be cruel.

109
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,186
No, stop that.

110
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,834
Come here!

111
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,749
Okay, hold the base

112
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:27,959
of the ladder.

113
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,834
We're on an incline here.

114
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,667
And if it starts to fall,

115
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,459
get out of the way.

116
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,436
- Okay?
- 'Cause I'll be up there.

117
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,227
If it comes down, - I'll
not be looking out for you.

118
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,834
I'll be looking out for myself.

119
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey!

120
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,207
The next time I see that

121
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:38,751
trash, I will shred it.

122
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,853
I was just drawing

123
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:40,918
What?

124
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,208
An idea I had.

125
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,811
I was... I was just

126
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,459
drawing an idea I had.

127
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,395
Hand me my food.

128
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,042
Okay.

129
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,167
What?

130
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,561
- I'm just laughing at your guy.
- Who?

131
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,000
Chris Paul.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,706
That guy will never,

133
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,375
never win a championship.

134
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,853
He could, he just needs

135
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,292
the right team around him.

136
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,603
Macca, for some people,

137
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:55,876
even with the right team,

138
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,334
they can't do it.

139
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,645
They're cursed.

140
00:08:58,669 --> 00:08:59,918
I mean, think about it.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,269
That guy is always,

142
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,584
always injured.

143
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,375
Yeah.

144
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,020
But those are the sacrifices

145
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,626
you make for your passion.

146
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,165
This is why the world

147
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:10,667
will always need doctors.

148
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,042
Those guys get hurt,

149
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,895
and they'll always need 
somebody to take care of them.

150
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,644
But, the world also

151
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,042
needs Michael Jordan.

152
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,394
Eh. Not everyone can

153
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,709
be a Michael Jordan.

154
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,769
What if Michael Jordan 
became a doctor?

155
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:24,895
Well, at least

156
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,959
it's guaranteed.

157
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,519
Landscaping is a job - anybody can do.

158
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,459
How is that guaranteed?

159
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,500
Who are you talking to?

160
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:38,061
We're just talking.

161
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,584
I'm your dad!

162
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,061
You don't talk

163
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,500
to me like that!

164
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,686
You're getting really,

165
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,834
really crazy!

166
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,459
Hey, remember John Kerry?

167
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,728
That's his house down

168
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:14,959
the street there.

169
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,000
The guy who started AOL,

170
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,165
he used to live

171
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,292
down here, too.

172
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,894
This street is where all

173
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,542
the senators live, man.

174
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,832
Congressmen

175
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,083
and millionaires.

176
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,665
The area used to

177
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,000
be rough out here.

178
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,727
But they wiped out

179
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,417
everything for those guys.

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,852
So, this next street

181
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,250
we're going to?

182
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,790
I've taken you there

183
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,292
before when you were little.

184
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,290
I've been working

185
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,167
there since 1986.

186
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,311
I know this

187
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,417
neighborhood, man.

188
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,918
The lady who lives there?

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,125
She trusts me so much.

190
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,226
- Now she's out of town now,
- but she gave me the key

191
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,769
Because I'm the only one she

192
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,334
trusts to take care of it.

193
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,978
The first time she tried

194
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,250
to give me the key,

195
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,499
I said, "No!"

196
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:13,709
I'm a Black man!

197
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:14,957
"Hey? If anything goes"

198
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,167
missing in the house,

199
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,686
they gonna say, 'Who gave

200
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,167
"the Black man the key?'"

201
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,728
Son, you gonna

202
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,042
love this place.

203
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,769
- I'm gonna get the mail, okay?
- Come on.

204
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,167
White people.

205
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,959
Hey. Get away from that car.

206
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,500
Come on. Let's go. Follow me.

207
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,977
So, what do you think, son?

208
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,792
Wasn't expecting this.

209
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,001
working here since 1986.

210
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,124
I told you. I've been

211
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,748
That's why they pay me

212
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,417
the big bucks.

213
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,123
You got it. You a G.

214
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:20,792
Mm-hmm.

215
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,603
- Alright. Work time.

216
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,042
Grab the hose.

217
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,709
You water the plants over here,

218
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,498
and I will water the ones

219
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,250
on the side, okay? Alright.

220
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,876
Let me reset the alarm.

221
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:12,876
Hey, how you doing?

222
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,292
How you doing?

223
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,394
Hey, Dad, I think

224
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:28,791
that guy's watching us.

225
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,978
I've been working in this

226
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,209
neighborhood since 1986.

227
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,768
Let's go. We need 
to get to Suzanne's

228
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,311
In time for those checks, okay?

229
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,145
Oh wait. I have to run the car,

230
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,918
so the battery doesn't die out.

231
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,292
Hello?

232
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,626
Stanley! Hey!

233
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,834
Yeah!

234
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:57,853
No, I'm here in DC 
with Macca.

235
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,582
Macca's been hustling with

236
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,250
me the whole time, man.

237
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,561
Yeah! The same

238
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:03,834
Macca you know.

239
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,561
Yeah, that little scrawny guy?

240
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,250
He's not that little anymore.

241
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,125
Yeah. Okay.

242
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,561
Okay. That's right.

243
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,000
Dad, listen to me.

244
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,144
- The guy's looking at us.
- We gotta go.

245
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,209
What did I say? 1986.

246
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,915
Here, I-I'll shut it off.

247
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,584
No. I got it.

248
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,749
I'm sorry, Stanley.

249
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:32,876
That was Macca.

250
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,876
Uh-huh.

251
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,519
Hey, Stanley. I'm gonna

252
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,000
have to let you go. Okay.

253
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,728
- Dad.
- This light.

254
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,457
Move. I got it.

255
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,125
I got it! Come on!

256
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,707
Come on, let's go.

257
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,542
Something is wrong with you.

258
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,790
Come on, Pop.

259
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,000
Macca.

260
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,459
Macca!

261
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,582
Uh-oh.

262
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,101
Alright, stop right there, guys.

263
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:13,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- -Officer 1: We need

264
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,417
To see some ID.

265
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,582
We just work...

266
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,709
see some identification.

267
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,791
We need to

268
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,186
- -We're just working...
- -Hey!

269
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,394
- -Ah, this is ridiculous.
- -Dad, hey, Dad.

270
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,560
- -You need to calm down.
- -If you could just listen!

271
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,292
Oh, this is ridiculous!

272
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,374
You need to calm down, sir.

273
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,667
Dad, just show them your ID!

274
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,185
- We need to see some ID.
- ID for what!?

275
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,042
We need to see identification.

276
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,165
I've been working in

277
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:33,250
this place since 1986!

278
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,936
You need to stand still.

279
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,393
This is what happens when 
you're a Black man in America!

280
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:38,394
You need

281
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,417
Sir, you need...

282
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,499
to calm down.

283
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Okay, we're working at the house.
We're working...

284
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,250
Macca!

285
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,686
Be quiet!

286
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,083
I was just telling them...

287
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,643
Stop talking! 
You need to listen.

288
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:45,667
Okay, sir! 
Sir, you and your friend

289
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,667
Need to calm down.

290
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,686
- That is not my friend.
- That's my son.

291
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,582
Sir!

292
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,417
You need to speak to me

293
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,499
Ma'am, I am older than you!

294
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,352
- With some respect!
- Dad, calm down, okay?

295
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,728
I've been working

296
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,042
here since 1986!

297
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,018
Come on, man! 
Put your hands down!

298
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,768
- Hey, you need to calm
- him down right now!

299
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:02,873
Dad! Dad!

300
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,000
Listen to me! Listen!

301
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,602
Listen to me for what!?

302
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,167
Calm down! Dad, Dad, calm down!

303
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,644
This is ridiculous! Stop moving!
Stop moving!

304
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:09,751
Why do they have - their guns out?

305
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,500
Sir, put your hands down!

306
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,249
This is what happens!

307
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,751
We're the landscapers.

308
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,833
Hey. Hey,

309
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,103
Okay? We're the... Look!

310
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,499
Look in the truck! Look!

311
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,623
We work here, okay?

312
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,792
We were just working!

313
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:31,915
We're the landscapers.

314
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,000
Listen to me.

315
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:43,667
This is crazy.

316
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,542
Crazy.

317
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,290
We didn't even get the checks.

318
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:32,083
You can't do that!

319
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,560
- You know exactly what happens
- in those kind of situations!

320
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,019
If... If I wasn't there,

321
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,500
Macca, you can't...

322
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,583
you would've gotten shot.

323
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,665
No, you have to

324
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:39,792
control your anger!

325
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:41,436
You think I wasn't mad!?

326
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,042
Think!

327
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,518
These people don't - care about you!

328
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,019
- They don't give a shit that
- you've been here since 1986!

329
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,959
They're cruel!

330
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,709
You could've listened to me.

331
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,626
I can make decisions, too!
