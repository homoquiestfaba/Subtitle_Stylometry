1
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,552
- Mr. Mayor, are you here?

2
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,388
Jerry, you're not dead are you?

3
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,559
- I'm not dead.

4
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,829
I'm just grabbing a few bottles.

5
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:13,166
You're lucky Gary, you got one
job people rely on you for.

6
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,069
No one appreciates what I go through

7
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,772
every time we have a
town hall meeting here,

8
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,742
everyone cramming in and
nobody buying anything.

9
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,376
- Well, maybe it's time
to build a new town hall.

10
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,244
- Ah, with what money?

11
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,448
- Any luck with getting the
cable companies in this town?

12
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,118
- You're lucky I got us internet.

13
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:30,985
- Yeah, but it's like dial up.

14
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,620
It's too damn slow.

15
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,187
- Why are you here?

16
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,623
- I wanted to see if maybe

17
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,992
we could have tonight's town
hall meeting at the church.

18
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,527
- Why the hell would we do that?

19
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,996
It's clear on the other side of town.

20
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,230
- It's right there.

21
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,732
It's like two blocks away.

22
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,468
- We have been having the town
hall meetings here for years.

23
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,204
- You're gonna get Rakesh
Nibhanupudi to open the bar.

24
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,041
- Who the hell is Rakesh?

25
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,511
- It's the guy from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

26
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,012
- The EPA?

27
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,080
- Jesus, Jerry,

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,515
he's coming to talk to the town tonight.

29
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,416
- What are you talking about?

30
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,686
- It has something to do with Muellers.

31
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,922
- There is nothing wrong
with our chemical plant.

32
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:08,990
Well, we make one of a,

33
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,492
a hundred compounds used in dog shampoo.

34
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,499
- Would you call Father O'Dell?

35
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,603
- Why the hell would I do that?

36
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,039
- To have the meeting at the church.

37
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,207
Jerry it's the federal government.

38
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,443
- Christ.

39
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,378
You do it.

40
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,448
I'm not asking that man for any favors.

41
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,416
- Just pick up
the phone and call him.

42
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,317
- No.

43
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,251
- You're the mayor of this town.

44
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,286
So you should call--

45
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,487
- I know who I am.

46
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,222
- Then call Father O'Dell.

47
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,091
- No.

48
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,491
- One of these days,

49
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,426
you're gonna have to tell
me what this rival's about.

50
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,537
Father, it's Gary O'Reilly.

51
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,005
I'm over at the pub with the mayor

52
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:59,372
and we think it might be a good idea

53
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,843
if the meeting in tonight
was at the church.

54
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,478
I know it's a little last minute.

55
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,715
Hold on.

56
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,986
- What, no.

57
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:12,987
No.

58
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:21,863
Hello father.

59
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,765
This is the mayor speaking.

60
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:25,398
The town needs a,

61
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,668
but I am the mayor.

62
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,805
I didn't just call you Wesley, Wesley.

63
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:31,806
- Jerry.

64
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,811
- The town would be much obliged.

65
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,813
Yeah, fine.

66
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,648
I would be much obliged

67
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,517
if we could use the church this evening

68
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,552
for the town hall meeting.

69
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,054
Uh huh.

70
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,258
You spineless son.

71
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,528
Yeah, oh yeah, you wanna do that to me?

72
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,427
Oh no.

73
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:55,663
Well, I'll tell you what,

74
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,232
why don't you meet me at
the school gym tomorrow

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,334
and we'll settle this just like men.

76
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,572
I'll knock you to the
ground, you Nancy boy.

77
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:05,807
Booyah!

78
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,141
- Hello father.

79
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,408
Goddammit.

80
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,212
Did you just start a fight with a priest

81
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,513
- It's a long time coming, Gary.

82
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,815
You must not worry.

83
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,283
It's a primal ritual of,

84
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,120
of men battling mono-a-mono
until somebody dies.

85
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,788
- No one is gonna die tomorrow.

86
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,390
- In the ring, anything can happen, Gary

87
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,358
- I gotta let everyone know
about the changes tonight.

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,727
I'll see you later, okay.

89
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,096
- You should have come to
me sooner with that news.

90
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,316
- Hey, we need to shut down pump two

91
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,518
and crank up three and four.

92
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,788
- You want me to bleed
the valves from two?

93
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:54,989
- Hey sheriff.

94
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,290
No, not yet.

95
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,490
- Hey Gary.

96
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,961
- What can I do you for?

97
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,997
- Town's meetings been
moved to the church tonight.

98
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,165
What's going on?

99
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:06,100
- The Environmental Protection Agency

100
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,301
is running us through the mill

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,402
about getting these
new protocols in place.

102
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,606
They didn't waste any time.

103
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,108
- Don't they need the
town's approval for that?

104
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,010
- They showed me federal papers.

105
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,444
We didn't have a choice.

106
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,680
Everything went online yesterday.

107
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,414
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

108
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,618
- I'll let everyone know.

109
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,720
- I'll see you tonight.

110
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,899
- Introduce me.

111
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,234
- No.

112
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,602
- Introduce me.

113
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,638
- No.

114
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,941
- You have to introduce me.

115
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,976
- Introduce yourself.

116
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,211
- Introduce me.
- No.

117
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:25,546
- Dammit, O'Dell introduce me.

118
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,515
- We know who you are, Jerry.

119
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,649
Stand up there.

120
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,217
- All right, hello.

121
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,118
Hello.

122
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,485
Welcome.

123
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:37,124
Welcome to the quarterly
Kilnerry town hall meeting.

124
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,561
Oh, it's good to see you all.

125
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,266
It's been a long winter,

126
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,234
but spring is here.

127
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,670
Oh, we've got graduation coming up.

128
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,375
Some of our young folks will
be heading off to college soon.

129
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,846
Oh, and for those of
you who haven't heard,

130
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,216
the Kilnerry Gazette has closed down.

131
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:07,254
Well, now, as I've been
telling folks for a while now,

132
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,058
we were expecting a representative

133
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,162
from the federal government
to speak to us this evening.

134
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,501
Well, now I've been working
very closely with them,

135
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,773
but why don't I let you meet him yoursel

136
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,477
Let's let's give a big hand for

137
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,645
Mr. Rakesh

138
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:34,181
Najaputi.

139
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,087
- Thanks.

140
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,122
That was close.

141
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:43,924
Please rise.

142
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,300
Okay, I was just kidding you guys,

143
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,802
you, you can all sit down.

144
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,871
I just always wanted to say that, so.

145
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,310
Does he need help?

146
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,113
So

147
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,181
hi,

148
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,584
I am from the Environmental
Protection Agency,

149
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,554
which is a part of the federal governmen

150
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,423
I don't use usually talk to audiences

151
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:16,757
about these kinds of things.

152
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,761
I don't actually talk to
audiences at all, really.

153
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,564
We've just been short
staffed where I work.

154
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,366
So they, they just sent me,

155
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,301
but I'm actually just a chemist.

156
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,302
And

157
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:30,905
so hi.

158
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,574
Okay, as you may or may not know,

159
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,811
there has been a to international pressu

160
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:41,182
on our country to reduce
our environmental footprint.

161
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,918
The chemical plant that
is here in Kilnerry

162
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,287
is the only plant in the state

163
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,523
that produces a chemical compound

164
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,691
called propylene glycol,

165
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,661
which is used in dog shampoos.

166
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:57,566
However, the process the plant utilizes

167
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,233
to make that compound

168
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,270
also results in the creation
of some dangerous byproducts,

169
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,706
like sulfuric acids and alkaline,

170
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,043
which can run off into the waters.

171
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:12,079
And for a large fishing
community like yours,

172
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,247
the buildup of--

173
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,717
- 25% Of the state's catch.

174
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,887
- Okay, cool.

175
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,124
So for a large fishing
community like yours,

176
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:26,026
the buildup of those dangerous byproduct

177
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,563
can be devastating for
the local Marine life.

178
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,765
It may already have had
devastating effects.

179
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:36,571
You guys could be distributing
toxic fish to the country.

180
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,239
And we would know

181
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,807
that it came from you guys,

182
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,444
came from here because of
the chemical plant here.

183
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:48,649
So my agency came up with a
solution to fix the problem.

184
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,185
We found out that if we switch off

185
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,455
one of the chemicals
utilized by your plant

186
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:56,090
for a new chemical,

187
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,126
things could be solved.

188
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,996
And that new chemical is called P172.

189
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:05,432
- Your hearing aid is feeding back.

190
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:06,800
- What?

191
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:11,805
- I said, your hearing
aid is feeding back.

192
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,242
- I, I can't hear a
damn thing she's saying.

193
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,546
- So basically, Kilnerry,

194
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:20,481
you guys, this town has been chosen

195
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,850
to be the flagship town to,

196
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,221
to test out this new
process, this new chemical.

197
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:30,991
But before we implement it
at the other propylene glycol

198
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,294
chemical plants across the country.

199
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:35,763
- The flagship town.

200
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,232
Well, that's quite an honor!

201
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,134
- Hey, hearing aid!

202
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,269
- Take it out, I'll tell you later.

203
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,106
- Please go on Mister,.

204
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:48,976
- Yeah.

205
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,145
However,

206
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:55,684
there is one slight side
effect associated with P172

207
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,185
we just recently discovered.

208
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,153
But aside from that,

209
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,455
the whole process should be seamless.

210
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,591
- What side effect?

211
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:03,824
- Uh huh.

212
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,594
- You said there'd be
one slight side effect.

213
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,294
What, what's the side effect?

214
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,162
- Yes there is.

215
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,063
And you know what?

216
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,064
I think you're gonna find it kind of fun

217
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,700
because when I heard about it,

218
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,235
I thought it was hilarious.

219
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,872
It's act, it's actually not that funny.

220
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,247
We discovered that when laboratory rats

221
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,550
are exposed to P172,

222
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,687
they experience a dramatic
increase in their.

223
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,555
- What?

224
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:35,356
Speak up.

225
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,727
- There is a dramatic
increase in sexual libido.

226
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,695
- Oh is that, is that a dance?

227
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,762
- What?

228
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,164
- Will we be able to control ourselves?

229
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,968
What if we don't want an
increase in our sexual,

230
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,237
whatever you call it?

231
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:50,971
- Libido.

232
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,240
- Would, speak up!.

233
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,208
Is that a dance?

234
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,543
- Your sex drive.

235
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,410
- Oh.

236
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:57,411
- I don't drive.

237
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,913
- Kilnerry would be
like Sodom and Gomorrah

238
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,182
and there's nothing we can do about it.

239
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,286
- Oh, now you must be
outta your damn mind.

240
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,054
I mean, look at us.

241
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,090
I mean, most of us in
this town are elderly,

242
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,027
I haven't had an, an
erection for 20 years.

243
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,396
Something like this would kill me.

244
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,631
- All right, let's not panic.

245
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:17,632
- Wait.

246
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,734
Do we not get a say in this?

247
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,637
- They started making us
use that P172 yesterday.

248
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,104
- What?

249
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,207
Why didn't you tell us
before you went to our plant

250
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,477
and poisoned us with
your dirty sex fluids?

251
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,213
- Cause they knew that we
would try and stop them.

252
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,148
- Listen everyone,

253
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,051
my agency doesn't have the power

254
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,787
to even enforce any of this.

255
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,356
My agency has hardly any
power at all these days.

256
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,893
And I was, I was, I was
forced to come here and,

257
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:51,031
and to try to sell you
guys on this whole thing.

258
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,601
I was told it was for the greater good.

259
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:54,502
- Greater good?

260
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,136
What about our greater good?

261
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,439
- Hey, is this gonna
affect the animals too?

262
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,641
Cause when I was a little boy,

263
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,875
a great dane tried to get
physically intimate with me

264
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,877
against my will.

265
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,813
Ha ha yeah, yeah.

266
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:05,913
Laugh it up, Cooper.

267
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,314
- You two cut it out.

268
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,850
- Hey, hey, does this thing
affect just heterosexuals

269
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,119
or does it cause gayness too?

270
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,253
- Gayness?

271
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,121
- Yeah.

272
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,824
Yeah, ain't no gays in this town, buddy.

273
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:16,890
And we like to keep it that way.

274
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,925
Am I right?

275
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,627
- I'm okay with the gays.

276
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,695
- Who said that?

277
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:21,596
Gross.

278
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,832
- I know that this must all

279
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,933
be really hard for some of you to--

280
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,168
- No, no, no you don't.

281
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,338
They probably had a good
laugh at all us elderly folks

282
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,640
out here in the country,

283
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,375
losing our inhibitions,

284
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,810
gyrating around town,

285
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,178
rubbing up against one another.

286
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,179
- Oh.

287
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,314
- And you,

288
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,883
you knew about this for weeks, did you.

289
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,619
And you helped them!

290
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,489
- I have never seen this man in my life.

291
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,392
This is the first I've
heard anything of this.

292
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,259
- Liar.

293
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:52,926
You just said--

294
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:53,862
- Shut it, Wesley.

295
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,928
- We'll get the media involved.

296
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,665
- Let's not think about that right now.

297
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,835
- When I was a young man,

298
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,371
you put me in a room with anything,

299
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,973
anything.

300
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,274
And I'd hump it.

301
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,576
Yeah.

302
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:09,811
- Dad, come on.

303
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,211
Mr. Nibhanupudi,

304
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,113
you said that it took decades

305
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,884
for there to be a buildup
of this alkaline stuff.

306
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,519
Wouldn't it be safe to say

307
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,253
that it would take just as long

308
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,456
for this P172 chemical as well,

309
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:25,660
and by then you should have
a solution for it, right?

310
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,095
- No, the rats were actually affected

311
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,998
by the P172 almost immediately.

312
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,367
It was impressive, really.

313
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,135
There was this one rat that
just started fornicating

314
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,272
with this other rat until it died.

315
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,843
It just kept going and going.

316
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,745
Just fornicating even post death.

317
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,680
Just, it was an angry, it was hateful.

318
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,915
It was angry, hateful animal--

319
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,183
- Thank you, Mr. Nibhanupudi.

320
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:50,685
Well.

321
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,719
- This is awesome.

322
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,320
- This is not awesome.

323
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,556
Rat rape?

324
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:58,893
- Well, if there's nothing
else, why don't we adjourn

325
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,795
tonight's meeting.

326
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,362
Oh, well we,

327
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,900
we sure could all use a good
stiff drink right about now.

328
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,135
Why don't we all head over to the pub?

329
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,171
I've got drink specials until 10 o'clock

330
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,774
Yeah.

331
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,041
We're all gonna

332
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:16,711
head over to the pub.

333
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,346
Yeah.

334
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,154
- Listen up.

335
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,157
You have my word, I'm
gonna look into this.

336
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,025
- Since the Gazette is gone,

337
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,427
I'll keep everybody informed.

338
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,830
- Mr. Kerry, I've looked
after this town for 15 years.

339
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,799
I'll keep this town informed.

340
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,167
- You don't get the gossip like I do.

341
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,368
- Thanks sheriff.

342
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,509
- Dad, come on, I'll drive you to the pu

343
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,611
- Aednat's still passed out, you idiot.

344
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,712
- Oh Jesus.

345
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,580
Watch out, watch out.

346
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,749
Aednat, sweetie.

347
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:55,783
- Ah.

348
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:56,651
- Come on.

349
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,317
- Ah.

350
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,185
They're trying to pork me.

351
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,822
- No, no porking.

352
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:01,789
- Don't let them pork me.

353
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,558
- Stop saying pork.

354
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:04,424
She's fine.

355
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,026
Yeah.

356
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,027
It's okay.

357
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:07,896
Hey, hey, hey.

358
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:08,863
It's me.

359
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:09,831
It's okay, let me drive you home.

360
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:10,798
Come on.

361
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,432
Come on dad.

362
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,433
It's okay.

363
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:18,973
Father, you coming?

364
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,642
- I'll be along shortly.

365
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:22,010
I need to clean up

366
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,914
and have a moment of
reflection with the Lord.

367
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,003
- Let's go.

368
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,705
- You're late.

369
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:51,906
- You got somewhere to be?

370
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,741
- We only got the gym a half an hour.

371
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:54,742
I want to get this over with.

372
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,545
- Oh, well then Wesley,

373
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:01,315
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

374
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:05,787
Yeah.

375
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,789
Oh, oh yeah.

376
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:08,923
Oh, huh.

377
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,457
Oh I can do that too.

378
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:11,458
How's that, huh?

379
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,359
Huh?

380
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,360
- You want some of this?
- What's that?

381
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,428
Oh yeah.

382
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,898
Well I got, I got some
of that thunder too, huh.

383
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:20,200
- Are you guys serious right now?

384
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:24,872
- Not too bad, am I?

385
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,541
- You hit me in the ear!

386
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:27,407
- No.

387
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,743
- What the hell is wrong with you?

388
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,778
- Oh, he hit me in tit.

389
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,014
- All right, all right, all right.

390
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:38,151

but don't you believe it?

428
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,625
They tried this in a town in Wyoming.

429
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,794
They came back a few months later.

430
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,732
There were bodies strew
all over the place.

431
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:33,233
Well Dorene Tanley will be the first one

432
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,771
to keel over in our town from over sexin

433
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,707
I'm always over sexing.

434
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,009
I just can't find a
man to keep up with me.

435
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,310
- Ms. Kerry.

436
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,946
- Oh, I have to go Marina.

437
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:46,514
I'll call you back later.

438
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:47,481
Bye.

439
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,818
What are you all cleaned up today for?

440
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,420
- I've cleaned up before.

441
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:55,355
Don't mean nothing.

442
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,126
- Hey Mr. O'Reilly.

443
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,127
- Oh, hi, Stevie.

444
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,161
What are you doing here?

445
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,196
- Stevie's helping me unload my car.

446
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,831
I had to get up at four this morning.

447
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,466
Drive all the way into
the city to get supplies,

448
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,468
drive all the way back.

449
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,338
I don't know what I'm gonna
do when Stevie leaves town.

450
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,440
- Well, Mr. O'Reilly can help you out.

451
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,510
- I'm an old man, Stevie.

452
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,011
This may not mean much to you,

453
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,847
but if I do a handstand,

454
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:20,982
I can tee bag myself.

455
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:21,916
- All right.

456
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,050
Young Stevie does not need to be

457
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,385
hearing about your saggy bits.

458
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,725
You know, he has a point though.

459
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,994
You must walk, what,

460
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,163
10 to 15 miles a day.

461
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:36,731
- 12.3 miles.

462
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,397
Yeah.

463
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,167
I used to be pretty fit.

464
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,802
- Hmm?

465
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:41,803
Football?

466
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,738
- Dancer.

467
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:44,806
- Dancer?
- Yeah.

468
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,609
- I just, I don't believe it.

469
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,078
- I was a very good dancer.

470
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,649
I won the county finals in 1978.

471
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:55,750
Well,

472
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,218
after Dora died, I,

473
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,487
I didn't feel much like dancing anymore.

474
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:05,392
- Have you been to Aednat's yet today?

475
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,360
- Digging for gossip again, huh?

476
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,298
- I don't gossip, Fergal.

477
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,632
I just happen to know things

478
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,135
and people just happen to be interested

479
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,771
in the things I know.

480
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,673
Come on, tell me.

481
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,311
- I dropped by early to

482
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,146
deliver her mail,

483
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:28,316
but she barricaded herself inside.

484
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,117
Reciting the Lord's prayer.

485
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,788
I think she thinks
perverts are attacking her.

486
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,890
- She thinks pretty much of herself.

487
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,158
- Yeah.

488
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:38,759
Duty calls.

489
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:49,036
- Always such a gray skies.

490
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,138
No wonder this town is so sour.

491
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,076
- You know, my science teacher says

492
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,476
since we don't get enough sunlight,

493
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,279
we don't get enough UV rays.

494
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,714
- Really?

495
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:02,216
- They increase vitamin D and serotonin,

496
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,618
which actually helps with depression.

497
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,620
In some places like Alaska and Iceland,

498
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,521
they use tanning beds to make up for it.

499
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,657
- Very interesting.

500
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:12,260
- You know, if you actually
had a tanning bed set up here,

501
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,861
you'd make a lot of money.

502
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,032
- Okay, we'll take care of it.

503
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,067
Hey sheriff,

504
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,869
Judy Davenport just called.

505
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,739
Somebody stole the gnomes
out of her front yard.

506
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,075
- I'm sure it's just a couple of kids.

507
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:31,545
- I don't know, she seemed upset to me.

508
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,284
- Okay.

509
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:37,351
I'll go talk to her.

510
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,333
- Hi.
- Hello.

511
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,475
- Jerry?

512
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,481
Jerry?

513
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,353
- Oh yeah,

514
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,921
you dirty little--

515
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:17,692
- Jerry, are you in there?
- Holy Christ!

516
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,095
I'll be right out.

517
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:21,963
- Okay.

518
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,573
- Nessa.

519
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:33,908
- Who were you on the phone with?

520
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,276
- No one, no one.

521
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:37,778
what are you doing here?

522
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,816
- You know, just sitting over in my shop

523
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:42,817
Just

524
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:45,252
sitting.

525
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:48,522
No one's buying anything.

526
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,658
Everyone's shopping online.

527
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,227
I don't know how much
longer I can stay open.

528
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,363
- I'm sure it can't be that bad.

529
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:58,432
- Jerry, this town is dying.

530
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:00,401
- This town is not dying.

531
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,671
- Well, businesses are closing
and no one's having babies.

532
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,706
- Well, most of the people in this town

533
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,275
are too all to be having babies.

534
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,910
- And Brigid told me

535
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:14,281
Mary Hughes died last night.

536
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,218
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

537
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:18,119
- I know.

538
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,820
And there's gonna be a wake.

539
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:23,090
- We can order a bouquet with,

540
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,959
with the pride of Kilnerry.

541
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,260
- That's nice.

542
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,063
And all the kids are leaving.

543
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,731
So there's that.

544
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,866
- I see.

545
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,369
Stevie's leaving soon for college.

546
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:36,570
- Yeah.

547
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,373
Maybe I can move in with him.

548
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:40,908
You know, go where he goes.

549
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:41,709
- Nessa.

550
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,879
Kilnerry's been around a long time.

551
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,180
It's quiet here,

552
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,249
just the way we like it.

553
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,352
No one even locks their doors.

554
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:53,187
You wanna go off to the big city

555
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,589
with crime and concrete

556
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:59,226
and pollution and tight jeans.

557
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,729
Who wears their jeans so tight

558
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,297
with their private parts

559
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,199
pressed up against the front of you?

560
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,436
It's like an advertisement
for disappointment.

561
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,637
- What?

562
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:14,608
- No, now we are going to stay in Kilner

563
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,143
where we belong.

564
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:17,945
Now,

565
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,847
excuse me, I,

566
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,650
I need to finish cleaning the bathroom.

567
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,819
- Oh, okay.

568
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:25,820
- Okay.

569
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:28,355
Huh, oh, oh now.

570
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,356
Okay.

571
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:38,466
Hello?

572
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,468
Are you still there?

573
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,303
Well, listen, I'll,

574
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,338
I'll call back another time.

575
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,206
Great.

576
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,073
You, you were terrific.

577
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,041
Thank you.

578
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:48,943
Great.

579
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,612
That only cost me 9.99 a minute.

580
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,615
- Hey Sheriff.

581
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,385
- What's up, Roy?

582
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,386
- Nothing.

583
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,157
Where are you?

584
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,093
- I'm out at Deerman Road.

585
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:09,363
- What are you doing
all the way out there?

586
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,000
- Rory, hold on for a second.

587
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,945
- Sheriff, I'm really lonely.

588
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:30,684
- I'm out here.

589
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,722
- I'm getting it.

590
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:35,656
- Yeah.

591
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:36,558
- Am I getting it?

592
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,292
- You are.

593
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:42,129
- Hey, stop!

594
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,382
- James, I'm sorry for your loss.

595
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,184
Your aunt was a wonderful woman.

596
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:39,688
- I guess.

597
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,026
- Who ordered the flower arrangement?

598
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,128
- Oh yeah, that was the mayor.

599
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,464
Figured he'd do something nice.

600
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:52,266
I guess.

601
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,501
- What in the hell?

602
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,341
Goddammit!

603
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:07,348
Sorry for your loss, James.

604
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,250
- I can do this, I can
do this, I can do this.

605
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,118
I can't do it, nope.

606
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,621
I can't do it.

607
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,689
- That girl is not all there.

608
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,790
- Need I remind you
what she's been through.

609
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,459
- No, of course not.

610
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,760
- Her father was a good man.

611
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,663
Her mother was a saint.

612
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,599
- Maybe she needs a good husband.

613
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:25,799
James.

614
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,103
- No, she's crazy.

615
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:30,971
- After her parents died,

616
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:32,540
she spent all her time
taking care of Stevie.

617
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,241
I guess she never found time to date.

618
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,744
- What about Gary?

619
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,044
- He likes her, sure.

620
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:39,880
But good luck trying
to make that boy date.

621
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,283
- How long did you know Mary?

622
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:43,384
- 19 Years,

623
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:44,385
seven months,

624
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:45,319
three days.

625
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,820
- To Mary!

626
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,955
- Sorry.

627
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,324
- You are a Muppet.

628
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:51,892
- A Muppet?

629
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:53,427
Admit it, Wesley,

630
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:56,731
it's true what they say about
priests and little boys.

631
00:29:58,332 --> 00:29:59,500
- Spawn of Satan!

632
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,368
- Jerry!

633
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:05,540
Jerry.

634
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,541
Oh, Jerry.

635
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:08,909
- Jesus, Jerry, you okay?

636
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,244
- He probably had a stroke.

637
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,845
- A stroke?

638
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:12,880
What the hell's wrong with you guys?

639
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,748
- He knows.

640
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:14,683
- Keep your voice down.

641
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,350
- It's because of him.

642
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,552
- Gary, hi, Gary.

643
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:18,485
- Nessa.

644
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,353
- Gary.

645
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:20,487
- Sheriff O'Reilly.

646
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,356
Any hardened criminals today?

647
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,093
- I had to arrest Peter and Lisa Donahue

648
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:26,761
- What?

649
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,629
What for?

650
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,096
- Public lewdness.

651
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:32,066
I caught him fornicating behind
a building on Deerman Road.

652
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,736
- There's nothing out on Deerman Road.

653
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,706
- So what happened to Peter and Lisa?

654
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:38,573
- I tried to stop them,

655
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:39,907
but they just kept going.

656
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,975
Peter had this worried look on his face.

657
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,210
- So, what did you do?

658
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,513
Stand there and watch
'em until they finished.

659
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:46,480
- No.

660
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:47,649
I thought someone might see them.

661
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:48,982
So I tried to hide them,

662
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,720
but then I just realized
I was being an accessory.

663
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,655
- An accessory at a public lewdness?

664
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,089
- That's not a thing.

665
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,559
- Maybe they, they held Peter's hips

666
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,860
and help them go in and out.

667
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,362
- Oh, you know,

668
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:04,632
being a sexual voyeur is a
pretty common thing these days.

669
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,934
If that's your thing Gary, embrace it.

670
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,803
- I am not a sexual voyeur.

671
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,805
- That'd explain a lot.

672
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:11,673
- Dad.

673
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:12,574
- I still love you, son.

674
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:14,743
- Dammit, I'm not a voyeur.

675
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:17,444
- The man who watches us all.

676
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,445
To Gary!

677
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,248
- To Gary!

678
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,016
- Oh, poor Mary.

679
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:25,553
She was always such a sweetheart.

680
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:26,688
- She's outta the house.

681
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,155
Aednat, it's good to see you.

682
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:29,858
- I convinced Aednat that
nobody was going to attack her.

683
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,259
And that this whole P172 thing

684
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,361
was blown way out of proportion

685
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:37,565
and that she should come and
pay her respects to Mary.

686
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,667
- You looked so nice.

687
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,435
- Once I convinced her to come here,

688
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:44,639
then I talked to taking
dance lessons with me.

689
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:45,640
- Oh really?

690
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,040
- We're gonna go to the next county

691
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,877
where they have a dance studio

692
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:50,911
and we're going to learn the tango.

693
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,547
- That would be lovely.

694
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,750
- The Tango's a little risque, isn't it?

695
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,951
- Gary, we're fine.

696
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,288
- Gary arrested the Donahues today.

697
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:02,791
- What?
- Fergal, shut up.

698
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:03,957
- What for?

699
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,693
- Aednat doesn't need to hear this.

700
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:06,861
- Yes she does.

701
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,095
- Gary.

702
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,831
- Okay, they were having
sex behind the building

703
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,165
on Deerman Road.

704
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,333
- What were you doing on Deerman Road?

705
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:14,669
- They couldn't control themselves.

706
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:15,537
He tried to stop them,

707
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:16,470
but they were still going.

708
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,137
- I knew it.

709
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,306
It's that P172, Brigid.

710
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:19,973
Take me home.

711
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,676
I, I can't stay.

712
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,977
They'll gang bang me.

713
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:25,713
I'm gonna burn in hell, Father.

714
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:26,781
- You're not gonna burn in hell, Aednat.

715
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,782
Just calm down.

716
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,384
- Aednat.

717
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:31,385
Aednat.

718
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,689
- I didn't have a choice.

719
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,089
I tried everything.

720
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,559
They wouldn't stop.

721
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:38,626
- Oh.

722
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:39,993
- Maybe it is in the water.

723
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,764
- What did you do to Lisa and Peter?

724
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:43,964
- I pepper sprayed them.

725
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,265
- Oh.

726
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:47,100
- They were screaming
and flailing around.

727
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,369
They were blind and so they tried to run

728
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,940
I thought they might hurt
themselves, so I tackled them.

729
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:52,907
- Oh.

730
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:54,676
Well what did they say?

731
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:55,577
- They said, ah!

732
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,783
- Excuse me, princess.

733
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:02,983
- Princess!

734
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,592
- Oh, that P172!

735
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,428
- Don't worry, it's okay.

736
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,563
You're okay.

737
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,232
- Seems like things are really

738
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,767
starting to a kick up around here.

739
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:23,671
- I can't imagine how bad
Peter and Lisa must feel.

740
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:25,673
- Gary, you should let them out.

741
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:27,140
- They were fornicating in public.

742
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:28,676
There's schools in this town.

743
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:30,010
- He's right.

744
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,516
- Just imagine what it's
like to be young and in love

745
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,784
up against a wall,

746
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:40,688
lost in a moment of carnal lost.

747
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:45,225
- Gary, I want you to go down
to the jail and let them out.

748
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:45,894
- What?

749
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,327
That's not gonna happen.

750
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:48,262
- Son.

751
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,864
You only got one jail cell.

752
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,567
They're probably down there having sex

753
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,402
in the jail right now.

754
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,403
- No.

755
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:29,236
- Hey Sheriff,

756
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,071
I let them out already.

757
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:32,674
- What?

758
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,341
- Your dad called.

759
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,143
So.

760
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,150
- Go home Rory.

761
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:49,456
- How is it you're single, Brigid?

762
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:50,123
You're funny.

763
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:51,526
You're gorgeous.

764
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,426
You're confident.

765
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,261
You're everything a man could want.

766
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,965
- Nobody's ever called me those before.

767
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:58,365
I don't know.

768
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,868
I guess I just haven't
met the right man yet.

769
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,303
How about you?

770
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:06,340
- Oh, I, I've got plenty of options.

771
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,543
I'm just extremely picky.

772
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,811
- Of course.

773
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,348
I was married once.

774
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:18,118
Miserable son of a bitch liked to drink,

775
00:35:18,218 --> 00:35:19,353
gambled all my money away.

776
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:22,624
The real straw that broke the camel's ba

777
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:26,961
was when he slept with a
woman nicknamed the goat.

778
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,228
- Charming.

779
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,430
- Didn't even divorce him.

780
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,533
- Well, my wife cheated on me too.

781
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,535
- Sorry.

782
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,169
- Yeah, she met a group of musicians

783
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,538
playing in the town fair.

784
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:40,575
She slept with every member of that band

785
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,844
She left town about five years ago.

786
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,512
- What was the band called?

787
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:45,680
- Lost children.

788
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,551
She had me film them in their
little vagabond outfits.

789
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,020
Horrible name,

790
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,888
horrible band.

791
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,590
Eh, good riddance.

792
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,725
I never filed for a divorce either.

793
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:02,496
- It's nice to talk to
someone who understands.

794
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,500
Any girl in this town
would be lucky to have you.

795
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:13,473
- I have had my eye on
somebody else quite a while.

796
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:17,477
- Mayor Boylan.

797
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:21,849
Now you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

798
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,218
- Call me Jerry.

799
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:26,754
- Jerry.

800
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,857
Just shut up and take me.

801
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:32,093
- Don't expect anything fancy.

802
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,161
- Yeah.

803
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,228
Just tear away the cobwebs and hit this.

804
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,131
- Oh.
- Jerry!

805
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,232
- Oh, call me Mr. Mayor.

806
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:41,636
- Oh, Mr. Mayor,

807
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,437
be rough with me.

808
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:44,605
- Oh.

809
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,281
- Hello.

810
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:32,787
What, they're stolen again?

811
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:40,962
Hold on for a second.

812
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,751
- That'll do.

813
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,554
- Where's he going?

814
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,256
He doesn't have any traps.

815
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,456
- He don't fish.

816
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,759
- Why's he got a boat?

817
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,493
- Every night he gets out past the break

818
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:15,395
where he thinks nobody can see him

819
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:16,764
and he dances.

820
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,168
- Is he any good?

821
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:21,636
- Shit no.

822
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,571
But every time he does that,

823
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:26,574
crazy light housekeeper watches him.

824
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:31,913
Finish 'em up now.

825
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,021
- What am I doing?

826
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,056
I'm a married man.

827
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,095
You're gonna make me
go see him, aren't you.

828
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,365
You don't play fair either.

829
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:02,643
- Bless me, father for I have sinned.

830
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:06,614
It has been two years
since my last confession.

831
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:08,448
- What troubles you, my child?

832
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:11,118
- I may have committed adultery.

833
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,086
- What do you mean, you don't know?

834
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:12,954
- No.

835
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:13,654
- How could you not know?

836
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,422
- I don't know where he is.

837
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,489
- Does he know where he is?

838
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:17,892
- Why wouldn't he know where he is?

839
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,061
- Is that why you committed
adultery to draw him out?

840
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,996
- Well he's not hiding in the bushes.

841
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:22,930
- Where is he hiding?

842
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,764
- I dunno that he is.

843
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,032
- Then why would you commit adultery?

844
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,968
- I don't know that I did.

845
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:29,670
- One second.

846
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:34,809
- Forgive me, father
for I might have sinned.

847
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,510
- I'm sorry, that booth
was meant to be locked.

848
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:37,945
I'm with some at the moment.

849
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:38,679
- In there?

850
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:39,881
- No, in the other booth,

851
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,148
can you come around the
other side and wait.

852
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,482
- Father, please, this is important.

853
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,517
- Okay, okay.

854
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,086
How long since your last confession?

855
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:47,321
- Yeah, a long time.

856
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,290
- I see, what is it?

857
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,524
- Yeah, I think I'm,

858
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,960
I might have committed a adultery.

859
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,961
- You don't know either?

860
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,363
- What do you mean either?

861
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:56,530
- Hold on.

862
00:39:58,232 --> 00:39:59,499
Please continue.

863
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,269
- Well, when I left my husband,

864
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,703
I packed up everything we owned

865
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:05,806
and I grabbed whatever money
I could and I moved here.

866
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,209
- So you've committed theft as well.

867
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,510
- Well,

868
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,179
I never really thought
about it that way before.

869
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,282
- Why did you leave your husband?

870
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:15,616
- He was a drunk,

871
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:18,686
a gambler and he slept with the goat.

872
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:21,622
- I need a minute.

873
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:29,263
Did you leave your wife
before you commit adultery?

874
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,197
- Yes.

875
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:31,332
Is that better for me?

876
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,800
- It depends, why'd you leave her?

877
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,537
- She was having sex with lost children.

878
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:39,006
- Did you participate in
these disgusting acts?

879
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,207
- No!

880
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:41,609
I mean, no.

881
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:46,914
All I did was photograph
them in their little outfits.

882
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:48,549
I wasn't around for the sex.

883
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:49,850
- You did what?

884
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:53,621
- They had a fog machine and a light sho

885
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,323
It was rather impressive.

886
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:59,560
- You stay right there.

887
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,128
- Are you still there, my child?

888
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:02,462
- Yes.
- Yes.

889
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,031
- The church has gotten
very relaxed over the years.

890
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,933
I don't think it's as big
a deal as you might think.

891
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:08,402
- Oh well that's great.

892
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:09,704
- It's not you.

893
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,206
You and your wife are
definitely going to hell.

894
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,641
- Ex-wife

895
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:17,345
and all I did was make the
introductions and film them.

896
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:18,212
I'm innocent.

897
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,213
- On your way out,

898
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,115
splash some holy water on your face.

899
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:22,616
If you don't burst into flames,

900
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:24,552
do a thousand to hail Mary's.

901
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:25,953
- And a thousand hail?

902
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:28,756
- As I was saying,

903
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,124
you can't be held accountable

904
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:32,460
for your husband's transgressions.

905
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,327
- Amen.

906
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:34,295
Hail Mary full of grace.

907
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:35,229
The lord is with the.

908
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,564
Blessed art thou amongst women

909
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,732
blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus, Holy Mary.

910
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,633
- If he was a threat to himself and you,

911
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,369
it only makes sense that you would flee

912
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,804
in search of a more wholesome life.

913
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,673
While fornicating out of wedlock

914
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,575
is frowned upon by the church,

915
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:48,843
it's hardly anything

916
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:51,078
that would have an eternal
effect on your soul.

917
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,713
- Thank God.

918
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,184
- Can I confess something to you?

919
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,355
- Sure.

920
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:04,058
- Lately I've been struggling
with something in my own life

921
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:07,595
and whether it would be
acceptable with the modern church

922
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,731
and its relaxed views on social norms.

923
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:13,067
- I'm all ears, father.

924
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,736
- When Adam and Eve were
originally put on earth by God,

925
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,705
they were put here in the nude.

926
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,609
Clothed and unclothed
meant nothing to them.

927
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:24,078
It wasn't until Eve
ate the forbidden fruit

928
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:25,946
that sin was created.

929
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:29,583
In an attempt to cover
their spiritual shame,

930
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,685
they covered their bodies.

931
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:33,454
As God's children,

932
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,423
we live with a great deal of shame

933
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:37,358
and cover who we really are.

934
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,428
Can you imagine if we
could shed that shame

935
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,129
to be closer to God?

936
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:45,699
- I'm afraid I'm not quite
following your father.

937
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,101
- Don't worry about it.

938
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,335
All I'm trying to say is

939
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,237
try not to be too hard on
yourself for finding love again.

940
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:52,573
- It's a little early to call it love.

941
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:54,141
It's just sex.

942
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:55,976
I mean,

943
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,580
should I say a thousand hail Marys too?

944
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,416
- How about five hail
Marys and a high five?

945
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:03,617
- Deal.

946
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:12,693
- Watch the back, watch the back.

947
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,498
How's it coming along?

948
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:18,533
- Good.

949
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:20,734
Trying to get these outputs lined up.

950
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:23,505
- That's good.

951
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,139
Let's keep up the good work.

952
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,216
- It's okay.

953
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:36,650
I like it.

954
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:39,386
- You do?

955
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:40,387
- Yeah.

956
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:46,861
- You know, I wouldn't be doing this

957
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:49,697
if it wasn't for that P172 though, right

958
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,198
- Thank God for P172.

959
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,325
- You give me too much credit

960
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:53,961
if you think I'd be any harm.

961
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:58,999
- I suppose you're right.

962
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,368
- I,

963
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:06,006
I just came by to give you your mail and

964
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,309
to check on you.

965
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:12,780
- That's very sweet.

966
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:22,122
I don't suppose you'd care
to come in for a cup of tea.

967
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:27,696
- I'd like that.

968
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:46,747
- This doesn't seem right.

969
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:48,617
I must be doing something.

970
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:49,817
Oh.

971
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:53,454
Okay.

972
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:54,455
Breathe.

973
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:56,357
Hey Gary.

974
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,259
Hi Gary, it's Nessa.

975
00:45:58,359 --> 00:45:59,126
He knows your name.

976
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:00,261
What are doing?

977
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:01,262
No.

978
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:04,331
Act relaxed and calm.

979
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:05,332
Breathe.

980
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,405
What are you doing here?

981
00:46:11,506 --> 00:46:14,141
- I just need some paper
for down at the station.

982
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,944
- Right, paper, paper,
'cause it's a paper store.

983
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:18,445
What is your poison?

984
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,282
Ink jet or all purpose?

985
00:46:21,382 --> 00:46:22,349
- All purpose is fine.

986
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,984
- Ultra bright or regular?

987
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,287
- Whatever's cheaper.

988
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:27,288
- Okay.

989
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,968
That'll be $6, sir.

990
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:45,573
Any hot bed activity today?

991
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,875
- You don't want to know.

992
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,143
- Oh, okay.

993
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:53,548
- Have a good day.

994
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:54,415
- You too.

995
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:55,416
Gary, wait.

996
00:46:56,116 --> 00:47:01,021
I forgot you are my
100th customer and you,

997
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:04,693
you get a free group of pens.

998
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:05,794
Yes.

999
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:06,728
- What color?

1000
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:07,662
Black or blue?

1001
00:47:07,762 --> 00:47:10,064
Now I recommend choosing blue

1002
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,965
because it shows people
that you care enough

1003
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,467
to give them an original

1004
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,335
and that you like them

1005
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:15,235
unless they want a copy

1006
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:16,805
and then it would come back black anyway

1007
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:19,541
But I really do think that
blue shows that people,

1008
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:20,407
you know care.

1009
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,275
Do you care, Gary?

1010
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,176
You care, don't you?

1011
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:22,910
Which color?

1012
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,712
Black or blue or blue or black?

1013
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:24,679
- I pick blue.

1014
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,681
- Ah, I knew you'd like blue.

1015
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:30,284
You also get this.

1016
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,220
- Kittens?

1017
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,887
- Yeah.

1018
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,690
For when you're lonely.

1019
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,091
Meow.

1020
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,628
Oh, and also I need to take
a picture for my website.

1021
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:42,096
- You have a website?
- I do.

1022
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:42,764
Ready.

1023
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,331
One, two, three.

1024
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,433
Sorry.

1025
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:47,134
- Nessa.

1026
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:48,469
Come on, I'm still at work.

1027
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,204
- Gary, why don't you like me?

1028
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,206
- What?

1029
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:52,873
- I know.

1030
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,108
I am, I'm socially awkward

1031
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,910
and I'm not as pretty
as other girls, but why?

1032
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,847
I mean I'm all right, aren't I?

1033
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:00,047
- Yeah.

1034
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,183
I mean, yeah,

1035
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,252
I just,

1036
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:08,556
I just don't date.

1037
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,096
- Now it makes sense.

1038
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:18,065
Oh my God, I can't believe
I didn't see this before.

1039
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:19,166
Of course you wouldn't want people to kn

1040
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,135
you were an officer of the law.

1041
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,403
Does your, does your, does your dad know

1042
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:23,872
- Does my dad know what?

1043
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,774
- That you like to have
sex with other men.

1044
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:26,841
- Wait, what?
- I can't believe

1045
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,676
I've been throwing myself at you,

1046
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:29,811
and your probably like ugh,

1047
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,978
Nessa, vaginas gross.

1048
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,680
Not the mine's gross.

1049
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:34,348
It's actually quite lovely.

1050
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:35,048
You know what?

1051
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:38,118
Now we can be best friends.

1052
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:39,286
I can be your Grace.

1053
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,221
I love that show, "Will and Grace".

1054
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,691
Talk about waxin' private parts and boys

1055
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,959
And well, I wax my private parts.

1056
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,028
It's very important apparently, you know

1057
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:49,564
if opportunity comes a knocking.

1058
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:51,131
And actually in the gay community,

1059
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,500
you know, manscaping, it's
something that really matters.

1060
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,536
So I can show you how.

1061
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,203
- Nessa, Nessa, I'm not gay.

1062
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,045
- So I don't get to be your Grace.

1063
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,348
- No.

1064
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:13,755
- This is embarrassing.

1065
00:49:13,855 --> 00:49:16,290
You probably think I'm cookoo.

1066
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,493
- Well, I don't think you're dangerous.

1067
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:23,665
- It's probably the chemical plant.

1068
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:24,666
Yeah.

1069
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:26,266
That's making me like act like this.

1070
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:29,704
- I think everyone's taking
P172 a little too far.

1071
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:32,740
- No, because the lot
of people in this town

1072
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:35,175
are on this dating site.

1073
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,410
- You're on a dating site?

1074
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,579
- Yes.

1075
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,848
Nancy Owen said she got a
picture of a guy's penis.

1076
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:41,081
- What?
- Yeah.

1077
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:42,983
It happens a lot, I guess.

1078
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,687
- Does that work?

1079
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,020
- I mean, yeah, if you like the guy.

1080
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,322
If not, then no.

1081
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,090
- Do girls send pictures?
- Oh my God.

1082
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,893
No, it doesn't photograph well.

1083
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,093
Not that I try.

1084
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:57,030
- The site needs to be shut down.

1085
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:57,998
- Why?

1086
00:49:58,098 --> 00:49:59,934
- Nessa, lewdness and pornography

1087
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,803
is not an improvement on this town.

1088
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:03,403
- You're so handsome.

1089
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:04,204
- What?

1090
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,709
- I was asking if yoga is too lewd.

1091
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:08,776
- Yoga?

1092
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:09,644
- Oh yeah.

1093
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:10,945
You know the,

1094
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:12,914
the thing where people wear skimpy outfi

1095
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,181
and they do

1096
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:17,417
bendy positions.

1097
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:19,521
Are you okay?

1098
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:20,387
I got a book.

1099
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:21,488
I, I got a book

1100
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:23,290
and I think that it would
be good for the town.

1101
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:23,958
Yes.

1102
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,192
Good for the town,

1103
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:26,528
you know, to get--
- That's a terrible idea.

1104
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,461
- People loosen up and,

1105
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:28,897
and work on their core.
- Nessa.

1106
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:31,064
- And I mean, I really do
think it would be a good idea.

1107
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,099
It'll bring lots--

1108
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,168
- What would your parents think?

1109
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,907
- Why would you bring them into?

1110
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:40,107
- I'm sorry.

1111
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:41,876
I shouldn't have said that.

1112
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:43,645
- You know what, Gary, get out.

1113
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:46,781
Give me the kitten calendar,

1114
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:57,357
Gary why didn't you ask
me why I don't date?

1115
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,492
- What?

1116
00:50:58,593 --> 00:50:59,894
- You think I don't

1117
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:03,397
wanna be loved and kissed and touched.

1118
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:04,064
I do.

1119
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:05,667
I want that so badly.

1120
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,201
And you know how hard it is
to lose both your parents

1121
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:10,805
and have to raise your
kid brother on your own?

1122
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:13,708
- No.

1123
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:19,547
I think you're very pretty.

1124
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:21,583
But I.

1125
00:51:31,626 --> 00:51:32,527

I thought I was too old for all this.

00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:10,283
- No, no, I, I know what you mean.

1152
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:14,188
Yeah, of course the mind

1153
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:18,358
slows down and then the
body follows and well,

1154
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:21,662
then the mind tells you you're old.

00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:25,533
Yeah.

1156
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,112
Can I ask you something?

00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:39,312
- Sure.

1158

1159
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:45,052
was all that sexual stuff

1160
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:46,988
back at Mary's wake

1161
00:54:47,088 --> 00:54:49,624
before you were running out?

1162
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:50,625
- Well,

1163
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:54,529
I was a little wilder when I was younger

1164
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,230
You won't tell anybody will you?

1165
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:57,265
- Oh no.

1166
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:58,900
- That hasn't been me for a long time.

1167
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,537
And, and now I'm dancing
again after 10 years.

1168
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:06,473
I've got an idea for something
a little more sultry.

1169
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:08,509
How adventurous are you feeling?

1170
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:11,979
- Oh, I'm, I'm open for new things.

1171
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,748
- Good, I'll be right back.

1172
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:17,552
I've got something special in mind for u

1173
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:23,057
- Oh,

1174
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:26,828
please make it happen.

1175
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,529
I don't ask much,

1176
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,565
but if I ask anything,

1177
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:33,267
please don't let me get soft.

1178
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:34,735
- Did you say something?

1179
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:36,003
- Oh no, no, no.

1180
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:38,973
- I was a bit
impulsive when I was younger.

1181
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:40,308
I miss that.

1182
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:41,275
- Yeah.

1183
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:43,343
Impulsive is good.

1184
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,048
Exciting.

1185
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:52,220
- I hope I can
remember how to do this.

1186
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,090
I'm not as flexible as I used to be.

1187
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,759
- You and me both, baby.

1188
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,499
- These were always great dance moves.

1189
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:10,470
- What?

1190
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,306
- What are you doing?

1191
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:14,909
- Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm stretching.

1192
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:17,879
Yeah, you know,

1193
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:21,015
you can't stretch with your clothes on.

1194
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:23,483
Yeah, you might rip the crotch out

1195
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:26,320
and I don't wanna do that.

1196
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:29,056
Yeah, I mean, nothing against doing that

1197
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:31,424
but you should try stretching.

1198
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:34,528
It's always, it's always
something that helps you,

1199
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:35,663
particularly when you,

1200
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:37,231
when you get to be your age.

1201
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,199
You gotta keep moving.

1202
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:39,800
You gotta keep stretching.

1203
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:41,636
There.

1204
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:45,539
Now,

1205
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,011
let's have a look at that book.

1206
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:51,812
- Oh, it's,

1207
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:55,950
it's Noal's old dance book from the 90s.

1208
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,418
He was a wonderful dancer.

1209
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,655
Much better than I ever was.

1210
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,455
- Oh.

1211
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:06,928
No, I,

1212
00:57:07,028 --> 00:57:08,129
I don't really,

1213
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:12,300
I don't think I could do this, Aednat.

1214
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,001
I mean, I,

1215
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:17,772
I've never done anything
like this before, just,

1216
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:22,576
just basic dance moves.

1217
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:29,317
I mean like what's the human propeller?

1218
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:32,653
- Oh, that was Noal's favorite.

1219
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:33,421
- Oh

1220
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:35,089
yeah, well,

1221
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:36,190
all right, well,

1222
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,627
let's, let's have a look at it.

1223
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:48,336
Yeah.

1224
00:57:48,436 --> 00:57:49,537
The,

1225
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:55,209
the woman takes the first
position on the ground

1226
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:57,745
with her legs behind her head.

1227
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,781
Oh.

1228
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:04,452
And the man lays
perpendicular to the floor,

1229
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,587
stiff as a board

1230
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:09,523
with his hips balanced on her bottom

1231
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:13,327
and rotates 360 degrees.

1232
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:16,564
- Well, we don't have to do these moves.

1233
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:18,532
We can mix it up,

1234
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,868
but we can do tango or,

1235
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,103
or Foxtrot.

1236
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:25,206
We can learn it together.

1237
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,176
We're not dead yet, Fergal.

1238
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:30,211
- Yeah.

1239
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:32,079
- What have we got to lose?

1240
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:35,182
- Look, I,

1241
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:38,019
I just didn't expect this.

1242
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,022
You, you, you seem so

1243
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:44,258
quiet.

1244
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:46,560
- Well I,

1245
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:50,131
I like being with you and I,

1246
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:53,534

and all this it's,

1248
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:59,473
it's making me feel
like my old self again.

1249
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:00,674
- Yeah.

1250
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,111

- I went to the office,
but you weren't there.

1278
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:39,541
- My calls are being forwarded to my cel

1279
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,475
- But you should be at the office.

1280
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:42,710
- I didn't feel like going.

1281
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,311
I'll go in later.

1282
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:45,446
What's got into you, Gary?

1283
01:00:45,547 --> 01:00:47,381
- Did you get the email I sent you?

1284
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,617
- Yeah.

1285
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:49,551
- And?

1286
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,485
- And I am not imposing a curfew

1287
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:55,624
or posting notices around
town about proper behavior.

1288
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:56,724
- I just think it would prevent people

1289
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:57,825
from breaking the law.

1290
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:00,394
- What law is being broken?

1291
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,129
Gary, sit down.

1292
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,666
Brigid, honey, do you
have any coffee or tea?

1293
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:07,368
- Sure.

1294
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:08,769
- Gary,

1295
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:12,439
we've known each other for
the better part of 10 years.

1296
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:14,475
It's a long time.

1297
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:15,409
Yeah?

1298
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,578
- Yeah.

1299
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,778
- Yeah.

1300
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:19,548
- Yeah.

1301
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:20,714
- Yeah.

1302
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:24,852
- Jerry, if you have something
to say to me, then say it.

1303
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:27,955
- Gary, in all that time I,

1304
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:30,724
I have never seen you go out on a date.

1305
01:01:30,824 --> 01:01:33,294
You've never had a girlfriend.

1306
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:35,029
- Eric and James have come out.

1307
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:37,198
They're walking around town holding hand

1308
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:38,098
It is so adorable.

1309
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,100
- The job comes first now more than ever

1310
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:42,970
- But this town is better
than it's ever been.

1311
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:43,638
- Better?

1312
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:44,673
Are you blind.

1313
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,440
- Gary, why didn't you ask Nessa out?

1314
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,375
Everybody knows she's attracted to you.

1315
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:50,377
I don't know why.

1316
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:52,980
- Well, even your father is dating.

1317
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,648
- What?

1318
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:55,015
Who?

1319
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:56,685
- He's been giving Aednat
dancing lessons for weeks.

1320
01:01:56,784 --> 01:01:59,286
They've been spending
a lot of time together,

1321
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:01,755
if you know what I mean.

1322
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:02,990
- That doesn't mean that they're dating

1323
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,593
or that they're doing that.

1324
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:06,427
Jerry, this proposal--

1325
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,461
- Don't you miss love, Gary?

1326
01:02:07,562 --> 01:02:08,462
- Stay outta this, Brigid.

1327
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:10,464
- Don't bark at me in my own store.

1328
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:11,498
- This is why I came her.

1329
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,833
- I suppose you don't miss sex either.

1330
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:14,034
- Brigid, don't--

1331
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:15,202
- You've overstepped
your bounds, Ms. Kerry.

1332
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:16,337
- Oh, come on now.
- I'm a man of honor.

1333
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:17,438
- No, you are not.

1334
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:18,939
- I'm a man of honor who
cares more about this town

1335
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,207
than the town gossip.

1336
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:21,909
- You are a control freak and a bully.

1337
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:23,844
- Do you wanna talk about real solutions

1338
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:26,648
or do you wanna fail this
town and just dance all day?

1339
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,148
- Now you've overstepped your bounds.

1340
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:29,651
- Jerry, if you don't
wanna impose a curfew

1341
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,652
for anyone under 18,,

1342
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,986
I can't be held responsible

1343
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:34,021
when there's a hospital
full of teen pregnancies.

1344
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,823
- That's the way it was
when I was growing up.

1345
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:37,692
Maybe that's what this town needs.

1346
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:38,792
- You're insane.

1347
01:02:38,892 --> 01:02:40,227
I'm not giving up on this, Jerry.

1348
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:41,061
- I wish I had a baby.

1349
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:42,896
It would've filled a void in my life.

1350
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:44,365
- Police force.
- In your life.

1351
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:45,399
- Your fault.

1352
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:47,901
If you don't wanna rally
behind saving this town,

1353
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:49,503
then maybe I should find some residents

1354
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:50,771
who will find a mayor who will.

1355
01:02:50,871 --> 01:02:51,805
- Control yourself, man.

1356
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:53,274
Who do you think you are?

1357
01:02:53,374 --> 01:02:54,174
- I'm the law.

1358
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,043
- Yes.

1359
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:57,211
Yes.

1360
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:01,215
You are a law enforcement
officer, not a law maker.

1361
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:05,185
That son is far above your pay grade.

1362
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:07,555
Now I don't know what's
happening with you.

1363
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:09,456
Gary O'Reilly, stop.

1364
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:14,729
There has been talk around town

1365
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:17,097
that you have been abusing your power.

1366
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:21,035
You have no right to shut down the water

1367
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:24,338
Maybe you should have a drink yourself.

1368
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:25,339
Gary.

1369
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:27,676
Gary!

1370
01:03:42,524 --> 01:03:43,857
He's afraid.

1371
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,426
Of what, I don't know.

1372
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,763
Whatever it is, it has
nothing to do with this town.

1373
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:50,497
- He'd have a real breakdown

1374
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:53,601
if he knew we were planning an orgy.

Times up, get yourself together.

1390
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:36,076
- I'm not sure this tanning
lotion is the right fit for me.

1391
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:37,211
- Willy Wonka called.

1392
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:38,713
He said to go back to work.

1393
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,915
- I've got a new product in.

1394
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:43,183
Caribbean bronze.

1395
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:44,786
I can set you up with it.

1396
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:46,120
- Oh, I'd like that.

1397
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,823
- And I am not interested

1398
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:53,494
in seeing your butt print
on my new tanning bed.

1399
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:54,495
- Well.

1400
01:04:58,165 --> 01:05:00,901
- Who would've ever thought
that I would buy a tanning bed

1401
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,002
or that you could even have one

1402
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:04,071
in a place where they sell food.

1403
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:06,273
I'm gonna pick up some things

1404
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:07,776
and then I'm going over to Nessa's.

1405
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:09,577
I have to take her this plant.

1406
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:10,779
- Why?

1407
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:12,680
- It's the anniversary
of her parents passing,

1408
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:13,581
the car crash.

1409
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:14,481
- That's right.

1410
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:16,083
- It's called spathiphyllum.

1411
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:19,420
You give it to someone in
remembrance of their loved ones.

1412
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:20,822
- That's lovely.

1413
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,690
- Sytha polatitus?

1414
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:23,991
- Batachulatum.

1415
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:25,593
- Spathiphyllum.

1416
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:27,729
I won't be long.

1417
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:28,663
Will you watch things for me?

1418
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:29,664
- I will.

1419
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,207
- Hello.

1420
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:41,576
Ha ha.

1421
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:44,244
- What are you doing here?

1422
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:47,448
- I just got done with yoga and I,

1423
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:48,650
I saw some cars.

1424
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,984
I wanted know if anybody
wanted to have lunch with me?

1425
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,687
- Well, Brigid just
left out the back door.

1426
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:54,955
She's gonna give you something.

1427
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:55,824
- Oh, that's nice.

1428
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:56,691
What?

1429
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,991
- Syphilis?
- What?

1430
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:00,027
- To remind you that
your loved ones are dead.

1431
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:01,863
- What?
- Hey.

1432
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,765
- Oh hi, Stevie.

1433
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:04,965
We were just talking about how Brigid

1434
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:07,301
is gonna give your sister syphilis.

1435
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:08,302
- What, no, I.

1436
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:10,738
- It's a plant.

1437
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:12,339
We don't know how to pronounce it.

1438
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:15,242
If you hurry, you'll probably
catch her at your shop.

1439
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:15,910
- Yeah.

1440
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:22,115
Namaste.

1441
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:28,121
I'm getting there, I'm working on it.

1442
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:34,596
- Syphilis.

1443
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,633
- I know it's cheaper online,

1444
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,234
so I really appreciate this, John.

1445
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,035
I've got five other police
departments in the county

1446
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:43,638
who have agreed to buy
their office supplies

1447
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:44,471
from Nessa Ward.

1448
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:47,140
So this is really gonna help her out.

1449
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:49,443
Do me a favor though,

1450
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:51,679
don't tell her I called you about this.

1451
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:55,115
John, I gotta go.

1452
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:56,316
Thanks again.

1453
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,353
Kilnerry Sheriff's department.

1454
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:03,123
Kids wander around neighborhoods,

1455
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:04,458
that's what they do.

1456
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:11,098
Okay, I'll come check it out.

1457
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:18,071
- What's going on?

1458
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:20,842
- Are those my parents?

1459
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:22,142
- How can you tell?

1460
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,745
- Because that's a Halloween ma

1461
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:24,979
I used to wear as a kid.

1462
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:26,581
- That's so creepy.

1463
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,148
- What are you kids doing?

1464
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:30,183
Stevie.

1465
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:42,997

1478
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,547
- What is the matter, Jerry?

1479
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:07,649
- Nothing.

1480
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:09,851
Nothing is the matter.

1481
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:10,852
Nothing.

1482
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:13,121
- Nobody's ever gonna know.

1483
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,856
I don't know where this goes.

1484
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:16,223
- Yeah, it goes over here.

1485
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:18,726
You're doing great.

1486
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:21,696
- Worst swingers party ever.

1487
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:22,897
- Fergal!

1488
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:23,898
- What?

1489
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:26,934
- You weren't even
supposed to know about it.

1490
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:30,237
- Oh, like I wasn't supposed
to find out about it.

1491
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,640
I've never been to one, but I was curiou

1492
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:36,577
Everyone was supposed to
wear a mask for a anonymity,

1493
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:39,914
but how the hell are you supposed
to find a masquerade mask

1494
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,149
this time of season?

1495
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:43,383
Everything online takes
too long to get up here.

1496
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:47,187
So everyone ended up having
to take the Halloween mask

1497
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:49,289
that was left over from their grandkids.

1498
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:51,025
- You don't have grandkids?

1499
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,259
- Yeah.

1500
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:53,795
I was the one with a
paper sack on my head.

1501
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:54,896
- That was you?

1502
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:58,533
- What are you chuckling at?

1503
01:10:00,134 --> 01:10:01,401
- I'm not saying anything.

1504
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,838
- You better spill it right
now, CV Ward, right now.

1505
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:08,142
- Okay, look, it was,

1506
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:11,478
it was Colin's idea, all right.

1507
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:15,183
He found the invitation in
his mom's trash and well,

1508
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:16,416
you know, we were just curious.

1509
01:10:16,517 --> 01:10:18,218
We thought it was like a
sacrifice or something.

1510
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:19,319
- Some ways it was.

1511
01:10:19,419 --> 01:10:21,354
- Oh, you hush.

1512
01:10:21,455 --> 01:10:24,025
- Yeah, it made me feel
really uncomfortable.

1513
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,026
It's weird.

1514
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:27,895
- Jerry had a ghost mask on.

1515
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:29,731
- How did you know that was Jerry?

1516
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:31,833
- How many men his age have a tramp stam

1517
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,935
on his lower backs?

1518
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:35,770
- Hello all.

1519
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,771
- Hello!

1520
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:38,706
- Oh.
- Wow.

1521
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:42,342
- You two are gonna knock up dead tonigh

1522
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:43,578
- Did you read the Times?

1523
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:46,047
- Yes, they mentioned you and Fergal

1524
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:48,281
and the dance competition.

1525
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,084
- How did you get a copy of the Times?

1526
01:10:50,184 --> 01:10:51,185
- Oh, I have it made to me.

1527
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:53,087
It takes a week, but I get it.

1528
01:10:53,187 --> 01:10:54,387
- Ms. McLaughlin,

1529
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:56,190
you look as young as ever.

1530
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:57,525
- Oh.

1531
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,595
Well this is as good as
it's ever gonna get, Stevie.

1532
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:02,130
- Well, if you keep dancing,

1533
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,798
you have the body of a 20 year old.

1534
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:06,399
- Oh, listen to this one flirting with m

1535
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,401
It's true.

1536
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:11,572
- You know, I think I
gotta go home and study.

1537
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:12,472
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

1538
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:13,875
- All right, later everyone.

1539
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,243
- Bye.
- Bye.

1540
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:18,378
- And we are gonna talk when I get home.

1541
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:24,484
So are you nervous about tonight?

1542
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:26,319
- Well, I guess a little.

1543
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:28,523
- Well, what happened to
all that religious guilt?

1544
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:30,091
- Well, I wouldn't have done any of it

1545
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:33,227
if you hadn't been for that P172.

1546
01:11:33,326 --> 01:11:36,496
The good Lord would've
struck me down ages ago,

1547
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:40,034
but it's beyond our control.

1548
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,350
- So, the man from the EPA

1549
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,654
is going to pay us another visit.

1550
01:11:59,754 --> 01:12:00,555
- Why?

1551
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:03,257
- Yeah, we got a big success story here.

1552
01:12:03,356 --> 01:12:05,126
We're in the Times.

1553
01:12:05,226 --> 01:12:06,661
- Good evening everyone.

1554
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:07,460
- Hi, father.

1555
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:10,298
- Ah, Jerry, get the father a beer.

1556
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:11,299
- I'm busy.

1557
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:12,266
- Jerry.

1558
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:14,367
- I'll have a pint, barman.

1559
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:16,037
- You do it.

1560
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:17,772
- I don't know how.

1561
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:18,773
- Fine.

1562
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,075
I'll do it.

1563
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,677
- Hey Gary, how's it going?

1564
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:25,646
You're not still sore with me, are ya?

1565
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:27,414
I'm wearing clothes today.

1566
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:29,550
- Why wouldn't you be wearing clothes?

1567
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,418
- It's a long story.

1568
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,592
This tastes flat.

1569
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:40,528
- I've never served a
flat beer in my life.

1570
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:41,863
You wanna punch in a face?

1571
01:12:41,963 --> 01:12:43,831
- Always violence with you, isn't it me.

1572
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:44,497
- Me?

1573
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:45,465
Well, you are no saint.

1574
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:47,001
- Wait, wait, wait, who's violent?

1575
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:47,902
- This one here.

1576
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,203
- Who did you beat up?

1577
01:12:49,303 --> 01:12:51,272
- No one.
- Repent, sinner.

1578
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,075
- Don't try to intimidate
me with religion.

1579
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,244
- Son, you wanna jump in here?

1580
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:57,444
- Nope.

1581
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,447
- This man would come
into church every Sunday

1582
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:01,949
and steal holy water

1583
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,184
and take it back to his bar

1584
01:13:03,284 --> 01:13:04,952
and put it in his Shepherd's pies

1585
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,554
and call them Christ's pies.

1586
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:10,091
- Well, he would park in
my space at the office

1587
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:13,261
and walk three blocks to the church.

1588
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:14,896
You have a whole damn parking lot.

1589
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,664
- I've been upset with you for 15 years

1590
01:13:16,764 --> 01:13:17,999
for roughing up my sister.

1591
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:19,399
- What?

1592
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:20,500
- Is that true?

1593
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:22,837
- I have no idea what he's talking about

1594
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:23,905
What an earth are you talking about?

1595
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:24,572
- It's true.

1596
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:25,773
I was in high school

1597
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:27,108
and you picked up my
older sister for a date

1598
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:28,509
on your motorcycle.

1599
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:29,911
She always thought it was so cool

1600
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:33,014
to go out with a much older
guy who had a motorcycle.

1601
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,649
- She was in her 20s.

1602
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:37,218
Let's not make it could sound
like I was dating children.

1603
01:13:37,318 --> 01:13:38,519
- This hooligan picked her up,

1604
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:39,787
took her out and later that night

1605
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,622
she came home with bruises all over.

1606
01:13:41,722 --> 01:13:43,423
She refused to tell anyone what happened

1607
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,726
I swore revenge on you
that night for life.

1608
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:47,395
- I never touched your sister.

1609
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,464
- Stop it.

1610
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:55,569
- We were riding home down Carigore Road

1611
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:59,073
And I looked back to talk
to her and she was gone.

1612
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:02,276
I had stopped at a few
intersections and I,

1613
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:04,845
I just assumed she jumped off.

1614
01:14:05,646 --> 01:14:06,948
She never called me that night.

1615
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:07,748
I was devastated.

1616
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:08,983
- You didn't notice when she let go.

1617
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:11,185
- She was holding onto
the back of her seat.

1618
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:13,554
- See, so maybe when, when she got off,

1619
01:14:13,654 --> 01:14:15,523
someone else roughed her up.

1620
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,191
- And,

1621
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:20,394
is that the same Corigan Road

1622
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:23,597
that used to have all those old pot hole

1623
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:26,867
- Oh dear God.

1624
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:29,737
She must have bounced right off the back

1625
01:14:29,837 --> 01:14:31,305
- How could you not have noticed?

1626
01:14:31,405 --> 01:14:33,240
- I was facing forward.

1627
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:35,676
I'm not a damn stunt driver.

1628
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:37,945
- I didn't know you had a motorcycle.

1629
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:40,715
- She must have tumbled
right down the hill

1630
01:14:40,815 --> 01:14:42,783
and I just kept going.

1631
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:44,919
I thought for sure, I was
gonna get laid that night.

1632
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:45,653
- Animal!

1633
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:46,554
That's my sister!

1634
01:14:46,654 --> 01:14:48,389
- It didn't happen, did it?

1635
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:51,025
- See, he never touched your sister.

1636
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,560
It was an accident.

1637
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:55,863
- And you've had,

1638
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:58,599
you've had this grudge for 15 years.

1639
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:03,004
♪ We are the one ♪

1640
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,983
- Take him.
- What the?

1641
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:16,984
- Hit him.

1642
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:18,452
You can hit him.

1643
01:15:19,587 --> 01:15:20,721
- What is the matter with you?

1644
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:23,324
- What is the matter with you?

1645
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:24,759
- I just drank the water.

1646
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:25,626
- So?

1647
01:15:25,726 --> 01:15:27,395
- So I'm infected just like all of you.

1648
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:28,863
- Infected?

1649
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:30,431
- The one thing we
could count in this town

1650
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:31,866
was that these two
would always be fighting

1651
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:33,768
and now that's is gonna change too.

1652
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:35,302
You people don't get it.

1653
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:39,106
P172 has ruined this town.

1654
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,610
Look at you.

1655
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:44,712
You've changed.

1656
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,248
You've all changed.

1657
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:51,152
- I haven't.

1658
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:52,720
I'm still the same.

1659
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:54,555
- You.

1660
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,192
You're the worst out of all of them.

1661
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,761
You and your yoga nonsense.

1662
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:03,297
I can't stop thinking about you

1663
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:06,667
in your sexual provocative positions.

1664
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,002
It's not normal.

1665
01:16:08,936 --> 01:16:11,338
You're disgracing yourself
and everyone in this town.

1666
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:12,339
- Gary.

1667
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:14,909
- Your parents would be ashamed of you.

1668
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,077
- Hey enough!

1669
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:30,191
Oh, you're a real horses ass.

1670
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:33,027
Come on, Aednat.

1671
01:16:34,563 --> 01:16:36,797
We've got a competition to go to.

1672
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:39,934
Yeah, that's right.

1673
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,703
A dance competition.

1674
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:45,507
- I'll drive you.

1675
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,076
- Hey.
- Well.

1676
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:51,846
- You know, sheriff,

1677
01:16:51,946 --> 01:16:53,848
you've been so busy playing dictator

1678
01:16:53,948 --> 01:16:55,149
to everyone in this town

1679
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:56,617
that you to realize

1680
01:16:56,717 --> 01:16:58,953
that we don't need you anymore.

1681
01:16:59,053 --> 01:17:00,654
There's no crime in Kilnerry

1682
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:02,957
except for police harassment.

1683
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,860
And I for one am going to
call the governor's office

1684
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,062
first thing in the morning
to lodge a complaint

1685
01:17:08,162 --> 01:17:11,398
and maybe it's time for
the people of this town

1686
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:14,301
to petition for a new sheriff.

1687
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:18,439
- Maybe you should go, son.

1688
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:33,522
- Jerry, keys.

1689
01:17:33,622 --> 01:17:34,722
- Gary,

1690
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:36,257
keys.

1691
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,755
- Let's hear
it for Sally

1692
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:08,657
and Peter McGuire.

1693
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,257
Weren't they wonderful!

1694
01:18:14,629 --> 01:18:16,197
- You look great.

1695
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:18,832
Just remember

1696
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:20,401
to focus on your breathing

1697
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:23,337
and watch me, huh.

1698
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:27,808
- Up next, the senior
regional division competition.

1699
01:18:28,543 --> 01:18:31,445

1762
01:21:16,778 --> 01:21:17,579
We gotta to tell Aiesha.

1763
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:18,580
- She's gonna freak.

1764
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,547
Come on.

1765
01:21:54,749 --> 01:21:55,650
- Come in.

1766
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,953
- What are you still doing up?

1767
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,890
- What are you, my mother now?

1768
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,725
- Just seems a little late, that's all.

1769
01:22:03,825 --> 01:22:04,759
- I didn't feel like it.

1770
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:06,661
I'll go to bed when I'm ready.

1771
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:11,365
What, leave them there.

1772
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:13,668
- You can't leave trash
all over your house, Dad.

1773
01:22:13,768 --> 01:22:14,636
- I said, leave them.

1774
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:15,837
- What's going on with with you?

1775
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,204
- Me?

1776
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:19,106
- What, you're dancing,
you're dating, you're tanning.

1777
01:22:19,206 --> 01:22:20,374
- Leave me alone.

1778
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:22,142
I'm happy.

1779
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:24,612
I wanna be happy before I die.

1780
01:22:25,713 --> 01:22:26,748
- Is that what this is about?

1781
01:22:26,848 --> 01:22:28,382
You think you're gonna die.

1782
01:22:29,717 --> 01:22:30,618
- One day?

1783
01:22:31,418 --> 01:22:33,788
You can keep you from dying son,

1784
01:22:33,888 --> 01:22:35,989
but you can keep me from living.

1785
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:40,127
- If mom were alive,

1786
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:41,295
she'd say you were acting crazy.

1787
01:22:41,395 --> 01:22:43,363
- Yeah, but she's not here.

1788
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,902
She's been dead for a long time.

1789
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:50,003
- Yeah, I know mom's dead, dad.

1790
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:52,907
- I loved your mom

1791
01:22:53,006 --> 01:22:54,341
with every ounce of me.

1792
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:57,077
Yeah, but,

1793
01:22:58,412 --> 01:22:59,446
when she died,

1794
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:01,516
I stopped living.

1795
01:23:05,018 --> 01:23:07,321
Maybe I stopped being a good father too.

1796
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:08,523
- Stop.

1797
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:10,023
- But she,

1798
01:23:10,123 --> 01:23:12,092
she would want me to be happy.

1799
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,029
I even joined a new dating app.

1800
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:17,130
- Yeah, I saw.

1801
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:20,869
- Yeah, Aednat and I, we enjoy each othe

1802
01:23:20,969 --> 01:23:22,570
but we're not exclusive.

1803
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:23,638
Not yet.

1804
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:28,510
It's a very sexy name, that app.

1805
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,611
Grinder.

1806
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:32,614
Not a lot of women on that thing.

1807
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:34,516
Just a lot of polite men.

1808
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,684
It's weird how they,

1809
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:38,553
they keep calling me daddy.

1810
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:39,219
- Dad.

1811
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:40,420
- And for some reason,

1812
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:42,524
they think I must own a
scrapyard or something

1813
01:23:42,624 --> 01:23:46,026
because they keep asking
for pictures are my junk.

1814
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:49,096
And I send them pictures
of our old jalopy out back

1815
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:51,398
and things in the garage, but

1816
01:23:52,132 --> 01:23:53,701
they never write back.

1817
01:23:54,802 --> 01:23:56,470
You know what,

1818
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:58,038
my junk maybe,

1819
01:23:58,138 --> 01:23:59,908
maybe worn and beat up, but it,

1820
01:24:00,008 --> 01:24:02,276
it's still worth something.

1821
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,377
Yeah, they can, they can,

1822
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:06,380
they can stick it straight up their asse

1823
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,717
- Dad, Grinder's a gay dating app.

1824
01:24:10,885 --> 01:24:11,786
- Huh?

1825
01:24:13,153 --> 01:24:14,221
- Forget it.

1826
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,538
- You remember when you were

1827
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:33,273
sleeping in the hall of
that hospital for two weeks

1828
01:24:33,373 --> 01:24:35,175
when your mother was dying?

1829
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,879
You must have been all of 18,

1830
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:41,549
too young for a boy to
be losing his mother.

1831
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:45,687
I was falling apart, but you,

1832
01:24:46,854 --> 01:24:47,789
you were the rock.

1833
01:24:49,057 --> 01:24:52,794
Keeping me up and yelling at
all the doctors and nurses.

1834
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,030
And before she,

1835
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:57,431
she was sick,

1836
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,369
you saved money to go
backpacking across Europe,

1837
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,640
wanted to be an architect.

1838
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,475
- Well, I had to stay
here and take care of you.

1839
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:11,846
- Don't you put that on me.

1840
01:25:13,715 --> 01:25:14,616
You just,

1841
01:25:15,717 --> 01:25:16,918
you stopped living.

1842
01:25:17,018 --> 01:25:18,218
Why?

1843
01:25:18,318 --> 01:25:20,989
Just because you're wanted to save her.

1844
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:21,956
- I was just some dumb kid.

1845
01:25:22,056 --> 01:25:23,725
What did I know?

1846
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,125
- No, you weren't.

1847
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:27,194
You're the bravest kid I know.

1848
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,130
You just gave up.

1849
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,498
That's what you did.

1850
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:33,300
And now you're just right
up and down these streets

1851
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,335
trying to make everybody the same becaus

1852
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,038
because change scares you.

1853
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:37,905
I see it.

1854
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:39,139
I get it.

1855
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:39,774
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1856
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:40,675
- Yes I do!

1857
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:44,679
And you're pushing everyone away from yo

1858
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:46,380
Like you are a coward

1859
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:49,717
and that's not you.

1860
01:25:51,151 --> 01:25:53,253
And if you don't come to terms

1861
01:25:53,353 --> 01:25:56,090
with what you're doing,
you're always gonna be alone.

1862
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:58,225
I love you son.

1863
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:03,665
But you're the only
one that can stop this.

1864
01:26:04,364 --> 01:26:06,166
- What am I supposed to do?

1865
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:07,334
Just ignore what everyone's doing.

1866
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:09,236
Let 'em do whatever they want.

1867
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:10,772
- You'll figure it out.

1868
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,541
You're a smart kid.

1869
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:18,780
Now you gotta go.

1870
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:26,420
I ordered the spice channel.

1871
01:26:27,588 --> 01:26:28,990
An old man

1872
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:31,391
and young sluts is about to start.

1873
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:32,994
- I didn't need to hear that.

1874
01:26:33,094 --> 01:26:35,830
- Why do you think I have
newspapers all over the floor?

1875
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,831
- Oh geez.

1876
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:46,273

1919
01:28:50,832 --> 01:28:53,835
Welcome to another
quarterly town hall meeting

1920
01:28:53,935 --> 01:28:55,303
in lovely Kilnerry.

1921
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,972
There have been a lot of exciting change

1922
01:28:58,072 --> 01:28:59,372
since our last meeting, yeah.

1923
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,580
Oh, I see some new smiling faces.

1924
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,115
The, the, the gray clouds are parted

1925
01:29:08,216 --> 01:29:10,318
and it's gonna be a beautiful summer

1926
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:14,055
and we're booming now baby!

1927
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:21,461
Now, as you know,

1928
01:29:21,562 --> 01:29:23,865
my dear friend Rakesh

1929
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:27,568
from the Environmental Protection Agency

1930
01:29:27,668 --> 01:29:29,502
has come back to speak to us.

1931
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:34,041
He says he has some good news for us.

1932
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:36,010
Let's bring him up.

1933
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,011
- Yay!

1934
01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:41,414
- Wow.

1935
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:45,052
Thank you.

1936
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:46,486
This is a pretty different welcome

1937
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:48,856
compared to the last
time I was here, right?

1938
01:29:48,956 --> 01:29:52,459
Thank you all for being so, so gracious.

1939
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:56,697
I've been reading about
you guys in the Times.

1940
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:59,700
And Jerry has told me about
all the amazing things

1941
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,168
that have been happening here.

1942
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:03,070
And gosh, I, I gotta admit

1943
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:06,173
I was not excited to
come here that first time

1944
01:30:06,274 --> 01:30:08,242
when I had to break the news

1945
01:30:08,342 --> 01:30:10,711
about the potential side effects of P172

1946
01:30:10,811 --> 01:30:15,016
which is why I am so
excited to be back here now,

1947
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:15,883
to tell you.

1948
01:30:15,983 --> 01:30:18,085
- What did I miss?

1949
01:30:18,185 --> 01:30:19,020
- Well, the rats that we got

1950
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,221
for the original--

1951
01:30:20,321 --> 01:30:21,255
- Don't shush me.

1952
01:30:21,355 --> 01:30:22,623
I shush you.

1953
01:30:22,723 --> 01:30:24,325
- Right, so what I had to say

1954
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:25,793
was I'm excited to tell you--

1955
01:30:25,893 --> 01:30:26,527
- I shush you.

1956
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:28,329
That's what I do.

1957
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,071
I shush you!

1958
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:40,408
- Wow.

1959
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:41,943
I really missed you guys.

1960
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:46,514
So anyways, the rats that we conducted

1961
01:30:46,614 --> 01:30:49,884
the original P172 study on,

1962
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,754
they were all contaminated
before we got them.

1963
01:30:53,854 --> 01:30:56,456
They were in another department

1964
01:30:56,557 --> 01:30:58,559
being tested on pheromones.

1965
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:01,295
- Does that mean we're not
helping the environment?

1966
01:31:01,395 --> 01:31:04,098
- No, you are helping the environment.

1967
01:31:04,198 --> 01:31:06,233
I'm just saying that

1968
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:09,502
P172 has no side effects.

1969
01:31:09,603 --> 01:31:12,206
- But I was out of control.

1970
01:31:12,306 --> 01:31:13,674
- Just look outside

1971
01:31:13,774 --> 01:31:15,609
and you'll see that the animals

1972
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:17,912
are not fornicating each other to death.

1973
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:20,848
They, they're acting completely normal.

1974
01:31:21,582 --> 01:31:22,616
- I shush you.

1975
01:31:22,717 --> 01:31:24,385
- Not now darling.

1976
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:26,287
None of this is real.

1977
01:31:26,387 --> 01:31:29,023
P172 is fake.

1978
01:31:29,657 --> 01:31:31,993
All those things we did,

1979
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:33,661
we did on our own.

1980
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:35,796
Oh, I feel so ashamed.

1981
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:39,834
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1982
01:31:39,934 --> 01:31:43,637
- We mortgaged the house
to build a dungeon,

1983
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:47,041
all the leather toys and butt plugs.

1984
01:31:52,813 --> 01:31:54,448
- Look, I know this is
hitting all hard now--

1985
01:31:54,548 --> 01:31:55,649
- Shut up, Gary.

1986
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,052
It isn't about you right now.

1987
01:31:58,152 --> 01:31:59,820
I'm going to hell.

1988
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,490
- You damn sons of bitches.

1989
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:04,525
We must be a laughing stock to you.

1990
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,527
You and the whole lot of
you back in Washington,

1991
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:07,962
laughing at us.

1992
01:32:08,062 --> 01:32:11,532
Yeah, thinking we're we're
under some, some goddamn spell.

1993
01:32:11,632 --> 01:32:13,067
- We'll sue them.

1994
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:16,670
- No, I would not suggest
that these private companies

1995
01:32:16,771 --> 01:32:19,206
have millions that they put into lobbyin

1996
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:22,643
and they have politicians
in their pockets.

1997
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:24,578
They have teams of lawyers

1998
01:32:24,678 --> 01:32:27,581
that could bankrupt this entire town.

1999
01:32:27,681 --> 01:32:29,717
Things are just not the
way they used to be.

2000
01:32:29,817 --> 01:32:31,886
- We were in the Times

2001
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:33,287
on the internet.

2002
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:34,523
- I just think--

2003
01:32:34,622 --> 01:32:36,757
- My face is the face
they're going to show

2004
01:32:36,857 --> 01:32:39,293
when they talk about
what fools we've been.

2005
01:32:39,393 --> 01:32:40,227
- Everyone, please.

2006
01:32:40,327 --> 01:32:42,263
- Not now, Gary.

2007
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:45,399
You've got the rest of your
life to rub our noses in this.

2008
01:32:45,499 --> 01:32:46,333
- I don't wanna--

2009
01:32:46,434 --> 01:32:47,868
- I'm not sorry for any of it.

2010
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:49,670
- What?

2011
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:52,873
- I'm not sorry for any of it.

2012
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:53,607
I'm not.

2013
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:54,975
- What do you mean?

2014
01:32:55,609 --> 01:32:58,045
- P172 or not,

2015
01:32:59,613 --> 01:33:00,714
I love you.

2016
01:33:03,117 --> 01:33:04,553
I am a fool.

2017
01:33:04,652 --> 01:33:06,654
And now the world knows.

2018
01:33:08,122 --> 01:33:09,356
I don't care.

2019
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:13,094
All I care is about

2020
01:33:14,563 --> 01:33:15,663
you,

2021
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,665
Brigid love.

2022
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:19,934
- Oh Jerry.

2023
01:33:28,876 --> 01:33:30,344
- Listen, everybody.

2024
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,313
However you're feeling right now,

2025
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:33,681
just give it some time.

2026
01:33:33,781 --> 01:33:35,282
It'll blow over.

2027
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:36,884
- Blow over.

2028
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:40,821
Some of us have a lot more years
behind us than ahead of us.

2029
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:44,658
Oh, well for some of
us, it's a dying legacy

2030
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:46,528
being a punch line.

2031
01:33:46,627 --> 01:33:48,295
- Let's calm down and remember

2032
01:33:48,395 --> 01:33:50,331
we're in the house of the Lord.

2033
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,034
We're all responsible for our own action

2034
01:33:54,869 --> 01:33:56,605
No one in this room is being judged.

2035
01:33:56,704 --> 01:33:58,706
Only God can do that.

2036
01:33:58,806 --> 01:34:02,343
No one here acted out to spite God.

2037
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:05,279
You all acted in a manner
that made you happy

2038
01:34:05,379 --> 01:34:07,281
or made you express love.

2039
01:34:07,948 --> 01:34:11,886
For some fornicating was a
way of breaking down walls

2040
01:34:11,986 --> 01:34:14,255
and allowing yourself to feel love again

2041
01:34:15,422 --> 01:34:19,193
I too had to come to terms with
wanting to be closer to God

2042
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:21,929
in the image that he made me,

2043
01:34:23,664 --> 01:34:24,798
which is why

2044
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,269
I have become a nudist.

2045
01:34:33,642 --> 01:34:35,442
- Okay, it was great
to see you guys again.

2046
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:37,044
Have a good one.

2047
01:34:37,711 --> 01:34:39,180
- It's not sexual.

2048
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,515
It's not sinful.

2049
01:34:40,615 --> 01:34:42,349
It's just the way God made me.

2050
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:46,253
You all inspired this courageous leap.

2051
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,022
- Nice penis, Wesley.

2052
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,090
- Hey.

2053
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,293
- Babe, I'm just looking.

2054
01:34:52,393 --> 01:34:53,093
Just looking.

2055
01:34:53,194 --> 01:34:56,096
- I have something to add here too.

2056
01:34:58,065 --> 01:35:00,234
It wasn't too long ago that

2057
01:35:01,335 --> 01:35:02,770
I was pretty lonely.

2058
01:35:04,606 --> 01:35:07,808
We'd pass one another and say hi,

2059
01:35:09,009 --> 01:35:12,313
but otherwise we wouldn't
bother one another.

2060
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:14,782
And these last three months,

2061
01:35:14,882 --> 01:35:19,019
there's not a day that's
gone by that not one of you

2062
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,455
hasn't been part of my life.

2063
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:25,759
I've never felt so loved.

2064
01:35:27,161 --> 01:35:27,861
And I will,

2065
01:35:27,962 --> 01:35:31,232
I will not let anyone cheapen that

2066
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,169
or shame the people that I love

2067
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:40,474
and respect.

2068
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:47,748
- I was wrong, dad.

2069
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,951
I was wrong.

2070
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:56,490
Let me ask you people something.

2071
01:35:56,591 --> 01:35:58,759
Have I ever been unfair?

2072
01:35:58,859 --> 01:35:59,893
By the constraints of the law,

2073
01:35:59,994 --> 01:36:02,229
have I ever been unfair?

2074
01:36:02,329 --> 01:36:03,230
Blake?

2075
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:04,999
Margaret?

2076
01:36:05,099 --> 01:36:06,066
Anyone?

2077
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:11,805
I just always knew what
to expect from this town.

2078
01:36:13,107 --> 01:36:15,409
I protect the people I love.

2079
01:36:16,176 --> 01:36:17,478
Even when that means pointing out

2080
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:18,479
when I think you're doing things

2081
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,114
against your better judgment.

2082
01:36:20,214 --> 01:36:22,850
- That's not for you to decide.

2083
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:26,053
Oh, I know you look at me
and you see an old woman.

2084
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:28,022
Well, I can't help these wrinkles

2085
01:36:28,122 --> 01:36:29,857
or that I move a little slower.

2086
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:34,562
Inside, I'm the same woman
I was before you were born.

2087
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:36,363
- Just let me finish.

2088
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:37,364
I.

2089
01:36:39,768 --> 01:36:41,235
I was just trying to.

2090
01:36:48,242 --> 01:36:49,410
You gotta know

2091
01:36:50,244 --> 01:36:52,313
that it came from a right place.

2092
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:56,083
No matter how misguided it was,

2093
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:59,554
maybe I was a horse's ass.

2094
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:01,889
You,

2095
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:05,025
you people have no idea how
important you are to me.

2096
01:37:07,394 --> 01:37:08,295
I'm sorry.

2097
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:14,536
I'm not gonna stop
upholding the law either.

2098
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:19,239
But I will try and be a better friend.

2099
01:37:20,908 --> 01:37:23,477
- I don't accept your
apology, Sheriff O'Reilly.

2100
01:37:24,345 --> 01:37:26,113
You don't just get to say you're sorry

2101
01:37:26,213 --> 01:37:28,550
and expect everything to be fine.

2102
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,117
You hurt people.

2103
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:33,354
And some cuts are deeper than others.

2104
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:35,989
And we just got some very
shocking news yet again,

2105
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,991
and you're making it about you.

2106
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:39,993
So I am gonna go home

2107
01:37:40,094 --> 01:37:42,496
and I am gonna think about
how this makes me feel.

2108
01:37:42,597 --> 01:37:47,267
And I will not be thinking about
you or your rock hard body.

2109
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:50,437
I said it out loud.

2110
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,850
- If there's nothing else,

2111
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:04,051
let's call it a night.

2112
01:38:04,151 --> 01:38:07,522
As always, the bar is open,

2113
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:10,224
but whatever you decide to do,

2114
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:11,559
please

2115
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:12,560
be safe.

2116
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,839
- Hey Gary.

2117
01:38:25,573 --> 01:38:28,976
How'd you like those gnomes
I left in your front yard?

2118
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:53,233
- I'm proud of you son.

2119
01:38:54,769 --> 01:38:55,670
Come on.

2120
01:38:57,906 --> 01:38:58,939
I'll buy you a pint.

2121
01:39:21,161 --> 01:39:23,297
- And you promise me that
you are gonna call me,

2122
01:39:23,397 --> 01:39:24,364
give your room number so
I can send you a surprise.

2123
01:39:24,465 --> 01:39:25,232
- Yes.

2124
01:39:25,332 --> 01:39:27,167
Yes sis, I'll text you everything.

2125
01:39:27,267 --> 01:39:28,536
I thought they sell supplies there.

2126
01:39:28,636 --> 01:39:30,905
- I wanna be able to send
you highlighters and pens.

2127
01:39:31,004 --> 01:39:32,973
And do you need protractor?

2128
01:39:33,073 --> 01:39:34,007
- What?

2129
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:41,950
- What are you looking for?

2130
01:39:42,049 --> 01:39:43,718
- Sheriff O'Reilly.

2131
01:39:43,818 --> 01:39:45,720
- Why are you looking for him?

2132
01:39:46,688 --> 01:39:48,890
- Well, he said that he
would say goodbye to me

2133
01:39:48,989 --> 01:39:49,958
before I left.

2134
01:39:50,057 --> 01:39:51,726
And I haven't really seen him all week.

2135
01:39:51,826 --> 01:39:53,728
- I wouldn't expect too much from him.

2136
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:54,863
- Look, he's not a bad guy.

2137
01:39:54,963 --> 01:39:56,196
You just gotta give him a chance.

2138
01:39:56,296 --> 01:39:57,665
- Stevie please--
- Look, he really likes, you.

2139
01:39:57,765 --> 01:39:58,566
- No, he doesn't.

2140
01:39:58,666 --> 01:39:59,601
- But he's a great guy--

2141
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:00,768
- Stevie, stop, stop.

2142
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,604
- Give him a chance.
- Stop.

2143
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:05,372
Just stop.

2144
01:40:06,808 --> 01:40:08,643
I'm gonna be alone and that's fine.

2145
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:19,019
- Look, I'll come over
for summer and holidays

2146
01:40:20,187 --> 01:40:21,890
and I'll talk to you on the
phone all the time, okay.

2147
01:40:24,759 --> 01:40:26,159
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

2148
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,530
Okay, I love you sis.

2149
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:29,831
- I love you too.

2150
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:38,238
Mom and dad would be really proud.

2151
01:40:46,781 --> 01:40:47,549
- Hey, what's up.

2152
01:40:49,751 --> 01:40:50,785
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

2153
01:40:50,885 --> 01:40:51,986
How's it going?

2154
01:41:04,298 --> 01:41:05,967
Hey, Sheriff O'Reilly.

2155
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:07,167
Hey.

2156
01:41:07,835 --> 01:41:09,069
Just give me one second, one second.

2157
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:10,004
I'm gonna go grab Nessa.

2158
01:41:10,103 --> 01:41:10,805
She's on the other side, okay.

2159
01:41:10,905 --> 01:41:11,806
Hold on.

2160
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:15,777
Hey, he's on the other side.
- What are you?

2161
01:41:15,877 --> 01:41:16,844
- Just talk to him.

2162
01:41:16,945 --> 01:41:18,046
- Are you okay?

2163
01:41:18,145 --> 01:41:18,913
What?

2164
01:41:19,013 --> 01:41:20,213
Wait, Stevie.

2165
01:41:20,314 --> 01:41:22,215
Just call me later.

2166
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:37,497
- You just missed him.

2167
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:39,166
- Actually, we saw each
other through the window.

2168
01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:41,168
We, we set our goodbyes.

2169
01:41:43,638 --> 01:41:45,372
I thought I'd come by--
- I have dates.

2170
01:41:45,472 --> 01:41:48,375
I mean, I have to go on a date.

2171
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:49,043
- Oh.

2172
01:41:49,142 --> 01:41:49,978
- Yes.

2173
01:41:50,078 --> 01:41:53,246
I signed up for that dating app.

2174
01:41:53,347 --> 01:41:54,381
- Congratulations.

2175
01:41:54,481 --> 01:41:55,817
- Thank you, I've moved on and I have

2176
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:59,921
a lot of men that are sending
me picture of their dicks.

2177
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:01,121
Dick pics.

2178
01:42:01,221 --> 01:42:02,724
Little dicks, big dicks,
all kinds of dicks--

2179
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:03,591
- Nessa--
- Why would you

2180
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:04,458
say those things to me?

2181
01:42:04,559 --> 01:42:05,660
- You know why.

2182
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,728
- No.

2183
01:42:06,828 --> 01:42:07,895
You're an awful person.

2184
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:08,930
- It's not because I meant them.

2185
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:10,163
It's 'cause I was trying to hurt you.

2186
01:42:10,263 --> 01:42:11,032
- Why would you wanna hurt me?

2187
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:12,000
- Because you terrify me.

2188
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,301
Why do I terrify you?

2189
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:16,771
- Because I'm absolutely

2190
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:18,640
in every possible way

2191
01:42:19,272 --> 01:42:20,842
in love with you.

2192
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:23,477
- What?

2193
01:42:23,578 --> 01:42:25,880
- You don't terrify me anymore.

2194
01:42:38,726 --> 01:42:40,227
- I terrify you?

2195
01:42:40,995 --> 01:42:41,896
- Uh huh.

2196
01:42:58,012 --> 01:42:59,047
There's one more thing.

2197
01:42:59,147 --> 01:43:00,048
- What?

2198
01:43:00,915 --> 01:43:03,117
- I think I'm gonna
open up a dance studio.

2199
01:43:03,751 --> 01:43:05,520
- What do you know about dance?

2200
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,922
- Mom and dad might have
showed me one or two things

2201
01:43:08,022 --> 01:43:11,224
and there might be room
enough for your yoga studio.

2202
01:43:11,324 --> 01:43:12,492
- Well, Sheriff O'Reilly,

2203
01:43:12,593 --> 01:43:14,829
I don't know what to say.

2204
01:43:16,831 --> 01:43:19,199
So you love me, huh?

2205
01:43:19,299 --> 01:43:20,200
- You making fun of me?

2206
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,070
- No, you got moves.

2207
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:23,303
Moves, moves, moves.

2208
01:43:23,403 --> 01:43:24,605

- We're really worried.

2234
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,188
- All right, I got this.

2235
01:45:20,288 --> 01:45:21,789
Just go back in your homes.

2236
01:45:41,108 --> 01:45:43,376
Jim, Carol it's Gary O'Reilly.

2237
01:46:15,543 --> 01:46:17,111
Freeze, Kilnerry police!

2238
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:28,155
- Looks like we got
ourselves another slave.

2239
01:46:36,264 --> 01:46:37,164
- Just,

2240
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:40,167
just keep it down next time.

2241
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:41,769
- Sure thing, sheriff.

2242
01:46:41,869 --> 01:46:44,672
Hey, but if you ever feel like
bringing your handcuffs by

2243
01:46:44,772 --> 01:46:47,775
and play, you know where to find us.
