NARRATOR: The
 following dramatization

3
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,430
is based on personal interviews,
 books, newspapers, magazine

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,130
accounts, and the reports of
 the Presidential Commission

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,200
and the House Committee on
 the Challenger accident.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,450
This picture was researched
 with the consultation

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,120
of the National Aeronautics
 and Space Administration

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,220
and was filmed at the
 Johnson Space Center

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,650
and at Clear Lake, Texas.

11
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
Hello.

12
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,070
I'm Christa McAuliffe,
 talking to you

13
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,580
from the flight deck of the
 space shuttle Challenger.

14
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,530
We're in orbit now and
 we've just stowed our seats.

15
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,410
Since we're weightless, we won't
 be bolting them back in again

16
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,720
until our return to Earth.

17
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,180
Let me tell you being
 launched into space

18
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,630
is every bit as thrilling
 as they said it would be.

19
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,330
When those main engines
 ignite, and right

20
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,280
after them the solid
 rocket boosters

21
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,800
and you're just hurled
 upwards, well, it's

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,480
something unusual in this
 school teacher's life.

23
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,510
By the time the shuttle
 reaches the top of the tower,

24
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,970
you're going 100 miles an hour.

25
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,250
Two minutes later,
 you're leaving the earth

26
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,560
at 3,000 miles an hour.

27
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,790
3,312.5.

28
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,750
I knew that.

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,800
She's within 10%.

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,250
That's good enough
 for high school.

31
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,710
Not in my class.

32
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,850
I'll vouch for that.

33
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,310
I watch her correct
 her homework papers.

34
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,310
All right, class,
 order, order.

35
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,870
Please, Christa, go on.

36
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,910
Now I'd like you
 to meet our crew.

37
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,460
This is the flight deck and
 on my left is our commander

38
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,570
Richard Scobee.

39
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,330
We call him Scobe.

40
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,010
He's one of the few enlisted
 men to have become an astronaut,

41
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,310
and we're very proud
 that he's our commander.

42
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,690
Boy, look at those
 lovebirds holding hands.

43
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,450
Frightening.

44
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,240
Don't make fun of romance,
 honey, or I'll go and knock you

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,640
upside your head,
 dear country boy.

46
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,820
Well?

47
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,720
Come on, let her rehearse.

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,260
Well, who's next, Christa?

49
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,920
On my right is my
 husband Stephen McAuliffe.

50
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,320
He'll be-- oh, no, honey,
 you won't be on the flight.

51
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,750
I'll be home doing
 the breakfast dishes.

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,450
Wait a minute.

53
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,300
Let's put some order into this.

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,450
The man really on her right
 will be our pilot Michael Smith.

55
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,680
And I'm Judy Resnick,
 the flight engineer.

56
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,380
And she sits right
 behind Scobe and me

57
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,300
and during the ascent phase
 and on our return to Earth,

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,200
she watches us to make sure
 that we do everything right,

59
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,180
and everybody else watches her.

60
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,480
Except you, I'm sure.

61
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,010
Except me, of course.

62
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm always looking
 over at you, hon.

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,020
I'm getting to like
 this role, Christa.

64
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,390
You play the flight engineer.

65
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,920
Take it, JR.

66
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,550
And now, from the coffee
 fields of the Kona coast,

67
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,530
one of the macadamia nuts--

68
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,860
And the man who still thinks
 I shouldn't be on this mission.

69
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,640
That's right.

70
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
What do you have
 against us teachers, El?

71
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
Hey, nothing against teachers.

72
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,430
Hey, wait, let
 me introduce him.

73
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,970
Mission specialist,
 Ellison Onizuka.

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,090
Come on, El, give us
 your deepest thoughts.

75
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,080
You'll feel better.

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,900
Well, we just scrubbed
 for the second time.

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,730
Why?

78
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,060
Because the shuttle is the most
 complicated machine ever built.

79
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,960
You know, they call it
 operational, but it isn't.

80
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,070
It's still experimental.

81
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm going whatever they
 call it, so move over, El.

82
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,580
And if it's experimental,
 only professional astronauts

83
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,100
should be flying it,
 which doesn't mean I

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,780
won't enjoy going with Christa.

85
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,750
What about me, El?

86
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,150
Glad to be flying with me?

87
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh, no, you're too
 much of an achiever.

88
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,520
You've got all these
 doctorates from MIT.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,290
Hey, what are you, a pineapple
 picker from Kealakekua?

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,590
All right, let's get
 back on track here.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,050
NASA's number one
 laser physicist,

92
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,030
the man who launched
 our Spartan satellite

93
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,680
to photograph Halley's comet--

94
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,170
And the sweetest sax
 player this side of Mars.

95
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,970
Mission specialist,
 Ron McNair.

96
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,090
And don't forget, El,
 black belt in karate.

97
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,050
Show him, honey.

98
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,060
Kick some butt.

99
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,860
And finally, from
 Hughes Aircraft,

100
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,660
my fellow outsider on
 the flight, Greg Jarvis.

101
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
That's my hero.

102
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
All right, Christa,
 that was perfect chaos.

103
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,940
Flawless, actually.

104
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,640
You'll be fine when you
 do it from space tomorrow.

105
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,350
I wish we didn't have
 to wait until tomorrow.

106
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,670
I could go out right
 now and get on board.

107
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,210
Well, I wouldn't quite yet.

108
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,750
The way I see this weather, none
 of us will be flying tomorrow.

109
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,820
I know everybody's
 a little frustrated.

110
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,730
It's our fourth scrub
 in the last month,

111
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,860
but let's work on a
 quick turnaround, huh?

112
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Any contractor see any change
 in their flight readiness?

113
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,710
Uh-uhn.

114
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,280
No.

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,590
OK.

116
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,390
Let's schedule launch for
 0938 tomorrow morning.

117
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,460
Now, very important,
 extremely cold

118
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,840
temperatures, into the low 20s,
 have been forecast for tonight.

119
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,490
How will this
 affect each of you?

120
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,340
Lockheed?

121
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,230
If temperatures get
 down to the low 20s,

122
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,970
we'll have a hard
 freeze for sure.

123
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,250
We've never launched at
 anything close to that.

124
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll have to get more
 information, Arnie.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,170
Rockwell?

126
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,390
We need to figure these
 temperatures into our data,

127
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,890
but it looks possible.

128
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,090
Larry?

129
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,560
Oh, I can't give
 a definite yet.

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,030
I want to find out
 if this kind of cold

131
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,590
would trigger a
 violation of the launch

132
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,170
commit criteria on the
 solid rocket boosters.

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,690
All right.

134
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,690
Jesse and I will be
 in the ops center.

135
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,410
Lewis, get me the firing room.

136
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,110
Right.

137
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,810
Right, Arnie.

138
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,590
24 hour turnaround,
 go with a soft count.

139
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,290
Right, Gene.

140
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:47,720
4, 3, 2, and--

141
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,850
there it goes, folks.

[CHEERING]

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,970
Wondering what it's going
 to be like up there, Christa?

145
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,780
No, I was back in the past.

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,350
Six months ago, the
 day I was chosen.

147
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,420
I was a small town
 schoolteacher.

148
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,750
The closest I'd ever
 been to flying anything

149
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,780
was the coach section
 of an airliner.

150
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,030
I never could have imagined
 that I'd be here now the night

151
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,510
before a launch,
 all of us having

152
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,210
become the family that we are.

153
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,050
Any of you remember what
 you were doing July 19th?

154
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,810
Sweating.

155
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,580
That's the main thing you
 do in Houston on July 19th.

156
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,430
I think Lorna was giving
 me problems on July 19th,

157
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,200
but that could
 have been any day.

158
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
What were you
 remembering, Christa?

159
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,620
I'd rather hear what
 you were doing back then.

160
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,840
No, we'll catch up with you.

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,900
Come on.

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,600
Come on.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Well, it was an
 absolutely crazy morning.

164
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
NASA had brought all 10 of
 us finalists to Washington,

165
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,440
and the winner was
 going to be announced

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,260
at a ceremony at
 the White House,

167
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,930
but we wanted to
 know ahead of time.

168
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,600
We didn't want to find out at
 the same moment as the rest

169
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,020
of the country, but Ann
 Bradley was in charge

170
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,580
and she absolutely
 would not tell us.

171
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,720
It's out of my
 control, everyone.

172
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,790
The White House will
 administer floggings

173
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,140
if the winner's name leaks.

174
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,940
They're acting like this is
 a national security issue.

175
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,140
Ann, I think what you should
 do is call the White House

176
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,900
and tell them that the teachers
 aren't coming unless we know

177
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,580
in advance who the winner is.

178
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,680
Yes, now you're talking.

179
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,270
I think that's a great idea.

180
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,580
You absolutely
 cannot tell anyone.

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,280
OK, we got.

182
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,130
I mean it.

183
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,190
All right, all right.

184
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,050
Come on.

185
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,250
I'll tell you at
 the end of lunch.

186
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,570
What do your kids think?

187
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,540
My kids are a little too
 young to understand their mother

188
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,400
wanting to go up into space.

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,620
I mean, how do they explain
 that to their friends?

190
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,680
Well, how's your
 husband holding up?

191
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,380
It's rough.

192
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,080
He says he's writing an
 article on child management

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,140
through the massive
 use of cornflakes.

194
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,390
Better tell him to stock up on
 a lot more cornflakes, Christa.

195
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,290
Excuse me?

196
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,580
You're going.

197
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,270
You're the one
 going up in space.

198
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,390
Christa, I am
 so happy for you.

199
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,660
So sad for me, but--

200
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,720
It's terrible we cannot be
 going up in space together.

201
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
And Barbara Morgan
 is the alternate.

202
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,140
And I might as well
 spill everything.

203
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,250
The rest of you will be
 employed by NASA for a year.

204
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,150
Christa.

205
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Do you realize?

206
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't.

207
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't.

208
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,380
It just doesn't seem possible.

209
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,640
You're actually
 going into space.

210
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,890
You think there
 will be a recount?

211
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,490
Christa, even if there were a
 recount, you'd still win again.

212
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,040
It's not often that a
 teacher is at a loss for words.

213
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
I know my students would agree.

214
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,680
I've made nine wonderful
 friends in the last two weeks,

215
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:45,950
and when that shuttle goes
 there might be one body,

216
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,580
but there's going to be 10
 souls I'm taking with me.

217
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,280
Thank you.

218
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,120
We'll only practice
 about an hour today, Scobe.

219
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,760
Why is that?

220
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,450
The other aircraft
 in maintenance,

221
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,470
so this one's on overload.

222
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,090
Weren't you scheduled to
 get another landing trainer?

223
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,370
We keep asking and
 they keep promising.

224
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,270
Still looking for a
 January launch, Scobe?

225
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,340
They don't change payload
 or add a congressman.

226
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,710
I think I'm going to go even
 if no one else is ready.

227
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,410
I agree.

228
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,810
You're ready for a real one.

229
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,910
What number is this?

230
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,750
You got it there?

231
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,330
Yes, sir.

232
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,050
You're getting close
 to your 900th shuttle

233
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,700
landing rehearsal, Commander.

234
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,890
It's OK, Scobe, you'll get
 the hang of it pretty soon.

235
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,360
Yeah, well, I hope so.

236
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,880
The folks with me are going
 to be real interested in how

237
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,220
I fly the shuttle.

238
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,840
Hey, that's right,
 you got the teacher.

239
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,100
How'd you find that out?

240
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,740
We just heard.

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,470
They tell the
 important people first.

242
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,920
That a good idea, Scobe?

243
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,620
You like the idea of an outsider
 getting a seat on your shuttle?

244
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,360
Well, it torqued me at first.

245
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,730
You know, we got guys in this
 program who were waiting 15

246
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,730
years to fly and then they
 lose their seat to somebody who

247
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,280
just walks in off the street.

248
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,610
But I liked the
 idea of us sending

249
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,920
the first lesson from space.

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,210
I think a lot of
 it'll depend on what

251
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,810
this Christa person is like.

252
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,320
All right, let's
 fly the shuttle.

253
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,340
Yours, Scobe.

254
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,590
Well, what do I do first?

255
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,290
Pull this?

256
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,480
You're off line.

257
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,180
Right.

258
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
I see it.

259
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,430
Scobe, one thing, if you
 break through cloud cover,

260
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,980
you're 7,000 feet, and
 you're off line that far,

261
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,790
better jump on it even quicker.

262
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,480
You need to correct
 it right now.

263
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,180
Right.

264
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
I can do better.

265
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,670
Watch this next one.

266
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,060
How soon can we get inside
 and take a look at the O-rings?

267
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,290
We start taking
 it apart tomorrow.

268
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,160
In a couple of days, we'll
 give you everything you want.

269
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,560
These horizontal tests
 don't give us what we want.

270
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,330
The only thing that will
 give us real information

271
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,350
is the vertical firing
 under flight conditions.

272
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,890
We fire it the way
 we're told to, Roger.

273
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,030
We know that, Stan.

274
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,910
If we try to test one of
 these things vertically,

275
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,610
there's no way to hold it down.
 It'll launch itself.

276
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,310
Fine.

277
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,000
But the only way to know
 exactly what we've got

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,820
is with a vertical firing.

279
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,600
Somebody ought to
 tell management that.

280
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,450
Well, we can't tell
 nothing to nobody today.

281
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,150
It's quitting time.

282
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,080
How about a beer?

283
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,550
We don't drink in my family.

284
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,330
OK.

285
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,100
Come on over the bowling
 alley, knock down some pins.

286
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,190
It'll make you feel mighty.

287
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,880
See you in a couple of days.

288
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,230
Typical.

289
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,160
Nobody seems to take
 this problem seriously.

290
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,920
I'll bet 90% of the people
 who work here don't even know

291
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,040
what an O-ring is, let
 alone there's a serious

292
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,630
problem with them.

293
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,930
Real discouraging.

294
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,870
What's discouraging
 is Morton-Thiokol

295
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,940
not getting off its behind
 and doing something about it.

296
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,640
Right.

297
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
They met their contract with
 NASA, the shuttle is flying,

298
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,690
why talk about problems
 is their attitude.

299
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,130
They'll have to
 talk about this one.

300
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,400
I hear if this O-ring
 problem isn't solved soon,

301
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,660
NASA will be looking
 for another contractor.

302
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,920
No way.

303
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,380
If NASA dropped
 Morton-Thiokol, they'd

304
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,360
had to suspend the shuttle
 program for a year,

305
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,650
redesign the entire booster,
 start a whole new test program.

306
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,790
You know that's not
 going to happen.

307
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,690
Ichi.

308
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,460
Ni.

309
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,420
San.

310
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,760
Shi.

311
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,980
Ichi.

312
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,430
Ni.

313
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,310
San.

314
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,370
Shi.

315
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,510
Ichi.

316
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,210
Ni.

317
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,320
Yame.

318
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,830
Rei.

319
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,540
Seiza.

320
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,060
Do you study karate
 to fight others?

321
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,010
Charlie?

322
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,190
I study karate to improve
 myself through self-discipline

323
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,160
and self-criticism, to
 learn to overcome failure,

324
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
hardship, and fear.

325
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
For what other purpose
 do you learn karate?

326
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,620
Al?

327
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,410
To know courage and beauty.

328
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,100
Through karate,
 the warrior finds

329
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,960
the beauty that lies
 in a lily, in music,

330
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,540
and the knowledge of
 what he might become.

331
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,040
Is this a moment in
 which to fight or to smile?

332
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,210
OK.

333
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,450
See you Thursday.

334
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,430
Ha, Sensai.

335
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,850
Sensai?

336
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,550
Hm?

337
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,720
Did you hear
 you're going to have

338
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,780
that teacher on your shuttle?

339
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,860
I did. yes.

340
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,240
What's that going to be like?

341
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,430
I mean, you're this brain
 already been in space, ans

342
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,990
she's a high school teacher.

343
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,370
Who's going to be teaching who?

344
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,880
Well, that's not the question.

345
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,390
The question is, where's
 the opportunity here?

346
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,050
I knew he was going
 to turn his back on me.

347
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,720
Why is she you
 going into space?

348
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,380
And who'll be listening
 when she's teaching?

349
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,660
Calvin?

350
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,440
Us?

351
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Us.

352
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,550
When the teacher is
 giving her lesson,

353
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,010
I'll be staring down
 into your classroom

354
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,710
to see if you are listening.

355
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,410
Hm?

356
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,870
Hey, Roger, have
 you got a minute?

357
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,500
Come on over.

358
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,510
I hear you've had a
 couple of new thoughts.

359
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,490
Yes, I do.

360
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,820
I wrote a memo to
 Bob Lund about it.

361
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Well, what's the meat of it?

362
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,110
Would you mind telling us?

363
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,870
Well, I think we've had
 a mistake in position.

364
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,810
We believe we can get a new
 design going for the O-ring

365
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,140
and continue to fly
 without any real worry.

366
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,360
So what's changed?

367
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,410
We're working on the new design.

368
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,220
We sure as hell
 have to keep flying.

369
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,310
NASA's nearly doubled the
 schedule for next year.

370
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,400
I don't think we have to fly.

371
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,030
I mean, we're sending
 those shuttles up like they

372
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,430
can't fail or something.

373
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,470
It's a different
 ballgame since flight 17.

374
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,440
I don't see it as
 a different ballgame.

375
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,610
There's a problem,
 and we got to fix it.

376
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,740
Isn't that what
 you're saying, Roger?

377
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,870
I'm saying that and I'm
 saying something else too.

378
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,840
Oh, come on, you have
 to play this for drama?

379
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,910
Just say what you got to say.

380
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,470
Since flight 17,
 we know something

381
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,430
we didn't know before.

382
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,150
The primary O-ring
 can fail completely.

383
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,890
If that ever happens, one of the
 major sections to the rocket,

384
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,690
it's a jump ball as to whether
 the joint holds or fails.

385
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,330
If it fails, it'll
 be a catastrophe

386
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,220
of the highest order.

387
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,230
Loss of human life.

388
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,030
The shuttle, the
 launch pad, all of it.

389
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,760
Roger, you're keyed
 up about the O-ring

390
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
problem because O-rings
 is what you work on.

391
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,050
It's what you see every day.

392
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,390
I want you to know there
 are other major problems

393
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,130
on the shuttle, cracks in the
 blades of the main engines,

394
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,050
brakes, computer malfunctions.

395
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,790
If any one of these
 fail, it could

396
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,400
bring the same devastation
 you're talking about.

397
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Now, we've got to fix
 this O-ring problem.

398
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,090
There's no question
 about that, but, Roger,

399
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,760
the shuttle has flown 19 times
 and it's come back 19 times.

400
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,650
Our job isn't to run
 around like Chicken Little

401
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,740
hollering the sky is falling.

402
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,100
It's to fix this
 problem, and when

403
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,080
the next problem
 comes up fix that,

404
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,580
and keep that shuttle flying.

405
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,590
Do you remember Claire?

406
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,280
Um, yeah, read hair.

407
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,980
Right.

408
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,470
We saw her at the PTA meeting.

409
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,170
Uh-huh.

410
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,190
Well, her husband's
 this race nut

411
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,460
and he has a soundtrack
 of cars screaming

412
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,720
around the Indy track.

413
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah.

414
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm going to play
 it as background

415
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,550
for your morning preparations.

416
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,250
Uh-huh.

417
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,760
Oh, very funny, hon.

418
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,810
We're overload today On
 Scobee's going to Washington.

419
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,350
I've got to fly to the Cape to
 check out the escape system,

420
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,000
then get back for the
 seminar on fire control

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,870
that we're having
 here this afternoon,

422
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,010
and I've still got to bone
 up for the standalone seminar

423
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,240
that we're having Wednesday.

424
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,830
Well, there's only one way.

425
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,730
Plan the work--

426
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,970
And work the plan.

427
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,470
Otherwise it will
 never get done.

428
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,750
Right.

429
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,270
Talking of plan and
 work, do you think we

430
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,080
could work in some family time?

431
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,150
Yeah, we have to.

432
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,920
When?

433
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,620
I don't know.

434
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,390
You tell me.

435
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,090
Saturday?

436
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,960
40 minutes right after lunch,
 I could probably do that.

437
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,470
A full 40 minutes?

438
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,030
Oh my.

439
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,060
I didn't dare hope we'd
 get that kind of time.

440
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,990
Hon, I know, it's just
 that there are so many things

441
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,860
that I've got to get done.

442
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,840
Come on, let's say
 goodbye to the kids.

443
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,220
When will you be back, Dad?

444
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,030
Saturday.

445
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,950
Right in time for
 Janelle's soccer game.

446
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,560
You missed the
 last one, so be sure.

447
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,340
You won't be back in time, El.

448
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,040
Why?

449
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,740
Why?

450
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,180
When you go to the
 Cape you get back late.

451
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,290
Sometimes.

452
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,370
Usually.

453
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,080
Hey, if I don't get here,
 it's because something

454
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,340
made it impossible.

455
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,710
I'll get here as soon as I can.

456
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,370
And mostly, it's when
 we're already asleep

457
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,960
and then you're gone
 before we get up.

458
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,470
We know you've been here
 by the laundry you leave.

459
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,390
Try to get here, Dad.

460
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,300
I need help with my algebra too.

461
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,210
I'll be here.

462
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,880
We'll do algebra right
 after the game, OK?

463
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,800
OK.

464
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,230
Now keep my record
 of punctuality perfect,

465
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,370
I lift a tiny Hawaiian
 body out of here.

466
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,070
Aloha.

467
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,700
Well, there's no
 mystery about who you are.

468
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,400
Or you.

469
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,810
I've seen your picture.

470
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,610
Dick Scobee.

471
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,420
Quick, what's 9 times 7?

472
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,080
68.

473
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,500
Well, that's within 10%.

474
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,060
I think that's close
 enough, don't you?

475
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,520
Not in my class.

476
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,910
Please, nice to meet you.

477
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,610
Please sit up.

478
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,350
So NASA asked me to meet
 with y'all and tell you

479
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,810
something about the shuttle.

480
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,010
Who's got the first question?

481
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,710
I do.

482
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,420
Go ahead.

483
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,710
What do we call you?

484
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,940
Well, Dick is fine, but
 mostly people call me Scobe.

485
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,010
I picked that up
 in grammar school.

486
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,120
Commander?

487
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,730
Commander, no, you wouldn't
 use except during a mission,

488
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,530
and even then,
 we're more informal

489
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,940
unless there's a crisis.

490
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,860
Not that it fixes a
 crisis that people

491
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,950
start calling me commander.

492
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,830
How often is there
 likely to be a crisis?

493
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,250
Well, they don't appear
 on schedule, of course.

494
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,450
Most of them occur during ascent
 and when we come back to Earth,

495
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,220
so that's why we
 practice those the most.

496
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,750
How are you in a
 crisis, Christa?

497
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,800
All right, I think.

498
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,710
High school teachers have all
 kinds of crises to deal with.

499
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,160
How do you get to be
 commander of a shuttle?

500
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,930
I mean, I guess these are
 pretty primitive questions,

501
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,380
but we're just getting into
 this massive world, you know.

502
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,080
No, no.

503
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,100
That's fine.

504
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,110
Most of us were test pilots.

505
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,110
Weren't you in the military?

506
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,810
Air Force.

507
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,610
23 years ago, I was an
 enlisted man in San Antonio

508
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,430
fixing piston engines on C124s.

509
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,280
How did you get
 from there to here?

510
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,300
Well, I guess I must have
 married the right woman.

511
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,180
June and I, my wife
 and I, we both decided

512
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,490
there was more to life
 than me fixing engines

513
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,560
and her being a waitress,
 so we entered college.

514
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,500
I graduated from the
 University of Arizona

515
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,880
and went into pilot training.

516
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,660
And June?

517
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,140
Oh, I think y'all
 have a friend in June.

518
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,040
She's now an assistant professor
 at the University of Houston.

519
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,990
Great story.

520
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,780
There's something
 that I'd like to know.

521
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,790
Do you ever get scared
 flying into space?

522
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,540
No.

523
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,820
No, not scared.

524
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,500
We've all been fighting
 too hard to get up there.

525
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,960
By the time you become a
 commander of a shuttle mission,

526
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,390
you've been in the
 program about eight years

527
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,230
and you've done over 2,000 hours
 in the sims, in the simulators,

528
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,960
so during a mission, you're
 not afraid for your life,

529
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,810
you're just afraid
 of screwing up.

530
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,540
Senator Garn said he
 felt safer flying in space

531
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,820
than he did going down
 the George Washington

532
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,790
Parkway at rush hour.

533
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,800
Well, he wouldn't be.

534
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,750
Flying the shuttle
 involves real danger.

535
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,850
You're sitting on top of a
 controlled explosion at launch.

536
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,750
Solid rockets generate
 44 million horsepower,

537
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,910
and each one contains 500
 tons of explosive fuel.

538
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,260
So you light them
 and you ride them

539
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,240
until they burn out two
 minutes later, because there

540
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,080
is no way to shut it down.

541
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,040
It would be very easy for
 something to go wrong.

542
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,190
And yet, you're not scared?

543
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:06,390
And even after what you've
 just told us, neither am I.

544
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,590
That's the way you have to
 feel when you're an astronaut.

545
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,720
Morning, everybody.

546
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,420
Morning.

547
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,800
Let me remind you, this
 is a level one meeting.

548
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,260
We're going to be deciding on a
 couple of very critical issues

549
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,050
here today, and I put
 the O-ring problem right

550
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,330
at the top of those issues.

551
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,890
Larry Mulloy will begin.

552
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,710
We've got a hard
 question to answer today.

553
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,690
Is it safe to continue
 flying the shuttle?

554
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,240
Now, if quit should be said,
 this is the time to say it.

555
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,560
In the original design of
 the solid rocket booster,

556
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,500
no erosion of O-rings
 was ever anticipated.

557
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,760
No such possibility was
 ever even mentioned.

558
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,170
O-ring erosion occurred in the
 second flight of the shuttle.

559
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,510
Now we didn't know how
 serious a problem it was.

560
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,720
We decided since every O-ring
 in the solid rocket booster

561
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,790
has a backup, a secondary
 O-ring, safety was guaranteed.

562
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,280
We decided that we would
 continue to fly the shuttle,

563
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,680
but we would monitor the
 O-rings very closely.

564
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,640
Now since flight 2, there
 have been continuing

565
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,780
instances of O-ring erosion.

566
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,480
None, however, has been greater
 than that experienced on flight

567
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,720
2 so the rationale
 has become as long

568
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,810
as the O-ring erosion does
 not exceed that of flight 2,

569
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,260
it's safe to fly.

570
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,140
But two months ago, post
 flight inspection of flight 17

571
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,570
showed a brand new
 set of circumstances.

572
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,570
An O-ring in a nozzle
 joint was so badly eroded,

573
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,310
it didn't seal at all.

574
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:49,990
The secondary O-ring did seal,
 but it too was badly eroded.

575
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,670
Now this combination
 of erosion has

576
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,330
destroyed our rationale that
 we have a guarantee of safety.

577
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,430
I think that's a
 pretty fair description.

578
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,690
Everybody agreed?

579
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,630
Um?

580
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,470
Yeah, Joe.

581
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,270
Well, it was our
 engineers obviously

582
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,260
who did the post flight analysis
 on 17 and produced these facts.

583
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,510
No one is more concerned
 than us at Morton-Thiokol

584
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,590
about what they mean.

585
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,290
What do they mean?

586
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,800
Well, let me say first off
 that I would be lying to you

587
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,690
if I told you we know
 everything about what

588
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,980
went wrong on flight 17.

589
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,580
Let me tell you that's
 exactly what we've got to know.

590
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,310
Everything about what did
 go wrong on flight 17,

591
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,290
otherwise we don't have
 an answer to our question.

592
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,170
But we do have an answer,
 Larry, continue flying.

593
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,870
That's our recommendation.

594
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,180
We've discovered that the
 nozzle joint was not properly

595
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,360
leak checked, and because
 of that very serious mistake

596
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,720
both O-rings were made
 vulnerable to the hot gases.

597
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,900
We're making sure that no
 such aberration happens again,

598
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,720
but we believe that that
 was the cause of the erosion

599
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,310
in both O-rings on flight 17.

600
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,320
And that's why we
 recommend continue

601
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,180
flying with proper checks.

602
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,490
Assuming what you say is
 true, that would explain

603
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,050
what happened on flight 17.

604
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,500
It does not explain the whole
 history of O-ring erosions.

605
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,470
Improperly leak checks
 didn't cause all of them.

606
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,510
O-ring erosions were
 not supposed to occur,

607
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,380
but they did, and then
 sometimes they didn't.

608
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,700
Why?

609
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,530
I keep thinking we're
 flying rocket boosters

610
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,790
we don't really understand.

611
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,610
We are forming an
 O-ring task force

612
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,800
at Morton-Thiokol to find
 out exactly what the problem

613
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,020
is and how to fix it.

614
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,810
This task force will recommend
 short and long range solutions

615
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,190
to the O-ring problem.

616
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,340
It's a little late in
 coming, but it's a good idea.

617
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,720
It's a real good idea, Larry.

618
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,860
We'll wrestle this
 thing to earth.

619
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,330
All right, but
 there are conditions.

620
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,540
You form that task force
 immediately and get a report

621
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,770
into me within two months.

622
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,740
You've got it.

623
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,030
The task force begins tomorrow.

624
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,450
We going right
 to meet the crew?

625
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,750
That building over there.

626
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,210
Barbara, why do I
 suddenly feel so inadequate?

627
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,560
Because I am.

628
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,150
I doubt that.

629
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,250
They don't expect us
 to be brilliant yet.

630
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,000
I look around here and I
 realize how little I know

631
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,830
about rockets and space travel.

632
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,740
I say the words, space
 travel, and I think

633
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,690
is that me I'm talking about.

634
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,680
You're right.

635
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,480
It's intimidating.

636
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Now, ladies, the crew's
 very busy on some highly

637
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,390
technical work, so we'll
 just sort of tiptoe in, OK?

638
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,930
Just try not to
 disturb anything.

639
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,160
Is it all right to go in?

640
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,860
Should we wait?

641
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,560
It'll be all right.

642
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,320
Hi.

643
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,820
I'm Elon Onizuka.

644
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,130
We'd like to welcome
 our journalist in space.

645
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,300
Teacher in space, fool.

646
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,110
Morning, Christa.

647
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm the well-behaved
 one, Mike Smith.

648
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,730
Uh, that is not the truth.

649
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,560
He's always late to
 class, he doesn't

650
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
complete his
 homework assignments,

651
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,010
and he uses bad words.

652
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,090
I'm the good
 student, Ron McNair.

653
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,970
They're all truants, Christa.

654
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,130
You and I will have to take
 this bunch of dead end kids

655
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,040
on together.

656
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,930
I'm Judy Resnick.

657
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,630
Hi.

658
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,570
I see you in all
 the best places.

659
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,650
Welcome aboard, Christa.

660
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,970
Thank you.

661
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,860
All together now.

662
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,900
Good morning, Mrs. McAuliffe.

663
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,420
Good morning, class.

664
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,450
Teacher, can you tell me--

665
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,070
What's the capital of France?

666
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,530
How high is--

667
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,970
What are the primary colors?

668
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,560
Ready to buy
 some beers tonight?

669
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,050
No way.

670
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,060
Are we about ready, Jerry?

671
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,760
Pretty much.

672
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,480
Got some good
 work down for us?

673
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,000
You won't sleep through it.

674
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,870
I want to be told
 it Mike eats a donut.

675
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,010
We've got $100 bet.

676
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,740
Which I've practically won.

677
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,440
You wish.

678
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,060
We're going to be tough today.

679
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,130
You win a beer, you'll earn it.

680
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,860
Better get your money
 out now, Beaufort.

681
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,940
He seemed especially
 vindictive today.

682
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,270
OK, we're ready to begin
 a cabin leak at six minutes

683
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,860
before main engine cutoff.

684
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,930
How many of these do you want?

685
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,680
You've had two.

686
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,350
Come on, I didn't
 have breakfast.

687
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,120
At two minutes before cut
 off, fail the computers.

688
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,520
Computer switches?

689
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,230
Got them.

690
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,940
Let him be vindictive.

691
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,970
They won't get one by us.

692
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,530
You want any?

693
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,230
Yes.

694
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,780
You got my little green pen?

695
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,480
No.

696
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,510
We've got pens right there.

697
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,110
I know, but I like the
 one with the little--

698
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,960
Brake.

699
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,290
All right, we're reset.

700
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,910
Let's tighten up.

701
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,760
OK, resetting.

702
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,370
I want that cabin leak
 right after liftoff.

703
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,570
OK, it says a 6 inch
 hole in the cabin.

704
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,200
That's be big enough
 to pull people through.

705
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,410
Must mean 6/10 of an inch.

706
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,110
Yeah, 6/10.

707
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,220
It couldn't be 6 inches.

708
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,170
Ready in the simulator.

709
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,870
Ready.

710
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,570
Ready.

711
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,480
It's getting boring up here.

712
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,150
Ah so, please forgive.

713
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,910
All right, start them.

714
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,030
T minus 8 seconds.

715
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,880
OK, we have three
 engines burning at 100%.

716
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,970
3, 2, 1.

717
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,860
Here's the roll program.

718
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,180
Roger will, Challenger.

719
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,880
LBLH.

720
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,700
Throttle down.

721
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,140
And throttle up.

722
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,620
Going throttle up, Challenger?

723
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,660
Roger, going throttle up.

724
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,850
Boosters separated.

725
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,200
Negative return.

726
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,900
Roger.

727
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,510
Challenger press to orbit.

728
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,240
Roger, press to orbit.

729
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,710
Cabin leak, Scobe.

730
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,910
Relief valves.

731
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,750
Already checked.

732
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,760
What's cabin pressure?

733
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,130
Down to 14.2 PSI.

734
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,740
There's nothing to do except
 cycle the relief valves.

735
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,310
That's right.

736
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,200
Right and they're closed.

737
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,810
For record, did you
 make it, not a gusher.

738
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,510
No, it's right.

739
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,350
It's real.

740
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,250
Standby for a curve ball
 in a couple of minutes.

741
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:28,950
I'm ready.

742
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,160
I've got a good one for them.

743
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,150
That didn't stop the leak.

744
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,180
Better get ready to abort.

745
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,670
We've got the velocity
 for Dakar or Conchesa.

746
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,170
There's a Club Med at Dakar.

747
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,850
Let's go there.

748
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,830
I'm slowing the leak,
 give them a better chance.

749
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,330
Soon as they pick
 their abort site,

750
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,620
we'll toss in another
 couple of malfs.

751
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,950
Hold on, what's
 their cabin pressure?

752
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,650
It's dropping.

753
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,040
It's close to 10.

754
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,430
I failed a caution
 warning light.

755
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,730
They probably won't
 notice it yet.

756
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,200
Abort to Dakar now.

757
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,850
Abort to Dakar.

758
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,430
UMS are dumping.

759
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,900
And valves are configured.

760
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,590
What's cabin pressure?

761
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,650
A little under 10 PSI.

762
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,830
Seems to be slowing slightly.

763
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,720
This is where they
 get paid the big bucks.

764
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,620
Let's beat them up.

765
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,460
I'll kill one of
 the main engines.

766
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,830
Still gonna make Dakar?

767
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,080
Trust me.

768
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Go ahead.

769
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,200
Left main engine gone.

770
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,580
Guide and seize it.

771
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,290
The other two engines
 half throttled up.

772
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,030
Looks like we have enough
 energy to still make Dakar.

773
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,120
They'll make Dakar but
 they'll have to do an OHMS burn.

774
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,060
We have main engine cutoff.

775
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,310
What's our final velocity?

776
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,930
I don't know if we're going
 to have to do an OHMS burn.

777
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,400
What a guide, Mike.

778
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,870
External tank separated.

779
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,760
We'll turn off the
 OHMS engines mainly

780
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,290
once they burn long enough.

781
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,450
I don't know if we
 have to do that, Scobe.

782
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,070
They don't have to do that.

783
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,510
When the engine shuts
 off automatically,

784
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,920
they'll see that they
 don't have to do that.

785
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,860
Yep, the computer
 automatically

786
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
figures the length of the burn.

787
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,020
Come on, Scobe, get
 your brains together.

788
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,700
Fail the OHMS engine.

789
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,400
Right.

790
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,720
Left OHMS is down.

791
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,960
Protected burn time
 will be two more minutes.

792
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,170
They'll have to remember
 to cross feed the fuel.

793
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:16,870
They will.

794
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,040
Oh, no, we've got to cross feed.

795
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,060
It's too late now.

796
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,120
We're way past halfway.

797
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,080
They'll be lucky if
 they have enough fuel

798
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,290
to make it through the burn.

799
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,460
I think they'll make it.

800
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,300
They should have paid more
 attention to the checklist.

801
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,020
The OHMS burn is finished.

802
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,280
Main engine dump.

803
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,510
Got it.

804
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,240
They're dumping remaining fuel
 from the main engines, good.

805
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,020
Can I put in a
 communications now?

806
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,700
No, they're too busy.

807
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,640
Gee, what did I come for?

808
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,600
You're supposed
 to bring the donuts.

809
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,070
All right, check the
 auxiliary power units

810
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,780
for body flaps and speed rate.

811
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,870
They're looking good.

812
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,630
Good.

813
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,310
Hey, Scobee screwed me up.

814
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,470
He went through the checklist so
 fast I couldn't get my malf in.

815
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,250
Oh.

816
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,000
Gee, I'll fix that.

817
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm jamming the gearbox
 for the speed brakes.

818
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,850
That'll keep them fully closed.

819
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,790
Speed brakes are jammed.

820
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,240
There's nothing we
 can do about that.

821
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,050
We may have too much energy
 to land on the runway.

822
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,110
Mike, let's plan to bring
 the gear down early.

823
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,620
High tail winds over
 Africa, that's going

824
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,130
to keep the energy even higher.

825
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,150
Scobe, should we try to open
 the speed brake manually?

826
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,850
No, it's too late.

827
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,550
I just tried.

828
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,670
I'm not sure they're
 going to make it.

829
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,840
Last time I trust you.

830
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,040
Mike, get the gear down.

831
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,390
I've got three Goodyear.

832
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,160
He won't get it
 down on the runway.

833
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,320
Altitude 50 feet,
 speed 250 knots.

834
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,940
30 feet, 230.

835
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,100
20, 230.

836
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,090
10, 210.

837
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,130
We're going way too fast.

838
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,980
Touchdown.

839
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,830
Nose gear is down.

840
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,530
We're over shooting.

841
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,550
Going to maximum braking.

842
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,990
I'm sorry we gave
 you so much energy.

843
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,910
We want you to make
 that landing in case

844
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,380
you ever do an abort to Dakar.

845
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,330
You should've given us
 something we could solve.

846
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,830
We're supposed to be
 learning something here.

847
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,310
What are you guys
 doing out there?

848
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,340
Yeah, but you know something?

849
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,300
What I'm think, Scobe--

850
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,970
You know, I could have taken
 a wider swing around the hack.

851
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,950
It would have dissipated
 more of the energy.

852
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,760
Yeah, but then you're
 fighting the computers.

853
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,310
They said stay on course.

854
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,070
Yeah, I know, but sometimes
 you just gotta fly by your gut.

855
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,540
You gotta bring it on in.

856
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,590
Tell me about it.

857
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,330
You know something else
 we might have tried?

858
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,430
All right, ready to reset?

859
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,130
Later.

860
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,270
Larry, what went on at
 that Washington meeting?

861
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,270
Are we getting anywhere?

862
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,460
Oh, we're flying,
 you know that.

863
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,050
The conclusion is that
 the problem with flight 17

864
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,880
was an improper leak check.

865
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,610
If you accept that conclusion,
 you continue flying.

866
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,170
I don't think
 that's the question.

867
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,170
The question is are we
 right to continue flying?

868
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,370
Well, the future
 will tell us that.

869
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,650
Launch criteria prohibit
 flying the shuttle

870
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,900
with a criticality one element.

871
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,790
Those O-rings are now
 a criticality one,

872
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:59,130
so what I'm doing is issuing
 a waiver on each flight

873
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,420
as it comes up.

874
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,000
That sure doesn't
 solve the O-ring problem.

875
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,700
No, sir.

876
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,340
The O-ring problem
 is not solved.

877
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,210
Tell me what's wrong
 with this story, Larry?

878
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,930
Shuttle flies, and we
 find O-ring erosion,

879
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,500
but nothing happens.

880
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,560
So we fly some more and the
 O-rings erode some more,

881
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,700
then instead of getting
 more worried about it,

882
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,680
we start getting used to it.

883
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,660
Yeah.

884
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,420
That's the wrong part.

885
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,210
And almost without noticing
 it, we lower our standards.

886
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,480
We start to believe
 that because we've

887
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,010
gotten away with
 it so many times

888
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,250
we'll keep on
 getting away with it.

889
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,180
Well, we've gotten away with
 it but we're not going to get

890
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,730
away with it forever, Larry.

891
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,230
I want to know how that
 task force performs

892
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,330
and I want the O-ring problem
 to have absolute priority.

893
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,120
Yes, sir.

894
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,910
The instructor brings
 the chair to a stop

895
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,080
and suddenly you
 feel like you've

896
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,630
started to spin in the
 opposite direction,

897
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,640
but you open your eyes
 and you realize you're

898
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,870
standing completely still.

899
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,940
Good.

900
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,460
You're picking things up fast.

901
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,990
What else are they teaching you?

902
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,480
Well, we're going up
 in a KC 135 next week.

903
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,340
The Vomit Comet.

904
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,910
Don't worry, only
 the men get sick.

905
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,610
Good.

906
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,050
There's one other thing
 I wanted to ask you.

907
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,030
What's it like to be
 up there in space?

908
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,860
I always hate that question.

909
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,600
Why?

910
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,910
Because you can't answer it.

911
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,200
Ask me something else.

912
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,400
That's the one thing I've
 been longing to ask somebody.

913
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,320
All right.

914
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,790
I can give you
 impressions, snapshots.

915
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,030
You don't want to come back.

916
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,690
You find you left all
 the stress back on Earth.

917
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,460
You're serene.

918
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,880
Colors, blue, green,
 white, you've never

919
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,840
seen them that way before.

920
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,810
They come flying up to you.

921
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,180
Rivers pouring off
 the continents.

922
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,250
The Amazon comes down
 with a force that sends it

923
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,140
100 miles out into
 the ocean before it

924
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,880
even mixes with the saltwater.

925
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,590
You find yourself in
 the fetal position

926
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:16,210
when you sleep as
 if you're in a womb.

927
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,160
Our little planet, so
 beautiful, no boundaries on it,

928
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,280
no support coming
 from anywhere outside.

929
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,790
It's just there by itself.

930
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,940
You feel protective of it.

931
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
I can't wait.

932
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
I can't wait to share
 that with my students.

933
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,070
Hi.

934
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,770
Hi.

935
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,590
Is this for us?

936
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,800
Yes.

937
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,720
Didn't we used to have
 some children around here?

938
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,140
Scott's practicing late,
 Alison's at Mary's, and Aaron

939
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,250
is staying over with Cynthia.

940
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,460
I see.

941
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,850
We have two full hours
 to do whatever we want.

942
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,160
And just what
 do we want to do?

943
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,080
Dance.

944
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,850
Dance?

945
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,120
We don't dance much
 anymore, you know what I mean?

946
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,730
I mean, it's just one of
 those things that glides out

947
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,370
of your life and you forget
 how you used to do it,

948
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,990
and how much you enjoyed it.

949
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,890
Care to dance with
 me, Mr. Smith?

950
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,320
The truth?

951
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,670
Uh-huh.

952
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,570
Dancing was not the first
 thing I was planning on doing

953
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,440
when I got home this evening.

954
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,040
But, hon, if you want to dance--

955
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,580
I've got a cassette of some
 South Carolina beach music.

956
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,730
How long has that been?

957
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,700
People are going to think
 there are rednecks from the 60s

958
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,640
living in here.

959
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,420
But we're going to
 start with something else.

960
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,160
I've got this all timed,
 so come on now, darling.

961
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,230
I was thinking after you
 left today about the part

962
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,790
of your life I don't share.

963
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,490
You know what I mean?

964
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,310
I'm not in the simulator
 when you do something smart

965
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,040
and the trainers buy you a beer.

966
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:14,330
I won't be on orbit to see you
 fly the shuttle back to Earth.

967
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:19,380
But I'm here at
 home, and the Mike I

968
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,090
see a father and the husband.

969
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:31,300
Mike, I don't know how you can
 be so terrific as an astronaut

970
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,830
and then come home
 and be so wonderful

971
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,640
as a husband and a father.

972
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,830
It touches me so.

973
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,680
Honey--

974
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,670
Don't say anything.

975
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,110
This is the part I
 want you to hear.

976
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,770
[MUSIC - BETTE MIDLER, "WIND
 BENEATH MY WINGS"]

977
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,940
Did you ever know
 that you're my hero.

978
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,610
Everything I would like to be.

979
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:14,490
I can fly higher than
 an eagle because you

980
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,960
are the wind beneath my wings.

981
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,550
Don't let's talk
 about O-rings though.

982
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,730
It's Sunday, and I
 always think on Sunday we

983
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,490
don't have to talk
 about the things we talk

984
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,080
about the rest of the week.

985
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,430
All right, Mom.

986
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,020
I agree.

987
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,370
Sundays are special, especially
 when we have Norma visiting.

988
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,780
So tell us what's
 going on in Salt Lake?

989
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,300
We're doing good.

990
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,470
Preaching that
 every house should

991
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,870
have a personal computer bought
 from us, and sales are up.

992
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,950
Doing real good.

993
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,970
See, that's another thing.

994
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,850
If we used more
 computers in our testing,

995
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,060
we know a hell of a lot
 more hell of a lot faster.

996
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,370
So easy to slide into
 this weekday conversation.

997
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,910
I wasn't going
 to talk O-rings.

998
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,840
I was going to talk about
 the damn O-ring task

999
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,340
force they formed.

1000
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,700
Well, didn't you say the
 task force was a good thing?

1001
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,600
That business talk just
 creeps in, doesn't it?

1002
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,530
I just want to get this one
 point cleared up with Norma.

1003
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,580
The task force is a
 good thing, but the memo

1004
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,840
that created it doesn't demand
 that a solution be produced.

1005
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,710
It doesn't set a time limit.

1006
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,400
They just don't care.

1007
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,330
How can they not care?

1008
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,180
They formed the task force.

1009
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,040
Keeping things as they
 are is what they care about.

1010
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,710
Dad, do you mean they're
 actually obstructing

1011
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,520
the work of the task force?

1012
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,130
If it would endanger the crew
 and everything, why would they?

1013
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,610
It sounds frightening
 what you're saying, Dad.

1014
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,370
I'm not saying they
 want to endanger the crew.

1015
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,130
All I'm saying is we don't even
 know how these O-rings really

1016
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,100
work or even if they work.

1017
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,650
If you're trying to solve
 that kind of problem,

1018
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,660
you do it as fast as you
 can and you don't keep

1019
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,840
flying while you're doing it.

1020
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,170
I'm saying what I know is right.

1021
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,640
I'm sure you're
 right, Dad, but could

1022
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,380
there be another right?

1023
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,150
Could the company
 have a different right

1024
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,960
and be just as sincere?

1025
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm sorry, Mom.

1026
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,840
It's just so interesting to me.

1027
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,740
It is interesting.

1028
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,240
I can see that.

1029
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,950
It's just that it was Sunday.

1030
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,300
Ta-da.

1031
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,000
Neat.

1032
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,920
It's a little loose.

1033
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,110
Well, they need to be to
 work in, don't you know.

1034
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,170
Through the hips.

1035
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,210
Well, you want
 them larger there.

1036
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,670
Was that comment directed
 particularly at me?

1037
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:59,800
No.

1038
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,210
No, no.

1039
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,310
In the weightless state, the
 blood, instead of heading

1040
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,020
for the feet the way
 it does, Your Honor,

1041
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,940
goes to the middle of
 the body and stays there,

1042
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,950
don't you know?

1043
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:08,710
Great.

1044
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,570
I'll tell you one
 thing, I want to be

1045
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,950
photographed from the waist
 up when I'm doing my lessons.

1046
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,790
Those are lovely.

1047
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,050
Also, you know,
 you'll be an inch

1048
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,370
and a half taller in space.

1049
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,150
Oh, that's right.

1050
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,940
That would help.

1051
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,990
These black boots are
 what you wear for launch.

1052
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,190
Very smart.

1053
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,940
And these leather
 soled woolen moccasins

1054
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,350
are for comfort in orbit.

1055
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,130
These are terrific.

1056
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,400
Oh, look at that.

1057
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,670
My kids don't really believe
 I'm going up into space.

1058
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,570
I'd like to walk into the room
 in the middle of the night

1059
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,360
with one of those on.

1060
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,700
Now here's something
 for your diet, space food.

1061
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,010
You'll select the
 meals you eat on orbit.

1062
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,780
Your meals will be color coded.

1063
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,690
We've got 140 food
 and beverage items.

1064
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,090
Who wants to go first?

1065
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,790
I'll start.

1066
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,300
It's got cafeteria food beat.

1067
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,370
Uh-huh.

1068
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,020
They do chicken right.

1069
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,850
When you're hungry, you
 just float over, pick out

1070
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,290
your color, and start batting.

1071
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,190
Float over.

1072
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,110
Every once in a while, I
 sort of stand outside myself

1073
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,720
and I realize what I'm doing.

1074
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,430
Oh, try the broccoli.

1075
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,790
It's delicious.

1076
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,260
Sprouts.

1077
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,030
Want more?

1078
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,730
No, you.

1079
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,600
You haven't eaten any.

1080
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,530
I will.

1081
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:30,750
Did Dad call?

1082
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,580
No.

1083
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,980
Did he say you would
 be here for dinner?

1084
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,880
Nope.

1085
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,370
Maybe it's one of
 those times when he says

1086
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,870
it's impossible to get here?

1087
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,280
Yeah, maybe rainfalls
 up instead of down too.

1088
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,980
Eat your fish.

1089
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,680
Try them.

1090
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,140
I used to run around the islands
 picking these when I was a kid.

1091
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,010
They're good, El.

1092
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,790
What are they called?

1093
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,610
Macadamia nuts.

1094
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,010
Eat them with your
 beer, guaranteed you'll

1095
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,540
gain 30 pounds in one night.

1096
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,900
It's my turn.

1097
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,640
Hey, wait a minute.

1098
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,950
I'm next on that pool game.

1099
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,200
Let me go next, El.

1100
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,290
I need revenge on Brandenstein.

1101
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,190
All right, all right,
 but I'm next, OK?

1102
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,860
I got dinner waiting at home.

1103
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,200
You should have
 brought the plans,

1104
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,360
I could point right to where
 you should make revisions.

1105
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,720
We took a good long look.

1106
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,240
Those plans don't have
 to be revised, JR.

1107
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,510
Mark, there are
 three specific errors.

1108
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,560
They don't exist.

1109
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,960
We didn't find them.

1110
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,960
They do exist.

1111
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,140
The remote arm cannot
 grab that satellite

1112
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,070
the way it's positioned
 in the payload bay.

1113
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,370
I'm not guessing at this.

1114
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,620
JR, there are four
 of us and one of you.

1115
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,010
Now, four guys can't be
 wrong, or am I treading

1116
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,550
on your feminist views?

1117
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,720
You're doing worse.

1118
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,310
You're arguing with
 someone who knows

1119
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,400
everything that's possible to
 know about that remote arm.

1120
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,990
Think about this, Mark.

1121
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,080
I'm the one who launches a
 $50 million piece of equipment

1122
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,520
off the shuttle in front of
 the onboard television cameras,

1123
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,220
and I don't get it wrong.

1124
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,060
So check it out, OK?

1125
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,750
And you're treading
 on my feminist views.

1126
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,240
I don't know what to tell you.

1127
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,840
Want to make a bet you're wrong?

1128
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,480
What kind of bet?

1129
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,400
Well, if I'm right,
 you go to dinner with me.

1130
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,510
And if I'm right?

1131
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,190
Then that would be bad.

1132
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,450
I'd have to go to
 dinner with you.

1133
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:31,700
[SINGING]

1134
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,340
Hey.

1135
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,880
Where are the kids?

1136
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,390
They're in bed, El.

1137
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,940
OK, I can work with that.

1138
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,870
Is dinner ready?

1139
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,170
Why are you closing the window?

1140
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,870
It's hot.

1141
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,840
I'm closing the windows
 because I'm going to shout.

1142
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,170
Don't shout.

1143
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,860
I'm going to eat
 for three weeks

1144
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,500
straight and make my
 rear end so big you

1145
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,880
won't be able to get around
 it to get in to this house.

1146
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,530
What do you mean
 coming home at 2:30

1147
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,390
in the morning with
 that breath belching

1148
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,360
stupid questions like where are
 the kids and where's my dinner?

1149
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,320
I've been waiting.

1150
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,310
Your kids have been waiting.

1151
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,690
I fixed your dinner
 and you didn't

1152
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,730
even have the decency to call.

1153
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,430
What?

1154
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,200
I had a couple of
 beers at the Outpost.

1155
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,670
You had 40 beers
 at the Outpost.

1156
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,430
Where's dinner?

1157
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,690
You said you made dinner.

1158
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,950
It's at the bottom
 of the garbage.

1159
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,190
You go paw through it.

1160
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,900
Lorna, why are we shouting?

1161
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,030
You're not shouting.

1162
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,150
I'm shouting.

1163
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,230
Because you're never home.

1164
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,050
It's because this
 isn't the life I wanted

1165
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,540
and it is because of that
 stack of technical documents

1166
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,190
always piled up on that table.

1167
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,930
I've grown to hate it.

1168
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,760
I want to burn it.

1169
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,290
Why can't we have
 a home without it?

1170
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,170
A little shack that has
 nothing to do with NASA?

1171
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:53,890
We can as soon as the flight
 is over, we'll take a vacation.

1172
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,210
Vacation?

1173
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,820
That word doesn't exist
 in your vocabulary.

1174
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,940
You can't do this, El.

1175
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,090
You can't work 100 hour weeks.

1176
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,190
And you're away on these
 Defense Department assignments

1177
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,360
where we don't know where
 you are, you call us,

1178
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,380
but we don't know where you
 are or when you're coming home.

1179
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,090
You have 30 days
 vacation a year.

1180
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,770
You haven't taken one
 in the past seven.

1181
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,950
NASA is not just my job.

1182
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:28,650
It's my life.

1183
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,570
I made a commitment years ago.

1184
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:38,010
You made it with me.

1185
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,160
Whatever I do, I have to do it
 well or I don't do it at all.

1186
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,950
I'll try to do better, Lorna.

1187
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,130
No, don't do better.

1188
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,950
Do worse.

1189
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:58,700
Do less.

1190
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,440
Just-- just stop, El.

1191
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,490
Be with us.

1192
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,250
The girls and I are a
 part of your life too.

1193
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,390
Just come home.

1194
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:16,990
We miss you.

1195
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,250
And we take that vacation.

1196
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:25,950
I promise.

1197
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,900
This is not some grievance
 committee from the unions, Joe.

1198
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,240
These guys are members
 of the task force.

1199
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,360
They have a serious problem.

1200
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,360
The problem is the task
 force isn't getting anywhere.

1201
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,850
It doesn't have a priority.

1202
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,030
Roger, all three of
 you, Morton-Thiokol

1203
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,620
commissioned this task force.

1204
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,550
We saw a need for
 it and created it.

1205
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,820
It has a priority here.

1206
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,320
The word priority doesn't mean
 anything important at Thiokol.

1207
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,370
All priorities have
 the same priority.

1208
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:04,220
Roger, you work
 on one component

1209
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,870
of a single system
 of which there

1210
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,010
are hundreds in the shuttle.

1211
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,500
You know your component well.

1212
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,070
What you don't know is how
 a corporation is managed.

1213
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,740
That's something that
 I'm paid to know, right?

1214
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,250
And when I say that something
 has a priority, by God,

1215
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,750
it has a priority.

1216
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,770
This is a requisition
 for a function generator.

1217
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,890
We placed the order
 priority on September 24th.

1218
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,380
It's 10 days later, there's
 still no sign of it.

1219
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,290
This is a typical experience.

1220
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,580
Joe, this is a cry for help.

1221
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,410
We run into delays
 everywhere and every time

1222
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,660
we try to do something.

1223
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,490
This is a red flag.

1224
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,640
All right.

1225
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,500
Then you better tell me
 everything you're thinking.

1226
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,210
I'll tell you
 what I'm thinking.

1227
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,750
I'm thinking maybe
 Morton-Thiokol

1228
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,610
is trying to slow us down.

1229
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,490
Maybe they're afraid our
 task force will find out

1230
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,110
that the solid
 rocket boosters never

1231
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,980
should have been made with
 O-rings in the first place.

1232
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,150
That the O-rings can never
 be made strong enough

1233
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,770
to contain the hot gases.

1234
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,100
Maybe that's why we run
 into so many obstacles.

1235
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,100
How dare you make an
 accusation like that?

1236
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,540
Do you know what you're saying?

1237
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,280
You're darn right I
 know what I'm saying.

1238
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,500
I'm saying what's
 the explanation

1239
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,120
of why things go so slow?

1240
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,100
Even NASA sees
 were being blocked.

1241
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,030
They're sending an engineer
 next week to monitor

1242
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,770
the progress of our task force.

1243
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,590
Did you know about that?

1244
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,420
Of course, I know that.

1245
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,490
We got a problem, Joe.

1246
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,090
We need a way to
 get our work done.

1247
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,400
It's as simple as that.

1248
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,900
There's a problem,
 all right, and I can see

1249
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,060
it right here in front of me.

1250
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,340
You people want to go around
 the established system.

1251
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,320
That's possible in
 some cases, but nobody

1252
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,030
can take shortcuts
 that risk damaging

1253
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,800
the flight hardware we produce.

1254
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,740
Our first job is to provide the
 boosters that fly that shuttle.

1255
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,240
That's the point.

1256
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,730
We're supposed to find out if
 it's safe to fly the shuttle,

1257
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,270
and we can't get our work done.

1258
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,930
Oh, you can get
 your work done.

1259
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,270
When you come across a
 problem, you handle it.

1260
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,620
You don't come crying in here.

1261
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,730
You don't look for somebody
 else to get it solved.

1262
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:00,430
You solve it.

1263
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,880
You've been here a long time.

1264
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,340
You know what I'm talking about.

1265
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,590
Now we want a solution to the
 O-ring problem from this task

1266
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,310
force and we're going
 to have a solution,

1267
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,460
and it's going to be one that
 does not endanger production

1268
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,690
quality or production schedule.

1269
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,120
That's what I've
 got to tell you.

1270
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,070
That's all.

1271
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:34,180
I'm telling you, Joe,
 Morton-Thiokol should not ship

1272
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,520
any more solid rocket
 boosters, not until

1273
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,810
this O-ring problem is fixed.

1274
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:15,280
Excuse me, aren't
 you what's her name?

1275
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,080
Yes.

1276
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:16,840
Christa McAuliffe.

1277
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,860
Well, congratulations to
 you going up into space.

1278
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,560
Thank you.

1279
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,260
I can hardly wait.

1280
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,050
We won't keep you.

1281
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,890
We know you want to
 get on with your trip,

1282
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,950
but it's just so exciting
 to talk to you for a minute.

1283
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:26,650
Thank you.

1284
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,510
You have a wonderful
 time down here.

1285
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,360
You have a wonderful
 time up there.

1286
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,090
Thank you.

1287
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,180
All of America
 is proud of you.

1288
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:33,880
So proud.

1289
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,680
Howdy.

1290
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,380
Hi.

1291
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,140
Bob Mayfield.

1292
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,740
Hi, Bob.

1293
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,730
I've been looking
 forward to our meeting.

1294
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:49,280
I'll be working with
 you on the lesson plans.

1295
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,170
Sorry for the tardiness.

1296
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,670
I feel I need to
 respond to people,

1297
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,460
but it can sure throw
 your schedule off.

1298
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,620
Add three hours off
 by about 20 minutes.

1299
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,430
Really?

1300
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,420
Well that and whatever
 else is going on.

1301
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,030
Time sure can slip by.

1302
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,660
Anyway, shall we talk
 about the lesson plans?

1303
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,180
Yes, naturally I
 have some questions.

1304
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,430
Mainly, I wish I'd been
 consulted before the lesson

1305
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,110
plan got into a final form.

1306
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,120
Well, they had to be
 finalized before the teacher

1307
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,480
was selected because there's
 so much hardware to create.

1308
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,760
Time is another problem.

1309
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,050
Lesson plans have
 to get scripted.

1310
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:21,750
Scripted?

1311
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,450
Right.

1312
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,240
Why?

1313
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,470
Scheduling is one
 of most important

1314
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,610
elements in a shuttle flight.

1315
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,220
Everything's got to be
 timed and slotted exactly.

1316
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,490
All right, when I know
 how much time I've got,

1317
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,700
I'll fit my lesson plan to that.

1318
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,330
Well, I don't
 think that'll work.

1319
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,320
NASA wants every
 word written down.

1320
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,590
Well, NASA really
 should have talked

1321
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,940
to a teacher about all this.

1322
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,740
They did.

1323
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,440
I'm a teacher.

1324
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,080
Well, then, Bob, you
 know what I'm saying?

1325
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,280
This isn't a stage play.

1326
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,780
Teachers don't need speeches.

1327
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,110
All they need is their lesson
 plan and their students.

1328
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,710
It's worked for ages on earth,
 why shouldn't it work in space?

1329
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,180
Well, others will
 make that decision.

1330
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,270
Anything else?

1331
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,370
I don't see why there's
 so much emphasis on science.

1332
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,140
Shuttle's basically
 a scientific vehicle

1333
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,440
that gives us a platform where
 space science can be performed

1334
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,570
in front of millions of people.

1335
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,760
Yes, but a lot of
 people besides scientists

1336
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,160
will be involved in
 space in the future.

1337
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,620
There will be space
 schools, space post

1338
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,420
offices, space
 construction, space

1339
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,940
restaurants, space everything.

1340
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,950
I'd like my students
 to see themselves

1341
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,600
as a part of that big picture.

1342
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,960
That'd probably be a good
 idea in about 20 years.

1343
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,870
I mean, right now, we don't
 have any space post offices

1344
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,910
or space restaurants, so
 experiments about them

1345
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,710
won't be much help.

1346
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,890
It feels to me that the
 first lesson from space

1347
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,460
ought to be something
 everybody can understand.

1348
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,950
Of course, but I think
 we should be sending

1349
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,050
something more to our
 classrooms than just

1350
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,940
scientific experiments.

1351
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,920
I don't get what
 you're saying.

1352
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,390
Is it that you don't
 know much about science

1353
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,060
or you want to put your
 experience on this mission

1354
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,040
into a social studies course?

1355
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,070
What I'm saying is
 that NASA selected

1356
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,640
me because I'm a good teacher.

1357
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,950
I think they're
 right, and I don't

1358
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:05,100
think I need additional
 instruction in how to do that.

1359
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,220
Being the first teacher in
 space is a tremendous thrill,

1360
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,070
but it's not a
 personal trophy for me.

1361
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,220
Christa McAuliffe, one
 teacher, isn't the point.

1362
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,830
It's teaching.

1363
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,800
Teachers being acknowledged
 for the shaping hand

1364
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,970
they lay on the young
 lives of our country.

1365
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,020
Commander Scobee?

1366
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,370
Right.

1367
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,960
My name is Greg Jarvis.

1368
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,660
All right.

1369
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,920
How's it going, Greg Jarvis?

1370
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,290
Listen, I don't want
 to bother you now.

1371
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,660
I know you're busy
 preparing for the mission.

1372
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,630
I might be going with you.

1373
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,830
Well, is that so?

1374
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,730
Yeah, it's just
 a rumor still, but

1375
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,100
in case I wind up
 on your shuttle,

1376
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,390
I wanted to introduce myself.

1377
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:42,090
I'm--

1378
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,150
You're Greg Jarvis.

1379
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:43,850
Yeah.

1380
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:44,550
No.

1381
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,230
Well.

1382
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,200
But what I was going
 to say was, I'm

1383
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,100
really excited because I was
 assigned to two other missions

1384
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,450
and I was bumped both
 times, first by Senator Garn

1385
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,650
and then by Congressman Nelson.

1386
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,450
Well, what are you
 going to be doing?

1387
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,220
Experiments on
 how fluids behave

1388
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,020
in an orbiting space vehicle.

1389
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,320
I'm an engineer at Hughes.

1390
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,860
I won a contest to
 go on the shuttle.

1391
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,820
Well, congratulations.

1392
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,890
Listen, I'm glad
 to meet you Greg,

1393
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:10,210
but I'm not glad to hear about
 more experiments coming aboard.

1394
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,870
You think it'll be a problem?

1395
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,150
It's hard for me
 to explain to you

1396
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,220
just how big a problem it is.

1397
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,110
You see, by adding a
 passenger and his experiments

1398
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,580
that means total
 redistribution of crew space.

1399
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,780
It means revision of
 this activity plan here.

1400
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,830
You've already got all
 of this paraphernalia

1401
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:31,060
for Christa McAuliffe
 experiments.

1402
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,690
For example, now she's
 going to be doing a lesson

1403
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,650
in space about magnetism.

1404
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:36,090
Now, they wanted to bring
 iron filings aboard.

1405
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,340
Now, can you picture this?

1406
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,710
If those iron filings
 had ever gotten out

1407
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,110
of the container, first
 of all, they would

1408
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,240
have been inhaled by the crew.

1409
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,970
They would've gotten into
 the electronics equipment.

1410
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,380
Commander, if I'm lucky
 enough to go on this mission,

1411
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,050
I'll do everything I
 can to make it simple.

1412
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,750
I'll make it easy.

1413
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,740
Good luck.

1414
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,210
Watch your head.

1415
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:11,930
Good boy.

1416
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:21,290
All right, now, these are the
 lockers where all the food

1417
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,930
and supplies are kept, OK?

1418
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:29,120
And this is the airlock, or the
 door to the payload bay, OK?

1419
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,740
And Daddy's seat goes here.

1420
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,790
This is where he'll be
 when the shuttle flies.

1421
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:36,550
Now beside that door,
 which we call the hatch, now,

1422
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,840
can you say that?

1423
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,590
Hatch.

1424
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:39,620
Right and these are called?

1425
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,850
Lockers.

1426
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,980
Very good.

1427
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,530
I think our genius is
 ready to fly this thing.

1428
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:46,820
Well, I think so too.

1429
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,900
Maybe we should go
 to the flight deck?

1430
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,550
What do you think?

1431
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,250
Let's go.

1432
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:51,950
Come on.

1433
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,350
I'm going to go up first, OK?

1434
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,710
Let's go, Champ, come on.

1435
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:06,790
Here you go.

1436
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,490
I'll tell you what.

1437
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,100
You're going to sit over
 here in the pilot's seat,

1438
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,990
and we're not going to even
 use that poster because I

1439
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,930
don't think you need it.

1440
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:13,840
What do you think?

1441
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,540
Huh?

1442
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,250
OK?

1443
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:24,220
Now we're harnessed in,
 there go the main engines,

1444
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,300
and we're leaving the ground.

1445
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,380
Do you it, Reggie?

1446
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,350
Yes, Daddy, I see it.

1447
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:32,820
Challenger,
 initiate roll program.

1448
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,660
Roger, roll program.

1449
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,690
What do we do now?

1450
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,210
Throttle down.

1451
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,620
Challenger, throttle down.

1452
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,870
Throttle down, Houston.

1453
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,410
Go with throttle
 up, Challenger.

1454
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,920
Roger, throttle up.

1455
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,200
Now the solid rockets.

1456
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,040
SRV separated.

1457
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,860
And now we're
 going into orbit.

1458
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,670
Oh, look, Reggie.

1459
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,290
Look how we're leaving
 the earth behind us.

1460
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,290
Do you see that?

1461
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,860
And now we're going into space.

1462
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,150
Hear how quiet it is?

1463
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,570
Daddy, I hear.

1464
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,400
Oh, look, Reggie,
 we're coming into night.

1465
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,280
Look at all those stars.

1466
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,040
Do you see that, Reggie?

1467
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,470
Yes, Daddy, I see
 millions of them.

1468
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:42,700
We fly these things
 almost every day

1469
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,190
to keep our skills sharp.

1470
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,690
You don't want any
 rust on you when you're

1471
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,460
about to launch in the shuttle.

1472
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,210
Right, Scobe, I can see that.

1473
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,910
Take it easy now, guys.

1474
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,480
So first of all,
 when we get up there,

1475
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,350
we're going to try some dives
 because I want you to feel

1476
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,570
G-Forces like at liftoff.

1477
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,500
I warn you, Christa.

1478
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,320
This is not going to
 be like airline flying.

1479
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,160
I want to get you
 ready for what you're

1480
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,510
going to experience
 during liftoff and ascent

1481
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,000
and during reentry.

1482
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,050
You ready?

1483
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:09,750
Ready.

1484
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:10,450
All right.

1485
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,640
There we go.

1486
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,290
Now, you let me know if anything
 starts loosening up, all right?

1487
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,220
You keep this microphone
 right in front of your mouth

1488
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,270
so we can talk.

1489
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,430
Now your emergency
 oxygen is down there

1490
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,490
and these are the
 different radio bands here,

1491
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:39,010
and this is a stick that you fly
 with if anything happens to me.

1492
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,130
All right, Christa, here we go.

1493
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,720
(LAUGHING) Wow.

1494
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,400
They say about the T38,
 you keep the dirty side down.

1495
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,680
Oh.

1496
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,120
As you can see, it's just as
 easy to fly her belly side up.

1497
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,140
Want to stay here for a while?

1498
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,450
If it's my choice, Scobe--

1499
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,690
Uh-huh?

1500
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,430
I think I could see
 better right side up.

1501
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,930
All right.

1502
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,190
I'll show you what it feels
 like when we're dropping back

1503
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,960
through the Earth's atmosphere.

1504
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,930
It'll pull your clavicles
 down through your pelvis.

1505
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,100
You ready?

1506
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,680
Probably not actually.

1507
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,980
Here we go.

1508
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,920
Woo hoo hoo.

1509
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,830
Whoa.

1510
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,510
The bottom's dropping out.

1511
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,940
That's bad.

1512
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:04,330
Hold on to your bottom, Christa,
 you don't want to lose that.

1513
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,700
We'll go back up there now and
 do a couple of other maneuvers

1514
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,970
that'll show you what a
 graceful little bird we're in.

1515
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,100
These are known
 as aileron rolls.

1516
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,660
Once you get the hang of
 them, you can do them all day,

1517
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,060
but the constant turning
 makes some people queasy.

1518
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,480
You're not getting
 queasy, are you, Christa?

1519
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,340
It's yours, Christa.

1520
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:37,060
My what?

1521
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,940
Your airplane, fly it.

1522
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,640
Fly it?

1523
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,770
Just take control.

1524
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,470
She'll respond.

1525
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,940
Really?

1526
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,250
Absolutely.

1527
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,220
There's planes your friend.

1528
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:54,040
Oh.

1529
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,740
Wow.

1530
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,170
I have never known
 anything like this.

1531
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,630
Because there isn't
 anything like this.

1532
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:06,510
Go ahead, get creative.

1533
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,210
I'll try.

1534
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,950
Just something you
 can tell the kids about.

1535
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:14,810
OK, Scobe.

1536
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:34,040
Hey, that's pretty good.

1537
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,750
Try it again, to
 the left this time.

1538
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,480
Yes, sir.

1539
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,760
Hey, that was big time.

1540
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,830
Congratulations,
 Airman McAuliffe.

1541
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,610
Watch this.

1542
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,980
Even better.

1543
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,860
Did I earn my wings, Scobe?

1544
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:59,840
Absolutely, Christa.

1545
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,100
This is what I wanted
 to share with you.

1546
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,320
This is freedom.

1547
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,240
I hope it's something
 you'll remember.

1548
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,090
Oh, Scobe.

1549
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,060
There's just so much to learn.

1550
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,080
The insects and the humidity.

1551
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,280
There's cockroaches
 here you can saddle.

1552
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,330
My hair is constantly frizzled.

1553
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,030
Swell.

1554
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:54,400
We finally get to talk and
 I fill it with laments.

1555
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,640
Well, you're
 entitled, sweetheart.

1556
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,340
No.

1557
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,550
Don't even listen to me.

1558
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,560
This is ridiculous.

1559
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,980
I'm the most privileged
 person in the United States.

1560
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,120
I'm lonesome, Steven.

1561
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:13,560
I miss my old wooden table.

1562
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,740
I miss having dinner there.

1563
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,570
I miss reading to
 the kids at bedtime.

1564
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:24,490
I want to go to the airport,
 I want to get on a plane,

1565
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,530
I want to be home by midnight.

1566
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,050
I want to look in
 and kiss the kids,

1567
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,250
and I want to sleep
 in our own bed.

1568
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:30,950
Great.

1569
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:34,540
I'll put on some coffee.

1570
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,840
No.

1571
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,800
I won't.

1572
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,760
I'm fine.

1573
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,830
Let me say good
 night to the kids.

1574
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,530
OK.

1575
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,720
Scott's asleep,
 but Carolyn's here.

1576
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,070
Your mom would like
 to talk to you.

1577
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,300
Hi, Mom.

1578
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Hi, Darling.

01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,480
Are you in space yet?

01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,420
No, honey, not yet.

Well, when do you get there?

Well, you tell them that
 I'm as anxious as they are.

01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,900
I'll talk to you tomorrow night.

Thank you.

Well, I knew it was
 possible, but NASA just called

1621
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,100
tonight and gave me the word.

1622
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,780

 and I called my folks

01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,590
and went out and got
 something to eat,

1624

and I came back to my apartment.

 yawn and hit the sack.

 said I'm gonna find her.

 at these astronauts

in the world who
 could understand

exactly what you're feeling.

01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,130
sitting here to
 my left, and this

is our pilot, Michael Smith.

 be breaking up a bit.

Let me try the variable
 to light switch here.

01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,300
Talk to me back then.

01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,000
OK.

1663
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,700
OK.

01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,190
Well, what I'm trying
 to do is get this rig.

01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:30,620

1666
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,880
Yeah.

01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,600
I can hear you now.

01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,410

Now, that bolt I
 think turns to the left.

1671
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,610

 left, so you're going

 - Yeah.

 your checklist, all right?

01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:44,420
Yeah.

01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,020

Now I just want to remind you
 that when the aircraft comes

1708
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,810
to the top of the
 climb, the pilot puts it

1709

into a fall for
 about 30 seconds,

1710
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,640

 you'll be weightless.

01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,320
Why are those chemistry
 experiments so important?

1756
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,580
Can you tell me that?

1757
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,920
You're not interested in why
 I think those experiments are

1758
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,790
important, Christa.

1759
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:34,530
Say it again, let's
 see if I can hear it.

1760
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,660
I don't want to.

1761
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,850
I really don't.

1762
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,120
It's two different
 views of the world.

1763
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,350
You teach social studies,
 you see the world that way.

1764
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:43,220
It didn't seem possible for
 you to see it any other way.

1765
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:43,920
That's all.

1766
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,510
That's not all.

1767
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:47,700
Say everything
 about me or anything

1768
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,950
else, that'll help us the most.

1769
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:58,940
The idea of a
 school room in space

1770
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,890
ignited this little
 section I'm part of.

1771
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,270
We talked about it.

1772
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,060
We argued.

1773
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:11,890
We imagined, and out of
 it came a beautiful idea.

1774
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:16,030
A teacher performing an
 experiment in a weightless

1775
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:19,660
state while the students on
 Earth did it along with her

1776
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:23,720
and saw the fantastically
 different results.

1777
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,280
And that single action would
 illuminate the greatest mystery

1778
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:33,150
that surrounds us, gravity.

1779
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,830
I think something
 all the teachers here

1780
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:39,240
share is the desire
 just once or twice along

1781
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:43,260
the way to have our students
 absolutely awed by what

1782
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:48,810
they're learning, and we thought
 this experiment would do that.

1783
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,940
I guess that's why we had
 such high hopes for it.

1784
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,750
So what we'd like,
 Larry, what Morton-Thiokol

1785
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:00,260
would really like is a
 close out on the O-rings.

1786
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,330
Close out?

1787
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,290
Close out means the
 problem's solved.

1788
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,330
Right.

1789
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:07,360
But the problem with
 the O-rings isn't solved.

1790
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,880
The problem with the O-rings
 is being tracked through

1791
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,680
the monthly board review.

1792
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,350
Giving a close out here isn't
 going to change the work we're

1793
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,000
doing or the speed we do it at.

1794
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,910
It'll just keep the review
 books from getting fatter.

1795
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,170
I'm not sure I got that.

1796
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:23,950
Look, giving a close
 out would keep the O-ring

1797
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,520
situation on one set of books.

1798
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,580
It'll get rid of mountains
 of unnecessary paperwork.

1799
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,590
The books?

1800
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,800
One set, two sets, three
 sets are there to tell us

1801
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,580
we've got a problem, Al.

1802
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,460
Now the way to keep the
 books from getting fatter

1803
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:39,310
isn't to close them out,
 it's to solve the problem.

1804
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,880
We're trying to
 solve the problem,

1805
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,260
but all this paperwork
 really slows us down.

1806
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:48,000
Boisjoly, Ebling, all of them
 are asking for less paperwork.

1807
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,710
Al, paperwork is
 not the problem.

1808
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,960
And it is not the answer
 to what's taking so long.

1809
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,120
Now that's my question.

1810
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,330
What is taking so long?

1811
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:59,410
You know, I am deeply
 committed to the idea

1812
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,810
that finding a solution
 to the O-ring problem

1813
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,490
should not take
 longer than it took

1814
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:08,150
to invent the entire
 solid rocket booster.

1815
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,340
I can't know who's to blame.

1816
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:15,230
You or us, but this thing
 is not moving fast enough.

1817
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:19,720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1818
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,080
That was wonderful, Ron.

1819
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:29,770
Thank you.

1820
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,280
Did you want to be a
 musician when you were a kid?

1821
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,230
My grandmother took charge of
 what I wanted when I was a kid.

1822
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,260
What did she want?

1823
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,010
For me to finish high school.

1824
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:44,840
She had her hand on
 my back for 10 years.

1825
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,820
I mean, it took some doing.

1826
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:47,620
A black boy graduating
 from high school

1827
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:53,080
in Lake City, South Carolina in
 the 50s was not a usual thing.

1828
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,350
When I graduated from college,
 I rush back home, well,

1829
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,910
my little brother was graduating
 from my same high school,

1830
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:01,030
but that was not the
 reason I rushed home.

1831
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,580
My grandmother was
 graduating too.

1832
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,590
What did she think
 you should do next?

1833
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,660
Well, she says I
 have too many degrees,

1834
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,750
so I should decide for myself.

1835
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,370
What do you do with
 all those degrees?

1836
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,600
Well, I think after
 this mission is over,

1837
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,890
I'm going to go back to
 South Carolina and teach.

1838
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,800
Folks, we have a
 personal best here tonight.

1839
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,320
Ron McNair is the most
 lucid guy at NASA.

1840
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,000
When it comes to describing
 technical things,

1841
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,060
he'll fascinate you.

1842
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,980
I've never heard him talk
 so long about himself.

1843
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:37,820
I think that's right JR.

1844
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,520
Come on, now.

1845
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,680
You've got to play this.

1846
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,650
No.
 No.

1847
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:42,420
No more for me.

1848
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:43,620
As a matter of fact,
 we have a press

1849
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,090
conference tomorrow morning.

1850
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:48,610
Besides it's your turn,
 JR. Who raised you?

1851
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:49,800
Oh, no you don't.

1852
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,420
Come on, Ron, play.

1853
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,180
Come on, please?

1854
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:52,880
No.

1855
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,020
Just one more than we'll go.

1856
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,050
You know, you twisted my arm.

1857
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,760
This will be the
 last press opportunity

1858
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,350
as this crew will
 be in quarantine

1859
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,630
between now and the time
 that they leave for the Cape.

1860
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
 the crew of STS 51L,

1861
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,540
Dick Scobee Commander.

1862
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,550
OK, Mark, why don't
 we get it started?

1863
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:30,960
Commander Scobee, what do you
 enjoy most about spaceflight?

1864
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,850
Oh.

1865
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,780
All of it, I guess.

1866
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,570
In particular, now
 there is a launch

1867
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,490
with all that
 associated machinery

1868
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:41,730
going off all at the same time.

1869
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,890
You've been waiting five
 years to get into space,

1870
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:45,460
was it worth the wait?

1871
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,590
Well, we were
 told that it would

1872
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:50,190
take five years when we got
 here, so it seems about right.

1873
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,750
Are you excited?

1874
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,070
Yeah, sure, you bet.

1875
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:54,170
Do you have kids?

1876
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:55,080
Yeah, three kids.

1877
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,450
Are they excited?

1878
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:57,150
And how.

1879
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:58,380
They couldn't wait
 to get to Florida

1880
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:01,110
so they can go to Disney World.

1881
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:03,780
El, you've been on
 the shuttle before.

1882
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,030
Do you think taking
 civilians up,

1883
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:10,860
any civilians, teachers,
 politicians, is a good idea?

1884
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,050
I personally don't
 feel that we should

1885
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:15,670
consider spaceflight routine.

1886
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,790
There's still a lot of
 questions about the shuttle.

1887
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,500
We should make sure
 it's as safe as possible

1888
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,500
before we start flying
 too many civilians.

1889
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,330
On the other hand,
 I wouldn't mind

1890
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:27,030
a malfunction or two once
 the Challenger reaches orbit.

1891
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,460
I spent a lot of time,
 hours, underwater training

1892
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,850
for an emergency spacewalk,
 and I'm anxious to try one.

1893
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:35,100
You mean, you hope
 something goes wrong?

1894
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,980
Well, I'd love to shimmy up
 that remote manipulator arm.

1895
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,360
Feel like climbing a
 coconut tree back home.

1896
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,950
You're the payload
 specialists on this slide, Judy,

1897
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,450
aren't you?

1898
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:47,710
Mission specialist.

1899
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:50,320
What about the malfunctions
 in the simulator?

1900
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,810
Do you find them difficult?

1901
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,970
I wouldn't say
 difficult. It's a matter

1902
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:58,030
of understanding the systems
 and practicing a lot.

1903
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:58,870
That's how we train.

1904
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,640
We practice a lot.

1905
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,100
Do you practice so much that
 when you actually get there,

1906
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,110
it's an anticlimax.

1907
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:07,900
When you get there, it's
 just like you practiced it.

1908
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,340
That's what the
 simulators are for,

1909
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,530
to give you real situations.

1910
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:13,090
Judy, do you
 think that Christa

1911
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:16,210
could humanize space better
 than the astronauts have?

1912
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,710
Christa is a
 wonderful teacher,

1913
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:19,930
but we haven't
 talked about that.

1914
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:21,840
You ought to ask
 her what she thinks.

1915
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,240
Christa, are you excited yet?

1916
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,040
Well, when this
 started, I didn't

1917
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,680
think I could get
 any more excited,

1918
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,540
but it just keeps
 building and building.

1919
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:34,660
I'll probably be a nervous
 wreck by the time we launch.

1920
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,610
Didn't your family
 come down for a visit?

1921
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,140
Yes, they did.

1922
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,040
NASA was wonderful.

1923
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,380
They took them on a tour
 of the whole Space Center.

1924
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,590
What part did they like best?

1925
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,680
Well, I asked my daughter
 Caroline what she enjoyed most,

1926
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,980
she said the tuna sandwich.

1927
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,250
Christa, do you have any
 concerns about the trip?

1928
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,900
Are you worried?

1929
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,390
Are you afraid?

1930
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:00,480
Well, I can honestly
 say that I'm not .

1931
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,130
Maybe I will be when I
 walk across that catwalk,

1932
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:07,050
but right now there's
 so much to do.

1933
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:11,370
This crew has made me feel
 that I'm a part of them.

1934
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,200
There's no group of
 people that I'd rather

1935
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,810
be sharing this adventure
 with, no group of people

1936
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,970
that I'd rather leave our
 planet with than the people

1937
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,410
at this table.

1938
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,420
Is that crew, Commander?

1939
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:25,070
Has Christa really
 become part of the crew?

1940
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:26,880
Well, thinking anybody
 who hasn't been trained

1941
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,510
is an astronaut is just
 something you'd rather not do.

1942
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:33,630
And we had to watch Christa
 stumble around a bit,

1943
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:38,370
but she's shown a special
 person that she is,

1944
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:42,190
and I don't believe any of
 us would go without her now.

1945
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:43,890
Christa says
 she's not worried,

1946
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:47,190
but fear might hit her when
 she starts to get on board.

1947
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:50,610
What could you say to
 put her mind at ease?

1948
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,810
I could tell her
 that she's right.

1949
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,430
The unknown is
 mysterious, frightening.

1950
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,640
When she walks out and she
 sees those giant boosters

1951
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:04,050
and the big tank, 6 million
 pounds of fire and thunder

1952
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:06,850
smoking, she'll know it's real.

1953
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,940
Ron, I understand that
 you often visit schools

1954
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,860
and talk to young people.

1955
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,700
Yes.

1956
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:14,490
What do you tell them?

1957
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:16,630
Well, that's not really the
 province of today's questions,

1958
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,330
is it?

1959
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:19,150
Why don't you ask me
 questions about laser physics

1960
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,240
or Halley's comet?

1961
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:24,770
It's an aspect of you
 that I'd like to know about.

1962
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:28,520
All right, I tell them it
 doesn't matter who you are,

1963
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,970
where you come from, or
 how much money you have,

1964
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,830
if you want to reach
 a goal badly enough

1965
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:38,560
and you're willing to
 work hard to get it,

1966
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,790
you can be what you want to be.

1967
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:44,410
How does it feel
 to finally be getting

1968
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:46,330
a chance to fly in the shuttle?

1969
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,350
All right.

1970
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:50,030
Well, basically, fantastic.

1971
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:51,850
And you're on board to?

1972
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:55,390
Do fluid dynamics
 experiments, observe how fluids

1973
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,040
behave in a weightless state.

1974
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,730
Or how I behave in
 a weightless state.

1975
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:02,380
You came late to this mission,
 been with this crew what,

1976
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,460
five or six weeks?

1977
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,660
Six, yes.

1978
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:08,420
What feelings do
 you have about them?

1979
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,000
Admiration.

1980
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,390
I wish I could say
 this better, but I'm

1981
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:17,120
honored to be one of them.

1982
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,710
All right, I think this is
 a good point to wrap this up.

1983
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:21,680
We'll see our
 astronauts at the Cape.

1984
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,100
Thank you, everyone.

1985
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,280
That's beautiful, Darien.

1986
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,390
Beautiful.

1987
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:57,750
Music to live by.

1988
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,890
That was so good.

1989
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:06,650
All right, ready?

1990
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:07,570
Bye bye, son.

1991
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,270
Bye bye.

1992
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:10,540
You gonna give Daddy a kiss.

1993
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,340
And a hug.

1994
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:12,280
And a hug.

1995
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:12,980
Yeah.

1996
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,670
Don't go, Daddy.

1997
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:20,990
Daddy's got to go, Reggie.

1998
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,480
You stay with Mama now.

1999
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,410
I want to go with Daddy.

2000
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,580
Three good engines.

2001
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,650
You better be going, Ron.

2002
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:30,640
OK.

2003
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,590
Here we go, buddy.

2004
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:35,780
Bye bye, Baby.

2005
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,480
I love you.

2006
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,770
I love you.

2007
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,740
Bye bye.

2008
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,170
I'll see you down at
 the Cape, OK, honey?

2009
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:43,870
Bye.

2010
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,500
Bye bye.

2011
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,370
And where's my big girl?

2012
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:51,520
Here you are.

2013
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,380
Come Here, you.

2014
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,260
Oh.

2015
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,490
I'll see you later.
 Bye bye.

2016
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:56,240
Bye, honey.

2017
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,080
Come on, Scott, let's go.

2018
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,820
Now I don't want you
 to worry about anything.

2019
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,580
I'll run this place
 like boot camp.

2020
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:05,110
Good enough.

2021
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:06,620
And we'll be
 thinking about you.

2022
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:17,430
Look, Scott, you
 know there are always

2023
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:20,490
risks involved in spaceflight.

2024
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:24,150
You have to think about that
 because something could happen.

2025
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:29,080
If something did happen,
 you'd have to be strong.

2026
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,780
I know, Dad.

2027
01:35:32,290 --> 01:35:34,160
So don't let anything happen.

2028
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,270
But I'll be strong,
 if you need me.

2029
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,940
Well, I didn't mean
 to get into all that.

2030
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,920
My Six Months at NASA,
 by Christa McAuliffe.

2031
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,610
But while we were all talking,
 I looked out the window

2032
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:57,230
and I saw our shuttle
 pointing up at the sky,

2033
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:00,170
and Bradley's
 voice drifted back,

2034
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:02,090
you better tell Steve
 to stock up on a lot

2035
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:02,950
more cornflakes, Christa.

2036
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,410
Then the dam broke, memories
 of the whole past six months.

2037
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:11,060
I can believe it, Christa.

2038
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,310
I've watched you go
 through a big change.

2039
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:14,750
What do you think
 is your most important

2040
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:16,910
discovery in those six months?

2041
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:21,610
What I'll remember most
 is what I've learned,

2042
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:24,750
something about
 flying the shuttle,

2043
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:29,130
a little about
 propulsion systems, a lot

2044
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:30,860
about excellence.

2045
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:32,760
Well, let's see how much
 you've really change, Christa.

2046
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,780
What's 9 times 7.

2047
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,200
Quick.

2048
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,340
64.

2049
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:37,740
That's a 2% error.

2050
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,850
Now that's pretty good.

2051
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,720
Not in my class.

2052
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,930
Well, the real journey begins
 tomorrow, folks, so what do

2053
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,570
you say we go in and
 get everybody fed?

2054
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,830
Great idea.

2055
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:50,070
Let's go.

2056
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:51,030
No more scrubs.

2057
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,040
I'm tired of those.

2058
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,440
- Let's just go.
 - I thought I'd just ask.

2059
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,140
Yeah.

2060
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,910
Hi, Horace.

2061
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:10,960
Gene, everybody, I'm leaving
 you a cold legacy, Horace.

2062
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,210
We got a hard freeze coming
 in tonight around 2:00.

2063
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:14,710
Yeah, I heard.

2064
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,900
We had a freeze just
 about this time last year.

2065
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,860
We worked out that
 freeze protection plan.

2066
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,670
Right.

2067
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:20,570
We're going to try it.

2068
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:21,700
How'd it work?

2069
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,790
Well, the only protection
 we can give the launch pad

2070
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,710
is from the inside, so
 we run water continuously

2071
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,270
through the pipes in
 all of the showers

2072
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:30,700
to keep it from freezing,
 just like you do at home.

2073
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,120
Well, let's get it ready.

2074
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,330
Lower 20s, we're going to
 need everything we got.

2075
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:36,010
Better put the ice
 team on a special alert.

2076
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,810
Right.

2077
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:39,340
What do we got
 from the contractors?

2078
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,110
Anybody say how this
 freeze is going to affect

2079
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:42,450
the principle systems?

2080
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,150
Nothing yet.

2081
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:50,680
Any other element in the solid
 rockets this cold will affect?

2082
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:54,230
Oh, I think the
 O-rings is the main one.

2083
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:57,080
The O-rings are made of rubber
 and rubber is affected by cold,

2084
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,330
so we know we've got
 some kind of problem.

2085
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:01,830
How much of a
 problem, we can't tell.

2086
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,780
We don't have enough data.

2087
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,720
No tests have ever
 been run on the O-rings

2088
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,490
at temperatures that low.

2089
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:12,560
I want to get Marshall
 in on this right away.

2090
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,900
Let's get Cecil Houston to
 arrange a telephone conference

2091
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,300
between us and the Marshall
 engineers both down at Kennedy

2092
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,980
and at Huntsville.

2093
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:22,070
This problem could
 definitely affect the launch.

2094
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:26,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
 this is a diamond stylus.

2095
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,060
This is a magnum of champagne.

2096
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:33,930
We're going to carve on
 the one with the other.

2097
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:36,200
Then what are we going to
 do, put it in a time capsule?

2098
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,900
Oh, no, no, no, everyone
 gets to carve their name on it,

2099
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,310
and then when we're
 back home in Houston,

2100
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:43,220
we have one hell of a party
 and this bottle of champagne

2101
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,090
gets to kick it off.

2102
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:44,790
All right.

2103
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:57,230
Nobody reporting launch
 violations due to the cold?

2104
01:39:57,230 --> 01:39:58,900
Not yet, Horace.

2105
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,140
Kind of hard to believe.

2106
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,720
Is tomorrow definite?

2107
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,150
As definite as we can
 be with this weather.

2108
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:06,130
Well, looking at the
 predictions for tonight,

2109
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:07,450
you could have a delay.

2110
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:08,800
If there's another
 scrub, how will

2111
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,960
that affect future flights?

2112
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,640
We're planning on
 launching tomorrow.

2113
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,090
If there's a delay, we'll
 deal with it as we always do.

2114
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,460
Aren't you getting tight
 for the March 6 launch?

2115
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:19,810
Our schedule is always tight.

2116
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:20,680
We're used to tight.

2117
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,480
But to have any hope of
 keeping the schedule you've

2118
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,420
announced for 1986, don't
 you have to get Challenger

2119
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,160
off within the next two days?

2120
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,630
No, that isn't exactly so.

2121
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:30,780
Well, we know the March
 6 launch can't be moved,

2122
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,480
so how are you--

2123
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,880
I want to be perfectly
 clear about something.

2124
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,730
The decision to launch
 Challenger or any other orbiter

2125
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:39,550
will not be influenced
 by schedule pressure.

2126
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:42,520
We'll sit on the ground until
 we believe it's safe to go.

2127
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,120
The safety of the
 crew and the orbiter

2128
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,750
will be the sole criterion.

2129
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:53,140
This is Cecil, Houston.

2130
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,720
I think we have
 everyone connected.

2131
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,010
Can you all hear me?

2132
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:57,990
Yes.

2133
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,710
Yeah.

2134
01:40:58,710 --> 01:40:59,410
Yes.

2135
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:01,510
Morton-Thiokol has
 some concerns about

2136
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:03,100
the effect the cold
 weather might have

2137
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,120
on the solid rocket boosters.

2138
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,060
So let's get started.

2139
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,270
Morton-Thiokol, do you
 want to kick it off?

2140
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:10,370
I will.

2141
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,660
I've got a question.

2142
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:14,260
I keep getting this
 boomerfest every time.

2143
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:17,110
Wait a minute, I'm
 getting a voice delay.

2144
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:19,230
Maybe if you talk
 a little slower.

2145
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:21,960
All right, let's try it again.

2146
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,460
Go ahead, Judson.

2147
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,340
What did you guys at
 Morton-Thiokol come up with?

2148
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,820
Will these low temperatures
 affect the performance

2149
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:30,570
of the solid rockets?

2150
01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:32,520
We've been working
 on it, Judson.

2151
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,840
There's really no
 experience base

2152
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,430
for that kind of
 low temperature,

2153
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,750
but it does look
 like there could

2154
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,470
be serious problems in
 launching in this kind of cold.

2155
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:41,370
Can you give us
 some specifics?

2156
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:44,150
I lost it after what he
 about serious problems.

2157
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,890
I keep hearing my own
 voice coming back at me.

2158
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:46,590
Wait.

2159
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:47,290
Wait.

2160
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:49,920
We didn't get that, Stan.

2161
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,610
We're not getting
 anywhere with this.

2162
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:53,610
The problem is we're
 on a two wire system that

2163
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:56,120
can't carry this much traffic.

2164
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,660
We're going to have to go out to
 the marshall office at Kennedy,

2165
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:01,650
use the telecom system
 they got set up out there.

2166
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,290
You all stay right
 where you are.

2167
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:05,200
Set to separate.

2168
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,630
That OK with everybody?

2169
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:07,490
Yeah.

2170
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:08,190
Yes.

2171
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:09,330
OK, I'll be here.

2172
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,240
Look at that.

2173
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:22,540
Well, I think it's
 about that time, folks.

2174
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,760
Yeah, it's time for the families
 to head on home, because

2175
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,760
from this point on, I want the
 crew to be thinking of nothing

2176
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,780
but the mission, all right?

2177
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,940
Nobody's going home.

2178
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:33,130
There are parties here in
 Titusville, parties in Orlando.

2179
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,640
We have three bus
 loads of our own.

2180
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,340
Y'all have fun.

2181
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,680
I'll be in much more of a
 party mood when I get back.

2182
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,830
I'll see you in a week, hon.

2183
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:42,800
OK.

2184
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,560
I did it.

2185
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,640
Your thesis?

2186
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:45,340
Yeah.

2187
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,590
When the flight got delayed,
 I called the university

2188
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:49,900
and they said if I mailed
 it before the launch

2189
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,670
that they would give
 me my degree in orbit.

2190
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,950
The first degree
 awarded in space.

2191
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:56,860
Greg, this is inspiring.

2192
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:59,440
Well, you've got to get it
 to Hughes by tomorrow morning

2193
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,000
so they can type it up and
 take it over to the university.

2194
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,100
Oh, it'll be
 there first thing.

2195
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,990
There ought to be
 something momentous to say.

2196
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:08,910
Like what?

2197
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:11,540
There's nothing that we
 need to say to each other.

2198
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:14,730
Well, something better than
 see you in a week, honey.

2199
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:16,190
I'll see you in
 a week sounds good.

2200
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,790
Hits it on the head.

2201
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:21,270
Well, catch some
 stardust for me, will ya?

2202
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,710
All I can hold.

2203
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,670
See ya in a week, honey.

2204
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:41,630
Oh, thank you.

2205
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,310
You look for me and
 the kids tomorrow, OK?

2206
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:45,050
We'll be the ones waving.

2207
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:47,230
I'll spot you.

2208
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:48,290
The kids OK?

2209
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:49,260
Oh, they're fine.

2210
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,120
Fine.

2211
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,750
They're excited.

2212
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,120
I told them I'd take them to
 Disney World if you didn't go,

2213
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,540
but I have a feeling
 you're going to go.

2214
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:59,680
I think you'll
 finally be up there.

2215
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,000
I love you, sweetheart.

2216
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,630
I love you, sweetheart.

2217
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,970
And I love you
 and the kids more

2218
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:09,500
than anything on this earth.

2219
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,530
I'll pull out
 the nightstand now.

2220
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:18,760
Quiet.

2221
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,890
You take care, OK?

2222
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:20,590
Kiss for the kids.

2223
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:22,420
OK, bye.

2224
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,430
Bye.

2225
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,130
Watch it.

2226
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:24,940
This is Janelle's.

2227
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:26,110
She doesn't like her swea--

2228
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:35,770
Some swell time for you
 to get romantic, eh, you.

2229
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,690
You want to hang around?

2230
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:40,380
I want you to hang around.

2231
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,290
I'm going to throw away
 your roller skates.

2232
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,560
OK, bye.

2233
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,070
Cecil Houston.

2234
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:01,170
This is the Coast Guard.

2235
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:01,870
Yes, sir.

2236
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:03,670
What can I do for
 the Coast Guard?

2237
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:06,070
We're in communication with
 your two recovery vessels,

2238
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:07,690
the ones that will pick
 up the solid rocket

2239
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:09,300
boosters after launch tomorrow.

2240
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,000
Yes.

2241
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,690
They're on station 120
 miles due east of here.

2242
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,390
Right.

2243
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:14,670
That's right.

2244
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,210
They're in a full
 gale out there.

2245
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:17,800
Captain Devlin says
 he's never been

2246
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,840
in conditions like these
 outside of a hurricane

2247
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,370
in the North Atlantic.

2248
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:25,270
50 knot winds, extended
 gusts holding at 72 knots,

2249
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:27,430
waves 30 feet high.

2250
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:30,700
Those are shallow draft
 vessels and they're in survival

2251
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,920
mode heading back to Houston.

2252
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:35,400
The thing is, they won't be on
 station to retrieve the rockets

2253
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,940
if you launch in the morning.

2254
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:40,130
Don't know if that will
 affect your plans or not.

2255
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:41,590
No, I did get your
 message, Christa.

2256
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:43,510
I was sorry not to have
 a chance to say goodbye

2257
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,730
so I'm glad you called again.

2258
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:48,880
I called because I thought
 about our discussions, Bob,

2259
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:54,290
and I really do think you all
 created a beautiful experiment.

2260
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:57,220
I had to become a student
 again to appreciate it.

2261
01:45:57,220 --> 01:46:01,570
I just wanted to say that
 and I wanted to thank you.

2262
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:02,370
That's great, Christa.

2263
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:03,260
I'll tell everybody.

2264
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:03,960
I hope you will.

2265
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,170
It'll mean a lot to me.

2266
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:06,970
It'll mean a lot to them.

2267
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:10,080
Say, did I sound like a
 Texan when I said y'all?

2268
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:10,780
There you go.

2269
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:13,900
Now you're talking English.

2270
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:16,240
Listen, have a
 good trip, Christa.

2271
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,700
I think we all had a chance to
 become students again and learn

2272
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,560
something from each other.

2273
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,330
I know I'm speaking for
 everybody here when I say

2274
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:24,280
we'll be thinking about you.

2275
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:27,090
I'll carry that with me.

2276
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:28,700
See you when I get back, Bob.

2277
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:30,480
All right.

2278
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,610
Bye.

2279
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,320
Bye bye.

2280
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,620
This is Cecil Houston.

2281
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,530
I think everybody's hooked up.

2282
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,390
I want to say first
 that the boost recovery

2283
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,610
vessels are fighting a hell
 of a gale about 100 miles

2284
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:48,440
out to sea.

2285
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,710
Soon as this telecom
 is over, I'll

2286
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,050
have to see if
 Arnie Aldrich wants

2287
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:54,580
to launch without those
 vessels on station.

2288
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,960
OK, Bob Lund, why
 don't you start?

2289
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,480
This is Joe Kilminster.

2290
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,460
Earlier today, we were
 informed about the extremely

2291
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:04,670
low temperatures predicted
 for tomorrow morning's launch.

2292
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:05,900
The main question
 we're looking at

2293
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,790
is how the O-rings in
 the solid rocket booster

2294
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:08,950
would be affected.

2295
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:11,030
Now we put together some
 charts with information

2296
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:12,290
from previous flights.

2297
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:15,990
We'll go over those and then
 make our recommendations.

2298
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:17,360
Give us a minute, will ya?

2299
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:21,630
The charts are just
 coming over the fax now.

2300
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,120
Yeah, that's fine.

2301
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,500
Sorry about the delay.

2302
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,270
Arnie Thompson
 and Roger Boisjoly

2303
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:28,250
have been doing the research.

2304
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,580
They'll make the presentation.

2305
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,280
Arnie?

2306
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:38,590
We have no data on O-rings
 operating at temperatures this

2307
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:42,520
low, but we've put
 together a rationale based

2308
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,620
on the information we have.

2309
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:49,000
The charts are mostly not
 typed, so if there's a problem

2310
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,510
reading them, let us know.

2311
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,270
I'll begin by
 citing flight 15,

2312
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:54,650
which was launched a year ago.

2313
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,880
The temperature
 at that launch was

2314
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,290
53 degrees, which is the coldest
 reading experience to date.

2315
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:02,720
We're faxing a chart now
 that shows the O-ring erosion

2316
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,610
on that flight.

2317
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:05,800
Any questions so far?

2318
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:06,500
Go ahead.

2319
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,020
We've got the chart
 coming through.

2320
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:12,530
The Air Force estimates 29
 degrees at launch tomorrow

2321
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:13,730
morning.

2322
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:15,860
That is far below any
 temperature we've launched

2323
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:19,430
with before, so determining
 if this extreme cold

2324
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:24,830
will affect the O-rings, and if
 it does, how much, is critical.

2325
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:28,490
The chart you're
 getting relate to that.

2326
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:31,490
The indication is that
 the cold hardened O-rings

2327
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:33,470
will be slower in sealing.

2328
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:35,240
Therefore, there could
 be hot gas leakage

2329
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,880
past the primary
 seal, and because

2330
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,660
of that increased danger of
 the backup O-ring being eroded.

2331
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,300
So our recommendation is?

2332
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:46,820
You should see it on the
 sheet coming through now.

2333
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:49,190
Not launching until
 the temperature

2334
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:51,010
is at least 53 degrees.

2335
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:53,240
Whoa.

2336
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,470
Wait a minute.

2337
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:56,610
Am I looking at
 the right charts?

2338
01:48:56,610 --> 01:49:00,570
The charts I've got don't
 support that conclusion.

2339
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:01,890
They do.

2340
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:02,830
I think they do.

2341
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:04,400
Well, I've listened to
 everything you've said

2342
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,550
and I just don't see how
 you got that recommendation.

2343
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:10,240
Well, it's not logical.

2344
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:13,070
Why it's perfectly logical.

2345
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:15,530
Well, you began by saying
 what you're presenting can't be

2346
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:18,120
proved, and I agree, it can't.

2347
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,230
But now you're drawing
 serious conclusions from it,

2348
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:22,670
and you're making very
 serious recommendations.

2349
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,770
Serious recommendations
 are called for.

2350
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:27,270
Well, of course,
 that's why we're here.

2351
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:29,450
But what you're saying
 sounds like Morton-Thiokol

2352
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:31,910
is establishing new
 launch commit criteria

2353
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:33,830
the night before a launch.

2354
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:36,740
Now these solid rocket boosters
 have been operating under very

2355
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,210
definite specifications.

2356
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:40,190
You suddenly want
 to change them.

2357
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:44,270
You now want to base everything
 on this 53 degree benchmark.

2358
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:46,880
At that rate, it could be spring
 before the shuttle would fly.

2359
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,250
My god, Thiokol, when do you
 want me to launch, next April?

2360
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:54,110
No, I don't think we want to
 change launch commit criteria.

2361
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,820
We're trying to see
 if it's safe to launch

2362
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:59,300
with the O-rings experiencing
 these severe temperatures.

2363
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,060
The benchmark of 53 degrees
 is based on my personal

2364
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:04,850
observation of flight 15,
 where we had O-ring erosion

2365
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:07,430
and blow by in both boosters.

2366
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:10,310
By blow by, I mean the gases
 went right past the O-ring,

2367
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:13,790
didn't erode it, didn't
 even take the shine off it.

2368
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,650
That tells us lower
 temperature is a factor.

2369
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:18,800
Right, I'm looking at
 your chart on flight 15.

2370
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,400
There was erosion, but the
 worst erosion we've ever had

2371
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,110
was on flight 2
 and the temperature

2372
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:25,920
outside was 70 degrees.

2373
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,260
Now where in what
 you're presenting

2374
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:30,260
is the correlation between
 low temperature and erosion?

2375
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,300
Your charts even seem
 to support the opposite.

2376
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,710
I'm not talking
 about only erosion.

2377
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:37,070
I'm talking about blow by
 is the important thing here.

2378
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:40,770
All right, but where is the
 connection to low temperature?

2379
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:44,150
If the worst erosion
 occurred at 70 degrees,

2380
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:47,090
where is your data
 to support your idea

2381
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:51,160
of a connectionless between
 low temperature and erosion?

2382
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,450
I don't have any other
 data than what I sent to you,

2383
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:56,200
but I saw with my own eyes there
 was a much larger arch of soot

2384
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,260
between the two O-rings.

2385
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,280
The soot was much
 blacker and it penetrated

2386
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,660
all the way to the secondary
 ring, which was also scorched.

2387
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,580
When I see he grease
 was black, I mean

2388
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,440
it was black just like coal.

2389
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,940
It was jet black.

2390
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:13,150
What does the color
 mean, do you know?

2391
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:15,970
What engineering data supports
 your idea that the color

2392
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:18,520
of soot means something?

2393
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:19,640
Maybe it does, but what?

2394
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:23,080
It would be very dangerous
 to start guessing at it.

2395
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,990
I have no other data than
 what I'm presenting to you.

2396
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:27,700
I have tried to
 get additional data

2397
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,620
as a member of the O-ring
 task force since last October,

2398
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,930
but I have not been successful.

2399
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,770
I'm looking at some
 of your other charts.

2400
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,120
Oh, this chart on flight 22.

2401
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,860
Are you looking at that one?

2402
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:43,900
Yes.

2403
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:46,130
On flight 22, there
 was also blow by past

2404
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:48,350
the primary O-ring, right?

2405
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,460
That's correct.

2406
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:52,820
Yeah, but the temperature
 that day was 75 degrees,

2407
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:54,320
so I'm not clear
 what you're saying.

2408
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,150
If low temperature
 has a dangerous effect

2409
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:58,310
on the O-rings, why
 do we have both blow

2410
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,280
by and erosion at 75 degrees?

2411
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,260
I'm not talking
 about only erosion

2412
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,460
and damage to the O-ring.

2413
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,860
I'm talking about blow by
 as revealed by the post

2414
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:09,410
flight analysis
 of flight 15 when

2415
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:11,430
the temperature was 53 degrees.

2416
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:13,880
All, right how much
 erosion was there?

2417
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:16,070
It was minor compared
 to other erosions

2418
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:18,350
but it was black and
 sooty and more extensive.

2419
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,270
Now, if you have
 no data to say what

2420
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:22,490
darker or lighter
 means, let's just leave

2421
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,440
color out of the equation.

2422
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,410
Now you just said the
 erosion was more extensive.

2423
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:30,860
If it was, why didn't
 it burn the O-ring more?

2424
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,420
I don't know the
 answer to that,

2425
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,740
but I know it looked worse.

2426
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:35,600
You're saying it looked worse.

2427
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,790
The dark color
 made it seem worse?

2428
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:40,520
But the figures on your
 charts, which I'm looking at,

2429
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,240
say it wasn't worse.

2430
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,900
A direct relationship
 between O-ring performance

2431
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:47,600
and cold temperature is
 not supported by your data.

2432
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:50,000
You're putting what I said
 into a different context.

2433
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,500
I'm putting it
 into the context

2434
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,150
that I learned in
 engineering school.

2435
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:55,460
That you have to have
 reliable data to come

2436
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:58,920
to an engineering conclusion.

2437
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,800
I don't have that data.

2438
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,260
All I'm saying is that
 launching it below freezing

2439
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:07,090
is an act away from goodness.

2440
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:09,270
All I'm saying is we
 should go by our experience

2441
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:11,870
base, as limited as that is.

2442
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:15,470
And our experience base says
 that at 53 degrees or less,

2443
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:18,370
we can expect increased
 erosion and blow by.

2444
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:19,570
This is Stan Reinhard.

2445
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:21,550
Can I interrupt a second?

2446
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:24,430
Roger, it's my understanding
 that the solid rocket boosters

2447
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:26,920
are qualified by
 contract for operation

2448
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:29,680
between 40 and 90 degrees.

2449
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,530
This 53 degrees
 specification would

2450
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:34,690
be setting a new benchmark.

2451
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:38,310
Are the solids qualified at
 40 degrees or aren't they?

2452
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:43,160
Let me ask something else.

2453
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,260
How come this wasn't brought
 up at the post-scrub meeting

2454
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,000
this afternoon?

2455
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,850
How come temperature as a
 function of O-ring performance

2456
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,680
has never been
 brought up before.

2457
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,600
Two weeks ago,
 Columbia's launch was

2458
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:57,080
aborted 31 seconds before
 liftoff and the temperature

2459
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,250
was 42 degrees.

2460
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:00,170
How come Morton-Thiokol
 didn't insist

2461
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:01,970
on his 53 degrees minimum then?

2462
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,620
I'm sorry.

2463
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:09,570
Well, I just don't get
 your recommendation.

2464
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:15,700
It's away from goodness to
 make any other recommendation.

2465
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:19,030
Listen, if being in
 the direction of goodness

2466
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:21,410
means wanting a successful
 result for this mission,

2467
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:27,150
I want that result. Everybody
 involved in this telecom

2468
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:28,590
wants it.

2469
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:31,140
Be reassured, Roger, you
 are not in the direction

2470
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,160
of goodness by yourself.

2471
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:40,100
But we've got an engineering
 decision to make here,

2472
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:45,000
and it's got to be made
 on quantifiable data.

2473
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,290
Now, I-- well, I want
 to ask Joe Kilminster

2474
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:50,780
for his recommendation.

2475
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,680
Based on this presentation
 by our engineers

2476
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,900
here at Morton-Thiokol, I
 can't recommend the launch.

2477
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:05,170
I think we should get
 George Hardy's comments.

2478
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,130
Well, let me ask
 first, does Thiokol

2479
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:13,200
have any more to transmit?

2480
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,060
Any further views?

2481
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:20,150
Because if not, I'm appalled
 that they could arrive

2482
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:23,630
at the recommendation not to
 launch given the data that's

2483
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:26,810
been presented, especially
 so late on the evening

2484
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:29,180
before a launch.

2485
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:31,130
I agree with Larry Mulloy.

2486
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:33,510
I make the same
 assessment he does,

2487
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:37,100
but if Thiokol
 recommends not launching,

2488
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,000
I'm certainly not
 going to override it.

2489
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,110
We'd like to go
 offline for five minutes

2490
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:50,230
here and have a conference.

2491
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:50,930
All right.

2492
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:16,100
We won't get an absolute
 fix till early morning,

2493
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:19,220
but we're forecasting clear
 skies and acceptable winds.

2494
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:21,460
I don't get that forecast
 from today's weather.

2495
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,900
I bet we don't launch
 for another three days.

2496
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,790
Well, you could
 be right, Mike.

2497
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:28,190
You know this Florida
 weather gives us fits.

2498
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,650
Well, what do the
 abort sites look like?

2499
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:33,580
Dakar and Morocco are your
 principal options, Scobe.

2500
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,440
You got high winds off
 the desert in Morocco

2501
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:36,210
but they're dropping.

2502
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,910
Mm-hmm.

2503
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:38,790
is Edward still good as
 the once around site.

2504
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:39,790
Yeah, Edwards is fine.

2505
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,560
OK.

2506
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,850
That it?

2507
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:45,780
All right, Joe,
 thanks very much.

2508
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:47,070
Anything else?

2509
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:50,130
One thing we take you for
 sure, it's gonna be cold,

2510
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:51,150
so wear your mittens.

2511
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:52,370
Talk to you in the morning.
 - Right.

2512
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:53,070
Good night.

2513
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:53,770
Thanks.

2514
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,160
Well, nothing to do
 but wait and see.

2515
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,630
Two days ago they
 scrub us because they

2516
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:03,030
forecast bad weather and
 the launch time is fine.

2517
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:04,320
That's Florida
 weather for you.

2518
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,090
We live with it every day.

2519
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,970
What bothers me is decisions
 being made by guys who

2520
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:10,260
have never even flown a plane.

2521
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,890
Relax, Mike, if the
 weather's good, we'll go.

2522
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:16,680
If it's not, we'll
 watch Gunga Din again.

2523
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,230
We have a management
 decision as much

2524
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:24,600
as an engineering decision.

2525
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:27,330
Well, Hardy and Mulloy
 are right about one thing.

2526
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:30,510
We don't have the data to
 support our recommendation.

2527
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,490
I want to make
 sure I've got this.

2528
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:35,670
The worry is that
 temperatures in the 20s or 30s

2529
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:39,270
could cause the primary
 O-ring to seal more slowly.

2530
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:40,760
If it did, we could
 get some blow by.

2531
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,570
That's right.

2532
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:45,100
But don't we have some
 tests that show how the--

2533
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,160
We have tests showing
 that even if a blow

2534
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:51,160
by cut 125,000 of an
 inch out of the O-ring,

2535
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:52,020
it would still seal.

2536
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:54,540
Let me just show you
 again in the simplest

2537
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:59,490
terms why I say we shouldn't
 launch in less than 53 degrees.

2538
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:01,920
Even if we don't have 10
 pages of historical data,

2539
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,500
there's only one
 right conclusion.

2540
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:06,290
Here, look at this
 picture of the black soot.

2541
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:07,590
I'll tell you, it
 makes an impression

2542
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:09,780
on me if George Hardy
 says he's appalled

2543
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,850
at something we recommend.

2544
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:14,640
His point is, and I think
 you have to listen to it,

2545
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,290
is that even if you get blow
 by of the primary O-ring,

2546
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:20,370
the secondary O-ring is still
 in the proper position to seal.

2547
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,380
Our charts may
 be inconclusive,

2548
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:24,930
our data insufficient,
 but everything we do

2549
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:27,990
have shows we'll be safer
 launching at 53 degrees

2550
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,340
or above.

2551
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:30,750
That's clear.

2552
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:34,110
That's absolutely clear.

2553
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,750
It's time to make a decision.

2554
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,100
Bob, take off your
 engineer's hat

2555
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,180
and put on your management hat.

2556
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,540
This is Joe Kilminster.

2557
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:56,000
We've assessed the data and
 reviewed all our charts.

2558
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,420
Even though we had some concerns
 about the low temperatures,

2559
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:01,360
we now recommend
 proceeding with the launch.

2560
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:07,840
Does anyone in the loop
 have a different position?

2561
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:15,990
I'll type the letter and send
 it down tonight on the fax.

2562

Well, let's go home now.

Goodnight, George.

2567
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:37,250
Yep.

Getting worse.

2569
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:52,300
Every point the temperature
 drops, we get more ice.

Charlie?

2576
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:04,620
We've got to put the
 rationale together

2577
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:05,690

Now just give me your
 assessment of the situation.

2580
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,500
I've got the details
 on the monitors,

2581
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,060
but it doesn't tell me--

2582
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,540
it doesn't give me
 an overall picture.

It's grim, Horace.

2610
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,280
At the 195 foot
 level here, there's

2611
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:48,970
extensive sheet ice
 between the elevator

2612
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,720
where the crew will
 emerge and the escape

2613
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,760
baskets on the west side.

2614
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,460
You see it?

2615
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:54,080
Yeah, got it in closeup.

2616
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,400
If the crew had
 to be evacuated,

2617
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,020
they'd have to run
 across that ice.

2618
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:58,360
It's very slippery, Horace.

2619
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,580
They'd have a problem.

2620
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:02,300
What about the handrails?

2621
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:03,890
There's ice all over that too.

2622
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:05,160
Long icicles hanging down.

2623
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,560
There's a hell of a
 lot of ice everywhere.

2624
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,020
That's a simple fact.

2625
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:09,590
Can you see the impact
 of this on your monitor?

2626
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:10,350
I get it.

2627
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:13,110
The closeups look like
 something out of Dr. Zhivago.

2628
02:02:13,110 --> 02:02:14,960
Now the big problem
 is the massive ice

2629
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,760
on the whole structure.

2630
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,980
What's going to happen when
 those rockets light off and all

2631
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:20,600
that ice gets shook loose?

2632
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,960
I'd say the only choice you have
 today, Horace, is not to go.

2633
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,250
All right, Charlie,
 come on back in.

2634
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:45,410
We are now at T minus 4
 hours 12 minutes and counting.

2635
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:48,050
Weather prediction at the
 moment is clear for launch

2636
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:50,780
with acceptable winds aloft.

2637
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:52,940
Still concern however
 about the cold temperatures

2638
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:54,890
and whether they'll violate
 the launch commit criteria.

2639
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:00,660
Morning, Mr. Aldrich.

2640
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,970
Morning.

2641
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:05,200
Small news, but
 good news, Arnie.

2642
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,600
The ice on the side of the
 gantry facing the orbiter

2643
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,060
is starting to melt.

2644
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:11,770
That's better, but
 we're still a long way

2645
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:13,520
from out of the woods.

2646
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,130
We just might be all
 right by launch time.

2647
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:24,150
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

2648
02:05:43,330 --> 02:05:44,030
Right.

2649
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:46,050
We'll keep monitoring
 that and call

2650
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:49,030
me back is anything changes.

2651
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:52,380
If the south side of
 the gap is clear of ice,

2652
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,570
we could be looking pretty good.

2653
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,850
Well, we'll look
 at it real careful.

2654
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:58,040
Looking better now though.

2655
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:06,210
Now you take very
 good care of my stuff.

2656
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:07,400
My football tickets
 are in there.

2657
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,100
Sure.

2658
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:10,950
In case of an abort, I'll fly
 them to you personally, Scobe.

2659
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,750
What is your primary
 abort site, Dakar?

2660
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:13,560
Uh-huh.

2661
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,030
Well, due to the
 cold, you'll probably

2662
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:16,140
have considerable hold time.

2663
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,440
Might even have lift
 off close to noon.

2664
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,190
Well, one thing we
 know how to do is hold.

2665
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:20,890
Right.

2666
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,150
Hey, Christa, how do you feel?

2667
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:35,850
I feel great.

2668
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,750
Everybody call home?

2669
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,320
Yes, teacher.

2670
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:57,960
Imagine all the people who
 came to Florida for a vacation

2671
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,190
and are going home
 with frostbite.

2672
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:02,910
A personal note, folks, if
 you need to use the toilet,

2673
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:05,190
I suggest you use the one at
 the bottom of the building.

2674
02:07:05,190 --> 02:07:09,570
The stairs to the crew
 lavatory are blocked by ice.

2675
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:12,120
I've decided I'm not going
 till I'm back on Earth.

2676
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,330
T minus one hour.

2677
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:34,220
Everything continues to
 look favorable for an on

2678
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,770
time launch of the 51L mission.

2679
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:55,780
My kind of weather.

2680
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:57,540
We've got a
 beautiful day to fly.

2681
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:58,550
A little cold thought, Dick.

2682
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:59,900
Nah, that's good.

2683
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:00,720
It's OK.

2684
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,950
All right?

2685
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:20,650
Ready?

2686
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:21,350
Thank you.

2687
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:31,980
OK, take it easy.

2688
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:32,730
See you in a week.

2689
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,180
Have a good flight.

2690
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:17,160
See you up there, El.

2691
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:17,860
Bye.

2692
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:38,500
Get your feet through?

2693
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:39,200
OK.

2694
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:50,730
You're gonna need a haircut.

2695
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:08,430
Well, next time I see
 you, we'll be in space.

2696
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:09,130
Right.

2697
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:27,140
I've got a present for you.

2698
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:28,530
It's an apple.

2699
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:29,230
Johnny.

2700
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:33,290
Thank you.

2701
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:33,990
Save it for me.

2702
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,480
I'll eat it when I get back.

2703
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,460
It'll be waiting
 right here for you.

2704
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,240
Bye.

2705
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,310
Greg, morning.
 - Great.

2706
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:41,010
Morning.

2707
02:10:41,010 --> 02:10:42,610
It looks like you're
 really going to go today.

2708
02:10:42,610 --> 02:10:44,010
I sure hope so.

2709
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:46,390
T minus 50 minutes.

2710
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:49,050
Pilot Michael J. Smith has
 been asked by the orbiter test

2711
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:52,140
conductor to configure switches
 in the cockpit to preactivate

2712
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:55,570
the water spray boilers.

2713
02:10:55,570 --> 02:10:56,270
That's good.

2714
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:07,700
See ya.

2715
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:35,810
Scobe, the resetting we talked
 about, save that for the hold.

2716
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:38,030
It's coming up in a
 couple of minutes.

2717
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:39,820
And, Mike, you can
 start yours now.

2718
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:58,120
This will be the
 first of two planned

2719
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:02,190
holds remaining before
 the launch of mission 51L.

2720
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:03,490
You've done this
 before, haven't you?

2721
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:06,550
Well, maybe once or twice.

2722
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:07,250
Thank you.

2723
02:12:35,230 --> 02:12:35,930
Thank you.

2724
02:12:52,350 --> 02:12:53,760
Hey, Reggie, come on in here.

2725
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,560
How you doing?

2726
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:55,320
Hi, Cheryl.

2727
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,020
How are you?

2728
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:01,920
Lorna, make me some coffee.

2729
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:02,620
OK.

2730
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:03,360
Black.

2731
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,060
Right.

2732
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:14,100
Gosh, I hope
 that's not an omen.

2733
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,070
Jane.

2734
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:18,450
Launch sequencer has started
 retracting the orbiter crew

2735
02:13:18,450 --> 02:13:21,270
access arm, which is the
 walkway used by the astronauts

2736
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:22,200
to climb in the vehicle.

2737
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,410
I'm going to make voice
 contact with each of you.

2738
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:26,540
OK, Judy, say something, please.

2739
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:29,530
Cowabunga.

2740
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:31,950
Cowabunga, what's that?

2741
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:33,630
That's how cold it is in here.

2742
02:13:40,070 --> 02:13:40,770
Still no danger.

2743
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,420
It's ice cold up
 in the solid rocket

2744
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:44,650
that's violate launch
 commit criteria.

2745
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:46,480
On the other hand, the ice
 on the launch pad structures

2746
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,750
is still there.

2747
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,720
So the problem
 is could that ice

2748
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:51,980
get involved with the
 orbiter when we blast off?

2749
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:52,930
Right.

2750
02:13:52,930 --> 02:13:54,510
Of course, you got
 a warm sun now.

2751
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:56,920
There's considerable
 melting going on.

2752
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:58,730
That's helping things.

2753
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:00,160
I sure don't want
 to see those icicles

2754
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:02,650
turned into flying missiles.

2755
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:05,800
Let me get one more
 recommendation from the pad.

2756
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:08,710
We are at T minus 20
 minutes and counting.

2757
02:14:08,710 --> 02:14:10,930
Purge of the orbiter's
 fuel cells is now underway,

2758
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:13,240
and the data processing
 engineer has confirmed

2759
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:15,310
the onboard computers
 are in the process

2760
02:14:15,310 --> 02:14:17,110
of making the transition
 to the terminal

2761
02:14:17,110 --> 02:14:20,660
countdown configuration.

2762
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:23,390
Pilot Mike Smith has configured
 the cockpit instrument

2763
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:25,750
panel displays for launch.

2764
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:27,910
All right, we're
 clear on the ice.

2765
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:29,310
Let's go.

2766
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:33,980
Commander, there's word from
 level one, Challenger is a go.

2767
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:36,020
Count down is
 continuing in 4 minutes.

2768
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:37,410
Have a wonderful trip.

2769
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:38,730
You're a wonderful crew.

2770
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:39,430
All right.

2771
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:41,260
That's great.

2772
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:42,420
Cowabunga.

2773
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:43,120
Double.

2774
02:14:53,710 --> 02:14:57,230
T minus 4 minutes,
 and a final purge

2775
02:14:57,230 --> 02:15:00,460
sequence of the main
 engines is underway.

2776
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,840
Ground launch
 sequencer will make

2777
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,220
a final check to make sure the
 vent arm is fully retracted.

2778
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:09,830
Orbiter ground support equipment
 power bus has been turned off,

2779
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:13,470
and the vehicle is
 now on internal power.

2780
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:17,010
T minus 3 minutes 15 seconds.

2781
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:18,660
Come on, Roger,
 they're about the launch.

2782
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:20,160
No, I don't really want to.

2783
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:20,970
Come on.

2784
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:22,540
Sit down.

2785
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:23,960
The pilot Mike
 Smith has cleared

2786
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,800
the caution and memory system.

2787
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:28,440
No unexpected errors reported.

2788
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,560
Liquid oxygen check under way,
 and the liquid oxygen tank

2789
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:32,670
approaching flight pressure.

2790
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:37,490
T minus 2 minutes and counting.

2791
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:39,870
The liquid hydrogen
 replenish has been terminated

2792
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:42,660
and liquid hydrogen
 pressurization to flight level

2793
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:44,010
is under way.

2794
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,420
The vehicle is now isolated
 from all ground propellants

2795
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:47,730
and crew loading equipment.

2796
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:51,020
Activate auxiliary
 power units.

2797
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:51,720
APUs coming on.

2798
02:15:55,090 --> 02:15:57,030
We have three good APUs.

2799
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:59,820
Challenger is coming alive.

2800
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:00,620
Less than two minutes.

2801
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:08,000
T minus 1 minute 44
 seconds and counting.

2802
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,860
There goes the
 beanie cap, folks.

2803
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:14,280
Visors down, everybody,
 and welcome to space.

2804
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:25,840
At T minus 2 minutes,
 we are anticipating

2805
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,460
the launch of Challenger.

2806
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:29,530
The cold weather has
 set us back quite a bit,

2807
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:33,010
but they're actually nearing
 the launch, and at this point

2808
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:34,780
the families are
 still maintaining

2809
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:36,700
all their excitement,
 even with the delays.

2810
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:38,080
I'm sure at this point
 the astronauts are

2811
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:40,780
more than ready to be taking
 off of that launch pad,

2812
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:42,670
and I'm sure
 Christa is just as--

2813
02:16:42,670 --> 02:16:43,510
as thrilled as can be.

2814
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:47,210
I know I am just standing here
 waiting for it all to happen.

2815
02:16:47,210 --> 02:16:51,070
The cold weather actually formed
 some icicles on the launch pad

2816
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:53,530
and they were able to
 remove some of that

2817
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:55,180
and through some
 deicing processes

2818
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:57,190
they have now
 cleared the launch.

2819
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:58,870
T minus 30 seconds,
 and we've had

2820
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,430
a go for auto sequence start.

2821
02:17:00,430 --> 02:17:03,500
The SRV hydraulic power
 units have started.

2822
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:07,630
T minus 21 seconds, and
 SRB gimbal now underway.

2823
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:11,590
T minus 15 seconds.

2824
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:12,670
T minus 10 seconds.

2825
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:42,590
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2826
02:17:51,050 --> 02:17:55,590
Oh I have slipped the
 surly bonds of earth.

2827
02:17:55,590 --> 02:18:00,820
And danced to the skies
 on laughter silvered wings.

2828
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:04,720
High in the sun that silence
 over there i chase the shouting

2829
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,080
wind alone.

2830
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:09,980
And flung my eager craft
 through footless halls of air.

2831
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:14,100
Up, up, the long
 delirious burning blue.

2832
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:18,370
I've topped the wind swept
 heights with easy grace

2833
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:21,200
where never lark
 or even eagle flew.

2834
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,600
And while with
 silent lifting mind,

2835
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:29,270
I've tried the high
 untrespassed sanctity of space.

2836
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:33,470
Put out my hand, and
 touch the face of God.

2837
02:18:58,070 --> 02:19:01,720
