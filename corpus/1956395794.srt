1
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:05,244
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,534
- Is that...
- Oh.

3
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,703
-Oh, he's here.
-Huh?

4
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,908
Oh, Bruce, is that you?

5
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,510
I know, soon.

6
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,512
Ah, this is a terrific space
for this.

7
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,712
A moment.
I have to take this.

8
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,351
I'm clear, Alfred. Update.

9
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,154
<i>None as of yet.</i>

10
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,891
Master Bruce, it is acceptable
to take one night off.

11
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,660
Speak to someone about sports.

12
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,771
Selina Kyle is here.

13
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,742
<i> Perhaps Ms.
 Kyle is merely  enjoying the festivities.</i>

14
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,578
She hasn't been involved
in any illegal activity

15
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,780
for at least a year.

16
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,447
Sixteen months.

17
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:57,750
<i>Come on, it's Catwoman.</i>

18
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,492
She's probably
casing the joint.

19
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,726
One second.

20
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,801
You were only supposed
to be scouting tonight.

21
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,503
Sounds like it went sideways.

22
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,640
Yeah.

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,311
Found out the shipment
was tonight,
so I thought I'd torch it.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,681
Who knew heroin
was so flammable?

25
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,821
I'll be there in five.

26
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,424
Five? Where's the trust?

27
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,893
Huh?

28
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,328
Aah!

29
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,297
It's over in two.

30
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,437
<i> Gotham PD is in,
 so I'm out.</i>

31
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,740
<i>Sir, do you have an idea</i>

32
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,779
<i> what Ms. Kyle's interest
 in the gala would be?</i>

33
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,389
I'll ask.

34
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,525
Well, knock me over
with a feather.

35
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,728
Bruce Wayne mixing
with the swells.

36
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,795
So what do
they owe the honor?

37
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,431
It's mandatory.

38
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,633
I'm a board member.

39
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,669
How have you been, Selina?

40
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,571
Anything new?

41
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,973
You could say
I'm at a crossroads.

42
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,543
I used to love my work

43
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:32,911
at the gallery.

44
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,413
But now...

45
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,514
Sometimes change is good.

46
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,050
Like you would know.

47
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,985
Bruce?

48
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,388
You're actually here.

49
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,592
You never come
to these things.

50
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,693
It's like seeing a unicorn

51
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:50,562
in a $5,000 suit.

52
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,699
Selina,

53
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,769
this is Thomas Elliot,
good friend and world-renowned
brain surgeon.

54
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,505
Thomas, Selina Kyle.

55
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,640
Hello. And I wouldn't say
"world-renowned."

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,544
Maybe the US
and parts of Canada.

57
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,780
Tom and I were inseparable
as kids,

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,982
especially after
losing my parents.

59
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,616
You're not getting away
this time.

60
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:12,387
Come on, let's have a drink.

61
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,658
Tony, line them up.

62
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,994
<i> Sorry
 to interrupt, Master Bruce,</i>

63
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:26,098
but I'm receiving reports that
Bane has abducted a child.

64
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,833
Ringing your phone now.

65
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,571
This needs my attention.

66
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,572
But it was good seeing you.

67
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:35,642
I'd like to catch up.

68
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,050
Soon.

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,584
Nice while it lasted.

70
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,672
And here we are.

71
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,678
Seriously, both of them?

72
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,853
Perfect couple.

73
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,997
- The scion of
the Dupree Chemical fortune,

74
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:37,002
eight-year-old Edward Dupree,
has been kidnapped
by the criminal known as Bane.

75
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,439
He has demanded
an undisclosed ransom,

76
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,444
which the family has agreed
to pay, against police advice.

77
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,779
Commissioner Gordon,
do you have a statement?

78
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,182
Bane, if you're watching,

79
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,031
we have your money.
Don't hurt the boy.

80
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,718
<i>The child was taken from the
 playground in broad daylight.</i>

81
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,762
It's not like Bane
to be so public.

82
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,107
Everything will
be fine, Edward.

83
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,144
Where is he?

84
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:56,081
Where's my damn money?

85
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,692
Stupid old Bat,
my Venom is stronger.

86
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,894
I am stronger!

87
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,706
I need my money.

88
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,851
I'll kill you!

89
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:37,089
<i> Isn't Bane
 usually a bit more eloquent?</i>

90
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,894
It must be a side effect
of the new Venom design.

91
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:45,564
Which means his mind
is under the same strain.

92
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:48,901
Need my money
for more juice!

93
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,276
Here's your money.

94
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,079
Come get it.

95
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,105
Your parents
are waiting in front.

96
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,748
Asshole!

97
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,730
Batman.

98
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,032
Apologies for
the interruption.

99
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,833
Lady Shiva.

100
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,235
The League of Assassins
has no business here.

101
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:00,038
Perhaps we do.

102
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,173
The League has been in flux,

103
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,677
different factions
vying for power.

104
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,379
And?

105
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,315
And in the chaos,
the life-giving power
of a Lazarus Pit

106
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:13,784
was exploited by
an unknown intruder.

107
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,989
I would ask if you know
anything of this matter.

108
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,024
No.

109
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,625
But I'll look into it.

110
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,660
Down here.

111
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,363
My thanks.

112
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,932
It was a pleasure
to see you work.

113
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,308
Next time, call first.

114
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,878
Is it too much to ask
for one quiet weekend?

115
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:42,948
-Apparently.
-Well, thanks for saving
the day, as usual.

116
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,322
Wait, where's the ransom?

117
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:54,993
Catwoman?

118
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,028
Damn it!

119
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,774
Did you know
she was back in town?

120
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:10,244
Catwoman.

121
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,690
Took you long enough.

122
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,966
Like the view?

123
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,240
It's the only thing
you'll catch tonight.

124
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,491
Don't be so sure.

125
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,134
No.

126
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,484
Hush, Batman.

127
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,414
Hush.

128
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,250
Heh,
told you it was him.

129
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,888
Fell out of the sky
like a dead pigeon.

130
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:05,457
What the hell?

131
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,197
- Only one way to deal
with this freak.

132
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,269
Back off, boys.

133
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,505
He's mine.

134
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,441
How about we cut him in two,
and then you?

135
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,278
After we're done with you,
he means.

136
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,881
Naughty, naughty.
There's a three-strikes law
in this state, boys.

137
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,384
That was one.

138
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,351
Two.

139
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:35,221
Three.

140
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,422
Ah!

141
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,924
Ahh! Ooh!

142
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,359
You know,
some guys pay for that.

143
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,313
Man, screw this.

144
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,115
That was...

145
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,952
uncalled for.

146
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,352
Get away from him.

147
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,222
You're working with Bane
and you're going down.

148
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,191
Calm yourself, little girl.

149
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:15,594
Come quietly
and you won't get hurt.

150
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,197
Aw, that's adorable.

151
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,308
Take care of your boss.

152
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:35,279
Ugh! He's not my boss.

153
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:43,355
Alfred, Batman's hurt.

154
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,490
Really hurt.

155
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,076
Any problems?

156
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,080
Batman.

157
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,182
What happened?

158
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,551
He couldn't keep up.

159
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,486
You sound disappointed.

160
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,154
Does it matter?

161
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:19,957
I got the job done.

162
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,628
Don't worry yourself
with anyone or anything,

163
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,565
except pleasing me.

164
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,543
Now bring me my money.

165
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:39,946
Good Kitty.

166
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,647
How would you say it?

167
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:44,515
"Purrfect."

168
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,985
Say it for me, Kitty. Say,

169
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,121
"Purrfect."

170
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,125
Purrfect.

171
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,563
Mmm.

172
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,311
You can go now.

173
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,246
What the...

174
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,549
Not yet, Ivy.

175
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,753
Fifty-fifty, remember?

176
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,188
Since I can't control you,

177
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:27,392
maybe I'll finish our deal
another way.

178
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,527
Oh, I wouldn't.

179
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:34,399
If my vitals don't remain,
well, vital,

180
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,139
this herbicide bomb will make
nasty work of you
and your pets.

181
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,342
But let's not go down
that road.

182
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,547
I have a job that will pay
ten times what you made today.

183
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:53,250
Think of all the fertilizer
you could buy.

184
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,225
I even brought you a gift.

185
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,697
Your favorite color,
I believe.

186
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:08,066
Is he gonna be okay?

187
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,302
His head injury
is beyond me, I'm afraid.

188
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,038
He needs a hospital.

189
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,105
Batman can go to the hospital?

190
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,341
No.

191
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,043
But reckless playboy
Bruce Wayne can.

192
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:23,280
Take the roadster
to Forest Road near
mile marker 82, and wreck it.

193
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,316
Dick Grayson will take him
to the emergency room.

194
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:29,120
Forty-five miles an hour
should be adequate.

195
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,322
Remember to tuck and roll.

196
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:34,460
Pretty screwed up
you guys have a plan for this.

197
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,096
I shall notify Thomas Elliot.

198
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:42,375
It seems Master Bruce
will be spending time
with his old friend after all.

199
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,347
Well, surgery couldn't
have gone better.

200
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,418
But you'll have to stay out
of the fast lane for a while.

201
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,586
Tom, I owe you so much.

202
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,624
It's the least I can do
for all the times
I left you hanging.

203
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,161
Oh, wait.

204
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,596
I know, I haven't been
a very good friend.

205
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,465
Are you kidding me?

206
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,367
Look at all the publicity
you gave me.

207
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,438
And don't think
you're the most notorious
patient I ever had.

208
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,739
I get around, you know.

209
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,476
You have patients
more infamous than me?

210
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,179
You'd know if you
hung around me more.

211
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,116
Maybe I will.

212
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,318
I'm serious, Tom.

213
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:37,188
I wanna be a better friend.

214
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,392
Bruce, I will always
be your friend...

215
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,845
no matter how annoying
that can be.

216
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:08,786
Dr. Elliot recommended
a minimum of two more weeks
bed rest.

217
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:12,356
Can't be helped, I need to go
to Blackgate Prison.

218
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:16,662
Yes, I see. I know better
than to try and dissuade you.

219
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:20,798
By now, I would hope so.

220
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,301
However, might I suggest
this one?

221
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,476
The headpiece
has a bit more padding.

222
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:34,381
- Hmm.
-  -Do try to avoid blows to the head.

223
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,684
I'd prefer not to buttle
for the World's Greatest
Vegetable, sir.

224
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,493
Yes, very thoughtful, Alfred.

225
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,604
Moving Bane
is unnecessary.

226
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,673
Waller, this is one of
the most secure prisons
on the planet.

227
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,942
Security has nothing
to do with it.

228
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,816
You have no paperwork,
no orders.
I'm calling the mayor.

229
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,619
Wondered when you'd get here.

230
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,423
Are you also gonna tell me
I can't take him?

231
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,226
Can't and shouldn't
are different things.

232
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,894
I need to speak with Bane.

233
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,662
Regarding?

234
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,699
I believe he's working
with Poison Ivy and Catwoman.

235
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,901
I need to know why.

236
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,604
-Five minutes is all--
-No.

237
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,672
I might have some information
to trade.

238
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,708
I'm on a schedule.

239
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,845
Another mission with your
so-called Suicide Squad?

240
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,517
- What's going on?
Didn't you sedate him?

241
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:49,319
<i> Yes, ma'am, enough to tranq
 a herd of elephants.</i>

242
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:55,928
Bane is using a new Venom.
Makes him immune
to your sedatives.

243
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,529
I was going to tell you.

244
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,268
These tranquilizers can be
fired from the 20 millimeter
guns on your helicopters.

245
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,571
Stay back and I'll help you
reacquire him.

246
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:08,540
Batman.

247
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,393
Stay out of my business
and I might stay out of yours.

248
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,731
Where is my money?

249
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,034
How should I know?

250
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,436
Wrong answer.

251
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:43,840
Listen, freak,
Ivy was controlling me,
she made me steal your money.

252
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,343
Hmm.

253
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,744
Then you die first.

254
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,626
Catwoman, down.

255
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,049
The package is secure.
Move out.

256
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,961
Thanks.
It appears we're even.

257
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,895
Stay out of trouble.

258
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,833
Wait, God, I know you're not
big on conversation,

259
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,501
but hold on.

260
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,838
You're going after Ivy
and I want in.

261
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,874
I have a code.

262
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,510
Revenge isn't part of it.

263
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,482
How about the address of her
pheromone-controlled minions?

264
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:02,553
Anyone knows where she went,
it's the zombies
who tended her plants.

265
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,557
Give me the information
and I'll take care of Ivy.

266
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:08,492
Nope.

267
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:11,796
Hmm. Fine,
we work together on this.

268
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,096
What's the address?

269
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:14,567
Oh, I'm not done
with my demands.

270
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:20,943
Ticktock. Trail's going cold.

271
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:29,713
We've done this dance
for so long.

272
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,049
Aren't you just
the least bit...

273
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,028
curious?

274
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,173
No more.

275
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,775
Metropolis.

276
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,143
Ivy's in Metropolis.

277
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,011
Hmm.

278
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,588
God, you're hot
when you smash stuff.

279
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:13,590
It's me. Get the jet ready.

280
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,791
<i> Very good, sir.</i>

281
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,693
And pack the jewelry.

282
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,763
<i> Oh, dear.</i>

283
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:20,568
Jewelry?

284
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,704
"Man of Steel
Saves Bloodmobile."

285
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:29,673
I like it.

286
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:32,710
Hey, is "Man of Steel"
hyphenated?
I can never remember.

287
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,579
-Mmm, no.
-How about "Bloodmobile"?

288
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,582
Lois, I have a deadline.

289
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,685
Just super-type it
like you do when you think
I'm not watching.

290
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:45,056
How come you're
still hanging around?
Don't you have an interview?

291
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,092
He's coming here.
Quite the get.

292
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,029
- Who?
- That would be me.

293
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,733
Bruce, you're early.

294
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,003
Bruce Wayne,
this is Clark Kent.

295
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,705
I believe we've met.

296
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:04,241
Yes. I've admired
your work, Clark.

297
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,143
On occasion.

298
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,847
Excuse me, got to check if
the conference room is ready.

299
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:14,618
Something tells me
a man like you is here
for more than an interview.

300
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:17,154
I do like to multitask.

301
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,624
Any business you can
tell me about?

302
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,627
Not at the moment. Wouldn't
want any third parties
getting involved.

303
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,029
Ready.

304
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,632
Shall we?

305
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,101
I thought about buying
a newspaper once.

306
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,569
Wouldn't it be something
if I owned the<i> Planet?</i>

307
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,271
And you and Clark
could work for me.

308
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,074
Just don't forget
my big raise, Mr. Moneybags.

309
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:38,621
Lois.

310
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,192
Oh, please.

311
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:58,296
Don't tell me
you and the Boy Scout
have switched cities.

312
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,298
LexCorp makes
a fortified ethylene compound

313
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:02,967
engineered to allow
exotic plants

314
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:06,037
to withstand changes
in locale and temperature.

315
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,807
And, so, why are you here?

316
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:12,009
I need the delivery list
of that compound
for the last week.

317
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,913
So, of course you come to me
at 3:00 in the morning.

318
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:20,286
The sooner I have
the information, the sooner
you get back to sleep.

319
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,888
And you couldn't visit
the person who does
the deliveries

320
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:28,625
and is probably awake
as we speak?

321
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,760
The information was deleted
on her computer.

322
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,663
I assume yours has
a few more safeguards.

323
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:34,733
One or two.

324
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:39,710
Here.

325
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,080
Would you like a printout,
maybe some hot cocoa
before you leave?

326
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,781
I have what I need.

327
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:54,019
What you need is to show me
some respect.

328
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,055
I saved all your asses
against Cyborg Superman,

329
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:01,692
and I'll remind you I'm
a Justice League member now.

330
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:05,170
Probationary member.
Don't call us, we'll call you.

331
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,239
Well, look who's here.

332
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,141
Wondered when you'd find me.

333
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,844
I've come back to you.

334
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,749
Have you, now?

335
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,983
No one can resist you.

336
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:28,287
And why would they want to?

337
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,125
That's so true, Kitty.

338
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,827
But no one fakes it with me.

339
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:42,767
Okay, crazy plant bitch,
it's on.

340
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,882
Nose filters?

341
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,851
What am I going
to do with you, Kitty?

342
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:02,854
Oh, I know.

343
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,102
Cut it close, why don't you.

344
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,270
You're going back
to Arkham, Ivy.

345
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,771
Oh!

346
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:23,180
Is Batman your new boy toy?

347
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,382
I have one, too.

348
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,053
Stay away from her.

349
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,756
You heard my Superman.

350
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:39,057
Lover...

351
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,429
kill them.

352
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:47,832
-Tell me you have a plan.
-Yes.

353
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,167
Run.

354
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,465
You thoughtless, worthless,
stupid meat.

355
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:24,970
I don't get my money
if they're still alive.

356
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,306
I won't... kill.

357
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:32,108
Are you trying to resist?

358
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,815
Seems my kryptonite kisses
need a touch-up.

359
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,419
Mmm.

360
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,154
Find them.

361
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:45,022
Kill them.

362
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:47,124
Yes.

363
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,998
Ugh, help these days.

364
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,332
How is he not on us?

365
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,801
He's as fast as a...
Well, you know.

366
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,338
Lead-lined tunnels,
courtesy of LexCorp.

367
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:03,340
They'll buy us some time.

368
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,176
But this is Superman.

369
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,513
Yes, and if he wanted,
we'd be dead already.

370
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,249
Deep down, he's a good person.

371
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,852
And deep down...

372
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:16,586
I'm not.

373
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:19,123
That's the jewelry?

374
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,125
Normally I'd be disappointed.

375
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,059
You clear on your part?

376
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,063
Standard smash and grab,
not like I haven't
done it before.

377
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,301
That's my cue.

378
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,047
Listen to me, Clark,
I've opened the gas main.

379
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,083
One spark from
your heat vision,
you blow up the entire block.

380
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,920
And you know what building
we're under.

381
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:00,030
Huh?

382
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,271
Remember what I said
about the gas main?

383
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:09,909
I lied.

384
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:26,192
That hurt.

385
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,130
It was supposed to.

386
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,333
Hey!
What are you doing?

387
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,202
What... Get your hands off--

388
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:39,670
Shut up and hope
the Big Blue Boy Scout
snaps out of it.

389
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,907
Get control.
You can save her.

390
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,577
It's your choice, not Ivy's.

391
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,080
Damn it.

392
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:54,184
Okay, looks like
we do it the hard way.

393
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:00,223
Superman, help!

394
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,267
Oh.

395
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:12,368
How's your day been, honey?

396
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:14,505
Mine's been... eventful.

397
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,179
I'll explain everything.
I promise.

398
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,249
I, uh, blacked out
for that part.

399
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,186
You better have.

400
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:31,494
Catwoman.

401
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:39,067
He made me do it.

402
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,635
I wouldn't get
too comfortable if I were you.

403
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:46,003
Shit.

404
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,713
Was that really necessary?

405
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,583
Yes.

406
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,285
You could have gotten
Lois killed.

407
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,519
I had faith you'd save her.

408
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,622
- Hmm.
- Batman.

409
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:06,493
Catch.

410
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,261
Synthetic kryptonite.

411
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,566
-You know who made it?
-Working on it.

412
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,503
Mother...

413
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,705
None of this is my fault.

414
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:26,410
I was forced to use Catwoman
to steal Bane's ransom.

415
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,579
Then he made me
control Superman.

416
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,615
Can't say he put up
much of a fight.

417
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,518
What's his name?

418
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:36,623
Now that would be telling.

419
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,657
Not the hair!

420
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:46,630
They may go easy on you,
but I won't.

421
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,298
Name. Now.

422
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,099
Hush.

423
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,769
It's true,
he calls himself Hush.

424
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,038
I never met him before.

425
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,740
He knew a lot about me.

426
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,674
Too much.

427
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,676
That's enough.

428
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,250
I'll take her.

429
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,460
I think your business here
is done.

430
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,596
You weren't supposed
to throw Lois off the roof.

431
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:22,736
Is this your code again?

432
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:28,404
Superman was going
to squish you.

433
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:30,406
So I improvised.

434
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:32,148
That's what partners do,
right?

435
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,702
This just gets
better and better.

436
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:01,771
Look at you, making an effort.

437
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:06,143
So wait, does this mean
Selina is two-timing
Batman with you,

438
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:09,146
-or vice versa?
-Don't you have
something to do?

439
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,514
Nope.

440
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,449
Just thought
of something else.

441
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,217
Maybe she likes you both
because you're both
the same guy,

442
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,887
only she doesn't know it.

443
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,592
Thank you, Alfred.

444
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:25,331
There he goes.
Bruce Wayne on a genuine date.

445
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,869
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

446
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:37,375
Hello, Damian.

447
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,744
Titus.

448
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,779
<i> Pennyworth tells me you're
 romantically involved
 with a criminal now?</i>

449
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:45,815
Ex-criminal.
And it's only a date.

450
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,284
<i> There are
 no ex-criminals, Father,</i>

451
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,621
<i> only ones who aren't breaking
 the law at the moment.</i>

452
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,324
She's not like that anymore.

453
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:56,425
-Damian, I--<i>
 -Look, I understand.</i>

454
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:59,596
<i> This never-ending mission
 of ours is a lonely endeavor.</i>

455
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:02,532
<i> If this trollop provides
some carnal release, so be it.</i>

456
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:03,867
"Trollop"?

457
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,835
Your slang skills need work.

458
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:08,804
<i> But I needn't bring up your
 past poor choices in women,</i>

459
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,175
<i> including but not limited to
 my mother.</i>

460
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,309
Damian, I'm not--

461
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:14,911
<i> -Not that I'm ungrateful
 being here, mind you...</i>

462
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,914
<i> ...however, I must insist
 that you use protection.</i>

463
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,414
<i> And another thing,</i>

464
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:19,782
<i> -cover your drink.</i>
-Goodbye, Damian.

465
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,592
Here's your steak, Larry.

466
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,494
And one for you, Moe.

467
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:33,463
And, Shemp,

468
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,431
- you get two because
it's your birthday.

469
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,568
Aw.

470
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,269
I don't know why Mr. J
isn't here.

471
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,242
Huh?

472
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:49,279
Oh, he's not coming.

473
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:53,650
Okay, freak, who are you
and what do you know
about my puddin'?

474
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,751
I know he needs your help.

475
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:59,989
Hey, I'm the only one who gets
to tie up Mr. J!

476
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:04,295
Just do me a little favor and
you can have him back again.

477
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:06,364
Good as new.

478
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,940
It's open. Come in.

479
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,309
Are those for<i> moi?</i>

480
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,347
Yes. You look...

481
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,414
incredible.

482
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:27,818
Right back at ya.

483
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,255
-Is there time for a drink?
-Why not?

484
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:35,324
You know, I had a bet
with Eartha here
that you wouldn't show up.

485
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,463
- I thought for sure I'd get
a phone call with some excuse.

486
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,896
And yet...

487
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:43,637
...here I am.

488
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,472
Actually,

489
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,541
I've been rethinking
certain things in my life.

490
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,476
Ooh, confession time.

491
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:54,911
Do tell.

492
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,980
Nothing specific.

493
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,016
I've just been feeling
the need to...

494
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,918
change some things.

495
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:03,954
I know the feeling.

496
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,791
I've done some changing myself
since we first met.

497
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,693
I was wilder then.

498
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,527
I thought maybe that's
why you dropped me,

499
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,831
too unrefined
for your social circle.

500
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:16,733
That wasn't it.

501
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,036
Truth be told,
I like that about you.

502
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,972
I hope you're not
entirely tamed.

503
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,740
No.

504
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,844
But I like
to balance things more.

505
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:28,050
To balance.

506
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:17,661
"Wah, wah, wah."
Crying clowns,
who needs them, am I right?

507
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,463
Ladies and jerks,

508
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:23,400
there's been a slight change
to tonight's program.

509
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,402
Along with the opera
robbing you

510
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:27,971
for 1,000 bucks a ticket...

511
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,539
...we're gonna rob you too!

512
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,141
Ha-ha!

513
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:36,413
I'm also here for my puddin',
who's been clown-napped.

514
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,815
To get him back,
I have to kill...

515
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,751
Eh, not you.

516
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,085
Maybe you.

517
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,820
Uh, you!

518
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,722
You I should kill
for that stupid beard!

519
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,425
Oh, there you are.

520
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:52,094
Bruce Wayne.

521
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:55,798
Nice tux.
Hope it's not a rental.

522
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,137
Whoa.

523
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:03,507
Tom, get the ladies
to safety.

524
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,976
Okay, but I'm coming back.

525
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,010
What are you gonna do?

526
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,547
- She wants me,
she'll follow me.

527
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:14,083
Don't get killed.

528
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,192
Bingo-matic.

529
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:33,637
- Hold still,
you wascally wabbit.

530
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,773
Whoops.

531
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,443
Sorry, Rico!

532
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:41,713
Huh?

533
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:44,215
What?

534
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,155
Your jester drag was over
in the '90s,
now it's just sad.

535
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,563
Oh. Oh!

536
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,731
Hyah!

537
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,956
What is it
the theater folks say?

538
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,657
Break a face!

539
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,731
Bats with Cats, now? Ugh.

540
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,737
I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

541
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,240
-Batman.
-Lie still. You've been hurt.

542
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,909
Not that bad.

543
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,981
Get the clown.

544
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,599
Hmm?

545
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:15,706
Oh, boy. This does not
look good, does it?

546
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,275
Joker!

547
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:22,945
You know what the joke
is here? I'm totally innocent.

548
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:25,215
Ugh, that doesn't even
sound right, does it?

549
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:33,188
Batsy,
I was in a basement
until five minutes ago.

550
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,958
I'm also looking for Harley.
Have you seen her?

551
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,032
Stop. Stop!

552
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,811
Stop. Stop!

553
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,655
Batman, stop...

554
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,594
Stop me if you've
heard this one before.

555
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,994
Two guys walk into a bar...

556
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:25,909
I want you to break your code,

557
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:29,612
but for something
I actually did.

558
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:32,349
Batman, don't!

559
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,318
I'm warning you, Batman,
let him go!

560
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:41,925
Do not make me do this,
not over him.

561
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,860
- I won't let you
throw your life away.

562
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,639
Gotham needs Batman.

563
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:21,297
That sentimental
claptrap worked.

564
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:26,068
Well, back to the grind.

565
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:28,103
Who's Robin these days?

566
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:29,672
Shut your damn mouth.

567
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,742
Strip him.

568
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:35,445
Double hand and leg cuffs.

569
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,947
Ooh, kinky.

570
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,996
<i> "Do not store up
 treasures here on earth,</i>

571
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:57,300
where moths eat them
and rust destroys them,

572
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,135
and where thieves
break in and steal.

573
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:02,038
Store your treasures
in heaven,

574
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,740
where moths and rust
cannot destroy,

575
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,411
and thieves do not break in
and steal.

576
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:10,746
Wherever your treasure is,

577
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:13,288
there the desires
of your heart will also be.

578
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,190
Your eye is like a lamp,

579
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,492
it provides light
for your body.

580
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:25,094
When your eye is healthy,

581
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:28,364
your whole body
is filled with light.

582
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,833
But when your eye
is unhealthy,

583
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,369
your whole body
is filled with darkness.

584
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,175
And if the light you think
you have is actually darkness,

585
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,048
how deep that darkness is."

586
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:54,090
Knockout gas
from a jack-in-the-box.

587
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,291
-Someone did their homework.
-The knockout gas

588
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,827
only kept him unconscious
for 15 minutes.

589
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:03,099
After coming to, Joker used
the acid in his boutonniere
to burn through his ropes.

590
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:05,400
How do you forget
about the boutonniere?

591
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,404
He didn't.
He wanted Joker to escape.

592
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:11,840
It was all planned
so Joker would wake up
in time to free himself,

593
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,175
as Harley attacked.

594
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:14,878
Then he ran to the opera,

595
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,514
arriving just as
Tom was killed.

596
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,083
So, the Joker
really is innocent?

597
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,318
This time.

598
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,456
The events of the past months
reach as high as Superman
and as low as the Joker.

599
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:30,126
All were set into motion
by Hush.

600
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:32,394
But why kill Thomas Elliot?

601
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,797
He's got no connection
to Batman.

602
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:36,132
But he does...

603
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:38,302
Did have one
with Bruce Wayne.

604
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,940
Hush knows
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

605
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:58,353
Hi, Selina. How are you?

606
00:45:58,353 --> 00:46:01,858
- Sorry I haven't returned your calls.
-  -<i> It's okay.</i>

607
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:05,561
I just wanted to thank you
for... At the funeral.

608
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:08,130
<i> That meant a lot to me.</i>

609
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,400
I thought you could
use a friend.

610
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,135
I'm so sorry about Thomas.

611
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:14,572
He seemed like
one of the good ones.

612
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,507
He was.

613
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:20,976
Let's not wait
another ten years before
seeing each other, okay?

614
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:22,545
I'd like that.

615
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:25,414
There's just some business
I need to take care of first.

616
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:28,318
If I were you,
I wouldn't wait too long.

617
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,121
<i> Are you saying
 I have competition?</i>

618
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,922
Full disclosure?

619
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:37,393
I was seeing someone
on and off before you called.

620
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,128
<i> It's complicated.</i>

621
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:43,266
Ah. A mystery man.

622
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,434
<i> You have no idea.</i>

623
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:47,605
Well, may the best
mystery man win.

624
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,340
Be careful what you wish for.

625
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,610
Stay safe, Bruce.

626
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,385
I didn't hear a thing.

627
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,224
What now?

628
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:15,268
Riddler.

629
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,369
That C-lister?

630
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:23,179
It's like they're all
crawling out from
under the carpets now.

631
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:33,650
It might be
none of my business,

632
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,585
but I want you to know
I'm for this thing.

633
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,119
Thing?

634
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,487
You and Selina.

635
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,489
Brucelina?

636
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,992
Anyway, I think
she's good for you.

637
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,195
She makes you...

638
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:48,070
...less intense.

639
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:59,342
Hold on.

640
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:03,246
But if you're serious
about her, you're going to
have to tell her everything.

641
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:05,581
Otherwise it won't work.

642
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,416
-You're right.
-I am?

643
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,420
It's none of your business.

644
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,036
Oh, shit.

645
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,507
Hey, hey, I'm not resisting.

646
00:49:04,507 --> 00:49:05,675
Where is he?

647
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:08,177
I know not
whom you speak of.

648
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,079
Hush put you up to this.

649
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,483
Can you rephrase that
in the form of a riddle?

650
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,353
There was no riddle.
That's the point.

651
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:20,255
Maybe I'm trying
something new.

652
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:22,090
You know, shake things up.

653
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,226
<i> ♪ Shake, shake, shake ♪</i>

654
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,213
I'm glad
you're here, Batman.

655
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:46,181
Who are you?

656
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,751
I'm the man
that will destroy your life
before taking it.

657
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,454
We'll see about that.

658
00:49:52,454 --> 00:49:55,090
We already have.

659
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,628
Or at least Thomas Elliot has.

660
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:03,565
You'll run in circles
as I kill your friends

661
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,568
one by one.

662
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:07,572
Face me.

663
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,309
No one
you care for is safe.

664
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:43,740
Soon, Batman.
Very soon.

665
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,389
Batman.

666
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:04,159
I'm not stealing anything,
just looking around.

667
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,494
Old habits.

668
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:08,396
I know this is your home,
Selina.

669
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:10,833
I have for a long time.

670
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:13,469
Right.
World's Greatest Detective.

671
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:15,804
So why are you here?

672
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:17,809
I want you to leave town.

673
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,376
I don't know what
you think we have,

674
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:23,311
but you don't get to
tell me what to do.

675
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:26,449
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

676
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:29,518
Hush told me he's going to
hurt the ones closest to me.

677
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,621
The ones I care for most.

678
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:33,358
Okay. Unexpected.

679
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,297
Whoever Hush is, he's been
one step ahead of me
the whole time.

680
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:43,467
He undoubtedly
knows we're involved.

681
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:49,474
A few days ago,
I suffered a loss.

682
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:54,844
It's been suggested
that I'm handling it better

683
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:58,849
because I have you in my life.

684
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:03,518
In your life?
Isn't that a bit much?

685
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:05,356
Maybe it's time to find out.

686
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:09,958
Wait.

687
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,896
Are you sure?

688
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:14,932
I am.

689
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,606
Then let me.

690
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,275
Bruce?

691
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:27,643
Bruce Wayne is Batman?

692
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:31,248
So, what now?

693
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,391
Oh, I can think of
a few things.

694
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:48,664
I don't often say
something was worth the wait,

695
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:50,467
because I hate waiting.

696
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:54,603
But that? Meow.

697
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:56,907
I feel the same.

698
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:59,875
Oh, my God.

699
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,277
Your scars.

700
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:03,612
So many.

701
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:05,583
You, uh, remember these?

702
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,652
I'd just gotten
my retractable claws.

703
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,588
Cost a small fortune.

704
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:14,322
They worked.

705
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:16,592
I had to upgrade my
Kevlar body armor after that.

706
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:18,297
Uh, sorry?

707
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:24,032
That was why you
broke it off with me.

708
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:26,570
-That's when you
found out I was Catwoman.
-A kleptomaniac.

709
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,338
What?

710
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:34,510
Sorry, you were beautiful,
brilliant and accomplished.

711
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,512
You could do
anything you wanted.

712
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:38,614
I assumed you did it because
you couldn't stop, and--

713
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:41,585
And if you can't
control your actions,
you're not quite sane.

714
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:43,887
Whole.

715
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:46,856
And I was wrong.

716
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,757
You did change.

717
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:50,326
I'm sorry.

718
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:53,965
It's okay.
We're in uncharted territory.

719
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,735
Since you're not
leaving town,

720
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,804
maybe we should
go to my place.

721
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:02,938
Wayne Manor?

722
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:05,018
Better.

723
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,420
Huh?

724
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,590
Whoa...

725
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,925
You did it.

726
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:25,760
You actually did it.

727
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,597
Alfred, he did it!

728
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,338
Hi, Selina. Dick Grayson.

729
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,539
Pleasure.

730
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:42,411
Ms. Kyle, I've taken
the liberty to prepare tea
with assorted biscuits.

731
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:44,512
So everyone knows who I am?

732
00:54:44,512 --> 00:54:47,349
Just us and Damian,
not Gordon.

733
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:52,621
-Who's Damian?
-Robin, his... son.

734
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:56,592
You two
are gonna have so much fun.

735
00:54:57,592 --> 00:54:58,777
Hmm.

736
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:11,469
Morning, hon.

737
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:14,570
Mwah.

738
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,773
Pardon me. Ah.

739
00:56:18,773 --> 00:56:19,811
Oh, is that coffee?

740
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,112
Mmm.

741
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:25,648
We do have unclaimed coffee.

742
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:26,885
Yours is better.

743
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:31,059
Look at this.

744
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,094
I'll even pay.

745
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:41,764
Okay, you pay.

746
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,067
After we catch Hush.

747
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:46,001
Who's disappeared.

748
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,637
Maybe he heard about your hot,
ferocious new partner,

749
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:52,106
or died setting a bear trap
for you. Either way...

750
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:54,175
You go. Take the jet.

751
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:55,811
I have to be here.

752
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:58,981
You won't always.
You know that, right?

753
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:02,018
Dick will take over one day.
Isn't that what you've been
grooming him for?

754
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,552
He's not ready.

755
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:07,523
And you were?

756
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:11,760
I'm not asking you to retire,
Bruce. I'm asking you to spend
some time away from this.

757
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,961
With me.

758
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:17,666
- If we were to do this,
we'd have--

759
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,068
Mmm.

760
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,503
I do apologize, sir.

761
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:22,708
It's Commissioner Gordon.

762
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,744
What is it, Jim?

763
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,813
Two minutes ago,
a silent alarm was tripped
at a medical practice.

764
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:34,983
The office belongs
to that doctor
Hush killed at the opera.

765
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,619
Thomas Elliot.

766
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,621
Yeah.
Thought you'd want to know.

767
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:42,625
Thank you.

768
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,661
There's been a break-in
at Thomas' practice.

769
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:50,132
Ah. You know, maybe this
is something that Batman
needs to do alone.

770
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:52,079
This shouldn't take long.

771
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,780
What a mess.

772
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,550
Professional job.

773
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,719
No fingerprints. No DNA
on any of the rifled papers.

774
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,954
Not a robbery.

775
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:15,592
Look at all this
fencible crap.
What were they after?

776
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:18,030
Information.

777
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,699
Glioblastoma multiforme
brain tumor.

778
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,333
Nearly inoperable.

779
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,936
Well, that doesn't sound good.

780
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:30,606
It isn't. For him.

781
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:33,976
But it may be for us.
You up for a trip to Arkham?

782
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:35,016
Oh, joy.

783
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,320
Professor,

784
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,126
it's time to pay
our respects.

785
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:54,831
Going on patrol, Alfred.
Can you man the comms?

786
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:59,034
Of course, Master Dick.

787
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,202
Well, I'm not sitting around
doing nothing.

788
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:02,206
Mind if I tag along?

789
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:05,007
Hop in.

790
00:59:06,007 --> 00:59:07,213
But I'm driving.

791
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:14,717
So, you guys used to do this
every night?

792
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,652
Pretty much.

793
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:18,920
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

794
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,623
You can ask.

795
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,393
How is it dating the man
who is Batman?

796
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:26,228
It's weird.

797
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:27,996
Complicated.

798
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:30,199
Incredible.

799
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,635
The only drawback
is he just won't shut up
about his feelings.

800
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:36,838
Good one.

801
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:39,141
<i>71 Charlie.</i>

802
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:40,809
<i> Report of a person
 breaking the lock
 on the Gotham Cemetery gate.</i>

803
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:42,827
<i> Suspect believed to be
 inside the grounds.</i>

804
00:59:59,827 --> 00:00:02,431
It's like Halloween.

805
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,333
Everything but
the Great Pumpkin.

806
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,840
Catwoman, over here.

807
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,010
Wait, I've been here before.

808
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,951
So have you.

809
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:24,786
-But why would someone--
-Nightwing!

810
01:00:40,802 --> 01:00:42,072
Have a face full of fear!

811
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:54,782
No! Get away!

812
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,989
Hold still.

813
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,759
This will sting a bit.

814
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:12,235
Mmm.
Scaredy-cat wants to play.

815
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:26,347
-How?
-Nose plugs.

816
01:01:26,347 --> 01:01:28,217
Have you smelled
yourself lately?

817
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,529
No, he'll kill me!
I cannot fail.

818
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,505
Sure you can. Ass.

819
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,820
Stay back!

820
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,356
Nightwing, it's Selina!
Stop fighting me!

821
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:18,501
Get me to the car.

822
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,510
Alfred, are you listening?

823
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,346
<i> I am.</i>

824
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:34,115
<i> I shall remote pilot
 the Batmobile to the Batcave</i>

825
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:36,353
<i> whilst you secure Scarecrow.</i>

826
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:01,510
Now, now.

827
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,847
Wouldn't wanna make it
too easy.

828
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,063
So you finally
figured it out?

829
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,030
I was getting bored.

830
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,967
This is nuts.
How's the Riddler involved?

831
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,969
He's been locked in here.

832
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,570
When I saw the name
Arthur Wynne in
Thomas Elliot's files,

833
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,076
I knew he was more
than a bit player.

834
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,577
Okay, I'll bite,
who's Arthur Wynne?

835
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:39,248
Inventor of
the crossword puzzle?

836
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,516
Cretin.

837
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:46,154
It was the name you used when
visiting Dr. Thomas Elliot
for your brain tumor.

838
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:48,923
That useless incompetent!

839
01:03:48,923 --> 01:03:50,458
Supposed to be so brilliant.

840
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:54,096
He was the only doctor
who'd operate on me.

841
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:59,333
After the surgery failed,
he told me to get
my affairs in order.

842
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,436
But I refused to let that
be the end of me.

843
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,072
No, no, no,
I found another way.

844
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:06,608
A Lazarus Pit.

845
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:08,409
<i> All it took
 was a few bribes</i>

846
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:11,014
<i> and I was able to dip myself
 in its healing waters.</i>

847
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,048
<i> In that moment,
 I saw everything,</i>

848
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:15,951
<i> knew everything,</i>

849
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:19,255
<i> including the answer to my
 most frustrating riddle...</i>

850
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:22,193
<i> who is the Batman?</i>

851
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,369
<i> It was so obvious, right
in front of me the whole time.</i>

852
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:37,438
<i> In a flash of inspiration,
 I saw a way to destroy you</i>

853
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:42,547
<i> and get revenge on
 the criminal swine who
 disrespected me in the past.</i>

854
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:47,416
<i> I needed a new persona.</i>

855
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,152
<i> My true identity
 had to be kept hush, hush.</i>

856
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:53,521
<i> One by one,
 I convinced, cajoled,</i>

857
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:56,659
<i> and compelled the others
 to play their part...</i>

858
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:00,496
<i> and do my bidding.</i>

859
01:05:02,496 --> 01:05:05,132
<i> You see, Batman,
 this is my game</i>

860
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:07,536
<i>and everyone follows my rules.</i>

861
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:10,539
Even you.

862
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,242
That's some fancy monologuing
for a guy in cuffs.

863
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:16,210
Batman caught you.

864
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,215
Oh, woe is me. Foiled again.

865
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:22,985
Time for a riddle, I suppose.

866
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,322
Riddle me this,
Commissioner Gordon...

867
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,291
who is Batman?

868
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,425
Jesus.

869
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,597
<i>Oh, you shouldn't
 have done that.</i>

870
01:05:36,597 --> 01:05:38,271
<i>I was using it to control him.</i>

871
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:45,608
Shit, Clayface!

872
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,112
Finally, I'm free.

873
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:59,253
All right, get him!

874
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:00,590
Yeah, kill him!

875
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:07,628
Ooh, dinner and a show.

876
01:06:07,628 --> 01:06:10,065
This place isn't all bad.

877
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,375
Yeah!

878
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:23,577
- You're seeing
another villain already?

879
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:26,114
I thought we had
something special.

880
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:28,083
Shut up, freak!

881
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:31,820
"Freak"? Batsy,
are you going to let him
talk to me that way?

882
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,320
Get him, Clayface!

883
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,824
Oh, it is so like you
not to defend me.

884
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:38,726
How many others
were there? No, don't tell me!

885
01:06:40,628 --> 01:06:42,364
I guess the joke's on me.

886
01:06:43,364 --> 01:06:45,268
And scene.

887
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:54,208
Way not to die, Batsy.

888
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:58,079
Gordon! As usual,
you're laying there
with your thumb up your ass.

889
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,380
Do something, man!

890
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:04,585
Yeah!

891
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:07,692
Bullseye!

892
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,340
Now you're just
raining on my parade.

893
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:31,313
Oh, no!

894
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,784
Oh!

895
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,489
Anyone got a mint?

896
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:45,226
<i>Seems you're still playing
 catch-up, Batman.</i>

897
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:46,728
Let's end this, Hush.

898
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:49,197
<i> Agreed, but you come to me.</i>

899
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,800
<i> You see, I went
 to the graveyard
 to catch a bat</i>

900
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,668
<i> but was off by a letter.</i>

901
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:55,769
<i> Toodles.</i>

902
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:57,442
What did that mean?

903
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:18,926
Ah, admiring my beauty mark?

904
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:22,898
The damage to you
may be more severe.

905
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,632
Batman will find you.

906
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:26,434
Of course he will.

907
01:08:26,434 --> 01:08:28,703
Within seconds, he'll have
dissembled the device

908
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:31,840
I used to turn Clayface
into my doppelganger.

909
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,676
He'll then know the effective
range is ten miles,

910
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:36,545
and search that radius.

911
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:37,945
Which means...

912
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,255
we better get started.

913
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:51,859
Batman will then
contact Alfred to confirm
you're missing.

914
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:57,599
Batman will come alone.

915
01:08:57,599 --> 01:09:01,203
He'll deduce I've prepared
a place for our showdown.

916
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:05,340
He'll compile a list of every
factory and warehouse
within the ten-mile radius,

917
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,810
<i> of which there are 62.</i>

918
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,279
He'll winnow that list to 14,

919
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,280
too many to search one-by-one.

920
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,783
Shut up! Shut up!

921
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:17,953
Since I've left
no other tools,

922
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,256
Batman will revisit
the name, Arthur Wynne,

923
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:24,826
and check the names
of the 14 places
to find that only one

924
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:27,462
<i> is an anagram
 for "Arthur Wynne."</i>

925
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:30,431
<i> "New Thurnary."</i>

926
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:33,635
<i> Even allowing for traffic,
 he should be here any minute.</i>

927
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:34,935
Screw you!

928
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:36,847
No time.

929
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:49,551
<i> Riddle me this.</i>

930
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:52,921
<i> "The less of me you have,
 the more I am worth.</i>

931
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:53,261
<i> What am I?"</i>

932
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,296
<i> Answer?</i>

933
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:02,006
<i> A friend.</i>

934
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:13,742
I'm going to kill you.

935
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:17,045
You're not going anywhere
except down.

936
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:50,345
What's a bat to do?

937
01:10:58,052 --> 01:11:02,423
The briefest of reprieves,
I assure you.

938
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:03,527
Ha!

939
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:09,336
Ha!

940
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,619
Tonight, I'll show them all

941
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:34,922
by doing
what none of them could,

942
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:36,457
killing the Batman!

943
01:11:42,764 --> 01:11:44,798
Can you feel it, Bruce?

944
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:47,703
Can you feel it all
slipping away?

945
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:56,878
What do you think of me now?

946
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,082
You talk too much.

947
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:12,159
I repeat,
what do you think of me now?

948
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,929
That you're the same
insecure C-lister you were

949
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:17,832
before you went
into the Lazarus Pit.

950
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:20,467
Big talk from a dead man!

951
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:23,037
- You tell riddles
a fifth grader could solve

952
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:25,038
- and you call yourself
the Riddler.

953
01:12:25,038 --> 01:12:27,841
The sheer lack of imagination
is staggering.

954
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:30,043
You take that back!

955
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:31,679
A one-gimmick hack.

956
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,113
The joke of the underworld.

957
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:35,048
Damn you. Shut up!

958
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:40,154
You think you got the best
of Ivy, Joker, and Bane?

959
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:42,524
Once they find out
Hush was The Riddler...

960
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:46,761
- ...they'll hunt you down
like a dog.

961
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,829
It won't be pretty.

962
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:51,064
I'm not
scared of them anymore!

963
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:54,569
I'll kill them just like
I'm going to kill you.

964
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,443
- The effects of the Pit
don't last forever.

965
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,578
I'm betting even now
you can feel it.

966
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:06,713
All that strength
and genius slipping away

967
01:13:06,713 --> 01:13:08,917
just when you need it most.

968
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,851
No, no!

969
01:13:13,854 --> 01:13:16,925
Riddle me this,
who's his own worst enemy?

970
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:37,912
I have you now!

971
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,908
I win! I win!

972
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:40,877
I win!

973
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,152
Nine lives, remember?

974
01:14:51,152 --> 01:14:53,755
Now let's beat the crap
out of this asshole.

975
01:15:18,746 --> 01:15:19,914
Ahh! Oh...

976
01:15:29,222 --> 01:15:32,627
Don't let me die! Please!

977
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:34,862
Pull me up.
Pull me up!

978
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:35,029
Please!

979
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:37,698
Leave him!

980
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:39,301
Go!

981
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,108
Wait!

982
01:15:47,108 --> 01:15:50,845
You're Batman,
you can't let me die!

983
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:52,014
Screw this shit.

984
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,052
He didn't have to die.

985
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:33,822
What?

986
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:36,925
He didn't have to die.

987
01:16:37,925 --> 01:16:39,997
You're crazy.

988
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:45,233
You're absolutely insane.

989
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,668
He killed your friend.

990
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:51,306
Tried to murder Nightwing.
Hell, he almost killed me
and you're sorry he's dead?

991
01:16:53,306 --> 01:16:55,676
I had to try.

992
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:57,212
If someone can be saved,

993
01:16:58,212 --> 01:16:59,216
I have to try.

994
01:17:02,216 --> 01:17:04,686
You do, don't you?

995
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,454
It's a compulsion.

996
01:17:07,454 --> 01:17:10,291
You and your goddamn code.

997
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,926
And you'll die because of it,
you know this, right?

998
01:17:12,926 --> 01:17:14,229
Will that make it all better?

999
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:16,465
Without a code,

1000
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:19,136
I'm no better than them.

1001
01:17:23,136 --> 01:17:25,238
I'm such a stupid fool.

1002
01:17:25,238 --> 01:17:27,078
I can't believe I let myself
get caught up in this again.

1003
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,779
No, I changed!

1004
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:35,817
I would have changed more,
a lot more, for you!

1005
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,322
For us!

1006
01:17:41,322 --> 01:17:43,430
Selina, I...

1007
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:51,134
But you won't.

1008
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:55,903
Or can't.

1009
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,279
Maybe someday.

1010
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:07,152
But not today.

1011
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:12,860
Goodbye, Bruce.

1012
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:31,000
Someday.
