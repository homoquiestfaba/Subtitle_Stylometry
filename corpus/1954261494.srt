So one day, early '70s,

386
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,706
I ran a gallery in the Village,

387
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:59,252
and I get this huge
crate in the mail.

388
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,463
You could have fit a
refrigerator in there.

389
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,301
I open it up, and there
is sitting there,

390
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,429
inside, this thing.

391
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,431
I started to get reports

392
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,808
about these people
getting these packages

393
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,021
all over the country...
a dentist in Oregon,

394
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,565
a bartender in Iowa.

395
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,777
I had no idea why these people
were being singled out,

396
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,779
but it intrigued me.

397
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,992
And I go home and I
have about five drinks.

398
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,036
And I go to bed.

399
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,079
I can't get the thing
out of my head.

400
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,290
I just couldn't get
it out of my head.

401
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,667
Finally I wake up from this dream

402
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,880
where I'm actually having a dream
inside the dream about finding it.

403
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,342
Nobody knew who he was.
Nobody still knows.

404
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,510
There were all these
crazy rumors...

405
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,305
he was a concentration camp guard
who was hiding out in Georgia.

406
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,349
He was on death row.

407
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,226
It was a housewife in Ohio.
He was a mental patient.

408
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,438
He was a dentist in Washington
State. He was...

409
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,733
Mr. Jones.
That was me... I named him.

410
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,611
I was pretty angry at
the world at this time.

411
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,488
I was about to go broke.

412
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,824
So I just hung this thing

413
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,786
in the front window of the gallery.

414
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,829
And it stopped traffic.

415
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,375
When I first saw Mr. Jones'
famous scarecrows,

416
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:24,128
I immediately thought of
totem poles, tribal masks,

417
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,714
guardian figures that
occur in every culture

418
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,425
who stop the evil spirits

419
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,428
that dwell in the dark from
breaking into our home.

420
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,763
SCOTT: So what happened next?

421
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:38,219
Um, well, eventually
they just stopped.

422
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:44,065
And that was it. And I
thought Mr. Jones was done.

423
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,608
SCOTT: So you think you
got an actual piece

424
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,151
sent to you by Mr. Jones.

425
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,150
I don't think I did. I did.

426
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,990
SCOTT: I mean, most experts think

427
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,449
he sent these things
out in the '70s.

428
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,323
How do you know it was real?

429
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,082
It was real.

430
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,331
I know it was.

431
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,423
There are nine verified Jones
pieces in the world... nine.

432
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,468
If someone found an
authentic Jones,

433
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,723
I could get seven figures
for it tomorrow, easy.

434
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:22,145
But if it was a new piece,
any new piece, contemporary,

435
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,690
like what he's doing now...

436
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,734
whew.

437
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,109
SCOTT: If these are worth so much,
then why did you destroy it?

438
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:39,037
I met a lot of people that were
mailed totems by Mr. Jones.

439
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,997
And most of them

440
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,458
just say that they were
disturbed and moved on.

441
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,878
But if you actually start talking
to the people around them...

442
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,213
their husbands, their wives,

443
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,091
their friends, their
colleagues, their parents...

444
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,676
then you start to get
a different story.

445
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,505

he singled you out?

446
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,100

into the lives of these people,
