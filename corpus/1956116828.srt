174
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,963
I'm gonna go get booze.

175
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,299
Great!

Come on,
give me a little more.

183
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,030
I liked it.
I may join you later.

Oh! You must love cooking
in this kitchen!

185
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:38,762
No, not really.
Sean does.

186
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:41,763
I think it's probably just
an excuse to avoid writing.

187
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:43,362
Your husband's a writer?

188
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,395
No. He wrote a book
10 years ago.

189
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:46,729
It made him the toast
of the town.

190
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,930
I actually had to stalk him

191
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:49,097
to make him
fall in love with me.

192
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:52,529
But then, nothing. He never
wrote anything ever again.

193
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,029
- It's the old bait-and-switch.
- What was the book?

194
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:57,329
It's called
<i>Darkness at Dawn.</i>

195
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,696
Oh, my gosh! I read
that in my book club!

196

- Really?
- This was... Yeah.

197
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,862
Well, this was back when
I first became a single mom,

198
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,329
and I joined this book club, and
that was the first book we read.

199
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,262
It's so impressive.

200
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,298
So you're divorced, then?

201
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,565

- Oh. How awful.
- Yeah.

don't get to me.

210

But that one...

211
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,295
That one did.
That was brutal.

212
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,996
I don't talk
about it a lot.

213
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,329

I just met.

214
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,696
I'm really sorry.
Oh! Mmm...

215

Baby, if you
apologize again,

216

I'm gonna have to slap
the sorry out of you.

217
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:51,529
Yeah. That's...
I'm not sorry.

218
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,296
That's a hard habit
to break, though.

219
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:54,729
It is.

So, are you
dating anyone?

No. Slim pickings
in Warfield.

222
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,263
Well, you are an hour
and a half outside the city.

223
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:05,529
I'm not gonna date someone from the city.
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,428
I tried eHarmony
for a while,

225
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,695
and then that mother
of three wound up

226
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:09,896
with her head
in the trash can,

227
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,696
you remember that?
And I... Ugh.

228
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,662
I said, "No thank you.
Delete."

- you're too sexy to give up.

That's nice.
I don't know. Um...

233

If your head's gonna
end up in a trash can,

234
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,362
your head's gonna end up
in a trash can.

235
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,930
I just didn't think I would
end up a single mom,

236
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:29,695
struggling to make
ends meet.

237
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,428
I mean, my husband
had life insurance,

238
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,963
thank goodness,
but not a lot.

239
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,596
I put half of that away
for Miles' college,

240
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:37,562
and so, with
that coming in,

241
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,328
the money still
runs out in 2020.

242
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,830
Thank God
for his life insurance.

243
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,896
Yeah.

244
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:43,929
My husband
doesn't have anything

245
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:46,028
if it makes you feel better.
But he does spend like

246
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,729
- he's the man of the hour.

for everything.

248

We can't even
sell this house.

249
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:53,262
We bought it
during the bubble.

250
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,929
I love your house.

251
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,930
Don't dream of selling it.

252
00:11:56,932 --> 00:12:01,199
If I were you, I'd just bask
in this kitchen all day long!

253
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,363
- Then you should move in.
- (CHUCKLES)

254
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:07,029

to being house poor.

258
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,563
It's just another one
of my bad decisions.

259
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,696
Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It's great.

260
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:19,930
Is that a charity symbol?

261
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:23,263
Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are,
like, the same person, so...

262
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:25,595
It's a nice contrast
with your ring.

263
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:27,929
Thanks. Yeah, this is
a family heirloom.

264
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:29,528
It belonged to Sean's
great-grandmom,

265
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,528
and then his mom,

266
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,496
and she insisted that I
have it, so, you know?

is blocking the garage?

- You're what?
- Mmm...

270
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,996
Your wife is trying to get me
to stop apologizing.

271
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:44,463
Or maybe you can
get her to start.

272
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:46,630
- Oh! Hi.
- Hi.

273

Oh, martini time?

275
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,563
I'm sure
it's 5:00 somewhere.

276
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:52,696
Oh, my God,
did you just come up

277
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:53,863
with that cliche
by yourself?

278
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,362
He's such
a brilliant writer.

279
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:57,596
I have to say,
you inspire me.

280
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,028
EMILY:
Not enough, apparently.

SEAN: "Why,
thank you very much

00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:01,995
"for going to the grocery
store," he said,

283
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,729
dripping with sarcasm.

284
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,428
Oh, I figured
you'd want a break

285
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,029
- from not writing ever.
- (LAUGHS)

she won the joust.

- Well played.
- Hmm. Thank you.

288

- This is Stephanie.
- Hi, Stephanie.

Her kid goes to Warfield
with our kid.

290
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,232
She read your book.

291
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,862
I did. I loved it!

292
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:23,496
It reminded me
of William Thackeray.

293
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:24,695
She really read it.

294
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,428
Wow, not many people

295
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,796
trot out Thackeray
as a reference.

296
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,928
Oh, I was an English
major at Barnard.

297
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,328
It was pre-mommy brain.

298
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,896

a decent nanny

run off to London?

685
00:27:56,997 --> 00:27:58,628
Are you saying that
I broke my mother's hip?

686
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,630
You leave town,
your wife takes off.

687
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:03,461
Maybe there's, um,

688
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:05,962
a close friend she might be
spending some time with.

689
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,895
Excuse me,
that's very rude.

690
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:09,929
He is a dedicated
husband and father.

691
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:11,795
I have seen him with his
wife, let me tell you,

692
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:14,028
they've got more chemistry
than a science fair.

693
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,161
Just exploring
all avenues, ma'am.

694
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:17,764
Well, that avenue is a dead
end, so you can drop it.

695
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,828
And where's
Emily's family?

696
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,461
She doesn't have any.

697
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:23,562
She was an only child,

698
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:26,398
and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager.

699
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,996
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

700
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,527
OFFICER: We'll file
a missing person's report

701
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:33,294
and contact you
in the next couple of days.

702
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,695
If she doesn't turn up,

703
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:36,995
we'll contact the local
authorities in Miami.

704
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,428
Not planning any more trips,
are you, Mr. Townsend?

705
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,495
SEAN: No.

706
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:42,527
I'm gonna be right here.

707
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,864
I'm gonna be at my house
with my son.

708
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:47,498
We can show ourselves out.

709
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:52,294
SEAN: <i>God knows we've had
our troubles in the past,</i>

710
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:55,262
but I don't think she'd just
up and leave her child.

711
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,495
No, God, she adores Nicky.
She wouldn't do that.

712
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,461
She is an enigma, my wife.

713
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:01,929
That's what drew me to her.

714
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:03,494
It can also
make her impossible.

715
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,427
She can be
so fiercely private.

716
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:06,395
She sure doesn't like

717
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,528
having her picture taken,
I'll tell you that.

718
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,761
I remember this one time,
she shut down my Facebook

719
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:11,928
because I posted up
a family picture.

720
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,928
Ugh. Social media
is so tricky.

721
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,261
I can get
to close to her,

722
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:16,895
I can never quite reach her.

723
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:19,629
She's like
a beautiful ghost.

724
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:21,461
Never entirely there.

725
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:22,895
That's so poetic.

726
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:24,928
That's why you're
such a good writer.

727
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,528
I'm not a writer
anymore, Stephanie.

728
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,428
I gave all that up
just to chase this woman

729
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,431
for the rest of my life.

730

(SEAN SCOFFS)

731
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,694
I should order a taxi
and go home.

732
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:36,362
Yeah.

733
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:39,831
Oh, gosh, it's 1:25, they
stop driving at 1:00 here.

734
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,829
That couch pulls out, um,

735
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:45,595
if you wanna stay over.

736
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,428
I know Nicky would love it

737
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,495
if you were here
in the morning.

738
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,665
That would be lovely.

739
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:53,798
(BLENDER WHIRRING)

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,562
SEAN: Who wants
more B vitamins?

741
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:10,728
- MILES: Yeah!
- NICKY: I do!

742
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,528
SEAN: Yeah?
Are they nice?

743
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,561
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Delicious?

744
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,995
- Hi.
- SEAN: Hey.

745
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:18,428
Uh, what on Earth
are you making?

746
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,695
These are
hangover smoothies.

747
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,462
They get it
right out of you.

748
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,694
And the kids love them.

749
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,295
Little tip,
they have a full portion

750
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:27,428
of vegetables in them,

751
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,428
and they don't even
know it.

752
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,462
It's so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables.

753
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:31,464
SEAN: Right?

754
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,295
Mmm.

755
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:35,565
Wanna try some?

756
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,264
Great.

757
00:30:43,297 --> 00:30:44,530
Good?

758
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:46,893
(CHUCKLES)

759
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:50,528
I think we should get ready
for school. (GROANS)

760

a new recipe</i>

00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:58,027

for a hangover smoothie.</i>

00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,028
<i>Uh, it's really nice.</i>

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,994
<i>I especially
want to thank everybody</i>

766
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:03,564
<i>who's written in
to ask about Emily.</i>

767
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,230
<i>It's been four days now.</i>

768
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,161
<i>So...</i>

769
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:11,295
<i>The good news is that Sean
is home from London,</i>

770

<i>and he's working very
closely with the police.</i>

771

<i>Um, actually, moms,</i>

772
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:20,294
<i>I know a lot of you
are hung up on the idea</i>

773
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,362
<i>that the husband
is always the primary suspect.</i>

774
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:24,230
<i>I know, I've seen</i>
Law & Order.

775
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,893
<i>But, um...</i>

776
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:28,427
<i>First, I'm here to tell you</i>

777
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,327
<i>Sean was in London
when Emily disappeared.</i>

778
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,327
<i>And some of you
have suggested</i>

779
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,960
<i>that he did that
to set up an alibi,</i>

780
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:40,595
<i>but he's an amazing husband
and an amazing father, so...</i>

781
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:42,194
<i>The police
haven't been much help.</i>

782
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,394
<i>But every mom knows that if you
want something done right,</i>

783
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:46,527
<i>you have to do it yourself.</i>

784
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,294
<i>I will leave
no stone unturned.</i>

785
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,994

what Emily would want.</i>

788
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:56,661
Thanks for holding.

00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,494
How may I direct your call?

790
00:31:58,496 --> 00:31:59,595
Hi, my name
is Stephanie...

791
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:01,261
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

792
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:02,960
My friend works here.
She's been missing...

793
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,928
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

794
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,860
I tried to call
her assistant.

795
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:09,028
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Valerie.

796
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,095
She wasn't super helpful.

797
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,662
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

798
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:12,861
I can't tell
if you're talking to me.

799
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,264
You're looking right at me.

800
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:16,361
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.

801
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:18,361
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

802
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,694
Her name is Emily Nelson.

803
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,428
She's the head
of the PR department.

804
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,762
Emily's not in today.

805
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,428
I know she's not in.

806
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,695
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.

807
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,561
Just gonna...

808
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,027
Sorry. No, I am not sorry.

809
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,728
I need to speak
to Dennis Nylon, please?

810
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,395
A woman's missing, so...

811
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,494
Mr. Nylon's
not here right now.

812
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:39,628
Great, I'll wait.

813
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,796
Knock yourself out.

814
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:42,830
Okay.

815
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,761
RECEPTIONIST:
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

816
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:03,027
Um, Mr. Nylon?

817
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,894
We don't accept
unsolicited resumes.

818
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,427
Cool, that's not why
I'm here.

819
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:07,528
Um, we have a problem.

820
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,327
We most certainly do.

821
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:10,661
A friend of mine works in
your publicity department...

822
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,230
Is that a vintage
Hermes scarf?

823
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:14,395
My Aunt Frieda
gave it to me.

824
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:15,860
Did she want you
to hang yourself with it?

825
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:17,461
Look at that knot,
Jesus fucking Christ!

826
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,362
I'm here about
Emily Nelson.

827
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,027
What about Emily?
What happened?

828
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:23,361
She asked me to pick up
her son four days ago

829
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,695
because she went to Miami.

830
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:26,528
She's still not back.
No texts, no calls,

831
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,794
and no one in your office
seems to give a crap.

832
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:28,797
Excuse my language.

833
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:31,894
- Kiko.
- Hmm?

834
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:33,595
Why did Emily
go to Miami?

835
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:34,964
I didn't know she did.

836
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:38,893
We in this office
have learned that

837
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,594
when Emily elects
not to tell us something,

838
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:41,994
it's best not to ask.

839
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:43,462
Doesn't she work for you?

840
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,760
Emily's job
is to stop the apocalypse

841
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,629
without worrying
any of the designers.

842
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:48,960
And she always
finds a way

843
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,495
to look fabulous
when she does it.

844
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,793
That's great!

845
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:54,028
What do you suggest
that I do?

846
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,461
Never wear a vintage Hermes
scarf with a Gap T-shirt.

847
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,629
If you were truly Emily's
friend, you would know that.

848
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,697
Excuse me,
I have a very busy day.

849
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,328
Valerie, my office.

850
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,330
Now!

851
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:22,427
Hi.

852
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,464
DENNIS: Sit, sit, sit!
Emily! I want answers.

853
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,830
MAN: Steven,
you forgot the shirts.

854
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,893
WOMAN: No, I can't
help you with that.

855
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,327
Of course he's
freaking out.

856
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,728
He needs someone
to manage this now.

857
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,897

1043

started watching it,

we were just making
fun of you.

But, um...

1046
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,727
But then, you had some
really helpful hints in there.

got that rash,

like this.

do the same for me, so...

anytime, it's nothing.

my new mom!

to be your mom.

00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:51,427
that he took out
an extra $4 million

1202
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:52,760
life insurance policy

1203
00:51:52,762 --> 00:51:54,529
on Emily
before she disappeared?

1204
00:51:56,562 --> 00:51:59,695
I was not aware of that, no.

1205
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,863
Why? How would I?

1206
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:06,361
(CHUCKLES) Okay, all right.

1207
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:08,663
(SIGHS) Yeah, I don't...

1208
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:11,396
I'm sorry. What...

1209
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:14,426
What are you...

1210
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:15,759
Are you saying
he had her rubbed out?

1211
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,260
He hired a hitman?

1212
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:20,460
(LAUGHING)

1213
00:52:20,462 --> 00:52:22,792
I didn't say anything
about him hiring a hitman.

1214
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:23,892
You just did.

1215
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,693
Okay.

1216
00:52:25,695 --> 00:52:27,326
I can see that
you're enjoying yourself,

1217
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:28,461
Detective Summerville.

1218
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:29,993
But if you wanna
grill someone, you should

1219
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:32,527
really speak to Emily's
boss, Dennis Nylon.

1220
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:34,326
He could not be
more suspicious.

1221
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:36,593
That's super interesting
because he contacted us.

1222
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:39,693
And he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on.

1223
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:42,026
Well, he sucks.

1224
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:44,526
So... (SIGHS)

1225
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,826
As long as you're honest
with me, Ms. Smothers,

1226
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:47,993
I swear to you,

1227
00:52:47,995 --> 00:52:49,926
you have nothing
to worry about. Okay?

1228
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:53,692
I'm just following
breadcrumbs wherever they lead.

1229
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:55,427
Okay, you know what?
I'm done for now.

1230
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:57,461
Thanks for your time.

1231
00:52:57,463 --> 00:53:00,027
(STAMMERS) Your theory doesn't
hold water, you know,

1232
00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:01,426
because it doesn't explain

1233
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,727
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car.

1234
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:05,926
And why would someone
shoot her full of heroin

1235
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:07,193
at a summer camp in Michigan?

1236
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:09,262
There's plenty of good heroin
right here in Connecticut!

1237
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,293
I'm told.

1238
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,893
Great, good. Okay, so
we have a lot to talk about.

1239
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:15,559
All right, then.
Enjoy the new house.

1240
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:18,260
The worst breadcrumbs I've
ever heard of, you know.

1241
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,426
Couldn't fill
a Caesar salad

1242
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:20,729
- with those breadcrumbs!
- (DOOR CLOSES)

1243
00:53:27,528 --> 00:53:28,862
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

1244
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:17,426
Why is this Caesarean
salad so crunchy?

1245
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:20,197
It's Caesar salad, baby,
and it's delicious.

1246
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:21,829
What's in it?

1247
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,329
Breadcrumbs.

1248
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,660
Oh.

1249
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,863
How was your day at work?

1250
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:28,894
Grim.

1251
00:54:28,896 --> 00:54:30,060
Spent most of the day
explaining the difference

1252
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:34,526
between "your" possessive
and "you're" apostrophe R-E

1253
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:37,426
to college juniors.

1254
00:54:37,428 --> 00:54:39,396
I can see how that might
drive a man over the edge.

1255
00:54:40,562 --> 00:54:42,026
I know, right?

1256
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,459
What about you boys?

1257
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:45,660
What'd you guys get up to
today at school?

1258
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:46,863
I saw my mom.

1259
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:52,526
I understand, Nicky,
that sometimes

1260
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:54,462
we think we see people
that we miss

1261
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:56,759
even if they're gone.

1262
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,394
No, I saw her.

1263
00:54:58,396 --> 00:54:59,593
She was right outside
the fence

1264
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:01,428
by the kickball yard
at recess.

1265
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:05,460
Lots of people
look like someone else.

1266
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:06,729
Nobody looks like Mom!

1267
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,529
She told me
to say hi to Stephanie.

1268
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,026
Nicky,

1269
00:55:11,028 --> 00:55:12,627
this is unhealthy.

1270
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,629
Miles saw her, too.
Right, Miles?

1271
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,459
I think I did.

1272
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:18,592
But I don't know.

1273
00:55:18,594 --> 00:55:19,993
I was playing tetherball.

1274
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:21,827
Did you two hatch this up?

1275
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:24,026
Is this a game, like when you
smash everything with trucks?

1276
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:25,627
Because you know
what we say about lying.

1277
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:28,261
I'm not lying!
I saw her! Fuck you!

1278
00:55:28,263 --> 00:55:29,659
Hey, Nicky!

1279
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:30,662
MILES: Oopsy!

1280
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,263
I'm sorry.

1281
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,493
Don't I get a kiss
good night?

1282
00:55:45,495 --> 00:55:47,426
Of course you do, sweetie.

1283
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,361
Actually, you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter

1284
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:50,796
for earlier, but I...

1285
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:58,596
Good night, sweetie.

1286
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:09,230
Hey.

1287
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:12,196
We should get naked.

1288
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:15,662
What is it?

1289
00:56:16,462 --> 00:56:17,792
What's wrong?

1290
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:21,327
I smell her, Sean.
I smell her perfume.

1291
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:23,660
It's all over Nicky
like a ghost.

1292
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:25,026
He probably got
to her perfume bottle

1293
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:26,727
in the medicine cabinet.

1294
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:28,560
He misses her.

1295
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:29,860
Okay? It's just you
being paranoid.

1296
00:56:29,862 --> 00:56:31,930
Is it? Because
I found this, too.

1297
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,893
What's this?

1298
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:36,393
It's the friendship
bracelet I made her.

1299
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:37,963
I'm afraid to say
she would not have kept this.

1300
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:41,393
She hated stuff like this.

1301
00:56:41,395 --> 00:56:42,559
She probably
gave it to him

1302
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:43,993
right after
you gave it to her.

1303
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:45,993
Unless he's
telling the truth.

1304
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:48,428
You saw her
with your own eyes.

1305
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:50,560
In her coffin.

1306
00:56:50,562 --> 00:56:51,959
There was something off.

1307
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:54,026
They found her
at the bottom of a lake!

1308
00:56:54,028 --> 00:56:55,559
You saw her tattoo,

1309
00:56:55,561 --> 00:56:57,762
and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother.

1310
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:01,960
She said your mother wanted
her to have that ring.

1311
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:03,393
She said your
mother insisted.

1312
00:57:03,395 --> 00:57:05,759
That's what she told you?
(SCOFFS)

1313
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:07,927
My father gave that ring
to my mother.

1314
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:09,294
It was like
the only bit of jewelry

1315
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:10,560
that she ever owned.

1316
00:57:10,562 --> 00:57:12,493
I took Emily to London
to meet my mother

1317
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,727
after we eloped.

1318
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:16,393
It went missing
that weekend.

1319
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:19,459
My mother was frantic.
We searched everywhere.

1320
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:20,895
Nothing. We didn't
find a single thing.

1321
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:24,292
<i>My mother was devastated.</i>

1322
00:57:24,294 --> 00:57:25,763
<i>So we took a flight
back to New York.</i>

1323
00:57:26,995 --> 00:57:28,495
Guess what I found.

1324
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:30,729
What did you find?

1325
00:57:31,662 --> 00:57:32,960
- No!
- (LAUGHS)

1326
00:57:32,962 --> 00:57:34,692
No way!

1327
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:37,292
- My little Sherlock Holmes.
- (LAUGHS)

1328
00:57:37,294 --> 00:57:39,027
Mum is gonna be
so relieved.

1329
00:57:39,029 --> 00:57:40,927
Oh, come on, baby.

1330
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,663
Mum will take it to the grave.
What a waste.

1331
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:45,659
So pretty.

1332
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:46,627
Excuse me.

1333
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,459
Not amusing, my darling,
not in the slightest.

1334
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:52,259
I'm not joking
in the slightest,

1335
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,026
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
my darling.

1336
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:55,027
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
I took it.

1337
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:57,392
I don't have any intention
of giving it back.

1338
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:58,592
Of course
we're gonna give it back.

1339
00:57:58,594 --> 00:58:00,293
No.

1340
00:58:00,295 --> 00:58:01,627
We'll tell her that
it just slipped

1341
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:02,892
into your purse
by accident,

1342
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:05,425
and we've only
found it now.

1343
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:07,360
But if you tell her
that I found it,

1344
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:08,859
then I have to tell her
that I stole it.

1345
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,260
And what do you think
will be worse for her?

1346
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:13,426
Thinking that
she lost her ring,

1347
00:58:13,428 --> 00:58:16,260
or thinking that her son
married a thief? (GASPS)

1348
00:58:16,262 --> 00:58:17,759
- Baby...
- Hey.

1349
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,895
You choose, her or me?

1350
00:58:23,028 --> 00:58:24,926
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.

1351
00:58:24,928 --> 00:58:25,962
Knock twice.

1352
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:55,959
SEAN: <i>Nine months later,
Nicky was born.</i>

1353
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:58,027
STEPHANIE:
<i>How could you stay with her?</i>

1354
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:00,292
I was spellbound.

1355
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:01,393
She was the only woman

1356
00:59:01,395 --> 00:59:02,827
I could never
figure out fully.

1357
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:04,959
As a young, arrogant
writer, I could never

1358
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,993
live up to what
she expected of me.

1359
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:08,792
I was always
looking over my shoulder.

1360
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:10,228
I could hardly sleep.

1361
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:13,459
But with you,
it's different.

1362
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:14,893
I sleep like a log.

1363
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,626
That's what every woman
wants to hear.

1364
00:59:16,628 --> 00:59:17,692
You know what I mean.

1365
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:19,461
You understand me,
you see me.

1366
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:22,325
You've rebuilt me,
Stephanie.

1367
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:23,762
I've even started
writing again.

1368
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,592
First couple of chapters,

1369
00:59:26,594 --> 00:59:27,796
but it's a start.

1370
00:59:29,628 --> 00:59:30,696
Oh.

1371
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:33,759
That's wonderful.

1372
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:35,660
You took a broken man,

1373
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:37,993
and you pieced him
back together again.

1374
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,461
You're unlike any other

1891
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,527
What were you saying about
me being a fucking psycho?

1892
01:25:06,827 --> 01:25:08,391
Do you love her?

1893
01:25:08,393 --> 01:25:10,559
No. It was just sex.

1894
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:13,328
Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?

1895
01:25:13,593 --> 01:25:14,594
Yes.

1896
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:19,024
Do you love me
or not, baby?

1897
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:20,725
Of course I do.

1898
01:25:20,727 --> 01:25:22,492
She doesn't mean
a thing to me.

1899
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:23,724

Fuck. Oh, God.

Can you imagine
if I would've, though?

1905
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,790
What a mess.

1906
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:35,625
Emily, you're crazy.

1907
01:25:35,627 --> 01:25:37,958
Hey, it's pretty
simple. You know?

1908
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,861
It's your choice.
Her or me?

1909
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:41,927
It's not that hard.

1910
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:44,861
Hey.

1911
01:25:45,427 --> 01:25:46,758
Stop it.

1912
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,890
You love this.

Mr. Townsend, Isabel Prager,
Addison First Insurance.

1918
01:26:12,726 --> 01:26:14,424
I'm investigating
the death benefit claim

1919
01:26:14,426 --> 01:26:15,694
for your late wife.

1920
01:26:19,294 --> 01:26:20,295
Sean,

1921
01:26:21,494 --> 01:26:23,395
did you know that
Emily had a twin?

1922
01:26:26,026 --> 01:26:27,557
No, but...

1923
01:26:27,559 --> 01:26:29,359
Well, I hate
to even say this,

1924
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:30,825
but it means
the body in the lake

1925
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,757
could be this sister.

1926
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:34,458
ISABEL: It could explain
the DNA match.

1927
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,558
And if that's the case,

1928
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,794
then where is Emily?

1929
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:45,025
If my wife was still alive,
she'd come home.

1930
01:26:45,027 --> 01:26:46,228
She'd wanna see her son.

1931
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,025
I'm not a cop,

1932
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,858

interesting case.

1935

This is just bananas,
isn't it?

1936
01:26:59,626 --> 01:27:01,458
- Yeah.
- ISABEL: I will say,

1937
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,857
it's unusual

1938
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:04,658
to live with someone
as husband and wife

1939
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,925
and not know
that they have a twin.

1940
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:07,891
She was a very
private person.

1941
01:27:07,893 --> 01:27:10,991
Well, hey,
we all have our secrets.

you can understand,

with a payment of this size,

1945
01:27:16,327 --> 01:27:18,391
we'll have to continue
this claims investigation.

1946
01:27:18,393 --> 01:27:19,491
Of course.

1947
01:27:19,493 --> 01:27:21,591
And, by law,
give all our findings

1948
01:27:21,593 --> 01:27:22,791
to the authorities.

1949
01:27:22,793 --> 01:27:24,558
Of course,
anything you need.

1950
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,690
I just hope that my wife
is still alive.

1951
01:27:26,692 --> 01:27:27,694
I want her back.

1952
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,491
Okey-dokey, then.

Obviously, if you
do hear from her...

- You'll be the first to know.
- Thank you so much!

- Thank you so much again.
- Thanks.

1958
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,791
You knew that
she had a twin.

01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:46,991
Did I?

1960
01:27:46,993 --> 01:27:48,725
Why didn't you?

1961
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:49,992
You knew
and you didn't tell me.

1963
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,460
you sound crazy.

1964

Take a Xanax.

1965
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:58,690
Take two.

<i>For thinking outside the box.</i>

to just be flowers anymore.</i>

Nice, big twist.
I taught you well.

1982
01:28:42,393 --> 01:28:44,426
Ooh, wisdom.

1983
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,690
Hey, give me that.

1984
01:28:47,692 --> 01:28:49,259
I don't know
what tricks you have

1985
01:28:49,261 --> 01:28:51,359
up those new
sleeves of yours.

1986
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:52,992
You think
I poisoned both drinks?

1987
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,328
That's not my style.

1988
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:56,594
I don't even eat gluten.

1989
01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:01,328
- Want another?
- Please.

1990
01:29:02,827 --> 01:29:03,991
First, tell me why

1991
01:29:03,993 --> 01:29:05,658
you killed your father
and sister.

1992
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:07,259
Okay, why don't we
first talk about

1993
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:08,624
your son's real father?

1994
01:29:08,626 --> 01:29:11,424
Oh! Emily,
I hold all the cards here.

1995
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:12,891
I wanna know
about your twin, Faith.

1996
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:14,025
I'm not a twin.

1997
01:29:14,027 --> 01:29:15,857
Great, I know that you are.

1998
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,524
We were triplets.

1999
01:29:17,526 --> 01:29:19,791
Faith, Hope, and Charity.
Charity was stillborn.

2000
01:29:19,793 --> 01:29:20,891
Mom thought we offed her

2001
01:29:20,893 --> 01:29:21,958
- in the womb.
- Hmm.

2002
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,890
Dad believed her.

2003
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:25,793
She's quite a woman,
your mother.

2004
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:28,558
I had a nice afternoon
with Mags.

2005
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,423
You met my mother?

2006
01:29:30,425 --> 01:29:32,523
She likes her martinis
even stronger than yours.

2007
01:29:32,525 --> 01:29:35,258
We had a little walk
down memory lane.

2008
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,992
She's a cold woman, Em.

2009
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:39,891
Bet you couldn't do
anything right in her eyes.

2010
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:42,259
It was probably Faith's
idea to set the fire.

2011
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:43,924
But then, all the bad ideas
were Faith's, weren't they?

2012
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:45,957
- You don't know anything.
- Sure I do.

2013
01:29:45,959 --> 01:29:47,590

had the biting comment...</i>

- Dad! Dad!

(ECHOING) Fuck off!

2030
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:41,490
We had to say goodbye,
so we did it with tattoos.

something for Charity.</i>

We split up

01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,491
She was gonna head
south to Mexico,

2034
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:54,458
<i>I was gonna go north.</i>

2035
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,624
<i>We set a time
and place to meet</i>

2036
01:30:55,626 --> 01:30:57,426
<i>after the smoke cleared.</i>

2037
01:30:58,525 --> 01:31:01,025
<i>But then,
she never showed up.</i>

2038
01:31:01,027 --> 01:31:03,460
<i>I was worried sick.
I waited for days.</i>

2039
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,757
<i>But nothing.</i>

2040
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:07,324
I thought maybe
this is my opportunity

2041
01:31:07,326 --> 01:31:08,458
to do it on my own.

2042
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,757
She was always getting me
into trouble.

2043
01:31:09,759 --> 01:31:10,925
So I bought a one-way
ticket to New York

2044
01:31:10,927 --> 01:31:12,324
and never looked back.

2045
01:31:12,326 --> 01:31:13,423
Did you miss her?

2046
01:31:13,425 --> 01:31:14,490
Of course I missed her.

2047
01:31:14,492 --> 01:31:15,992
I wasn't whole without her.

2048
01:31:15,994 --> 01:31:17,891
But I couldn't go on like
that, I had to survive.

2049
01:31:17,893 --> 01:31:18,791
And it worked.

2050
01:31:18,793 --> 01:31:20,924
Yeah, my life in New York
fell into place.

2051
01:31:20,926 --> 01:31:23,757
I got a job,
worked my way up.

Oh, you know
that part, though.

2054
01:31:28,325 --> 01:31:29,758
Then your sister calls.

01:31:30,993 --> 01:31:33,323
- You had to see her.
- Yeah, of course I did.

2057
01:31:33,325 --> 01:31:36,524
So you fabricate
this trip to Miami,

2058
01:31:36,526 --> 01:31:37,824
meet up at the old camp.

01:47:05,026 --> 01:47:06,560
Thanks. That means a lot.

2402
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:09,625
But you did
confess, Emily.

2403
01:47:10,391 --> 01:47:13,392
Oh. Yeah. Um...

2404
01:47:14,691 --> 01:47:18,024
I did. But I cut
these first, though.

2405
01:47:18,026 --> 01:47:20,289
For our
friendship bracelets.

2406
01:47:20,291 --> 01:47:21,990
One for you!

2407
01:47:21,992 --> 01:47:25,356
That is disappointing.

2408
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:28,689
Oh! My God! Look what I found.

(GUN COCKS)

2410
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:33,824
Okay. You can't shoot us.
The police are outside.

2411
01:47:33,826 --> 01:47:36,024
No, they're not.

2412
01:47:36,026 --> 01:47:38,356
(IMITATING) Hey,
cops, Stephanie here.

2413
01:47:38,358 --> 01:47:39,423
Change of plans.

2414
01:47:39,425 --> 01:47:41,657
I'm meeting Emily and Sean
at Darren's house now.

2415
01:47:41,659 --> 01:47:42,757
I'll see you there.

2416
01:47:42,759 --> 01:47:44,457
You sent them
to Darren's house?

2417
01:47:44,459 --> 01:47:46,656
- (BONG BUBBLING)
- It's a virus.

2418
01:47:46,658 --> 01:47:48,923
String theory.
String theory, isn't it?

2419
01:47:48,925 --> 01:47:51,889
- (WOMEN SCREAM)
- Hands up! Weapons down!

2420
01:47:51,891 --> 01:47:53,556
No, I have
a prescription for that.

2421
01:47:53,558 --> 01:47:55,290
I have ocular pressure!

2422
01:47:55,292 --> 01:47:56,757
Come on, I've been
on the run for 10 years.

2423
01:47:56,759 --> 01:47:58,657
You think I don't know
how to manipulate the system?

2424
01:47:58,659 --> 01:48:00,624
So you're gonna kill us?

2425
01:48:00,626 --> 01:48:02,590
Well, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

2426
01:48:02,592 --> 01:48:04,257
You two will
clearly go to

2427
01:48:04,259 --> 01:48:05,890
extraordinary lengths
to take me down.

2428
01:48:05,892 --> 01:48:07,556
And you know too much.

2429
01:48:07,558 --> 01:48:09,757
So, I feel like
a murder-suicide

2430
01:48:09,759 --> 01:48:12,389
is the only fitting
end for you two.

2431
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:13,456
And if you kill him,

2432
01:48:13,458 --> 01:48:15,789
I think our insurance
still covers that, right?

2433
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:17,589
I mean, sort of perfect.

2434
01:48:17,591 --> 01:48:19,390
One door closes
and another one opens.

2435
01:48:19,392 --> 01:48:20,724
Thank you for that.

2436
01:48:20,726 --> 01:48:22,824
You always have been fucking
crazy, haven't you?

2437
01:48:22,826 --> 01:48:24,358
Have I?

2438

(SEAN GROANING)

2439
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:28,489
Oh, shit. You're right.

2440
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:30,358
God, you fucking...
You actually fucking shot me.

2441
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:32,890
I'm gonna miss him.

2442
01:48:32,892 --> 01:48:33,893
Your turn.

2443
01:48:34,825 --> 01:48:36,923
Emily, come on.

2444
01:48:36,925 --> 01:48:38,689
You're not gonna kill me.

2445
01:48:38,691 --> 01:48:40,956
Oh, yeah. I killed my
dad and my sister,

2446
01:48:40,958 --> 01:48:44,656
but I could never kill my
husband-fucking best friend.

2447
01:48:44,658 --> 01:48:46,657
Am I really
your best friend?

2448
01:48:46,659 --> 01:48:48,823
You're not just saying
that for, you know...

2449
01:48:48,825 --> 01:48:50,623
No, no, I'm not
just saying that at all.

2450
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:52,556
I get worried
that it's just me.

2451
01:48:52,558 --> 01:48:54,323
I know, sometimes
I was worried about that, too.

2452
01:48:54,325 --> 01:48:55,657
- (STEPHANIE LAUGHS)
- (CONTINUES GROANING)

2453
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:57,423
So hard to connect
with other moms.

2454
01:48:57,425 --> 01:48:59,489
And then when you have
a full-time job, it's...

2455
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:01,024
Okay, okay,
don't pull that crap.

2456
01:49:01,026 --> 01:49:02,389
Being a mom
is a full-time job.

2457
01:49:02,391 --> 01:49:04,289
What I do is hard work.

2458
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:05,657
And I have my vlog
on top of that,

2459
01:49:05,659 --> 01:49:07,389
and that's just getting
bigger and bigger.

2460
01:49:07,391 --> 01:49:09,457
If you came on the vlog,
that'd be so fun.

2461
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:10,858
If you came on the vlog

2462
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:13,757
and confessed to killing your father
and sister and held me at gunpoint,

2463
01:49:13,759 --> 01:49:15,389
I could probably hit
a million subscribers.

2464
01:49:15,391 --> 01:49:16,956
Aww. That
would've been great.

2465

Why don't we
do that right now?

2466

I'm sorry.

the freshest basil

they got away with it.
