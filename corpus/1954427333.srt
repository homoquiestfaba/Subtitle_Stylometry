00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,505
<i>Last week's sudden storm
is nothing new for the people...</i>

2
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,215
Slow down, will ya?

3
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,341
Relax, Rob.

4
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,842
Easy for you to say.

5
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,053
You don't have Amelia Lewis
waiting for you back home.

6
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,223
Amelia Lewis, the Amelia Lewis?

7
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,474
-The one with the...
-Yeah.

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,853
Obviously we can't crash now.
We gotta get you back to Amelia Lewis.

9
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,480
You're just jealous.

10
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,738
-Did you hear that?<i>
-The Curse of Marguerite has been blamed...</i>

11
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,906
I think you broke something.

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,282
Then go check it out.

13
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,951
I'm not going to check it out! You broke it.

14
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,953
Go ahead in back, check it out.

15
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,496
You know what we're hauling?

16
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,707
You really think I'd let somebody put

17
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,208
something on my truck,
I didn't know what it was?

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,252
Do you know what's special about them?
You know what they are?

19
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,713
Yeah, I heard the same thing, too.
I don't believe any of it.

20
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,298
Pete said they shot them up with
a bunch of drugs and then they started...

21
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,175
Pete needs to learn to keep his mouth shut.

22
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>...of Marguerite's ghost.</i>

23
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,429
Check it out!

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,557
What? Are you scared?

25
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,643
-I'm not scared.
-Amelia Lewis doesn't like scared boys.

26
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>Flood waters quickly receding
and meteorologists</i>

27
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>reporting a beautiful
weekend forecast, though.</i>

28
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,483
Just watch the road, okay?

29
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,738
If you're scared, just remember Amelia Lewis.

30
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,742
-I gotta get back to Amelia Lewis.
-Shut up, okay?

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,179
What in the world? What the heck is that?

32
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,242
Oh, man!

33
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,787
You did break something!

34
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,540
No.

35
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,336
What?

36
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,546
You did break something.

37
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,341
No! No!

38
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,802
Rob?

39
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,808
Rob?

40
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,497
It's started.

41
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,126
It's started.

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,678
No! No! No!

43
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,434
No! No! No! No!

44
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,519
Stay away from me! No! No!

45
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,522
No! No! No!

46
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,298
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

47
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,094
Yeah!

48
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:07,182
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.

49
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,437
Yeah!

50
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,992
Come on.

51
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,538
Cheers!

52
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,047
-Hi, how are you?
-Good. Wasn't it beautiful?

53
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,050
It was beautiful.
I mean, it's been a long time coming, huh?

54
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,260
-Those guys are great.
-They're great together.

55
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,863
Oh, my God! So happy for you.

56
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,825
It was so beautiful. Let me see. Let me see.

57
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,579
I'm so happy for you guys. It was amazing.

58
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,505
I'll be right back. So happy for you.

59
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,970
-Hello, darling.
-Hi.

60
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,291
You didn't have to come to her wedding.

61
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,044
You kidding me? This is great.

62
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,796
Let's get away for the day.

63
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,175
I got plans this weekend.

64
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,055
I was gonna hole myself up in my room
and listen to Lionel Richie and cry.

65
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,973
Come on.

66
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,228
Remember when we were kids and our folks
would always take us and Bryce out...

67
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,523
Chris, I'm so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

68
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,527
When's the last time we were out
at the point together?

69
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,446
I haven't been there in a long time, Ash.

70
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,241
Place doesn't exactly conjure up
good feelings for me.

71
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,994
Yeah, but, I mean, we should go.

72
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,289
I go out all the time,
and Ian's got his family boat for the day.

73
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,626
I don't want to hang out with Ian.
He hates me.

74
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,128
Please! Come on, Chris.

75
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,215
Sam's going, of course. Kerri will be there.

76
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,550
-You trying to set me up right now?
-It's not a set-up.

77
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,843
I don't need a pity date, Ash.

78
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,012
It's not, you'd be doing me a favor.

79
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,557
Ian always gets so plastered
every time we go out on the boat.

80
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,894
If you guys don't come, he's just gonna
want to mess around the whole time.

81
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,523
And I want somebody who can
actually carry a conversation, you know?

82
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,400
You got problems in paradise?

83
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,571
No, just Ian's Ian.

84
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,865
You know how it is.

85
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,952
Frat parties were fun at first,
but, I mean, you gotta grow up sometime.

86
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,332
Please, please, please, please.
You have to come.

87
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,545
All right.

88
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,255
Okay, you will not regret this.

89
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,799
-I regret it already.
-I'm so excited.

90
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,386
Can you slow down, please?
I'm trying to be somber here.

91
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,516
Please tell me some good news.

92
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,396
So tell me, Hutch, those tech guys
that called this in, were they right?

93
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
Looks like it.

94
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,983
On a scale of one to ten,
one being, "Let's go get some coffee."

95
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,234
Ten being,

96
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,195
"How do you want to spend your last night
on earth," what are we looking at?

97
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,906
Ten? Looks more like a 20.

98
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,283
That's what I was afraid of.

99
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,827
"Specimen 0," what's that?

100
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:00,331
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it was a lot bigger than the others.

101
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,382
You shouldn't be out here!

102
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,220
Unless you prepared for what you might find!

103
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,473
Better get back, sir! It's not safe just yet!

104
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,310
No! No!

105
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,899
The danger just getting started!

106
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,239
It's gonna be
one of those backwater towns, huh?

107
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,242
Salvage what you can.
I want an expanding perimeter on the swamp.

108
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,702
Yes, sir!

109
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,128
Hey, Chris, it's me.

110
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,967
Why don't you give me a call?
I'm just thinking about you.

111
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,975
I told her, "Look, honey, Trevor is my man."

112
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,102
Yes, I did.

113
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,230
I told her that she lost her chances with him
that last night at bingo,

114
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,065
and that if she didn't like it, well,

115
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,319
then I'd be happy to walk on over there
and shove my foot right up...

116
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,404
Morning, Marge.

117
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,328
Marge! Marge!

118
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,415
Will you get that damn hearing aid fixed?

119
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,002
-Lucille.
-Ranger Hardin.

120
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,629
You know, that Davids boy was out
past my property the other night

121
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,047
blasting his dynamite again.

122
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,299
Yeah, well,
I'll go have a little talk with him, then.

123
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,553
Well, you best head on down to the dock,
then, 'cause he's there right now.

124
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,722
And I hear Chris is with him.

125
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,390
My Chris?

126
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,276
This is Specimen number five.

127
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,071
-Is that the last one?
-No, I got a few more to collect.

128
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,037
-Do you hear that?
-Yeah.

129
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,707
-We should go check that out.
-All right, come on.

130
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,568
-Did you hear that?
-I did.

131
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,071
-It's over there.
-Let's go.

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,297
All right, let's do this.

133
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,715
I'm excited, and you?

134
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,301
-Yeah, I know.
-You know I am excited.

135
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,221
I know, Chris, Chris, Chris,
that's all you talk about.

136
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,432
Yeah, well, we haven't done this in so long.

137
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,275
Just hang back with the boat,
I gotta go find Chris.

138
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,568
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,074
Hey, partner, there's some good-lookers
down in the swamp today, eh?

140
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,785
Drop dead.

141
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,914
Make me wish I was 20 year younger.

142
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,916
Oglin' the coeds again, boys?

143
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,962
Sorry, Ranger Hardin.
Just enjoying the Blackbriar sights.

144
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,343
Hey, Chris, you made it!

145
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,594
Hi!

146
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,722
Chris.

147
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,058
Hey. Fun.

148
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,560
Don't worry about him, you're here with me.

149
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,647
Hey, Ashley! How are you? Good to see you.
Chris, what's up?

150
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,399
Right this way, dear wench.

151
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,234
-Shut up.
-What?

152
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,737
Hey, Chris, like my new swimsuit?

153
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,115
It's cute, thank you.

154
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,910
You need help with the beer
or anything like that?

155
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,662
Come on, let's go.

156
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,831
You chuckin' your line today, Brutus?

157
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,375
Sure. You want us to bring you back a big,
old gator head?

158
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,710
You can hang it on your wall?

159
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,381
You get brave on us, Sheriff,
come out on gator water with us, huh?

160
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,052
Chipmunk said
you should come out to the boat with us.

161
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,054
Well, maybe sometime I'll surprise you,

162
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,766
but in the meantime,
be careful and watch the drinking, huh?

163
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,851
Yeah, don't be so scared.

164
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,564
So you actually went to that wedding.
What a loser.

165
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,399
-Sucker.
-Stop it.

166
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,650
It was a sweet gesture.

167
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,028
A true gentleman can admit
when he's been defeated.

168
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,073
Yeah, but what loser
wants to be a gentleman?

169
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,408
Stop it. Stop.

170
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,995
If this is going on all weekend,
I'll shoot somebody.

171
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,084
Hey, Ranger Hardin.

172
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,420
Hey, Ashley.

173
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,923
Mom. I'll be right back.

174
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,008
Just wait up.

175
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,178
Mom, what are you doing here?

176
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,305
I have been calling your cell phone for days!

177
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,432
I've been busy, Mom. I'm sorry, okay?

178
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,726
So, how was the wedding?

179
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,478
I mean, I thought maybe
you'd want to talk afterwards.

180
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,232
It was fine. Whatever, I don't care.
It was nice.

181
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,195
Is that the Davids' boat?

182
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,488
Yes.

183
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,076
My office has gotten a few calls
about Ian doing some dynamite fishing.

184
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,327
Now, I haven't caught him yet,

185
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,580
but if I do catch him and whoever he's with,
they're gonna be in some big trouble,

186
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,041
so I'm hoping that is not what
you were planning on doing this weekend.

187
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,668
No, we're just going out
to have some fun, all right?

188
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,128
It's not a big deal, it's innocent, okay?

189
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,880
Okay, you just be careful.

190
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,010
That swamp, it can be mean.

191
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,557
Dad told me that you filed the other day.

192
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,228
I thought you were
gonna try to patch things up.

193
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,397
Honey, it's not that simple.

194
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,317
And are you sure that this is
the right move for you guys?

195
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,320
-Christopher, honey.
-It's fine. It's fine.

196
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,453
Kerri Ponter, is that you?

197
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,371
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,499
-Does your grandma know you're here?
-Mom.

199
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,586
-Are you nuts?
-What?

200
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,713
She's underage for drinking
and you're dragging her out

201
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,006
-to your wild orgy.
-She's not drinking.

202
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,382
Wild orgies, what are you talking about?

203
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,675
Where do you get this stuff from?

204
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,219
-Do you think she'll call my grandma?
-No.

205
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,473
We're just going out on the boat
to have a little fun on the water.

206
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,725
Man, come on. You coming? I'm shoving off.

207
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,352
-All right, I gotta go.
-Wait, wait.

208
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,145
-I gotta go.
-Wait, wait, wait, listen...

209
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,859
Honey, I really want to hang out with you, so,

210
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,696
how about I make you some dinner,
something like that?

211
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,449
Maybe. Yeah, no, that'd be nice. I'd like that.

212
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,284
-Let's do it. I'll talk to you.
-Okay.

213
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,994
Be safe.

214
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,214
<i>Au revoir,</i> Ranger!

215
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,594
Be careful out there.

216
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,222
I like her!

217
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,741
Can't stop us now, we're going!

218
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,912
We're going over this way.

219
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,878
Let's head back to the station.

220
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,422
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:17,078
I tried to hold you off, but you keep pushing.

222
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,045
These people,
they ain't the ones hurting you.

223
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,255
No!

224
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,343
Haven't you been in pain long enough?

225
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,013
Let it go.

226
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:42,145
What's it gonna take for you to be satisfied?

227
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,161
It's war, then.

228
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,917
Keep going, it's right up there.

229
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,562
Who got it better than us, Brutus?

230
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,235
Every day a good day in the swamp.
Even bad day a good day in the swamp.

231
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,321
You got that right, my friend. That's all true.

232
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,242
How much further
until we get to that other line?

233
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,077
We should be there by now.

234
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,996
Hush, hush, looky there.

235
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,956
Looky there.

236
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,833
That's a big, old gator track there.

237
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,294
Yeah, yeah, I think we coming up
on something big, man.

238
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,255
We got him on the run, too,
the way that line is all tight.

239
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,427
Come on, let's get in there and get him.

240
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,145
-Y'all want fish for dinner?
-We don't have any poles, though.

241
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,192
-Oh, my God!
-Here you go. Here you go.

242
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,492
Yeah, baby.

243
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,622
Everybody, lunch is almost ready! Lunch!

244
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:06,748
Y'all want to fish first?

245
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,917
What a day, what a day...

246
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,379
She big like pig, where she go...

247
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,344
Brutus, what's this?

248
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,724
Hey! Anybody there? Are y'all hurt?

249
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,148
We're gonna have
to call this in to Ranger Hardin.

250
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,365
Hey!

251
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,120
Hey?

252
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,211
Marge!

253
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,178
Damn it, Marge,
would you turn up your hearing aid?

254
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,727
Blackbriar Parks and Recreations,
this is Ranger Hardin speaking.

255
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,314
Hey, Brutus. Did y'all get me
that gator head you promised me?

256
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,573
All right, I'm gonna assume that you're
sober while you're giving me this report,

257
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,158
so was it a pick-up or a semi?

258
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,327
No, it's a delivery truck,
ran into a tree stump.

259
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,246
Right.

260
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:33,418
Yeah, there's white containers in the water.
There's more on the ground laying on a tarp.

261
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,795
There's more in the back of the truck,
there's some blood.

262
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,005
Blood?

263
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,215
This truck, it's got blood all in it.

264
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,345
There's more containers in there,
big container, too, that's all busted open.

265
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,931
Yeah, I thinkin' Marguerite
is getting pretty riled up.

266
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:51,019
Okay, you steer clear.
Matt and I are gonna come and check it out.

267
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,733
-What'd she say?
-She said steer clear.

268
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,110
They gonna come check it out.

269
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,905
Meanwhile, let's go find that line you lost.

270
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,573
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,203
Make-up's gonna come off
when you get in the water anyway, huh?

272
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,498
So, what happened with your mom?

273
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,208
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

274
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,251
Yeah, no, we're fine, it's good.

275
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,213
It's good, I'm just happy to be out here.

276
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,090
Having fun, I'm glad you invited me.

277
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,092
-Yeah, I'm glad you're here.
-I am, I am.

278
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,886
-You're such a loser.
-All right, let's do it!

279
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,222
It's what y'all came here for, right?

280
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,765
Later!

281
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,645
Amazing!

282
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,565
Come on, you coming?

283
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,692
All right, I'm up.

284
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:41,736
It's perfect.

285
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,742
That is the only one-piece
I have ever enjoyed.

286
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,457
You sure you're okay
with the whole Kerri thing?

287
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,209
Yes, it's fine, it's stupid.

288
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,753
-She really likes you.
-That's... No, I'm not interested.

289
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,673
Do you have a lighter or a bottle opener?

290
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,174
Come on, get in!

291
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,635
-I don't know, y'all. I don't know about this.
-You're gonna drown me.

292
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,929
Come on, get in! The fish aren't gonna bite.

293
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,056
Okay, all right.

294
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,977
-I'm not a raft, you can't pull me down.
-Get off me.

295
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,730
Looks like little Miss Kerri Ponter grew up.

296
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:17,981
Shut up!

297
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,358
-Shut up.
-What? Look at her.

298
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,777
Come on, let's go! That's what we're here for!

299
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,740
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

300
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,992
-You just seem a little...
-I'm fine, I'm having fun.

301
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,452
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-I'm having fun, and you know what?

302
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,078
-I'm jumping in. All right.
-Okay.

303
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,496
-Okay? I'm fine.
-Yeah.

304
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,581
-Have fun.
-Don't worry about me.

305
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,916
-I'm worried about you.
-Don't worry about me. I'm all right.

306
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,001
Sorry.

307
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,837
Come on! Get in! Get in, come on!

308
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,382
There you go!

309
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,390
The classic Prayer Dive, huh?
Very nice, hard-on.

310
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,226
Ash, get in! Let's go.

311
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,228
No, you guys, you guys have it.

312
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,855
Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!

313
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,398
Jump in my arms, baby!

314
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,858
How's the water down there?

315
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,406
Down! You're going down.

316
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,245
I found the line.

317
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,290
I told you there's another line out here.

318
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:21,878
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Here we go.

319
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:33,056
Oh, yeah. That feel like a good one.

320
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,893
This be present for fair Ranger Hardin, huh?

321
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,728
I think she got crush on me.

322
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,691
-Here it comes, get ready! Get ready!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,491
-What did that?
-Haven't seen that before!

324
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,619
My God.

325
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,871
I dropped the line.

326
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,790
Easy, now.

327
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,292
It's tangled up.

328
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,886
Get your hand out of there.
Get your hand out of there!

329
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,680
-What's the matter?
-Get your hand out of there.

330
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,598
Get your hand out of there!

331
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,022
Brutus!

332
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,882
Do we have to really
walk through this swamp?

333
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,426
Come on, you big baby. I'll take care of you.

334
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:52,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:58,767
So you can't really blame your mom.
I mean, I love your dad, but he's not very...

336
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,769
Attentive?

337
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,980
Yeah. He can get a little preoccupied.

338
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,859
And your mom's been really sad
for a long time, ever since...

339
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,280
Bryce. You can say his name, you know.

340
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:17,160
My dad's been so sad ever since
my mom left, it was really hard on him.

341
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:22,374
I mean, all of us, obviously,
but I just wish I knew how to help him.

342
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:25,877
You know, help both of them.
I don't know what to do.

343
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,213
Sometimes you can't help.

344
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,840
People grow apart.

345
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,803
It happens.

346
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,681
Why don't you just break up with him?

347
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,141
Because, I don't know, I'm just...

348
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm so used to being us,
I don't know how to be me anymore.

349
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,146
I know who you are.

350
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,483
You're just a punk
with questionable taste in dudes.

351
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,903
You're such a jerk.
Fine, you're mildly decent, then.

352
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,656
This is nice.

353
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,450
I know, this is exactly what I want.

354
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,077
I want one.

355
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,746
No, try again in a couple of years,
when you're actually of age.

356
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,039
Really?

357
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,249
Just looking out for you.

358
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,042
You suck.

359
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,545
Whatever, you'll thank me eventually.

360
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,591
You okay?

361
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,552
It's like he doesn't even see me.

362
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,849
Kerri, Chris is actually
one of the good guys, okay?

363
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,225
You don't want to come off as easy.

364
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,395
Do that and you'll attract guys
like my old man or Ian.

365
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,939
-Trust me.
-Head's up, ladies!

366
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,611
-How did I know he was gonna do that.
-Oh, my God!

367
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,030
You're such an ass.

368
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,408
I ruined my back. Why, you got wet?

369
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:41,995
-Kerri, did you get wet?
-Ian!

370
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,413
Little Kerri kind of got wet, huh?

371
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,706
-Stop.
-You got wet?

372
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,084
Oh, Kerri! What are we gonna do?

373
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,755
Where is all this water coming from?
Where's it all coming...

374
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,214
Where's it all coming from?

375
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,425
Have a blast!

376
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,052
What?

377
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,928
Sam, come on.

378
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:04,601
Whatever. I'm over this. Have fun.

379
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,062
Really?

380
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,862
What's her problem? Is this her beer?

381
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,988
Yeah.

382
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,406
Where's your beer?

383
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:22,744
She doesn't let me have one,
but now that she's gone...

384
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,381
Boy, I sure am hungry for lunch.
I'll tell you that much.

385
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,049
Me, too. Look at right over there.

386
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,844
Yeah.

387
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,013
You think Marge got us something good?

388
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,640
I doubt it.

389
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,892
-No way, huh?
-No way, babe.

390
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,562
All righty, let me tie us up.

391
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,772
You need some help?

392
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,607
-I think I got it.
-Okay, good.

393
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,567
Let me grab you over here.

394
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,361
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thanks.

395
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,905
Watch your step.

396
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,740
-Thank you.
-Good job.

397
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,327
He wasn't lying.

398
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,871
Looks like we got a big, old truck
crashed in our swamp, Carly.

399
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,623
Yeah, we sure do.

400
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,963
I wonder what they were hauling.
Think it could be toxic waste or something?

401
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,883
I don't know, but obviously
an investigation has been started.

402
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,055
Somebody should be here.
Where the hell is everybody?

403
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,600
Blackbriar Curse strikes again.

404
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,854
-Right?
-That's not funny.

405
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,149
Sorry, I'm just saying, this is crazy.

406
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,112
Great, now I gotta make phone calls
all afternoon to try and figure out this mess.

407
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,072
Isn't that Brutus?

408
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,743
Yeah, probably got drunk
and fell asleep again.

409
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,579
Old moonshine.

410
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,623
Hey, Brute! Chip!

411
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,045
Why don't you go check out that cab.
I'm gonna check out that boat.

412
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,546
Copy you.

413
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,262
Brutus?

414
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:08,850
Chipmunk?

415
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,234
Oh, God! Brutus.

416
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:22,072
-What is it? What's wrong?
-Marge, Marge, it's Ranger Hardin, come in!

417
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,239
Marge! Damn it!

418
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,867
What did you see? What happened?

419
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,578
Matt! Stay away from the water!

420
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:33,875
Matt!

421
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,271
Matt! Matt! Matt!

422
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,524
I need help! Help me! Help! Help!

423
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,526
Matt! Matt!

424
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,569
Matt! Matt!

425
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
Matt!

426
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,369
Chris?

427
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,419
Ashley?

428
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,476
Oh, my God, you creep! Don't do that!

429
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,562
What? Did you think
it was the Blackbriar Curse?

430
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,565
Old slump hag coming to get you.

431
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,233
-Shut up.
-What?

432
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,985
I thought you liked a little excitement.
Remember?

433
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,862
Are you crazy? Ashley's right over there.

434
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,239
Well, I mean, that makes it kind of hotter,
though, right?

435
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,575
No, it doesn't.

436
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,243
What?

437
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:52,871
That was a mistake, okay?

438
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,748
That's not how you felt before.

439
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,626
I was drunk, and it was stupid,
and you're a creep.

440
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,462
Come on, come here.

441
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,547
What are you gonna do?

442
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,133
Maybe I'll go see if Kerri wants to party, then.

443
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:08,386
Keep doing that,

444
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,098
and you can expect one of those
every day for the rest of your life, jerk.

445
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,361
<i>You know what? You're right.
I'm having a really nice time out here.</i>

446
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:25,403
-Good.
-This is good.

447
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,073
I can see why my brother loved it so much.
It's got a charm.

448
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,992
-I'm glad.
-I haven't been here in so long.

449
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,079
Don't give me that look.

450
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,331
Okay, fine. You want to talk about it?

451
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,582
Please!

452
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,670
Fine. The wedding, it was nice.

453
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,507
It was, she's happy, she looked great.

454
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,843
Her man is nice, which I hate.

455
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,472
I don't know, I'm happy for him. They...
I'm over it!

456
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,556
Sure you are.

457
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,558
Do not start with me like that.

458
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,768
Don't start what?

459
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,522
Don't start something you can't finish now.

460
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,650
Come on, you scared of a girl now? Let's go!
Come on!

461
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,068
Easy! Watch it!

462
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,403
Come on!

463
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,799
Problem?

464
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm not sure. Come on.

465
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,190
Sam?

466
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,194
Where are you guys?

467
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,881
Guys! Get off of me!

468
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,215
Something! Something out there!

469
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,844
-Sam! Get off of me! Help!
-Something out there!

470
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,804
-Kerri!
-Get off of her!

471
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,306
-Kerri!
-Get off of her!

472
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,436
Kerri!

473
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,565
Come on, you okay?

474
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,692
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Kerri!

475
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,069
Come on. Come on.

476
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:33,031
I got you. Come on, easy! Easy!

477
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,786
Something out there! Something out there!

478
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,872
We gotta leave! We gotta leave!
I want to get out!

479
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,540
No gator! No snake!

480
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:43,750
Easy!

481
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,419
-He's all covered in blood!
-What's wrong with him?

482
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,839
Probably just some drunk fool,
fisherman falling out of his boat.

483
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,883
I don't see any boat around, man.

484
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,052
We can't leave this guy here, okay?
We gotta take him somewhere.

485
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,137
Look at him!
What if he has a disease or something?

486
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,681
We gotta get this guy back to town.

487
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:00,058
Screw that, dude.
This dude is not getting in my parents' boat.

488
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,935
Ian, we have to get him to a hospital!

489
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,229
This bloody fool
is not getting in my parents' boat!

490
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,565
We're not gonna leave him here.
Now help me get him up.

491
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,067
Let's go! Right now!

492
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,070
-Come on, come on.
-I'm not helping, just get him up.

493
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,780
-All right, man, we got you.
-Just get on the boat, guys.

494
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,449
We got you. Come on, you're all right.

495
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,536
Thank you.

496
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:36,011
Come on, Ma. Pick up the phone.

497
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,391
Pick up the phone, Ma. Come on!

498
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,893
It's the one time I call her,
she's not answering.

499
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,437
There's no one at the station. I don't know.

500
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,272
We're gonna get home.
We're gonna get home.

501
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,566
What's the hold-up here? Let's go!

502
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,569
Can we get him something to drink?
Something other than beer?

503
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,113
Here you go, old man,
this'll make you feel better.

504
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:59,075
No, no, no, go quick, quick, quick, get out!
Something out there I never seen!

505
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:02,370
Not gator, not snake, not fish! Too big.

506
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:06,624
One ate Brutus! It gobbled him gone!
Come back for us next.

507
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,710
Dead! Dead!

508
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,962
This old coot's not drunk, he's nuts.

509
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:12,881
Was there an accident?

510
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,843
Not accident, no, snakefish!
Ate Brutus dead! He dead!

511
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,846
Great, thanks a lot, Ash.

512
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,600
Exactly how I wanted to spend my weekend,
babysitting some old drunk.

513
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,851
Don't be an ass, okay?

514
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,561
It wouldn't hurt you
to think of someone else for once.

515
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,563
-Sam, it's okay.
-The hell it is, okay?

516
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,231
-Quit apologizing for him.
-All right, enough!

517
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,858
This isn't helping anybody.

518
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,277
Ian, you take me, Sam and Kerri back.

519
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,988
We'll take care of him, and you and Ashley
come back and have some fun.

520
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,408
No! I'm coming with you.

521
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,910
What?

522
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:44,746
Ian can have his boat all to himself.

523
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,499
What do you say, Kerri?

524
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,878
You want to stay here with me,
or do you want to go with them?

525
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,924
-Look at that! Look at that!
-What the hell's your problem, old man!

526
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,927
See? See? We got to kill them,
before they kill us all dead!

527
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:00,679
What is that? Fish?

528
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,848
What is that?
I've never seen so many of them.

529
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,934
-It's like a school of fish, right?
-What do they want?

530
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,727
Maybe they're hungry.
Let's throw Sam in and see...

531
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,812
-Oh, my God!
-Man, stop!

532
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,397
-I'm joking!
-We got to kill that thing!

533
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,690
-You're crazy!
-We got... They...

534
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,858
What are you talking about?
Nobody understands!

535
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,985
Idiot kids! Do something!

536
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,738
Don't even think about it, old man!

537
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,948
No, stop! Stop!

538
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,117
Are you all right?

539
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,743
-Back up!
-Mistake...

540
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,666
Kerri!

541
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,128
-Right here. I'm right here.
-I'm okay.

542
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,046
-You all right?
-Yeah, she's fine, everyone.

543
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,464
What is your problem?

544
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:37,632
Get...

545
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,056
-Kerri! Take her hand!
-Come on!

546
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,474
Come on!

547
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,810
Kerri! Kerri! Kerri!

548
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,062
Help! Somebody help...

549
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,860
-Kerri? Kerri, get out!
-What happened?

550
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,070
Kerri! No...

551
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,073
-Get us out of here!
-Yeah.

552
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:03,867
Oh, my God!

553
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,460
Where's Kerri? What happened?

554
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:14,669
They killed the motor.

555
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,881
Oh, no, we got to leave.

556
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,800
We got to go, not safe.

557
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,095
The engine's dead. We're stranded.

558
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,035
Marguerite,

559
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,997
I didn't want to have to do this.

560
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,270
Where are you?

561
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,025
Where are you?

562
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,951
Marge, I need you to make a call!

563
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,452
Ranger Hardin?

564
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:31,871
And you are?

565
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:34,708
I'm Trooper Mark Simon
with the Louisiana State Police. Can I...

566
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,167
-Carly?
-Jim...

567
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:40,046
Thank God! Are you okay? What happened?

568
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,048
Ranger Hardin, can I talk to you in private?

569
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:46,886
Anything you have to say to her,
you can say in front of me. I'm her husband.

570
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:48,513
Ex-husband.

571
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:50,890
Soon to be ex-husband.

572
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,560
It's complicated, forget it.

573
00:39:58,732 --> 00:39:59,899
Let's go, you guys.

574
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,484
-All right, guys, ready?
-Yeah.

575
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,153
Ready, hut.

576
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,239
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

577
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,382
So what the hell is going on in Blackbriar?

578
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:28,428
Early this morning, a delivery truck
carrying a cargo of <i>Channa micropeltes</i>

579
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,513
crashed down by 8-Mile Ditch.

580
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:32,932
Snakeheads?

581
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,228
They're indigenous to Southeast Asia,
but they're not found in Louisiana.

582
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,565
I teach at the community college,
a biology professor...

583
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:46,237
Associate instructor.
I mean, tenure is so very political...

584
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,117
Point is, I know my fish.

585
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,620
<i>Channa micropeltes</i> is...

586
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,998
Well, it's the most aggressive
of the snakehead species.

587
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,041
No kidding.

588
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,835
Well, there have been infestations
in the States before,

589
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:06,549
but usually it's some yahoo gets a couple
as pets and decides to dump 'em in the river.

590
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,470
Did you know that it only takes them
two years to reach maturity

591
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:16,309
and that a fully grown female adult
can lay as many as 15,000 eggs at a time.

592
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,813
It takes quite a lot to feed that many babies,

593
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:24,067
and it's not long before snakeheads
have wiped out all other marine life.

594
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,446
And we're a half day behind this.

595
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,577
There was an infestation in Maryland.

596
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,413
Now, the authorities caught the fish,

597
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:39,207
but the new R&D team decided
they wanted to sterilize it.

598
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,418
-What happened?
-When I got off the phone with them,

599
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,378
they were still figuring out
what was going on.

600
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:47,549
The serum they used made the fish
more aggressive, bolder and smarter.

601
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,051
Before long,
they could become the perfect predator.

602
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:56,766
Chris!

603
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,602
Chris is on the water with his friends!

604
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,815
-Use this.
-I don't know how to use this, Carly.

605
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:08,403
Just aim this at the man-eating killer fish,
and then you pull the trigger, okay? Do it.

606
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,488
Marge! Marge!

607
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:14,576
Marge, turn up your hearing aid. Okay, listen.

608
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:18,246
I want to quarantine the beaches
and the swamp until further notice.

609
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,207
I want everybody out of the water
and off the shore. Got it?

610
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:22,959
Closing off the swamp won't be enough.

611
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:27,881
He's right, snakeheads have kind of
an air chamber in their skulls

612
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,717
that can act as a makeshift lung.

613
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:33,053
They can breathe on land
for up to three days.

614
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,221
By using the muscles in their fins,
they can almost walk.

615
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,225
And that's just a normal snakehead,
without genetic modifications.

616
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,644
Who knows what
these snakeheads are capable of.

617
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,522
Three days' time,
they could have the whole town overrun.

618
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,026
My God! Nowhere is safe.

619
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,028
Here, I'm open!

620
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,863
Catch it! Yes!

621
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,387
Oh, my God! Let's get out of here!

622
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:28,483
It's okay, it's okay.
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe.

623
00:43:30,026 --> 00:43:31,027
It's okay.

624
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:35,740
Just breathe, just breathe. Just breathe.
It's gonna be okay.

625
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,996
-Would you let go of him?
-Get your hands off of me!

626
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,748
What the hell are those things?
What did you do?

627
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,875
-I do nothing!
-Leave him alone!

628
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,711
Ian, stop it! You're not helping anything!

629
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,171
You, we wouldn't even be out here,
if it wasn't for you.

630
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:52,549
You think I don't know why
we're all really out here?

631
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,884
-It's all about him.
-Me?

632
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:57,303
-It's always about him.
-Get over yourself.

633
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,723
Should just toss him overboard,
just like Kerri, right?

634
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,224
You son of a...

635
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,642
-Don't say that!
-Forget about it!

636
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,728
We have more important things
to worry about.

637
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,438
The lines are still busy.

638
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,106
Your dad doesn't have a radio on this boat?

639
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:09,733
Dad was supposed to fix it on Tuesday.

640
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:11,234
Of course he was.

641
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:14,029
Look, look! Looky there!

642
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,323
Maybe we're not all done for yet!

643
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:18,575
What is he saying?

644
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:22,120
Maybe God will not kill us, or what?
Look, look, see?

645
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,123
We gotta get to that house.

646
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,167
First good idea all day.

647
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,002
So what?

648
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,713
We get through the swamp
and then call for help?

649
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,882
Yeah, and who do we call
when there's a killer fish epidemic?

650
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:38,720
-What was that?
-The fish! The fish!

651
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:40,055
-They're everywhere!
-Oh, my God!

652
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,474
The fish are everywhere! They're coming.

653
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,018
The fish, they're coming back!
They're everywhere.

654
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,978
Just calm down!
We just have to work together.

655
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:48,897
-Get out of the way, Sam.
-Just calm down!

656
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:51,566
-Get away from me!
-Oh, my God! They're breaking through!

657
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:53,026
We are so gonna die out here.

658
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,528
We're not gonna die, all right?
We're gonna get to that house.

659
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,572
How? There's no way to kill these mother...

660
00:44:57,822 --> 00:44:59,074
-Wait.
-What?

661
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:06,414
Dynamite. The rumors were true.
That's good.

662
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:12,045
I got you! I got you. I got you.

663
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,509
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah, no problem.

664
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,275
Yeah!

665
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,612
That's a good one. Yeah.

666
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,574
How you doin', little guy?

667
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,912
That's what I'm talkin' about.
You gonna make a good meal. Yes, you are.

668
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,915
You are such a big fish.

669
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:52,377
That's gonna be a good dinner.
That's gonna be a good dinner.

670
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,299
Where's my cleaver?

671
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,352
I'm gonna kill something.

672
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:17,068
It was just here. Am I losing my mind?

673
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:21,823
Holy mackerel! Where'd he go?

674
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:28,163
He's gone? I just had it!

675
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,677
Do you remember when the boys were little

676
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,638
and we'd bring Bryce and Chris
down to the bayou?

677
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:50,352
Bryce would get up in the bow,
and start waving his arms like he was a bird.

678
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:56,066
-There's a lot of good memories.
-Jim, don't.

679
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:57,525
Look, I'm...

680
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:02,864
I took you for granted for a long time,
I realize that,

681
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,159
but I never stopped loving you.

682
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:07,869
We've already been through all of this.

683
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,914
We're different people.
We want different things.

684
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:14,668
I want us to be a family again.
What do you want?

685
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:18,380
We need to make sure
that everyone's safe near the water.

686
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:21,716
Wait a second,
I thought we were out here looking for Chris.

687
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,552
We don't have time to stop
and warn everybody up and down the bayou.

688
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,972
That's Jessup's boat.
Maybe he saw where Chris was headed.

689
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:37,232
Jessup?

690
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,069
Jessup!

691
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:45,740
It's Ranger Hardin
from Blackbriar Parks and Recreation. Here.

692
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,244
Oh, God!

693
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:58,962
It's twice as big as it was before.

694
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:00,380
I got this.

695
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:04,092
Jim, the safety's on!

696
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,385
What?

697
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,732
Watch out, Jim! Watch out!

698
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,375
Ranger, come on up. Hurry!

699
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:39,669
Come on.

700
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,008
What are you doing here, Mr. Boudreaux?

701
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:47,552
The swamp, she's angry.

702
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:52,223
Marguerite's up to her old tricks again.

703
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,392
You can't stay here. The swamp isn't safe.

704
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:58,438
It's not safe for none of us
until the swamp get paid...

705
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:01,358
...what she got coming.

706
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:10,742
All these years,
I tried to make her happy, but...

707
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,244
We really have to go.

708
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,538
When I give you the word,
you run like hell to the boat.

709
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,207
You need to go home.

710
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:22,212
We have to find her, Ranger.
She's the heart of this bayou.

711
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,799
You have to fight her.

712
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,219
Go home! Lock the doors and stay there.

713
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,930
Okay, are you ready?

714
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:34,057
Yeah, I think we've got
a clear path so far, so...

715
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:35,392
Run.

716
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:39,521
Give me the gun. You drive.

717
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,231
So, let me get this straight.

718
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,526
Not only do we have an infestation
of killer fish, but they're getting bigger.

719
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,195
If they sprout wings and fly, I'm done.

720
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:51,074
I don't know what they did
to these snakeheads, but it has cranked up

721
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,743
the evolutionary process
and kicked it into overdrive.

722
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:58,248
They are adapting at a far greater rate
than mother nature ever intended.

723
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,958
I don't know what
these researchers did, but...

724
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,711
Or it could be what William Boudreaux said.

725
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:05,046
It could be
the Curse of the Blackbriar Swamp.

726
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,507
God knows this swamp
has taken enough out of our family.

727
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:11,428
Carly, we'll find our boy.

728
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:13,888
We'll find Chris.

729
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:25,233
We gotta get rid of these things,
and we gotta make a run for it.

730
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:29,529
All right, I'll take some of the dynamite
with us, and you take the flare gun.

731
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:30,780
-Okay.
-Keep it in the bag, all right?

732
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,407
-Right.
-We gotta get out of here.

733
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,576
-All right, ladies, let's go.
-Where are we gonna go?

734
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:36,911
-We're going to that house.
-But they're gonna take us over.

735
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,039
No, they're not.

736
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:42,000
That's for Brutus, you damn snakefish!

737
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,879
Stick this where you live, Marguerite!
You stinking witch!

738
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:50,717
Are you actually insane, man?
You're gonna kill all of us!

739
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:56,973
Look out!

740
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:07,400
Let's move! Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on. Come on.

741
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:09,569
Let's go. Come on!

742
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:11,988
-Come on.
-But the fish!

743
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,573
We still have to make it
through the whole swamp!

744
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,409
I'm gonna take care of you. Come on.

745
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:38,556
There you are.

746
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:47,357
Oh, Marguerite. What you done done?

747
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:01,705
Come on, keep going! Keep going!

748
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:11,172
-I can't.
-Don't stop!

749
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,049
Are you okay?

750
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,094
Are you all right, man?
Are you all right, man?

751
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:17,178
Yeah.

752
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,472
Shoot it.

753
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:23,059
Come on, shoot it! Let's go! Come on!

754
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,352
Come on, man, shoot him!

755
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:30,650
-Doesn't work, great. Let's go.
-Come on!

756
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:41,077
Come on!

757
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:49,711
We got it beat! Come on! We need help!

758
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:52,422
-Please help us!
-Hello?

759
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:55,050
-Please help us!
-Hello! Hello!

760
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,301
I don't see anybody.

761
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:57,385
-You see anybody?
-No, I don't see anyone!

762
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:58,595
Is it open?

763
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,096
Someone help us.

764
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,890
Come on, kick it in. We don't have time.

765
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:04,893
Hello? Is anyone here?

766
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,394
Come on, we gotta block these doors.

767
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,649
I don't see 'em anywhere, man.

768
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,402
There!

769
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,701
How are they crawling like that? They're fish.

770
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,912
I think they're growing.
They look bigger, too.

771
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:26,247
-Why?
-The Blackbriar Curse.

772
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:29,709
No, no, no. I don't believe that.

773
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,004
I don't care if it's the curse, or radiation,

774
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:36,841
or psycho fish from space,
we have to kill those things.

775
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,386
Ian's right, okay,
we gotta barricade the house.

776
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,595
We gotta make sure it's secure.

777
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,391
Look for weapons, axes,
a machete, a gun rack, whatever, okay?

778
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,434
We gotta close all the doors
and the windows.

779
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,019
Ian, check this room, okay?
I'm going this way.

780
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,690
Look, I don't remember making you leader.

781
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:54,734
Now we can work together,
but I'm not taking orders from you.

782
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:58,571
Ian! Just do it! Come on, I'll look with you.

783
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,285
Come on, let's get to work.

784
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,585
God, I hate this swamp.
I never should have stayed.

785
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:13,712
Why did you?

786
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,089
For you and Chris,
you both loved it so much.

787
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:19,092
Chris had his friends here, and I know
how much you admire your students,

788
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:23,722
and I thought if I were a ranger,
you know, I could help make things safer.

789
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:27,350
Keep something like what happened to Bryce
ever happening to anyone again.

790
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:30,937
You can't always stop the bad things
from happening, Carly.

791
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,816
I grew up hearing about that curse,
that curse, that curse.

792
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:37,819
-I never believed it.
-You can't blame a curse for what happened.

793
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:41,614
Bryce was... It was an accident.

794
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:44,159
Well, who can I blame, then, Jim?

795
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,662
Well, you seem to be doing
a fine job of blaming me.

796
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,414
I don't blame you.

797
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,543
Isn't that why you left me?

798
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:56,838
I told him he could go out
on the bayou that night with his friends,

799
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,215
after you told him he couldn't.

800
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,886
-It's my fault.
-Jim...

801
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,637
It's my fault. It's my fault.

802
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:05,847
Jim.

803
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,851
I don't blame you for hating me.
It's what I'd do.

804
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:13,646
Jim.

805
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,068
I've already lost too much, all right?

806
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,074
I can't stand to lose any more.

807
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:26,993
What's that?

808
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:34,584
That's Ian Davids' boat. Oh, my God! Chris.

809
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,837
What if Chris...
What if something happened to Chris?

810
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:41,049
No, no, Carly.
Carly, look, we're good, we're good.

811
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:45,220
I mean, look,
they might have swum ashore, huh?

812
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:47,931
Yeah. Okay.

813
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:51,059
-We're good, we're good.
-Okay.

814
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,561
Let's get in there and check it out.

815
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,150
Molotov cocktails.

816
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:02,070
We could throw them at them,
while we make a retreat.

817
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,662
You know, Bryce died two years ago.

818
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:14,874
Since then,
I thought a lot about how I might die.

819
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:20,213
Not one time did I ever consider killer fish.

820
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,050
We're gonna make it through this.

821
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,971
Kerri didn't, the old man on the boat didn't.

822
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,723
But we will.

823
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:37,188
Yeah, just stay here
and keep an eye on them, all right?

824
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:42,193
I'm gonna go look around just in case
the whole fire bomb thing doesn't pan out.

825
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,070
It would work.

826
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:16,102
Sam. Sam!

827
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:19,814
Come see.

828
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,067
What?

829
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:30,450
Oh, my gosh, what in the world is this?

830
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:33,620
Pretty freaky, right?

831
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:38,875
That's disgusting.

832
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,336
What's all this for, anyways?

833
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:42,796
Don't mess with it. It's like voodoo.

834
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:49,761
It stinks, is what it is.

835
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:54,683
-What was that?
-Grab that knife.

836
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:07,612
What?

837
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,532
Garage door's open.

838
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,201
I'm gonna have to close it,
before those things get in.

839
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:14,452
What if they're already inside?

840
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,712
There's a radio in there.

841
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,588
Okay, let's go.

842
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,555
We should probably go get Chris and Ashley.

843
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,015
Screw Chris.

844
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,684
Ashley probably already is.

845
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:41,521
-Shut up, go close the door.
-Don't push me.

846
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:51,197
Hello, is anybody there?

847
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,826
Hello, is anybody there? Please!

848
00:58:56,244 --> 00:58:57,579
They're outside.

849
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,459
Hello, is anybody there at all?

850
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:05,045
Please, please!
If anybody's there, please respond!

851
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:08,923
They're inside. Hide! Hide.

852
00:59:35,408 --> 00:59:37,202
Sam! Sam, help me!

853
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:38,787
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

854
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:48,129
Ian! Ian, wait! Ian! Ian!

855
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:51,591
Open the door! Ian, let me out!

856
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:55,178
Ian!

857
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,182
Let me out! Ian, let me out!

858
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,024
Choke on that, coward.

859
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:23,206
-You hear something?
-What was that?

860
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:13,715
-Come on!
-Wait!

861
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:25,101
We're sorry,
we didn't know anybody was home.

862
01:01:25,977 --> 01:01:29,814
What are you doing here, gal?
The swamp, it ain't safe.

863
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,817
There were snakes outside,
and we were just trying to protect ourselves.

864
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,199
Swamp, she's angry this time.

865
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:44,412
Marguerite's gonna
get her vengeance tonight.

866
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:51,753
-What are you talking about?
-Curse of Blackbriar Swamp.

867
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:54,255
No, I refuse to believe that.

868
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,008
It's just a story.
There's no such thing as a curse.

869
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,761
That's where you're wrong, little gal.

870
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,641
Marguerite, she has her ways.

871
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,103
So that's Marguerite Boudreaux.

872
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:10,480
I wasn't even sure if she was real.

873
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:14,109
She's real, all right. Marguerite Boudreaux.

874
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,320
My great, great-grandmother.

875
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,323
She was a powerful mamba.

876
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,911
Lived in Blackbriar nearly 200 years ago.

877
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,581
Marguerite took payment for healing the sick

878
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:32,919
and serving as a priestess to the Loa
for the Haitian immigrants.

879
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:37,882
They called her Queen,
"Queen of the Swamp."

880
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,718
Yeah?

881
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:43,638
I heard she was executed for murder.
For killing a little kid.

882
01:02:44,055 --> 01:02:46,891
I heard she put a hex on a slave owner,
and that's what did it.

883
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,853
Everybody hears it different.

884
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:54,232
-Maybe they're all right.
-Or maybe none of it's true.

885
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:59,571
She's dead, all right. That's a fact.

886
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,409
Murdered by the people of Blackbriar.

887
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:07,620
After that, the swamps turned mean.

888
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:17,756
These here swamps, Marguerite's.
She they queen.

889
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:20,717
And them creatures out there,

890
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:24,596
she brought 'em back to her swamp
to do her biddin'.

891
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,058
This is ridiculous. Why now, then?

892
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:34,105
Maybe she just been waitin'
for the right time, the right opportunity.

893
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,108
Or maybe you're full of voodoo crap.

894
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,070
My little brother died in these swamps,

895
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,405
and at the time,
everybody said that it was an accident.

896
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:46,159
But I knew I felt something.
I knew there was something there.

897
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:50,497
The swamp, she wants blood for blood.

898
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,083
This is crazy.

899
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:55,752
Are you sure about that?

900
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,675
Ian! What happened?

901
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:07,806
They got inside, in the garage.
I locked them in, but they killed Sam.

902
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:13,186
-No!
-I tried to save her, but they almost got me.

903
01:04:14,312 --> 01:04:16,356
I'm just glad you're okay.

904
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:19,901
All right. Who the hell are you?

905
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:25,657
William Boudreaux,
and this is my house, boy.

906
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:28,243
We need a phone.

907
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,870
We gotta call help.
I lost my phone when our ship went down.

908
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,414
Me, too.

909
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:36,209
No one to call, no one to help you now.

910
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:40,505
Marguerite ain't gonna stop
until the swamp gets her full of blood.

911
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,759
Not unless we stop her first.

912
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:50,765
She been mad before, storms, floods, death.

913
01:04:52,225 --> 01:04:54,728
Marguerite threw a tantrum
every now and again.

914
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,021
No! No!

915
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:00,191
This time she gone too far.

916
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,736
What happens if we don't get to her?

917
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:06,072
Then we all dead.

918
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:11,369
Marge! Marge, do you copy?

919
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:19,127
Marge! Do you hear me?

920
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,049
<i>Marge!</i>

921
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:33,892
Damn it!

922
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:35,894
-Anything?
-No.

923
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,898
Can't even raise her. She can't hear anything.
The whole town is probably gone by now.

924
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:41,649
Well, maybe she's napping.

925
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:44,903
This way.

926
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:51,368
We're almost there. It's just down a way.
The Boudreaux home, it's just up a ways.

927
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,744
Carly, what is this place?

928
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,079
It's Boudreaux's house.

929
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:55,830
-Boudreaux?
-Just follow me.

930
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:57,123
Okay.

931
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,885
What the hell is he mumbling about?

932
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,970
-It's the curse.
-It's the curse?

933
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,432
Yeah, I see all your damn hoodoo
and whatnot.

934
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:15,975
Bunch of crap, is what I say.

935
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,354
Mr. Boudreaux, can you stop this?

936
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:23,441
My whole life I tried
to keep Marguerite happy.

937
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,613
Take care of the swamp,
and she take care of you.

938
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,490
That's what my momma told me.

939
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:32,909
But now...

940
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:35,745
What is this?

941
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:39,082
She got a demon protecting the grave.

942
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:41,918
You're gonna need a heat bag.

943
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:48,216
Little agrimony, tobacco, goofer dust.

944
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:50,218
Goofer dust.

945
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,932
You use it to ward off the spirits.

946
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:05,442
But only fire can burn out evil.

947
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:11,614
She's at the heart of the swamp.

948
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,870
You got to help me destroy her.

949
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,415
If you knew that Marguerite
was the cause of all of this,

950
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:22,375
why haven't you done anything until now?
Why?

951
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:28,798
Same reason we don't go killing all the
gators in the bayou because of a few attacks.

952
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,135
Nature has a balance.

953
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:35,347
Marguerite kept the balance.

954
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:40,518
But she's out of control now.

955
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:47,734
Chris, it's your mom!

956
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:49,944
Mom.

957
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:58,703
Shame what happened
to your friend out in the garage.

958
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:03,375
Yeah, it is.

959
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:06,002
Be careful, boy.

960
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:11,883
Marguerite got it out especially for betrayers.

961
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,058
-Get in here!
-Thank God!

962
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:22,018
-Get in, get in!
-I'm all right, I'm all right.

963
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,770
What are you all doing together?
Are you talking again?

964
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,063
We gotta get out of here, okay?

965
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,148
This place is gonna be crawling
with those things any second now.

966
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:28,525
My boat is down by the dock.

967
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:30,860
Wait, Ian's here and William Boudreaux.

968
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:31,903
What about Sam and Kerri?

969
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:34,406
Oh, dear God!

970
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:37,200
-Ranger Hardin, what are we gonna do?
-We are going to survive.

971
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:39,744
Ian, what are you doing?

972
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:43,206
I'm not dying here
because of some stupid fish, okay?

973
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:44,666
Now come on, old man.

974
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,836
You said before you know how to stop this?
Spill it.

975
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:49,295
-Let him go!
-Shut up!

976
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:52,882
We've gotta find her heart, destroy it.

977
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:56,636
She wrecked that truck
at the source of her power.

978
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,222
-Now let me go.
-What the hell does that even mean?

979
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:02,976
She's in the swamp, in its trees, in its water.

980
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:05,145
You can't escape the swamp.

981
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,981
-Busting through the door!
-Run!

982
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,110
Eat this!

983
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:18,867
We're out of here now!

984
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,660
This way's clear! Hurry!

985
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:22,495
Ian, come on! What are you doing?

986
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,788
Let's go, we gotta run, man!

987
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:24,914
Let's go!

988
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,207
Somebody's gotta kill these things.

989
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:28,543
Oh, no! You need to put that out!

990
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,642
-Mom!
-Carly!

991
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:58,073
-Mom! Mom! Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

992
01:09:58,198 --> 01:09:59,491
Are you okay?

993
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,201
Chris, you need to go.

994
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:02,535
Guys, the house is gonna collapse.

995
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:03,912
-Chris, you need to go.
-We have to get out of here.

996
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:07,749
-No! I'm not going to leave her!
-I'm not gonna lose you like I lost Bryce! Go!

997
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:08,833
Mom!

998
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,043
Come on! We have to go!

999
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:11,127
No!

1000
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,380
Come on, sweetheart. I got you.

1001
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:15,048
-Come on! We can't stay here!
-Mom!

1002
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:16,633
-No! Mom!
-Come on!

1003
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:17,967
The house is gonna fall!

1004
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:32,691
Son.

1005
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:33,775
She's all right.

1006
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,239
She's all right.

1007
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:43,952
We lost you for a while there.

1008
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,578
Yeah, well, don't lose me again.

1009
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,955
I won't.

1010
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:52,085
We have to find
Marguerite Boudreaux's grave.

1011
01:10:52,168 --> 01:10:53,503
We have to end this.

1012
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:57,090
I'll go. I'll go.

1013
01:10:57,173 --> 01:10:58,967
Mr. Boudreaux,
he said something about a truck wreck.

1014
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,135
I know where that is.

1015
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:01,261
She could be buried there.

1016
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:02,554
Well, we don't know that for sure.

1017
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:03,638
But we have to do something.

1018
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:07,434
Chris, son, there isn't anything we can do.

1019
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:09,519
The fish are continuing to evolve.

1020
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:10,937
Blackbriar is lost.

1021
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:12,605
-No!
-We need to leave while we can.

1022
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:16,234
No! This is our home,
and we have to fight for it.

1023
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:19,237
We're not gonna give up on family.
We have to do this for Bryce!

1024
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:23,199
Sweetheart,
what if Mr. Boudreaux was wrong?

1025
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,243
What if there is no grave when you get there?

1026
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:28,663
Mr. Boudreaux, he believed in this enough
that he was willing to die for it.

1027
01:11:28,955 --> 01:11:31,833
I have to try. I have to.

1028
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:36,546
Ian's getting away!

1029
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:38,798
There's not a house around here for miles,
we are gonna be stranded.

1030
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:41,384
I am gonna go to the grave.
I know where it is. I can get there.

1031
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,346
I can walk there from here,
but you get that damn boat.

1032
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:45,555
And if I don't return,

1033
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:47,807
then you get out of Blackbriar
and you get some help.

1034
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:49,684
And I don't care
if you call the whole damn Army.

1035
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,146
I'm coming back,
and I'm bringing the cavalry, okay?

1036
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,903
-I'm coming with you.
-No, no, no, you can't.

1037
01:11:59,944 --> 01:12:02,447
Your leg is all messed up.
You're just gonna slow me down.

1038
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:06,034
Then I'll go with you.
You shouldn't go alone.

1039
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:10,205
What about Chris?

1040
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,874
I got Chris covered, go.

1041
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:16,044
Okay, you stay safe until we return. Okay?

1042
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:33,645
Ian! Ian! Stop!

1043
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:36,564
All right, you can't take the boat.
We need that. My family needs that.

1044
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:39,401
Listen to me,
we can make it out of this together, okay?

1045
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,444
-You have to...
-I have to?

1046
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:42,987
I'm done taking orders from you!

1047
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:53,915
What do you think, you're a hero?

1048
01:12:53,998 --> 01:12:55,667
You have no idea what those things are,

1049
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:59,212
and I'm not dying in this swamp,
so stay out of my way.

1050
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:03,425
Chris!

1051
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:11,891
Chris!

1052
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:35,248
We don't have to do this.

1053
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:39,544
You know,
I never got what Ashley saw in you,

1054
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:40,712
but you can have her.

1055
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:42,172
I used her all up anyways.

1056
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:49,804
Say goodbye, Hardin.

1057
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:55,894
Ian! Ian! Come on.

1058
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:57,729
Ian!

1059
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:01,232
Come on!

1060
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,528
Ian, come on!

1061
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,366
Where is he? I don't see him!

1062
01:14:10,784 --> 01:14:12,911
Come on! Come on!

1063
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:37,769
<i>Ranger Hardin, do you hear me?</i>

1064
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:41,773
Hello? Who is this?

1065
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:43,858
This is Trooper Simon with the State Police.
Who is this?

1066
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:45,902
<i>Where's Ranger Hardin?</i>

1067
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:48,363
I'm her son, Chris.

1068
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:51,157
<i>Where's your mom? I've gotta talk to her.
The National Guard is here.</i>

1069
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:52,867
<i>They're pushing the fish
back into the swamp,</i>

1070
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,119
<i>but we're not out of this yet.</i>

1071
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:09,050
So what is that supposed to do, anyway?

1072
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,510
Honestly, I don't even know.

1073
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:15,223
Mr. Boudreaux said it'll help fight the demon
that's out here protecting the grave.

1074
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:20,478
Do you see that?

1075
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:24,566
-Come on.
-There it is!

1076
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:34,576
Do you really think that
this is all because of the Blackbriar Curse?

1077
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:38,747
I don't know, but right now,
I'm willing to believe just about anything.

1078
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:41,458
I couldn't get a shot off.

1079
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,210
I couldn't help him,
but you're all right, though, right?

1080
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,212
-It's his own damn fault.
-Thank goodness.

1081
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:48,048
When did you learn to shoot like that?

1082
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:50,467
Well, when a fish tries to eat you...

1083
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,555
Look out!

1084
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:02,228
Trooper Simon!

1085
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:05,231
Mr. Hardin, where is your wife?

1086
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:07,442
No, she's all right. She's all right.

1087
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:09,819
She and Ashley went
back to the wreck to try and...

1088
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:10,904
No, that's not good!

1089
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:12,197
We're rounding up the survivors,

1090
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:13,907
and we have to get them
out of the swamp right now.

1091
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,408
Why? What's happening?

1092
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:16,910
We've got the snakeheads on the move.

1093
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:19,037
We have to make a "Hail Mary" play
to clear them out, okay?

1094
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,830
The Air Force has been called in.

1095
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:24,709
Your mom's in danger! Take it, it'll help!
It'll help!

1096
01:16:24,876 --> 01:16:25,877
-Thanks, Marge.
-Take it!

1097
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,713
Besides, I just got off the phone
with the guys who created these fish.

1098
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,256
Apparently, there's something worse

1099
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,050
that was on that truck
than just these snakeheads.

1100
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:34,803
What do you mean, "worse"?

1101
01:16:37,597 --> 01:16:40,058
-You gotta be kidding, right?
-No.

1102
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,020
What is that?

1103
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:48,900
I have no idea, but whatever it is,
it's a hell of a lot bigger than the others.

1104
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:51,152
What does that mean, "Specimen 0"?

1105
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:54,781
I don't know. Let's go to the other side.

1106
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:04,958
I never got to tell you how sorry I was
about what happened to Bryce.

1107
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:11,214
And I want you to know
that I'll take care of Chris.

1108
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,053
I know that you will, Ashley, and thank you.

1109
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,392
Marguerite Boudreaux.

1110
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:43,538
-Ashley!
-Help me, Ranger Hardin! Help me!

1111
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:48,543
Ashley! Stay with me!

1112
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:51,463
Help me!

1113
01:17:51,546 --> 01:17:53,340
No, no, just stay with me!

1114
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:57,385
Please, no! Please help!

1115
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:01,598
No, no, no, no!

1116
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:04,851
Don't leave me here, Ranger Hardin, please!

1117
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,227
Help me!

1118
01:18:09,272 --> 01:18:11,316
Come on, let's get you to cover.

1119
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,114
-You can do it. Good?
-Yeah.

1120
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,574
Okay, great.

1121
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:28,458
-It's okay, you're gonna be okay.
-What is that?

1122
01:18:30,669 --> 01:18:32,545
Oh, God, it's its eggs.

1123
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:36,883
Finish this off!

1124
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:39,844
-Jim?<i>
-Mom!</i>

1125
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:41,179
Chris!

1126
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:42,514
Mom! Where are you?

1127
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:43,682
Are you with Ashley?

1128
01:18:43,723 --> 01:18:46,226
Yeah, we're at the crash site.
It's past the 8-Mile Ditch.

1129
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,728
Ashley's with me, she's hurt.
She needs a hospital.

1130
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:52,273
There is a monster here,
it's just the worst damn one yet.

1131
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:54,067
<i>-All right, listen to me!</i>
-Oh, my God!

1132
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:56,569
That's the mother!
She's the original test specimen!

1133
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:59,489
-She's pregnant!
-It's worse, she's already laid her eggs.

1134
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:00,740
Ranger Hardin!

1135
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:03,702
<i>All right, the Air Force are on their way,</i>

1136
01:19:03,743 --> 01:19:05,412
<i>the National Guard, to kill the rest of the fish.</i>

1137
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,747
But the only way to stop the infestation...

1138
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:11,710
-Go on, Chris, tell me.
-They're carpet-bombing the swamp, Ma.

1139
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:17,632
Oh, my God!

1140
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:25,890
Chris, I love you.

1141
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:27,892
No! I'm coming to get you!

1142
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,482
No, don't! We're never gonna make it!

1143
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:38,028
I'm not gonna give up! Now get down!

1144
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,612
Okay, get down.

1145
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:55,045
Let's go!

1146
01:19:58,048 --> 01:19:59,382
You ready?

1147
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,513
Go! Go! Go!

1148
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,581
I hate this damn swamp, anyway.

1149
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,589
The fire's not working, she's following us.

1150
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:43,385
It's not to kill her, it's to control her.
We're leading her somewhere.

1151
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:44,719
You mean, we're the bait?

1152
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:46,971
Hold on.

1153
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:21,297
Help Ashley. Let me have the gun.

1154
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,049
Ranger Hardin, move! Let's go!

1155
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:24,884
Jim! Jim!

1156
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:27,095
-Come on.
-We gotta get across the swamp!

1157
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:29,806
I know, I think you're right.
Let's go, Chris. Let's go!

1158
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:31,433
The bullets aren't doing anything!

1159
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:34,894
Go! Jim, take this! Marge! Let's go!

1160
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:37,230
Marge! Marge! Let's go!

1161
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:56,041
Come on, Dad!

1162
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:00,128
Ash, fire bomb.

1163
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,257
Chris, what are you doing?

1164
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:07,093
Trust me.

1165
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:36,915
Chris, are you ready?

1166
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:39,686
I think the curse has finally been broken.

1167
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:46,401
I think that I've been hanging on to this
a little too long.

1168
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,782
I thought maybe you might want it back.
