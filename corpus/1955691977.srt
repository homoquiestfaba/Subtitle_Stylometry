00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,880
You.
We surrounded you.

3
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:07,620
I'm English. Do not shoot.

4
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:27,996
Go there, take the weapon.

5
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,352
Do not be here.

6
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:05,160
Where is the air force?

7
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:57,012
The Navy asked for this.

8
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,352
We'll be back in 1 hour.

9
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:01,668
That was before.

10
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:06,624
Do not make a mess of
that stuff over there.

11
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,600
It's only for the English.

12
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,900
- Can not.
- We can not do this!

13
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,376
You have your own ship, back!

14
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,900
Back, you got your ship
Myself, this is a english ship.

15
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:47,100
Bring them here, quick! Move out! Move out!

16
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,548
Quick, fast, fast!

17
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:53,196
He will die!

18
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:58,080
Step aside, step aside, watch everything!

19
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:18,336
Get ready!

20
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:35,388
All in one! Give more space!

21
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:53,376
Move out!

22
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:04,176
It's medical, give them a way.

23
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:41,220
- Lower the rope.
- Yes, Sir!

24
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:16,128
Their fullness, no
Can you transport them?

25
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:19,608
I have something to say.

26
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:24,564
I thought you were cornered.

27
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,160
Give the room!

28
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,948
Go ahead.

29
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:04,188
Get ready up front.

30
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,948
Do not we wait for the navy.

31
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,832
We're just waiting for
orders, I'm not the captain.

32
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,432
OK.

33
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:23,076
Thank you George.

34
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:30,408
Heydrick, do you know where we are?

35
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,656
- France.
- No need to wait.

36
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,620
How is it there?

37
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,936
He's behind me.

38
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:13,656
I'll take care of him.

39
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,476
Go to the line.

40
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:15,948
You two go.

41
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:20,832
- Go away!
- We should check the damage.

42
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:08,964
You see..

43
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,208
Whose party is it?

44
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,740
Our plane, George.

45
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:48,276
3, 2, 1 now!

46
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,536
Did he fall?

47
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,752
Yes, he was destroyed.

48
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:30,228
Our fortress defeated him.

49
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,480
Fortress do you hear me?

50
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:47,124
Force 2 I have
See the plane, replace it.

51
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:51,864
Understanding Force 1.

52
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:01,740
Hello, lieutenant.

53
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:06,312
- We have to do that, sir.
- Well do that.

54
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,820
Go.

55
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,196
General, you have to decide how many
Many more have to carry the wounded.

56
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:23,124
No, tell them to
Line up here. Excuse me.

57
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:38,748
- Let me help you.
- Commander.

58
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:44,664
- What about our territory?
- Minimizes every day.

59
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:48,384
I have ordered troops
France to hold its ranks.

60
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:50,760
And his tanks were trapped.

61
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:53,160
Why get stuck?

62
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:56,832
They think the tank is too
Worth to leave the island.

63
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,552
How long do you think they can
Hold it before we get back?

64
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:07,536
Back? Nothing stops here,
We must bring back his troops.

65
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,444
- the next UK and other countries.
- Of course.

66
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:15,936
We will trust the troops
Bodyguards start from here.

67
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:20,904
- What?
- Home..

68
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:22,068
What about France?

69
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,704
We are asked to meet
At the meeting place.

70
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:28,116
Prepare the troops
We go together.

71
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:31,512
- And his new troop?
- We're leaving all.

72
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,152
How many troops
Who's he talking about, sir?

73
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:40,092
That's only one, 20,000
And we can give 45.

74
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,880
There are 400,000 troops
on this beach, sir.

75
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:47,328
We just have to do our best.

76
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:52,056
We can not stay here.

77
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,728
We have troops of distance
Far to the western part.

78
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,176
If there is anything else,
Bodyguards are here.

79
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,552
They will always be able
Prevent this place.

80
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:02,868
But it is not possible. Too low.

81
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,328
If there is anything to be
able to accommodate They

82
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:10,068
though a small boat, will not
Can make them a destroyer.

83
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,676
We will have to reduce that, gentlemen.

84
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,444
Hey!

85
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,904
Hey!

86
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,528
Hey! Can you swim?

87
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:22,104
I can not reach it!

88
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:25,716
Hold on.

89
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:21,960
What is your name?

90
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:48,468
- There's a ship falling down below.
- Did you see anyone?

91
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:53,160
No .. We'd better leave it alone.

92
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:59,148
- You think he's okay?
- Maybe he should be all right.

93
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,600
Recording position

94
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:06,528
- 1071285.
- 10000?

95
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:11,172
Let's say 12 to 100 feet.

96
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:21,948
- Force 2, how much is your fuel?
- 50 gallons, replace.

97
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:25,620
50 gallons?

98
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,076
All right, keep telling me.
Because mine is broken.

99
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:43,632
- Do you think your fuel is enough?
- I do not know .. I can not see it.

100
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,524
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

101
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:32,916
Go!

102
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,552
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

103
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:46,056
What about the injured?

104
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,984
Hurry up! They will
Sink his ship!

105
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,364
Do you want to go inside?
It was much warmer.

106
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:44,976
A lot of wind here.

107
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:54,444
Leave him alone, George.
He feels safer here.

108
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,784
He wants to tell us
If we will be in bomb.

109
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,412
Human..

110
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm still human.

111
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:12,312
Come and help me, George.

112
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:32,808
OK. We're out for 15 minutes
So it will climb to 2000, replace.

113
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:34,092
We need more fuel.

114
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:40,092
No, I do not want to be pursued again.
We'll go up and land there, change.

115
00:34:40,104 --> 00:34:48,468
Understand. Angle 2, replace.

116
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,560
All right, up the stairs .. Let's go
Find you another ship.

117
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:44,988
Welcome.
Keep going down. Down.

118
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:48,468
Warm and comfortable down there.

119
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:53,196
Go downstairs.
Grab the blanket.

120
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:57,888
Make a space. Take a break.

121
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:03,924
Keep going down there.

122
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:01,536
So where's your friend?

123
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:25,524
Maybe we should
Find a way out.

124
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:29,244
This place will be ruined.

125
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,420
Where are our goals?

126
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,844
Dunkirk.

127
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,664
No, they will
Waiting for us there.

128
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:25,668
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

129
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:29,112
I will not go back there.

130
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,632
I will not be back ...

131
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:37,644
Look, if we go there.
We will die.

132
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:49,764
I understand, let's change
the direction of the ship.

133
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:58,128
I'm talking to you, hello?
You hear me?

134
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:03,870
We have to change the
direction of this ship.

135
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,381
Yes.

136
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,644
This.

137
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:26,736
Your place over there.

138
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:37,572
Take a break.
It's safe here.

139
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,480
He seemed terrified.

140
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,316
He's in shock, he is
not like usual.

141
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:06,324
Maybe he will not
Back as before again.

142
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,264
This.

143
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,316
I have to lower my height.

144
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:44,892
40,000 feet.

145
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:53,412
Moves towards 9 o'clock.
Do not let them get mine.

146
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,292
- OK.
- You have to take the right side.

147
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:02,952
Let's go up first.

148
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:06,360
Now...!

149
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:42,396
Oh, my God!

150
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:05,184
I will fall.

151
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:08,784
Get out of there.

152
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,304
I'll try to land it.

153
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,148
Yes!

154
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:01,512
Please!

155
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:06,360
- Help us!
- Please!

156
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:11,292
- Help us!
- Please, someone!

157
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:16,176
Please..!

158
00:45:20,712 --> 00:45:23,340
Please!

159
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:29,220
Torpedo...!

160
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:38,952
No!

161
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:42,360
What happened?

162
00:45:58,068 --> 00:46:02,940
- Everything goes to the deck.
- Climb to the deck!

163
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,808
There!

164
00:47:03,936 --> 00:47:06,396
Please!

165
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:10,248
Please!

166
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:18,516
Hurry up, George.
We do not have time.

167
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:29,160
- Did you see that?
- Like a Rolls Royce engine.

168
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,972
The sound is normal here.

169
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,612
Hello?

170
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:42,300
Open the door?
Hello, can you hear me?

171
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:45,936
Open the door!

172
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:49,512
You hear me?

173
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:55,512
- What is wrong?
- You're the one who locked him up.

174
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,148
Let him out.
I'll talk to him.

175
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:02,928
Let me out!

176
00:49:02,964 --> 00:49:08,808
When I was your age, I went to war.

177
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:14,652
I'm still alive today
To see the children beperang.

178
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:24,264
There is something strange.
I will continue to follow him.

179
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:29,304
It decreases to a height of 15,000 feet.

180
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,316
Okay, I understand.

181
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:39,960
I've recorded it.

182
00:49:42,372 --> 00:49:44,964
Gomez, you accept?

183
00:51:04,176 --> 00:51:07,488
Hey, come on.

184
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:10,020
Come up.

185
00:51:10,056 --> 00:51:13,500
Up!

186
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,372
- We'll help you.
- Please!

187
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,056
- They will attack again.
- No!

188
00:51:22,188 --> 00:51:28,140
- Come here!
- They've drowned the ship.

189
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,552
You have to stay calm,
There are many ships here.

190
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:35,280
You have to help them all!

191
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:38,916
- You got a buoy?
- Correct.

192
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:44,892
The water is not too cold,
Just swim to the beach.

193
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:47,179
There's still a place!

194
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:53,208
Just go back to the beach
and wait for another boat.

195
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:59,208
Or just wait here,
We will be back for you guys.

196
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:01,692
All ready?

197
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:06,432
Paddle!

198
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:09,876
Paddle!

199
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,760
Paddle!

200
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:18,324
Paddle!

201
00:52:19,764 --> 00:52:22,044
Paddle!

202
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:26,688
Paddle!

203
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:32,772
You can not hide, son.

204
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:36,384
What do you want to do
there? Seriously.

205
00:52:36,384 --> 00:52:40,056
You're not just an employee there.
Everything is drowning.

206
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:44,784
Not just you are stranded.

207
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:49,476
- We have guns.
- Yes, from the exchange of goods.

208
00:52:49,512 --> 00:52:54,348
You can help us
On a rescue boat.

209
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:57,924
You fools.

210
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,440
I will not go back there.

211
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:06,240
- Playback.
- I will not spin.

212
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:08,880
Playback!

213
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:11,376
Playback!

214
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:15,936
You're gonna kill us all!

215
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,548
- It is okay...
- Come on, turn back!

216
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:22,092
George?

217
00:53:22,152 --> 00:53:24,468
George...

218
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:30,312
She fainted.

219
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:32,784
Okay, I'll take the medicine.

220
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:35,124
You'll be all right.

221
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:37,596
Hold on. Okay...

222
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:41,088
Okay, I'll keep him here.

223
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:42,564
This will stop the bleeding.

224
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:47,124
Yes, so ...

225
00:53:47,172 --> 00:53:49,644
Are you all right, George?

226
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,500
Push...!

227
00:59:09,936 --> 00:59:14,892
It's okay, this is it
Part of his war.

228
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:23,292
You know, that's what I said.

229
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:26,976
How do you know?

230
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,796
His body was back.

231
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:13,788
Hey.

232
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:23,196
Hey, how's it going?

233
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:38,736
- Hey, how's it going?
- Do not worry.

234
01:00:38,784 --> 01:00:44,904
Come on! It's tied up.
There's no way it can escape.

235
01:01:11,136 --> 01:01:13,692
Do not be afraid.

236
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:19,812
Hey, young master Dawson.

237
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:23,148
You never
Heard about them.

238
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:26,904
Are you ok.
Are you alright.

239
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:42,372
I let him go.

240
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,116
I let him go.

241
01:01:46,128 --> 01:01:48,564
That's the only thing
I've done it for him.

242
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:51,936
It is okay. Drink.

243
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:54,300
I said I got him.

244
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:58,008
I did what I was taught.

245
01:01:59,184 --> 01:02:02,772
I know one day
I will do it.

246
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:08,868
You know, we can come back.

247
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:11,424
Maybe they'll see it.

248
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,676
Okay, take a break.

249
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:18,396
I want you back to
Deck as soon as possible.

250
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:23,280
- Uh ..
- What?

251
01:02:27,936 --> 01:02:31,500
I can not say that.

252
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,892
Sir?

253
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,336
The French army already
Beaten back in the west.

254
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:59,172
- That's a good development.
- For now.

255
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:04,056
I want you out of the way.
Get out of the way!

256
01:04:15,036 --> 01:04:19,764
- Where are they?
- They're coming.

257
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:23,040
No.

258
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:25,572
No.

259
01:04:26,736 --> 01:04:27,960
What? What?

260
01:04:27,972 --> 01:04:31,500
I think we lost a ship.

261
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:35,124
The help is here. For
Do they save him?

262
01:04:35,184 --> 01:04:38,772
The next troops,
Who helped England.

263
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:41,376
They sent her to the same place.

264
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:47,376
But it's there.

265
01:04:48,348 --> 01:04:49,536
They can do it.

266
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,152
Silence alone will not
Helps us to return.

267
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,716
They have to send
More ships.

268
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:59,076
If we are silent,
His enemy will draw near.

269
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:02,712
Back to the base,
Collect his soldiers.

270
01:05:02,772 --> 01:05:07,596
- What for?
- At least that's what we can do.

271
01:05:07,656 --> 01:05:14,736
Civilians? They
Will destroy it.

272
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:17,100
The more troops,
We can win.

273
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,372
But not in this condition.

274
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,148
I prefer like
It is rather than dead.

275
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:29,136
They're here, they are
Will come here.

276
01:05:31,632 --> 01:05:35,232
They come from the north.

277
01:05:35,244 --> 01:05:38,724
At least we can get ready
To face them.

278
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,360
We're leaving in 6 hours.

279
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:45,888
I think in three hours.

280
01:05:47,136 --> 01:05:52,008
That's good for your troops, right?

281
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:55,620
Yes. Of course.

282
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,232
- Where's the crew?
- Maybe apart after being stranded.

283
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:19,800
Let's check the beach.

284
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:23,208
- Why?
- Just do my commands.

285
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,652
Anything can be there.

286
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:30,528
Okay, we check the part
That part. On the other side.

287
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,892
How long?

288
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,364
Maybe 3 hours.

289
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:12,336
Put pressure on it.
Clean out the blood.

290
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:15,900
What?

291
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:21,900
Conditions are bad.

292
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:25,740
We have to go back.

293
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,352
We've gone this far.

294
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,964
What is our ship?

295
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,524
Right, we're going there.

296
01:07:43,572 --> 01:07:45,936
No, we have to get ready,
There may be survivors.

297
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:49,608
If we do that, we must
Save ourselves.

298
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:58,092
I'm going up, looking
Whether they have come.

299
01:08:02,952 --> 01:08:07,512
Am I talking too much?

300
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,700
They almost arrived.

301
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:42,540
Calm down. We'll be back, right?

302
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:46,032
Yes, but how long?

303
01:08:54,516 --> 01:08:58,152
That's them!

304
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:07,476
Spitfire plane!

305
01:09:15,936 --> 01:09:18,372
No, no..

306
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:30,276
- See what they do!
- Yes.

307
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:42,396
They show us direction.

308
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:48,444
Yes.

309
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:50,820
No, no..

310
01:09:52,056 --> 01:09:55,644
They're heading to the Spitfire!

311
01:09:55,704 --> 01:09:59,220
Get ready!

312
01:10:06,396 --> 01:10:08,676
Hey..

313
01:11:06,288 --> 01:11:07,764
- No, no, no.
- Who is that?

314
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:12,600
- Are you German?
- No, Netherlands!

315
01:11:13,656 --> 01:11:15,900
I'm Dutch.

316
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,656
- I'm here to help you guys.
- How can we be sure?

317
01:11:19,668 --> 01:11:21,984
I know the Germans are coming.

318
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:26,856
They waited on their shores,
Waiting for the tidal wave.

319
01:11:26,868 --> 01:11:30,312
We will back.

320
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:36,348
They will come. We must
Sailing in a few hours.

321
01:11:36,444 --> 01:11:38,952
A few hours? Why are you back?

322
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:45,048
I do not have anything, because
That's me not so go.

323
01:11:58,224 --> 01:12:01,620
Seriously!

324
01:12:06,432 --> 01:12:09,912
How's it going, Collins?

325
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,740
His plane crashed.

326
01:13:31,596 --> 01:13:32,820
No.

327
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,524
It's because of the engine,
the engine is dead.

328
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:40,116
No ships.

329
01:13:42,372 --> 01:13:44,964
Dad, come on, no boats!

330
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:50,688
- Maybe he's dead.
- Be quiet! I heard you!

331
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:56,664
Do not be noisy, shut up!

332
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,372
Maybe we can help him.

333
01:15:02,892 --> 01:15:05,400
Do not! They do not know
We are in here.

334
01:15:05,412 --> 01:15:08,688
Why are they shooting at us?

335
01:15:08,736 --> 01:15:12,528
We must hide.

336
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,384
Tommy, you can do this.

337
01:16:01,632 --> 01:16:04,020
Where are you?

338
01:16:31,572 --> 01:16:36,372
They're coming ..

339
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,700
Come on, come on, come on.

340
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:02,724
We have to close it.

341
01:17:02,772 --> 01:17:05,088
How to?

342
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,876
Come on. Hurry up.

343
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:42,408
How do we get out of here?

344
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,800
We have to open this place.

345
01:17:43,848 --> 01:17:46,212
Wait! We have to wait.

346
01:17:46,212 --> 01:17:49,776
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes.

347
01:17:50,736 --> 01:17:54,492
Someone ... Somebody has to get out.

348
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,892
Who wants to volunteer?

349
01:17:56,904 --> 01:17:59,268
I do not need volunteers.

350
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,700
I need someone who is brave.

351
01:18:04,224 --> 01:18:06,420
You're the one who goes up.

352
01:18:07,512 --> 01:18:10,188
He's a German spy. Let him alone.

353
01:18:10,236 --> 01:18:17,112
He's a spy and we're not
Telling him who he is.

354
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,800
Do you agree?

355
01:18:20,724 --> 01:18:23,112
You do not speak English.

356
01:18:23,172 --> 01:18:26,844
If he survived to
Germany, we will be finished.

357
01:18:26,856 --> 01:18:29,328
Certain. Tell him.

358
01:18:29,328 --> 01:18:31,536
Yes.

359
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,576
Tell me.

360
01:19:08,808 --> 01:19:11,412
Tell me, Gibson.

361
01:19:21,984 --> 01:19:23,340
Tell me!

362
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:26,664
For God's sake, just let me know.

363
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:35,040
Austin, he's with Austin.

364
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:38,676
Shit.

365
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,244
Shit.

366
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,008
Damn coward.

367
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:47,400
It belongs to Gibson, is not it?

368
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:50,856
It belongs to British soldiers
Who is brave, not yours.

369
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:54,444
It is not worthy of your use.

370
01:19:54,504 --> 01:19:55,620
He's my friend.

371
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,808
Maybe he killed him.

372
01:19:56,856 --> 01:19:58,092
He ... he did not kill him.

373
01:19:58,104 --> 01:19:59,220
How do we know?

374
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:02,784
How difficult is it to find a corpse
British soldiers on the beach?

375
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:07,704
He did not kill anyone.
He's just like all of us.

376
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:15,996
I think he gave
Code to them.

377
01:20:15,996 --> 01:20:18,432
Try all sorts,
And I'll shoot.

378
01:20:18,444 --> 01:20:19,752
This ship is still drowning.

379
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,876
Correct.

380
01:20:21,888 --> 01:20:24,276
We must trust each other.

381
01:20:24,492 --> 01:20:28,164
When we get out of here
I will interrogate you.

382
01:20:28,212 --> 01:20:29,376
Hurry up.

383
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:30,576
Come up.

384
01:20:30,612 --> 01:20:33,936
When your head comes out
We will know it.

385
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:36,528
Are you guys,
Or a real soldier

386
01:20:36,576 --> 01:20:38,700
That is not fair.

387
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,936
Something to hold on
Life is never fair.

388
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:41,376
That's bullshit.

389
01:20:42,432 --> 01:20:43,692
Hurry up.

390
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:44,976
I will not hesitate.

391
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:48,264
It represents thousands of people.

392
01:20:48,312 --> 01:20:49,620
Shit.

393
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,188
He sent something to Lars.

394
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,476
I knew it.

395
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,752
Somebody has to get out
So we can all live.

396
01:21:02,688 --> 01:21:03,912
Do you know what that means?

397
01:21:03,972 --> 01:21:07,560
No. I do not know.

398
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:10,044
This is the price of lies.

399
01:21:15,024 --> 01:21:19,656
I'll go with
he. This is wrong.

400
01:21:19,668 --> 01:21:21,900
Hurry up.

401
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:25,632
With or without me
Will make a lot of difference.

402
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:29,388
Of course, if you continue to defend him
I also do not hesitate to shoot you.

403
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:35,112
Hurry up.

404
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,524
You are stupid.

405
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:55,728
Turn off the engine.

406
01:22:41,268 --> 01:22:43,500
thanks.

407
01:23:42,372 --> 01:23:45,996
Sorry, I do not understand.

408
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:50,808
Maybe you're not proven guilty.

409
01:23:54,384 --> 01:23:56,892
You've done your best.

410
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,348
Stop wasting time.

411
01:24:12,396 --> 01:24:14,988
I understand your frustration, colonel.

412
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:17,232
Johnny.

413
01:24:21,972 --> 01:24:24,360
The ship was attacked.

414
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:26,916
Looks like they're gonna head over here.

415
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:32,928
Here it is.

416
01:26:05,304 --> 01:26:07,464
What do you see?

417
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,396
Hope.

418
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:25,752
Is she all right?

419
01:28:25,812 --> 01:28:27,972
Son?

420
01:28:29,376 --> 01:28:31,524
No.

421
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:33,012
No. She's not all right.

422
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:48,540
Exit!

423
01:29:25,704 --> 01:29:28,176
There are people at sea!

424
01:30:22,044 --> 01:30:23,400
Oil.

425
01:30:24,648 --> 01:30:28,212
Oil. You are all exposed to oil.

426
01:31:10,212 --> 01:31:12,456
They keep coming.

427
01:31:13,572 --> 01:31:14,964
Do not hesitate.

428
01:31:20,988 --> 01:31:23,352
All right, crack your hand.

429
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,784
Leave the boat!

430
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:11,160
Leave the boat!

431
01:32:35,304 --> 01:32:36,528
Catch him!

432
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,820
Do not leave him!

433
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,552
Under the deck.

434
01:34:47,112 --> 01:34:50,574
Sergeant, we have to
save people As much as

435
01:34:50,604 --> 01:34:54,617
possible before the oil
Reach us and make us burn.

436
01:34:58,044 --> 01:34:59,352
Keep up.

437
01:35:02,772 --> 01:35:05,124
Be careful down there.

438
01:35:05,172 --> 01:35:07,644
Be careful down there.

439
01:35:08,856 --> 01:35:11,088
He's dead, man.

440
01:35:17,136 --> 01:35:19,656
Then be more careful.

441
01:35:48,288 --> 01:35:49,764
Are you okay?

442
01:35:50,856 --> 01:35:52,164

Nice.
