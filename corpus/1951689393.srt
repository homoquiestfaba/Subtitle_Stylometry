wouId turn out the way they did...

974
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,271
...and I'd take him under my wing.

975
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:18,876
And maybe you boxed me in preciseIy
so I'd make this decision.

976
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:23,218
And that was the something wonderfuI
that he saw in his dream.

977
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,728
What do you say to that?

978
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,988
I say...

979
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:35,534
...that we are surrounded on aII sides
by mysteries, President Sheridan.

980
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:41,200
And mysteries, once soIved,
are never quite as interesting...

981
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,101
...are they?

982
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,780
[<i>M</i>USIC PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]

983
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,849
<i>M</i>AN [O VER SPEAKER] :
<i>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</i>

984
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:52,043
<i>We are honored to have</i>
<i>President Sheridan with us tonight.</i>

985
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,349
<i>He will be up here shortly</i>
<i>to say a few words.</i>

986
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,549
<i>And among our other</i>
<i>distinguished guests...</i>

987
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,719
<i>...we are fortunate enough</i>
<i>to have Prince Vintari joining us.</i>

988
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:02,727
WeII...

989
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,266
...here we go again.

990
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,900
SHERIDAN:
<i>Ten years.</i>

991
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,237
<i>Ten years since the world changed.</i>

992
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:18,312
<i>Ten years since I changed.</i>

993
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:21,780
<i>But it feels like I never left the place.</i>

994
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:27,048
<i>Babylon 5 is a place</i>
<i>of beginnings and endings.</i>

995
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,723
<i>I wonder which this will be.</i>
