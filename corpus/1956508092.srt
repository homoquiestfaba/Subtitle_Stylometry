699
00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:08,804
 YOU DIDN'T?

700
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:11,682
 NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THAT'S A RIDICULOUS IDEA.

701
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,684
 ALL RIGHT,
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

702
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:17,521
 THE D.E.A. IS
THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

703
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:21,149
I WORKED FOR THE D.I.A.,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

704
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:27,489
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONE
CUTTING OUT PAPER DOLLS.

705
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:31,410
 THE D.I.A. OF COURSE.

706
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,704
SHALL WE TRY
A LITTLE EXERCISE, PLEASE?

707
00:46:33,704 --> 00:46:36,456
IT'S NUMBERS.

708
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:40,502
LET'S COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM 100 BY 7.

00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:50,387
 THAT'S FINE. VERY GOOD.

713
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,888
NOW, SHALL WE
TRY SINGLE DIGITS?

714
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:54,433
 OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

715
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:57,352
NEXT YOU'LL HAVE ME DOING
MY IMPERSONATION OF MR. ED.

716
00:46:57,352 --> 00:46:59,021
 JUST HUMOR ME.

717
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:02,357
THIS IS JUST A STANDARD TEST
OF CONCENTRATION, SO...

718
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:03,608

TO REMEDIAL SCHOOL?

722
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:22,252

GETTING ALONG OK, DAD?

723
00:47:22,252 --> 00:47:25,255

NOW LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.

730
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:42,230
THERE IS A DEVICE
UNDER YOUR SEAT.

731
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,609
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC
DETONATION UNIT

732
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:48,403
THAT WILL BE ACTIVATED BY
THE REMOVAL OF YOUR WEIGHT.

733
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:51,156

734
00:47:51,156 --> 00:47:52,449
 LISTEN TO ME, GODDAMN IT!

THERE'S ENOUGH C-4
UNDER YOUR SEAT

TO BLOW BOTH OF OUR ASSES
TO PACOIMA.

 OH, MY GOD.

744
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:38,620

YOUR STUPID STUNTS.

I DID NOT PUT THIS HERE.

WITHOUT TOUCHING THE CLUB,

00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:02,102
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

 BY THE TIME
THE POLICE GET HERE,

752
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:13,155
WE COULD BOTH BE SITTING
ON MRS. TOBIN'S ROOF
UP THE STREET.

753
00:49:13,155 --> 00:49:18,243
GOOD. NOW GET
THE TOOLKIT OUT OF THE JAG,
AND THEN GET OUT OF HERE.

00:49:18,243 --> 00:49:20,996
 THIS IS CRAZY.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
MESS WITH THIS, DAD.

CLOSE BUT NO FUCKING CIGAR.

00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:53,904
 NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:55,447

759
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:57,199
 I SAID...

760
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,244
I CAN ASSURE YOU
I DID NOT PUT THIS THERE.

761
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:04,372
I NEVER SAID IT WAS REAL.

762
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:06,708
 THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE, DAD!

763
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,961
I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

764
00:50:09,961 --> 00:50:11,630
DO YOU?!

765
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,006
ONE MORE STUNT LIKE THIS

766
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:15,217
AND I'M GOING TO
HAVE YOU COMMITTED!

767
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:24,434
 ONE SECOND THERE
AND, IN A FLASH,

768
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:26,603
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED HIM.

769
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:28,897
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I DID.

770
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:31,399
WHEN I SAW THAT BLACK BOX
UNDER MY SEAT,

771
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:33,860
I FELT TERRIBLE FOR
DOUBTING HIM ALL THIS TIME.

772
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,243
 WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TALK TO STAN KRAVITZ

773
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:42,702
AND ASK WHAT WE NEED TO DO

00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:46,081
TO GET POWER OF ATTORNEY
OR CONSERVATORSHIP,

775
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:49,417
FILE SOMETHING
WITH THE COURTS.

776
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:52,170
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

777
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,880

INCLUDING YOU.

BE PLAYING WITH THEM,

AND I DON'T WANT HIM PLAYING
ANY MORE WAR GAMES WITH STUART.

NOT TO REALIZE THAT,
