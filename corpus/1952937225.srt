I don't feel like I have
to do it all on my own.

I know I will never stop
loving my old family,

678
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:16,223
but it's time to quit being
afraid of opening up my heart.

my new friends.

680

much I really miss my Katie.

And that I was totally
wrong to run away.

682
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:34,382
Guess I found out it's
okay not being super smart,

683

long as you have cool friends that
accept you just the way you are.

684

Looks like all we have to do now
is figure out how to stop Mazhula.

685

she recharges her power

Cracked myself up thinking
how funny it'd be

692
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:14,518
if next time she, like, stuck
her tail in a tub of glue instead.

693
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,256
Uh, so maybe
it wasn't that funny.

like my idea,

works on her end,

all the rest of us
have to do

702
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:46,114
is get Mazhula to use up all
her power trying to toast us.

00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:48,215
Let me take
a swing at her?
