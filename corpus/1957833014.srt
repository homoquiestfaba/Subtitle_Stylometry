1
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,705
That guy, he had extras.
It's, like, 15 cents.

2
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,172
You got that for 15 cents?

3
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,574
I don't have 15 cents.

4
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,676
- 50 cents?
- I paid 50 cents for...

5
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,612
- Where did you get 50 cents?
- You got ripped off.

6
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,145
How much further is it?

7
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,615
It's just up here,
at the very end of the block.

8
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,349
He doesn't
even know where we're going.

9
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,919
I know, I've... we've told you,
like, ten times.

10
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,153
You've been here, like...
What, like, two years?

11
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,456
I've been, like,
doing this for, like, four.

12
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,626
I'm the Reaper,
baby, I'm coming for your spot.

13
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:07,061
- Whatever, like, still.
- The Reaper?

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,930
If he's like a new kid,
then maybe he should be

15
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,832
- the one in charge.
- Damn right.

16
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,232
Are you crazy?

17
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,668
He doesn't even know
where the corner is.

18
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,335
No, that's the logic
that you have, like...

19
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,704
'Cause this is my first
time at this corner.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,740
I've been to
the corner on Fifth twice.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,207
I'm not assuming, I know.

22
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,677
You were, like, screaming
in the fucking street.

23
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,679
Is there a cop car?

24
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,650
You know, you guys are idiots.

25
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,853
There's certain
places that you can't live

26
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:33,588
unless you've, like,
worked your way up there.

27
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,924
Like Town Avenue is
the crack and heroin dealers,

28
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,393
and, like, unless you're, like,
one of those dealers,

29
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,129
you can't live there.

30
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,363
And then if you're... you're
working for someone,

31
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,932
like, helping with runs

32
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,834
you can, like, live near
where there... they... they live

33
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,671
and they, like, protect you,
and you wanna be protected.

34
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,906
You wanna be part of one
of those, like, gangs

35
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,240
in a way, you know?

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,842
Do you think you'll ever leave?

37
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,210
Mm.

38
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:04,852
I mean, I'm sure, yeah, one day.

39
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,486
- What?
- No.

40
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,056
Moved the pickup location.

41
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:09,924
Ah, Jesus Christ,
and he's sleeping.

42
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,526
Need to get him up right now.

43
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,727
Gabriel!

44
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,031
Wake up. Gabriel,
wake up, we have to go.

45
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,198
Come here.

46
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,535
Come on,
get up, big payday today.

47
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,336
This is gonna be a good one,
so we gotta go, guys, come on.

48
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,107
Just be good tonight, all right?

49
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,508
Just be good.

50
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,110
- For once.
- Where's the car?

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,411
It's up here,
they changed the spot.

52
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,431
Move it!

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,366
I wait all night.

54
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,437
Gabriel,
you're with Tom tonight,

55
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,372
and he paid holiday prices,

56
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,442
so she told me to tell you, uh,
you know,

57
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:04,712
be good.

58
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,549
Gabriel, be good to Tom, okay?

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,652
I heard you the first time.

60
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:20,161
Gabriel, you okay?

61
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,932
Gabriel.

62
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,736
Yeah, one second.

63
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,313
All right, I've been waiting.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,501
<i>Hey, Gabriel.</i>

65
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,103
Yeah?

66
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,504
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

67
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,542
Just a minute.

68
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,777
<i>All right, I've been
waiting for you a while.</i>

69
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,580
Yeah, ju... just a second.

70
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:28,896
What are you doing?

71
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,798
Nothing.

72
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,404
So, you all set, all good?

73
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,941
Yeah, all good.

74
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,108
Okay.

75
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,046
You wanna come out?

76
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,918
- You all right?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

77
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:27,989
You into kissing?

78
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,091
Sure.

79
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,492
Okay.

80
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,308
- Did you steal my wallet?
- No.

81
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,509
- Did you steal my wallet?
- No, I...

82
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,944
You are lying to me.

83
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,347
- You are lying to me.
- No.

84
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,015
You have my wallet.

85
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,583
I wanna see your pockets.

86
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,952
- I don't have your money.
- Empty your goddamn pockets.

87
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,386
I don't have your money,

88
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,654
- I don't have your money.
- You have my wallet.

89
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:34,956
- Empty your goddamn pockets.
- No.

90
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,757
- Empty them.
- I'm leaving.

91
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,392
- I wanna see your pockets.
- I'm leaving.

92
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,593
- Empty your pockets.
- I don't have your money.

93
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,063
Trying to scare
off the girls with those nails?

94
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,233
What?

95
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,270
Are you trying to scare
the girls off with those nails?

96
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:06,373
No.

97
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,776
Uh, everyone.

98
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,745
I don't blame you.

99
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,118
Why's a handsome boy like you

100
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,687
waiting for the Metro
all by himself?

101
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,656
Why are you still here?

102
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,060
You look like you
could use some company.

103
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,028
I'm good.

104
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,931
Good, I'm glad, I'm Martha.

105
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,505
Hey, Martha, um, I'm on my way

106
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,072
to see a client right now, so...

107
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,240
A client?

108
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,878
I sleep with people for money.

109
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,948
Oh. Oh.

110
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,687
You're still here.

111
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,391
Women or men?

112
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,062
Why, do you want to pay?

113
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,099
I'm a married woman, young man.

114
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,906
Where's your husband?

115
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:15,042
Well, he's no longer with us.

116
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:17,678
Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,114
You know what my favourite
thing about him was?

118
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,984
He would leave
little origami swans for me

119
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,921
every day in secret spots.

120
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,024
He knew how much I loved swans.

121
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,794
I miss those swans.

122
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:42,002
This is, uh...
This is my train coming.

123
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,440
Good luck with everything.

124
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,482
Do you ever get paid
just to spend time?

125
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,851
None of that other
stuff required.

126
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,628
Come in.

127
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,033
A Christmas tree.

128
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,869
It's Christmas Eve, after all.

129
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,405
I forgot.

130
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,109
I put up the tree
a couple of weeks ago.

131
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,213
This is a nice place.

132
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,148
Thank you.

133
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,017
Would you like some water?

134
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:31,785
Oh, no, thank you.

135
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,156
Wasn't expecting guests.

136
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,004
Do you like music?

137
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:51,939
Uh, yeah.

138
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,074
Do you sing?

139
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,076
Uh, no, ma'am.

140
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,479
I hate being called ma'am.

141
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,919
What would you be
doing if I wasn't here?

142
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:14,928
Well, I'd probably be
listening to music and reading,

143
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,064
nothing too crazy.

144
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,266
What type of music?

145
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,403
Oh, I don't think
you'd like my music.

146
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,139
Try me.

147
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,143
Okay.

148
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,586
Could I have one?

149
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,088
Are you old enough?

150
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,069
Thank you.

151
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,858
Do you need to be that
drunk to be here with me?

152
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:23,531
I think I just need to
be that drunk in general.

153
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,036
You don't need to stay.

154
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,337
I can give you some money

155
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,039
and you can leave
whenever you'd like.

156
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,510
I think I'll stay.

157
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:39,980
More?

158
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,448
Yes, please.

159
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,162
It's not water, my boy.

160
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,198
Who likes Scotch?

161
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,971
Apparently, you do.

162
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,548
Remind me to get Scotch later.

163
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,717
Scotch?

164
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,852
I always drink
scotch at Christmas.

165
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,740
Thanks for last night.

166
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,143
I'll see you later.
Don't be late again.

167
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,024
I have to go to the bathroom.

168
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,005
<i>Hey, Gabriel, it's Mom.</i>

169
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,875
<i>It's cold here today.</i>

170
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:56,811
<i>I hope Los Angeles is warm.</i>

171
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,348
<i>I know you can't call often,</i>

172
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,149
<i>but I'd love to hear
from you soon.</i>

173
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,721
<i>And if you can send
some more money,</i>

174
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,056
<i>that would be really great.</i>

175
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,893
<i>They cut my shifts
at the vocational school.</i>

176
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,495
<i>I'm praying for you.</i>

177
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:18,398
<i>Merry Christmas,
and call your mom soon.</i>

178
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,001
<i>I love you.</i>

179
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,621
<i>Who were you talking to,
Gabriel?</i>

180
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:41,822

I need to send all
of that to Illinois.

Okay, uh, we can do that

and if you could please
wait in the waiting...

- How do I get back there?
- If...

305
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:01,716
Where is he?
Just tell us where he is.

306
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,551
You cannot go back
there right now.

307
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:05,285

- Tell us where he is right now.

316
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:22,149
Of whiskey, and I pick Scotch.

317

Mm-hmm.

318
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:28,589
Have you been drinking?

319
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,091
Have you?

320
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,127
Can I get you a glass of water,
Gabriel?

321
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,664
Why do you always ask that?

322
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,265
Because you look like
you could use some.

323
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:41,102
Can I sit down?

324
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:43,504
Of course.

What is?

329

You'll be happier in Italy,

00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:04,125
and I think that's pretty cool.

331
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:08,295
Mm. Well, guess what?

332
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:14,702
My doctors say I'm not
well enough to go to Italy.

333
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,739
I'm here for another
round of treatment.

334
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:24,678
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Martha.

335
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,182
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

336
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,586
Hey, do you wanna go
somewhere that looks like Italy?

337
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:35,856
What?

338
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,591
So, do you want to?

339
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,764
- Gabriel, that's crazy.
- Hey...

340
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,234
Hey, what does Italy look like?

341
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:52,973
It's beautiful.

342
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:58,279
There are some hills up
the coast near Santa Barbara

343
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,047
that resemble parts of it,

344
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:04,852
but no, we're not going
anywhere.

345
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:06,053
Okay.

346
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:08,523
Mayb... maybe tomorrow?

347
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,193
Gabriel.

348
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:15,863
Okay.

349
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,101
Absolutely not.

350
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,779
Hybrids are economical.

351
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:35,149
They're great on gas, and much
better for the environment.

352
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:38,919
I'm serious.

353
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,956
Guess how many times
a month I fill up this tank?

354
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:47,328
Once. Just once.
Can you believe that?

355
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,504
If you ever make money,
want to keep it,

356
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,072
don't go buying fancy cars.

357
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:06,714
Means we're almost there.

358
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:23,764
When you receive bread,
you say <i>grazie.</i>

359
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,366
What does that mean?

360
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,234
It means "Thank you."

361
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:33,841
And then I reply, <i>prego.</i>

362
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:36,143
<i>- Prego.
- Prego.</i>

363
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:40,748
Hey, have you ever
looked at a sunset upside down?

364
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,116
What?

365
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,785
Yeah, you do a handstand, watch.

366
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,031
No, no, no, no, not that one.

367
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,266
- Shit, okay.
- R is reverse, not stop.

368
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,802
You need to take your
foot off the accelerator

369
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,871
- Okay.
- And put it on the...

370
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:09,243
Ah, ah, how do I stop?

371
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:10,744
Gabriel, Gabriel, hit the brake.

372
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:11,979
How do I stop, how do I stop?

373
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,480
Oh, my God, one more time.

374
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:15,015
- Oh, my gosh.
- How was that?

375
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,750
You're going
to give me a heart attack.

376
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,818
That was... that was
pretty good, though, right?

377
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,119
That was a pretty good turn?

378
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,055
Yes, you're
a fast learner, okay.

379
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:51,018
I'm gonna freshen up.

380
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,987
Can we get more wine?

381
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,155
Are you hungry?

382
00:45:55,256 --> 00:45:57,124
Always.

383
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:59,661
<i>Order room service,
anything you like,</i>

384
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,228
<i>and wine too.</i>

385
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,498
Are you going to order food?

386
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,966
Yeah, sure.

387
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:41,001
Is everything okay?

388
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,336
Yeah, everything's fine.

389
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,905
Do you want me to make the call?

390
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:49,711
Who's this?

391
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:52,046
What were you doing in my purse?

392
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:53,581
Who is it?

393
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:55,015
Give me the photo, Gabriel.

394
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,450
Not until you tell me who it is.

395
00:46:58,653 --> 00:46:59,920
My son.

396
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,557
The photo is of my son.

397
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,260
You didn't tell
me you had a son.

398
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,064
I don't have a son.

399
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:31,852
He looks like you.

400
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,387
Yeah.

401
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:45,265
That first night I saw you,

402
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,502
you looked so much like what
I imagined he might look like.

403
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,006
He drowned.

404
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,443
My husband was supposed
to be watching him,

405
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,046
but he got distracted
for two minutes.

406
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:01,649
That's all it took.

407
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,587
I tried to forgive him, but...

408
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:08,989
I don't think I ever really did.

409
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,397
I'm sorry, Martha.

410
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,234
Everyone says they're sorry,

411
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,203
I don't want you to be sorry.

412
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:32,179
I miss Luke so much.

413
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:35,215
Who's Luke?

414
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:37,451
My friend.

415
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:39,687
He couldn't handle it all.

416
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,058
Do you think
you can handle it all?

417
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:50,164
I don't think so.

418
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:56,437
Maybe he was warning you.

419
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:00,642
You believe that?

420
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,146
They don't ever really leave us.

421
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:15,055
Why don't we order
that room service?

422
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:34,742
Hey, Martha.

423
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,344
Hmm?

424
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,380
Can I sleep in your bed?

425
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,523
Of course.

426
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,122
You sure you want
me to let you off here?

427
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,291
Yeah, this is fine.

428
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,073
Well, okay, then.

429
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:20,048
<i>So, what's happened?</i>

430
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,792
Hey, Martha, it's, uh, Gabriel.

431
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:35,095
Just wanted to, uh...

432
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,499
Just call me back
if you get this voicemail.

433
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:42,804
Hey, Martha,
it's, uh... it's Gabriel again.

434
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,373
You haven't been
answering your phone,

435
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,610
so I just wanted just
see if you're okay.

436
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,282
Okay, uh...

437
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:34,615
What's going on, Gabriel?

438
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,686
Where you going this time,
Gabriel, huh?

439
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,253
I asked you a question.

440
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:42,389
Got any wallets on you, Gabriel?

441
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,160
Got any more wallets on you,
Gabriel?

442
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,096
- Huh? Got any more wallets?
- No, no.

443
00:53:48,196 --> 00:53:49,664
- Answer me.
- No.

444
00:53:56,137 --> 00:53:57,404
Got any wallets?

445
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:02,643
Fucking punk.

446
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,732
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,002
I think I broke a rib.

448
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:45,052
Where are those bruises from?

449
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,488
I don't wanna talk about it.

450
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,359
Oh, you don't have to.

451
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:56,931
What are you writing?

452
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:58,699
I just have to take some notes.

453
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:08,475
Have you consumed any alcohol
or drugs in the past 24 hours?

454
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:11,045
No.

455
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:12,980
- No?
- I hate drugs.

456
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:15,448
Why is that?

457
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:22,590
Drugs killed my best friend.

458
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:24,859
Oh.

459
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:27,562
I'm so sorry to hear that.

460
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:33,034
It's a very painful situation.

461
00:55:34,135 --> 00:55:39,339
Well, I'm glad to hear that
you're steering clear of it.

462
00:55:42,944 --> 00:55:46,914
Um, have you ever
been paid for sex?

463
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:48,950
No.

464
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,854
No?

465
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:56,423
Um, you were brought
in from the district

466
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:59,093
that has a high
level of prostitution.

467
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:02,730
Do you wanna tell me the truth?

468
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:07,702
No.

469
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:11,939
All right.

470
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:18,846
Gabriel,
I know you feel so alone,

471
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,049
and I know it's a dark path,

472
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,121
but I want you to
know that I understand.

473
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:29,657
I've been down that path

474
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:35,029
and... I'm gonna
do everything I can

475
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:38,733
to get you
in a better place, okay?

476
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,135
Okay.

477
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:42,770
Okay.

478
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:50,511
So... have you ever
been paid for sex?

479
00:56:58,552 --> 00:56:59,787
- Okay.
- Yeah.

480
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:02,455
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

481
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,896
And where does that money go?

482
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,770
I send most of it
to my mom in Illinois.

483
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:21,142
Hmm.
You still care about your mom?

484
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,615
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

485
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:29,884
I'm sure she misses you.

486
00:57:30,718 --> 00:57:34,487
Have you... have you called
her to talk to her?

487
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,558
No.

488
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:42,563
Is your mom in a situation?

489
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,136
The State of California
makes you ask these questions?

490
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:53,607
They don't make me ask anything.

491
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:58,946
I just...
I just want you to be better.

492
00:57:59,547 --> 00:58:01,215
- Okay.
- Okay?

493
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:03,851
Okay.

494
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:08,856
Do you have any
employment prospects?

495
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:11,792
Yeah.

496
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,527
- You do?
- I have one.

497
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,129
Oh, that's fantastic.

498
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:17,098
You excited?

499
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:20,534
- If I get it.
- Yeah.

500
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:22,036
How could they
not give it to you?

501
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,704
- Oh, thanks.
- Hmm.

502
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,874
Well, it's a great first step.

503
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:28,709
I hope so.

504
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:35,216
This is for you, mademoiselle.

505
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:36,617
Thanks, Gabriel.

506
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:38,786
You got it.

507
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:42,590
I got you.

508
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:56,070
Gabriel.

509
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,539
Hey, how can I help you?

510
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:01,242
You look good.

511
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,145
Thank you, so do you.

512
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:07,815
You got a job.

513
00:59:09,984 --> 00:59:14,588
Martha's assistant.
I knew I knew that face.

514
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,758
How is she?

515
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,899
Can... can I talk to you?

516
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:28,335
- Okay.
- Um...

517
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:33,007
Outside, please?

518
00:59:35,176 --> 00:59:37,111
Okay, okay, gimme five,

519
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:38,345
I'll meet you out back.

520
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,414
Okay.

521
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:41,782
Okay.

522
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:48,155
You good?
Okay.
