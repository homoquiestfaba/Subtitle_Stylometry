1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,500
This is a story about a housewife
during the sexual revolution.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,020
The time is 1972,
the place Los Angeles,

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,490
and the people...ordinary.

4
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,840
Good morning, lover.

5
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,160
You call this morning?

6
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,500
How about some breakfast?

7
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,440
Now I'm all set.
Coffee and the morning paper!

8
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,600
What do you want to do today, Mark?

9
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:00,620
I want to take some photos.
What do you want to do today, Mark?

10
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,290
I want to take some photos.

11
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,470
I've had this darn thing for a month,
and I haven't had time to use it yet.

12
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,380
It's supposed to take great pictures.

13
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,390
Do you know it comes
with a set of ND filters?

14
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,900
Now, that's a professional camera.

15
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,000
These girls in Playboy are pretty.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,740
But none of them has a bust like mine.

17
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,360
What?

18
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,440
I have a better bust
than any of these girls.

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
I should be in Playboy magazine.

20
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,700
That's right, honey.

21
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,600
If I could say one thing about you,

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,550
you've got great tits!

23
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
You're pretty ample yourself…
where it counts!

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's such a beautiful day.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Maybe we could just
lie by the pool all day.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,400
I love lying by the pool.

27
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
And you could take pictures of me.

28
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,200
That's not a bad idea, honey.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,240
My new camera will
put you in the right light.

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
But if you take your clothes off,
the neighbors will see.

31
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,830
They've seen tits before.

32
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,220
I mean, they've either got them
or they're married to them.

33
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,500
What's the big deal?

34
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,440
But people are so uptight around here.

35
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,720
They go nuts when they see a little sex.

36
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,970
I know, honey.

37
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,900
There's just not enough love in this world,
that's the problem.

38
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey, I know what's wrong
with this thing.

39
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,880
The camera needs a mount
before you can put the filter on.

40
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,280
A mount?

41
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,180
Sounds interesting!

42
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,690
Hi, Barbi.

43
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,790
Hi, Sheila. Hi, Mark.

44
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,300
Hi, Barbi.

45
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,500
It's great to see you, Barbi.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,090
To what do we owe this...pleasure?

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,830
To sheer boredom.

48
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,240
Rick and I were going to
spend the day together,

49
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,840
but at the last minute, he had to work.

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
On Sunday?

51
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,740
Yes, I know. Isn't it terrible?

52
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,540
But it's really not so bad.

53
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,400
At least it leaves me time
for...other diversions.

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,320
What are you guys up to?

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,370
Oh, we're just relaxing.

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,760
Would you like a drink?

57
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,880
Isn't it a little early?

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,080
It's never too early, is it, honey?

59
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,730
There are more than a thousand ways
to blend whiskey in Scotland,

60
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,730
but Dewar's never varies...

61
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,570
so why should we?

62
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,360
Sheila, what are you reading?
Playboy magazine?

63
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,180
I can't believe it.

64
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,540
Oh, Barbi, don't be such a square.

65
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I only look at it for the articles.

66
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,460
And you'd be surprised.
There's some very artistic photography.

67
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,200
I can look as good as these girls.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
They're pretty, but they're too thin.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,060
That's what I said, isn't it, honey?

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,450
Let's compare ourselves to them.

71
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,550
I've gotta get this!

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,310
Come and get it, boys.
This all-American dish is just for you!

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,790
Viva Italia!

74
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,770
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

75
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
You girls are fantastic.

76
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,900
You girls are really great!

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,070
I'm going to get you a drink.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,130
Thanks.

79
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah, you girls are really great!

80
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,140
Thank you, Mark. You're sweet.

81
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,190
So how's it going, Barbi?

82
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,700
How's what going?

83
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,840
Life, love, business.

84
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,760
Life and love are fine.

85
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
As for business, you should ask Rick.

86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,060
Rick works so much,
I hardly ever see him.

87
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,910
As for me, my job is always the same.

88
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,430
A little dictation,
a little pinch on the behind.

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
You know, the life of a secretary.

90
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,910
Sounds fascinating.

91
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,800
You think so?
You should try it sometime.

92
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,840
You're a beautiful woman, Barbi.

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,080
Men can't help it
if they respond to that.

94
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,240
You know, when I was a younger man,
I only went for blondes.

95
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,350
Now I prefer brunettes.

96
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,390
They're more intense,
more deeply sensual.

97
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,010
You'd better not let Sheila
hear you say that.

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
What?

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,810
Nothing, Sheila.

100
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm hot. I'm going to go for a swim.

101
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,740
Would anyone like to join me?

102
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,270
I will.

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,840
There's nothing I like more
than being wet.

104
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,040
Be careful, honey.
You're gonna say things you don't mean.

105
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,130
- What? What did I say?
- Never mind.

106
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,840
Remember last night, honey?
Remember what we did?

107
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,240
You little hussy.
That's what I like about you.

108
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,400
We have a great sex life,
don't we, honey?

109
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,250
Look, Barbi's pouting.

110
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,670
What a baby.

111
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,320
Babies can't have
cigarettes and alcohol.

112
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,420
Babies can only have milk.

113
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,110
Can I have a drink, too?

114
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,500
Sure.

115
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,800
Thanks.

116
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,570
On a single pipe full
of Bond Street tobacco,

117
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,070
you can travel a couple
of relaxing miles in a canoe...

118
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,150
without even lifting a paddle.

119
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,480
Poor Barbi. All undressed,

120
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
and no place to go.

121
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,220
I'll get you a dress.

122
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,840
Now, how about that movie?

123
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,440
- Good morning, Miss Smith.
- Good morning, Mr. Humphrey.

124
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,570
Now, take a letter, Miss Smith.

125
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,570
Dear Sirs.

126
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,330
We at Mutual Insurance

127
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,730
have been doing business
with Johnson & Jones

128
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,970
for over fifteen years.

129
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,760
Hey, man.
Is this the welfare office?

130
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
Room 222. Down the hall.

131
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,420
Oh, thanks, man.

132
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,990
Goddamn freeloading hippie!

133
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,720
Now, where were we?

134
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,090
"We at Mutual Insurance..."

135
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,090
Yes.

136
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,680
Now this merger...

137
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,280
This merger...

138
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,300
Oh, blast it, Miss Smith!

139
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,850
It isn't the merger I want! It's you!

140
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm glad to see that you're
always on top of things, Miss Smith.

141
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,870
Mine! All mine!

142
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm not taking any calls.

143
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait! I'm not through
promoting you yet!

144
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,240
I'm ready for you, lover.

145
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,090
Rick!

146
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,440
Well, hello.

147
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,520
Hi, stranger.

148
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,700
How was your day, honey?

149
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,420
Long. I could use that martini.

150
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,780
Sure thing, Rick.

151
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,000
Anyone ever tell you
you're the perfect little woman?

152
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,180
I sure try, Rick.

153
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,000
How was your day at the office, Rick?

154
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,520
Great. Sales have gone up 15%
since I started working overtime.

155
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
If I keep it up,

156
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,600
we'll be able to buy that cabin
and the fishing boat by the end of the year.

157
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,480
I sure am looking forward
to doing some fishing.

158
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,620
I could use a break.

159
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,910
Rick, I lost my job today.

160
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,400
What happened?

161
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,960
Mr. Humphrey found out I was married.

162
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,520
It doesn't matter, honey.

163
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
I make enough money
for the both of us.

164
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,830
You just work on being lovely,
and on being my girl.

165
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,640
But I like to work.

166
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,150
Also, if I work, you won't have to go
on so many business trips

167
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,430
and work so much overtime.

168
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,500
But I need the business trips.

169
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It's the only chance I get to unwind.

170
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,720
In Indianapolis, I go drag racing.

171
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
In Monterey, I play golf.

172
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,600
In Aspen, I ski.

173
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,670
What could be better?

174
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,430
I understand, Rick.

175
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,320
It's just I wish we could spend
more time together.

176
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,460
If you spent more time with me,
you'd get sick of me.

177
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,640
Rick, do you think I would
make a good model?

178
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,720
Sure, honey.

179
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,980
You could do just about anything
you put your mind to.

180
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Now how about you putting your mind
on giving me a little lovin.'

181
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,570
Happy birthday, Mark.
I brought you a present.

182
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, Sheila!
Crown Royal! My favorite!

183
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,820
Not the whiskey, silly. Here. Open it.

184
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,660
Sheila! Cologne! Thanks!

185
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,170
Now, how about a toast
to the birthday boy?

186
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,520
Mark,

187
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,230
Barbi and Rick have invited us
to a barbeque on Sunday.

188
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,320
Don't you think I should
have a new dress?

189
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,480
A new dress for a barbeque?
That's ridiculous.

190
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,640
It's lucky I'm responsible with our money,
or you'd have us in the poorhouse.

191
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Here they are.

192
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,560
How are you doing, old boy?

194
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,210
I can't complain. And yourself?

195
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,970
Not bad. Not bad.

196
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,180
I just love what you've done with your yard.

197
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,610
It's the manicured look. Very "in" this year.

198
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,170
What would you two like to drink?

199
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,880
I'll have a Pussycat.

200
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Make it a gin and tonic.

201
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,760
One pussycat and one gin and tonic
coming up.

202
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,530
Take it easy, old boy.

203
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,110
I have an audition tomorrow,
and I want to be fresh.

204
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,480
There you are.

205
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,060
That's perfect.

206
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,520
You're looking good, Rick.

207
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,010
What do you do to stay so strong?

208
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,650
Oh you know, tennis, golf,
push-ups, jumping jacks.

209
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,120
What a man.

210
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,910
I wish Mark would take some exercise.

211
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,200
He's developing a beer belly.

212
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,380
Really? I don't think so.

213
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,080
Mark looks pretty good to me.

214
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,580
Thanks, Barbi. I return the compliment.

215
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,730
One more, bartender.

216
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,400
And put a lot of vodka in it, Rick.

217
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,160
I want to get really smashed today.

218
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,450
- How's that?
- No. More.

219
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,120
More.

220
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,240
That's quite an outfit, Barbi.

221
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,020
Oh, this old thing?
I only wear it around the house.

222
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,760
I'll bet.

223
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,250
Why doesn't everybody eat something?
There's plenty of food.

224
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,470
-Come on.
-All right.

225
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,170
Here, everybody. Take a plate.

226
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,340
Wow, Barbi.
Everything looks great.

227
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,190
Thank you.

228
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
You've really outdone yourself
this time, Barbi.

229
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,010
It was nothing.

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,880
Mmm, Swedish meatballs.
I haven't had these in years!

231
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,040
I get them all the time now.

232
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,760
So, how is everything, Barbi?

233
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,930
Fine. I've got so much time on my hands,
I don't know what to do with myself.

234
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,720
I'm learning to cook, at least,
and we let the housekeeper go.

235
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,190
But I get so bored sometimes.

236
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,800
Rick works so much,
I hardly ever see him.

237
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,500
I know what you mean.

238
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Only my problem's the opposite.

239
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,970
Mark is home all the time, now that
he got laid off from that TV series.

240
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,710
I think the best thing for the both of us
would be to get out of the house more.

241
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,500
I completely agree.

242
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,570
That's why I want to get another job,
something meaningful.

243
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,120
I've even considered becoming a model.

244
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,290
Why don't you, Barbi?
You'd make a great model.

245
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,400
I'll think about it.

246
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,010
I noticed you got a new stereo system.

247
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,950
Pretty spiffy.

248
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,950
Yeah, It's a TEAC.

249
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,790
The receiver has glass tubes,
and it works with a remote.

250
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,870
We have a Panasonic.

251
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,950
It's not as expensive as your system,

252
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,760
but not everything that makes nice sounds

253
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,290
has to be expensive.

254
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
But we need a new TV.

255
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,600
We're thinking about getting
a color TV.

256
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,980
We need a new TV, too.

257
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,770
As soon as I trade in the car.

258
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,470
I've been wanting a Camaro.

259
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,350
And right now, business is great,
so I think I'll go for it.

260
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,760
Why worry about money anyway?

261
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,980
I say live and love today,
and pay tomorrow.

262
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,900
That's the American way.

263
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,140
You can take that
”live and love" stuff too far.

264
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,560
For one thing, your cologne
is way too strong, man.

265
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,400
It's knocking me out!

266
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,900
This cologne?

267
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
It was a birthday present from Sheila.

268
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,100
You may laugh, but let me tell you:

269
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,320
the ladies go for it.

270
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,950
You might think about buying some
to please your own lady.

271
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,000
No, thanks.

272
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,110
My lady likes me just the way I am.

273
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,620
Rick!

274
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,930
I need another Pussycat.

275
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,000
Sure thing, Mrs. Campbell.

276
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,360
Rick says my cologne's too strong.

277
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,990
What do you think, girls?

278
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,780
Do you like the way I smell?

279
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,030
Hey! Lay off! That's my woman.

280
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,890
Lighten up, Rick. It was just a joke.

281
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,990
Here you go, girls.

282
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,160
Mark! I thought I told you to lay off!

283
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,240
Don't worry about them!

284
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,440
Bye, honey.

285
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,030
Have a great day.

286
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,720
Listen, Barbi,
don't make dinner tonight.

287
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,310
I'll be working late at the office.

288
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,840
Rick, not again.

289
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,440
I'm sorry, baby, but it can't be helped.

290
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,290
You be a good girl 'til I come home.
and I’ll see you around ten.

291
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,290
Try to entertain yourself until then.

292
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,290
All right, Rick. I'll try.

293
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Hey, look at that.

294
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,430
Yeah.

295
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,520
She's got class.

296
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,340
May I help you?

297
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Is Mr. Gladstone in?

298
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,770
Mr. Gladstone's out of the office today.

299
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,970
I'm Miss Marker,
Mr. Gladstone's assistant.

300
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,580
What can I do for you?

301
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,200
My name is Barbi Smith,
and I want to be a model.

302
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,760
Have a seat, Barbi.

303
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,470
Do you have any experience?

304
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,100
No, I'm afraid not.

305
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,520
Well, you're hardly a little girl.

306
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,020
Don't you think it's a little late for you
to start a modeling career?

307
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,030
Excuse me a moment.

308
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,360
Girls!

309
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,560
Stop horsing around
and get ready.

310
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,470
The photographer will be here
in ten minutes.

311
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,520
Come in the light, dear.
I want to look at you.

312
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
You've got good bones…
and your figure's okay.

313
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,400
But your hair, it just hangs down.

314
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,260
And your make-up's all wrong.

315
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,270
But that shouldn't matter in the end,
not for the kind of work you could get.

316
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,740
What do you mean?

317
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,420
Oh, you know, catalog work, and...

318
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,000
art movies.

319
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll tell you what, dear.

320
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,880
Go get your hair and make-up
done by a professional,

321
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,430
and get some good photographs taken,
and come back.

322
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,840
If the pictures are any good,
I’ll run them by Mr. Gladstone.

323
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,530
Thank you, Miss Marker.
Thank you for your help.

324
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
Barbi,

325
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,240
Maybe we could set up
our own photo session.

326
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm a very good photographer.

327
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,740
I live far away,
and it could go late, but...

328
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,760
you could spend the night at my house.

329
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,500
Do you want to have beautiful hair?
Do you want to look like a model or a superstar?

330
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,200
Call Sherman of Hollywood!

331
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,160
Why, hello! You must be Barbi.

332
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,840
Come on in.

333
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,000
You have a great place here.

334
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,590
Don't say that! It's not done!

335
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,730
Come on into the salon, and we'll start.

336
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,330
Have a seat.

337
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Now, what can I do for you today?

338
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,260
I want to look beautiful, like a model.

339
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,760
You're already beautiful, Barbi.

340
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
But you know what your problem is?

341
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
You need to refine your look.

342
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,000
I'd like to see a couple of inches
off the bottom of your hair,

343
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,040
a lot more height and body
at the crown,

344
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
and some soft curls
around your face.

345
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,170
Now, how does that sound?

346
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,430
It sounds wonderful.

347
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,870
All right. Then let's begin.

348
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,760
I love cutting hair.
I could do it all day long!

349
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Now who could that be?

350
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,720
Excuse me a moment.

351
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,640
Oh, hi, Reeves!
I’m in the middle of a hair session.

352
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,240
I just came to borrow a cup of sugar.

353
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,660
Okay! Come on into the kitchen.

354
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,390
Is that all, just sugar?

355
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,640
Of course. What else would it be?

356
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,380
Actually, do you mind
if I watch you work?

357
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,840
Not at all. Come on in.

358
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,700
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

359
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,430
Sorry!

360
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,730
Reeves, this is Barbi.

361
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,180
Barbi, this is my neighbor Reeves.

362
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,490
Glad to meet you.

363
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,260
Barbi wants to look like a model,
and I'm going to help her all I can.

364
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,240
She doesn't need any help
as far as I'm concerned.

365
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,600
Go sit down. I'm going to start.

366
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,030
Now for some hairspray.

367
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,830
Actually, I think I need to be going.

368
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,560
You don't have to go.

369
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,070
I have all day!

370
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,070
It's so hot in here.

371
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,640
Why don't you two go sit on the couch,
and I'll make some refreshing shakes.

372
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,050
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,900
MAGIC DUST

374
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,600
Here you are.

375
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,400
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

376
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,830
Bottoms up.

377
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,870
Mmm. What's in this?

378
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,510
It's got milk and vanilla
and sugar and ice

379
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,730
and a special ingredient.

380
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,080
Whatever it is, it's delicious.

381
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,020
It's not the only thing around here
that's delicious.

382
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,380
Please, Reeves. I'm taken.

383
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm not talking about you.

384
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,370
What a pity.
And after all my hospitality.

385
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,270
This is so refreshing.

386
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,230
You have to give me the recipe
so I can make it for Rick.

387
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,810
- Who's Rick?
- My husband.

388
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,920
You have a husband?

389
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,570
Don't look so shocked, pretty boy.

390
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,180
They're all like that.

391
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
They'll do anything for a ring.

392
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,990
But that doesn't stop them
from having a little fun on the side,

393
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,920
any more that it stops me or you.

394
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,090
Don't say "me" and "you”
in the same sentence like that.

395
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,310
We're not the same.
Do you understand?

396
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,450
You two are so funny.

397
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,500
Why?

398
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,550
I don't know. Everything seems
really funny right now.

399
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,140
Well...I guess you're right.

400
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,370
I mean, here we all are!

401
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,400
I feel so...strange.

402
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,000
Reeves...help me.

403
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,000
What's so funny?

404
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,400
Too bad she passed out on you.

405
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,990
If you ask me, it's not much fun
with a sleeping beauty.

406
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,820
It's much more fun with a fully-awake girl...

407
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,080
or boy.

408
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,010
Rick?

409
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,990
Rick?

410
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,390
“Barbi, I am very sick. I have
Gone to the hospital. --Rick.”

411
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,010
Oh, Rick! Rick! What's happened?

412
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,700
You must be the new nurse.

413
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,350
No, I'm his wife, Mrs. Smith.

414
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,510
How is he, Doctor?

415
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,770
Mrs. Smith, it seems that he worked
himself into a state of hysteria

416
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,770
when you didn't come home last night.

417
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,640
He had a seizure which led to a high fever,

418
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,520
followed by pneumonia.

419
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,520
He's going to have to stay in bed
for at least two weeks.

420
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,720
Now, I know this is not my business,

421
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,300
-but if I were you--
-I understand, doctor.

422
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I won't let it happen again.

423
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,570
Oh, Rick. Rick. Please forgive me.

424
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,290
It's all my fault.

425
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,350
Barbi. Where were you?

426
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,700
It doesn't matter now.

427
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,680
I did a bad thing, Rick,but I won't
be bad anymore, I promise.

428
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,820
Barbi, what are you wearing?

429
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,560
Oh, darling, I love you,

430
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,950
and I want to prove it to you.

431
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,040
That's why I'm dressed like a nurse.

432
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,130
I want to nurse you back to health.

433
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,200
I'll stay with you night and day
until you're better.

434
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,280
And then we'll do everything
you want to do.

435
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,370
You mean that, honey?

436
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
Of course I do.

437
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,530
Thank you, Barbi.

438
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,310
You're so good to me.

439
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,100
Now rest, darling.

440
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,790
Just rest.

441
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,000
I just love watching the guys
play tennis. Don't you?

442
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,570
Yes. Rick loves to play tennis.

443
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,510
From now on, everything is for Rick.

444
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
What sort of man reads Playboy?

445
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,980
A personable guy whose personal
appearance is his calling card.

446
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,760
He knows that a big part of being
welcome is being well-groomed.

447
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,970
Here are your eggs, honey.

448
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,060
Thanks.

449
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,160
Your bags are all packed.

450
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,220
Did you pack my skis?

451
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,320
Yes, they're in the ski bag.

452
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,060
But when are you going to have time to ski
with all those business meetings?

453
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,970
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

454
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,480
I'm gonna extend my trip to a month.

455
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,960
Then I'll have time for
business and leisure.

456
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,710
A month?

457
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,710
Darling, you can't mean that.

458
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,800
We were planning a trip in two weeks.

459
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,920
I know. But this is more important.

460
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,670
If I don't ski now,
I won't ski 'til next year.

461
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,780
Is there more coffee?

462
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,150
Of course.

463
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,400
Why don't you bring me along?
I could learn to ski, too.

464
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,500
Oh, no. It's not for you.

465
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,220
You'd get bored.

466
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,520
Are there going to be girls up there?

467
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,640
Girls?

468
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,720
There are girls everywhere.

469
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,350
Of course there will be girls.

470
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,890
Is that why you don't want me to come?

471
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,880
Barbi, what has gotten into you?

472
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,990
It's just a business trip.

473
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,080
I'll be home before you know it.

474
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,970
I know. It's just...

475
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,030
I'm so disappointed.

476
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,130
You're always working.

477
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,320
And I was looking forward to this vacation
so we could spend some time together.

478
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,710
Why are you always on my back?

479
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,280
Can't a guy just have
some fun every once in a while?

480
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,750
Look, Barbi, you're
being a ball and chain.

481
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,260
I need to go in the outdoors
and express myself.

482
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,730
It's who I am!

483
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,420
All right. Express yourself, then!

484
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,900
I don't care what you do.

485
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,400
Stay away as long as you like.

486
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,700
Stay away forever!

487
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,780
Maybe I will!

488
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,000
Now you've really blown it, Barbi.

489
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,790
Before, I wanted to come back.

490
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,790
Now I'm not sure.

491
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,560
I need my space, and I need to think.

492
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,460
I'll call you when I'm good and ready.

493
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:14,550
You may be waiting a long time!
I'll call you when I'm good and ready.

494
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,550
You may be waiting a long time!

495
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,750
Oh, Sheila. It's so horrible.

496
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,580
Rick and I got in a fight,
and I yelled at him,

497
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,660
and now he may never come back.

498
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,020
That's terrible.

499
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,800
But can you believe it?
Mark and I split up, too.

500
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,900
He's gone to live with his brother.

501
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,000
Listen, Barbi,

502
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,850
maybe we can benefit
from our newfound freedom.

503
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,250
How do you mean?

504
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,410
Put on something sexy,
and I'll be right over.

505
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,070
There. That's better.

506
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,200
That'll knock their eyes out.

507
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,080
Now, Barbi, you look stuffy
compared to me.

508
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,300
I do?

509
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,230
Yes. Definitely stuffy.

510
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,960
Here. Come here.

511
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,000
Take off your vest and tie.

512
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,810
But my blouse is transparent,

513
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,810
and I'm not wearing a bra.

514
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,550
Well, that's the whole point.

515
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,720
Here, come on. Give them to me.

516
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,540
But, Sheila, we can't just go out
on the street looking like this.

517
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,290
Are you kidding?

518
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,350
This is the 1970s.

519
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,350
We're liberated women now.

520
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,350
We' re dressing for ourselves.

521
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,840
Barbi, isn't this exciting?

522
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,510
All alone in the city and no husbands.

523
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,710
But, Sheila, what are we going to do?

524
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,400
I don't know.

525
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,480
Let's stand over there and think.

526
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,160
Would you look at that, Harry?

527
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,610
I've got eyes in my head.

528
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,540
Hi, girls.

529
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,690
You look very sexy.
Very nice.

530
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,690
Who do you work for?

531
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,390
Well, I was just fired from my job,

532
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,040
and Sheila here has never worked.

533
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,600
So I guess you can say
we work as housewives.

534
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,970
Housewives? Dressed like that?

535
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,530
Yeah. You see, we want
to have adventures.

536
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh, my.

537
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,570
Well, let me introduce myself.

538
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,710
I’m Mrs. James.

539
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,040
- I'm Barbi.
- And I'm Sheila.

540
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,300
Pleased to meet you.

541
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,130
Now, you girls say
you want some adventure?

542
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,770
Well, that's not so difficult
for girls that look like you.

543
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,620
Only...what kind of adventure?

544
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,090
I want to meet a rich man who will
buy me a fur coat and diamonds...

545
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,680
and who's not at all like
my cheapskate husband.

546
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,490
I want to meet someone
kind and sensitive and loving.

547
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,140
I can arrange all of that.

548
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,830
Why don't you come up to my parlor,
girls, and we'll discuss it?

549
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,910
I live just across the street.

550
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,870
So, the way I work is,

551
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,510
I try to set people up so they can meet casually.

552
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,330
Call it a single's agency.

553
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,210
In most cases, the man
pays me the commission fee,

554
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,950
so you don't have to worry
about any of that.

555
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,950
Is that all there is to it?

556
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,130
It all depends on if you girls
want to just meet people

557
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,020
or make a little money on the side.

558
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,640
- That sounds very provocative.
- Tell us more.

559
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,880
It's a call girl service.

560
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,810
You, of course, get to okay the customers
before agreeing to anything.

561
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,220
And you can make very good money.

562
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,960
Sheila...

563
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,730
she means we would be prostitutes.

564
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,240
I've always wanted to be a prostitute.

565
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,280
It sounds so romantic!

566
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,520
But isn't prostitution morally wrong?

567
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,280
No, Barbi.

568
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,980
Don't you see?

569
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,920
It's part of the sexual revolution.

570
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,980
It's taking advantage of your
newfound sexual freedom.

571
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,590
Everybody's doing it.

572
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,320
I guess I never thought of that before.

573
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,680
I mean, exploring my sexuality.

574
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
It does sound intriguing.

575
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,430
If you don't like it, you
don't have to continue.

576
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,120
I mean, this is what we
were looking for, isn't it?

577
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,240
Some real adventure?

578
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,460
Yes, I guess so.

579
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,940
We have nothing to lose.

580
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,010
Perfect.

581
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,120
I knew you girls would be good sports.

582
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,010
Now:

583
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,420
We have to come up
with some new names for you.

584
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,560
I've always wanted to be called Candy.

585
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,970
Can I be Candy?

586
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,260
Of course!

587
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,660
And you, Barbi?

588
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,490
I want to be called Viva,
which in Italy means "to live."

589
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,960
Because that's what I
want to do now: to live.

590
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,810
In fact, from now on, I’m
going to be a new woman.

591
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,920
I'll never be Barbi again.

592
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Just a moment, girls.

593
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,760
Hello?

594
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,210
Hello, Doctor.

595
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,320
I’m so glad you called.

596
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,590
I'm Dr. Collins.

597
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,140
And you must be a couple of whores!

598
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,120
You two girls look sick!

599
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,920
Very sick.

600
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,250
I think I'm going to have to operate.

601
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,810
Remember all that
rubbish in high school

602
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,080
about the human body
being worth only 97 cents?

603
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,020
Hey, handsome. Buy us a drink?

604
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,520
Look at those muscles.

605
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,520
Come on. Leave me alone.

606
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
I'm not in the mood.

607
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,170
Didn't I see you on the slopes today?

608
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,720
What?

609
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,720
Oh. Yeah.

610
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,720
You go skiing often?

611
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,090
Excuse me.

612
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,320
I'll take a hundred dollars
for my commission.

613
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,500
Good.

614
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,830
Perfect.

615
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,450
Now...

616
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,670
I'll make some phone calls and try
to set you up with your dream-men.

617
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,130
A sensitive guy for Viva...

618
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,360
and a millionaire for Candy.

619
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,260
That coat does a lot for you, dear…

620
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,080
but I'm sure you've done a lot for it.

621
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,000
Right this way.

622
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,610
Your waiter will be right with you.

623
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,180
My dear,

624
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,140
you look like a sweet
little innocent girl.

625
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,130
How old are you, dear?

626
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,480
I'm 29, Mr. Carlisle.

627
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,420
I'm glad you're 29, dear!

628
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,220
I prefer older women.

629
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,190
Bring us some Chateauneuf du Pape,

630
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,770
1956,

631
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,570
and two Waldorf salads.

632
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,050
Yes, sir. Right away.

633
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,500
My dear,

634
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,130
We shall spend a splendid evening

635
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,130
with food and wine.

636
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,900
Yes.

637
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,050
Then we can go shopping for that little
itty-bitty present that you promised me.

638
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,320
You mean the diamond bracelet!

639
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,680
Yes, indeed!

640
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,820
And we'll pick one up at Cartier's!

641
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,490
Oh, my!

642
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,070
- To us!
- To us!

643
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,440
And to Cartier!

644
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,270
Mr. Carlisle, you've been
so generous to me.

645
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,300
But do you know what else
I would like, Mr. Carlisle?

646
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,400
A white horse.

647
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,510
It's been my fantasy all my life

648
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,360
just to ride and ride a white horse.

649
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,480
And you will, my dear, you will.

650
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,170
There's a lot of strength
in this old horse yet!

651
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:07,090
Whatever happens along the way

652
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:14,040
You know I'll always be true

653
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,040
As long as I have diamonds

654
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,440
Sheared mink coats

655
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,640
A white horse and you

656
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:36,320
You may not be so handsome,
young, or strong

657
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:43,200
But we can do each other right

658
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,610
'Cause you'll have me,
and I'll have Saks,

659
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,320
Bloomingdale's,

660
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,640
Cartier, and a fantasy horse so white.

661
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:19,430
And so I sink back in my reverie

662
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:26,700
And dream of things I can't resist

663
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,920
Like diamonds, Halston dresses

664
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,870
Imported Scotch

665
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:42,120
And a white horse in the mist

666
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,370
Hi.

667
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,370
Are you looking for someone?

668
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,360
I was wondering if I have the right address.
I’m here to meet Elmer.

669
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,680
Oh, Elmer's down there.

670
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,910
Thanks.

671
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,390
Hey.

672
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,760
You're gonna have to take
your clothes off.

673
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,410
But I'm just here to meet someone.

674
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,450
Oh, leave her alone.

675
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,270
You can go on down.

676
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,040
Thanks.

677
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,360
Marcuse's Foundation is Freud's principle

678
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,340
that our instincts are founded
in the pleasure principle of Eros,

679
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,340
or libidinal energy.

680
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:54,370
Too often we sublimate this
energy into a work impulse,

681
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:57,260
which is what makes civilization possible.

682
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,720
It's nice to see youngsters showing
an interest in nature.

683
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,180
Are you saying that we should
reject Freud's model

684
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,080
and just be ourselves in the moment?

685
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,640
That's precisely what I'm saying.

686
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,730
Excuse me. Is one of you Elmer?

687
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,730
Elmer? No, man.

688
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,760
Elmer's over there, man.

689
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,400
He's the one with the guitar.

690
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,920
- Oh, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

691
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,530
Fare thee well, fare thee well.

692
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,550
- Hi. Elmer?
- Yeah. Viva?

693
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:40,180
Oh, hi, darlin’.
I’m so glad you came.

694
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,080
Hey, everyone. This is Viva.

695
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,700
Hi.

696
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,320
Uh, we have a rule out here.
No clothing in the garden.

697
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,580
Clothing is strictly forbidden.

698
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,280
I'll take my dress off in a minute.
I just have to get used to the idea.

699
01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:00,050
Isn't it ironic that we need to get used
to existing in our most natural state?

700
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,300
Clothing only constricts us and
sets up arbitrary social codes.

701
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,960
You'll feel much better
if you shed all of that.

702
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:16,040
Oh, just ignore her. I mean,
how uptight can you get?

703
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,160
What a downer!

704
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,200
Live and let live, that's my motto.

705
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,380
Hey, everybody, I'm gonna sing a song.

706
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,600
It's about love.

707
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Love, the power of love

708
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,430
The power of love is the
power to make me love you

709
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,200
Love, the power of love

710
01:02:53,200 --> 01:03:00,860
The power of love makes me
want to get it on with you

711
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,810
Love, it's good for the birds,
it's good for the trees

712
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:10,940
It's good for you and me

713
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:16,960
Love, it's good for all humanity

714
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,210
Da, da da da da da
Da, da da da da da

715
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,560
Da, da da da da da
Da, da da da da da

716
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:38,530
Love, it's good for the birds,
it's good for the trees

717
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:43,830
It's good for you and me

718
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:49,640
Love, it's good for all humanity

719
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:55,880
Da, da da da da da
Da, da da da da da

720
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:20,480
Da, da da da da da
Da, da da da da da

721
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,640
Oh, Elmer, you're so sexy.

722
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,910
Yeah, Elmer. Come on.
Spread the loving around.

723
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:41,080
No, thanks. I got a date with Viva.

724
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,080
Let's split.

725
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,680
So, how'd you get hooked
up with the agency?

726
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,630
I'll be honest with you.
I got in a fight with my husband.

727
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,760
That's when I realized that life
could be so much more,

728
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,310
that I could be having adventures
instead of just staying home

729
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,000
and cooking all the time and
waiting for him to come home.

730
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,430
That's cool. That's very cool.

731
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,120
This whole husband and
wife thing’s a drag, isn't it?

732
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,510
It puts unnecessary
constraints on free love.

733
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,360
I'm so glad you told me how you feel.

734
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,920
I want to know all about you,

735
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,360
about your hopes, your fears,
what you love, what you hate.

736
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,440
I want to reach deep inside
and pull out the real Viva.

737
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,080
But why do you want to know about me?

738
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,350
'Cause I feel a strange attraction to you.

739
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,810
Could it be love? No. It couldn't be.

740
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,920
But yet it is love. Pure love energy.

741
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,910
The most beautiful thing in the world.

742
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,640
Do you feel it, too, Viva?

743
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,720
I don't know.
I’m not sure how I feel.

744
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,250
Oh, baby. I love you so much.

745
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,390
Elmer...

746
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:09,190
I like you, but you're going too fast.

747
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,680
I don't even know you.

748
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,320
What's the matter, baby? I mean,
you came here to get it on with me, right?

749
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,090
So why waste time?

750
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Elmer! Stop it!

751
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,150
I'm sorry, baby.

752
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,240
We'll do whatever you want to do.

753
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,290
There's already enough
conflict in this world -

754
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,520
war and pollution,
hypocrisy and greed.

755
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,370
We have to do whatever we can to
spread love on this planet and not war.

756
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,530
What is it? A cigarette?

757
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,140
Man, baby, are you square.

758
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,240
It's marijuana. Have some.

759
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,480
It's good.

760
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,000
I love to see you smile, Viva.

761
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,450
Your smile is beautiful.
Everything about you is beautiful.

762
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,110
I want to see how beautiful you are.

763
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:13,700
Will you show me?
Come on. Show me your body.

764
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,630
Look. I'm showing you my body.

765
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:18,470
You have no reason to be ashamed.

766
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:20,280
I won't touch you, I promise.

767
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:24,270
Elmer, I can't just take off my clothes.

768
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,560
I’ve only just met you.

769
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,580
What's the big deal, for Christ's sakes?

770
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,160
I mean, they're only clothes!

771
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,780
Don't be such a ninny! I swear!

772
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,130
How's this, Elmer?

773
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,810
Hey, you know what, baby?
You look good in pink.

774
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,560
Relax, baby.
Relax and feel the lovin'.

775
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,540
I'm gonna make you feel real good.

776
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:55,560
I thought I was going to
hate myself this morning, but I don't.

777
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,760
I hate you!

778
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,060
So you see, Mrs. James, it wasn't
what I thought it would be,

779
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,380
so I had to leave.

780
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,240
I thought Elmer would be
the perfect choice.

781
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,440
He's such a sensitive, natural guy.

782
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,280
That's the problem. He's too natural.

783
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,840
Too focused on the physical.

784
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:19,350
You know, Viva,
I’ve got just the man for you.

785
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,790
His name is Clyde, and he's an artist.

786
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,280
Hi. You must be Viva.

787
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,280
Come on in.

788
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,140
Have a seat.

789
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,140
May I offer you a drink?

790
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,140
Yes, thank you.

791
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,990
I did those photos last week
for a magazine spread.

792
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,700
Do you like them?

793
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,350
Yes, they're beautiful.

794
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,870
Who is the model?

795
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,790
I don't remember her name.

796
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:19,680
A professional model.
They're all the same.

797
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,400
She's very pretty.

798
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,120
I would think you would remember her.

799
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,960
It's a job.

800
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,960
The models come and go.

801
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:33,940
This one's pretty, but she doesn’t
have much of a personality.

802
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:36,360
Does personality matter to you, then?

803
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,940
Oh, personality's everything.

804
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:43,360
I mean, what's the point of looking at
a bunch of pictures of vacuous girls?

805
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,110
When I photograph a girl for my artwork,

806
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:49,040
she's got to have...pizazz,

807
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,140
oomph, élan.

808
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:54,780
Did those girls have...élan?

809
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:03,410
You bet your tushy they did, honey.

810
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,680
I like a woman with a good backside.

811
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,240
You can see that.

812
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,280
But if a girl doesn't have personality,

813
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,310
I don't even give her ass
a second look.

814
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,250
You, for example.

815
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,250
You have that extra oomph.

816
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,810
You have star quality.

817
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,320
I saw that the first
moment you walked in.

818
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,990
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

819
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,800
It's written all over you.

820
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:39,360
I knew you were a model or an actress
the moment you walked in that door.

821
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,820
But I'm not a model or an actress.

822
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,320
In fact, I've never modeled before.

823
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Well, that explains it!

824
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,480
That's why you're so natural -

825
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,030
so original.

826
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:59,370
You haven't learned to be all vampy and
cheap like most girls in pictures today.

827
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:05,040
You've got a natural innocence.

828
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,840
It's absolutely fabulous!

829
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,010
Do you like to look at yourself, Viva?

830
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,140
Of course.
What woman doesn't?

831
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,560
I would like to take some pictures of you.

832
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:21,620
Let's see, Viva...arch your back.

833
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,340
Hold it. Hold it.

834
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,040
Perfect.

835
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,160
There. Hold it.
Look at me. Look at me.

836
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:34,170
Tasty. Love it! Love it!

837
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,230
Yes! There! There! Sexy!

838
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,120
Fabulous, Viva! Fabulous! Hold it!

839
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,160
Love it! Love it! Love it! Woo!

840
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,650
I'll have these photos
developed in the morning.

841
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,230
You were a real knockout, Viva.

842
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,950
You think so?

843
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,070
Sure.

844
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,910
What's the matter?

845
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:14,980
Why are you all tense?

846
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,980
Relax.

847
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,500
Clyde - Clyde.

848
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,040
I really like you, but I
don't want to rush things.

849
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,080
I want to be sure, you know?

850
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,520
Look, honey, it's not such a big deal.

851
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,670
We like each other.
We turn each other on.

852
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:33,760
That's all that matters, right?

853
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,950
Clyde - Clyde -

854
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,950
Stop it!

855
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,080
I didn't leave my husband for this.

856
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,950
I'm a liberated woman now.

857
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:46,240
I don't want to be a man's plaything.

858
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,360
I'll let you know when
I want you to touch me.

859
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,510
Until then, we're just friends, okay?

860
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,880
Screwy women's lib!

861
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:03,400
All right. Have it your way.

862
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,040
But when you come to me begging for it,
don't expect me to be there.

863
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,640
Thank you, Clyde. You're sweet.

864
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,590
What do you think?

865
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,620
I need a closer look!

866
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,010
You naughty boy!

867
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,400
Was that my foot?

868
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,960
Anyone have a joint?

869
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,830
I've got one!

870
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,030
Oh, I left Viva alone.

871
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,490
Arthur, come meet a friend of mine.

872
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,880
Viva,

873
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,120
this is my fabulous friend Arthur.

874
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,400
He'll take care of you.

875
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,010
I need to talk to those demanding girls!

876
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:52,100
Ta-ta!

877
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:56,610
Let me introduce myself.

878
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:00,400
Arthur Canter the Second
at your disposal.

879
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,200
Glad to meet you. I'm Viva.

880
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,500
An aspiring model, I assume.

881
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,930
Not quite, but maybe someday.

882
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,790
Where are you from?

883
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:17,560
Judging from your look and your name,
I would say...Tuscany. Am I right?

884
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,310
Yes. My mother was Italian,
and I was born in Rome,

885
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,830
but I've lived here most of my life.

886
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,570
My parents died in a car
accident when I was little,

887
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,120
and I was raised in a
convent in San Jose.

888
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,180
But the nuns sent me away
to a public school when I was 14

889
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:34,180
because they said
they couldn't handle me.

890
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,560
And what about you?
Where are you from?

891
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,020
I'm from Liverpool, child.

892
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,560
I've traveled the wide world
and the seven seas

893
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,640
and done just about everything
that you could possibly think of.

894
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,530
Right now I'm amusing myself

895
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,660
directing a local production
of the hit show “Oh, Baby.”

896
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:50,930
Heard of it?

897
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:54,180
Of course. Isn't that the one
where no one wears any clothes?

898
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,120
Exactly!

899
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:59,040
It's new, it's fresh, it's alive!
It reflects the spirit of the age!

900
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,060
Why don't you audition for it?

901
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,040
For a nude musical?
I don't know.

902
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,560
I would love to be in a musical,
but I would prefer to keep my clothes on.

903
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,240
By why not nude?
I mean, why not?

904
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:15,120
You have nothing to hide.
You're beautiful.

905
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,420
I'll second that.

906
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,420
What?

907
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,560
Nothing, honey.
Why don't you come into the tub?

908
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,280
What do you think?
Should we get into the tub?

909
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,280
It's nice and warm in here.

910
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,450
It does seem warm. Very warm.

911
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:34,440
I think I'll leave you two lovebirds to it.

912
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,720
Just don't do anything
that I wouldn't do.

913
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,100
Crystal? Don't put that ass away!

914
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,320
What's your name, beautiful?

915
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,250
They call me Viva.

916
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,210
Viva. Meow! That's a
pretty sexy name.

917
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,160
I'm Agnes.

918
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,190
Glad to meet you, Agnes.

919
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,000
You're new around here, aren't you?

920
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,640
I've never seen you at any
of Clyde's parties before.

921
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,700
Yes, this is my first party.

922
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,880
Well, don't get taken in by all of the promises,

923
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,340
that's all I have to say.

924
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,520
Clyde and his friends, they talk big,

925
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,740
but you won't necessarily get
famous hanging around here.

926
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,490
But if you like to party,
I guess that's okay.

927
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:23,130
Just don't get hurt.

928
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,730
I can take care of myself.

929
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:25,130
That's good.
I can take care of myself.

930
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,200
That's good.

931
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:31,050
Because you look like someone
who needs taking care of...

932
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:34,550
by someone who knows how.

933
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,990
Hey, Viva!

934
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,530
Okay.

935
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,840
Oh. Hello, Arthur.

936
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,560
Clyde isn't here.
He's gone to the country.

937
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,200
Yes, I know.

938
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,920
Do you mind if I come in?

939
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,860
Can I get myself a drink?

940
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,270
Go ahead.

941
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,120
What's that you're reading?

942
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,330
Nothing.

943
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,990
“The Sensuous Woman?”

944
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:50,930
Why, Viva, you are spending
altogether too much time alone.

945
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:52,510
What do you mean?

946
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,230
You're burning up with lust.
I can see that.

947
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:01,240
You spend all day thinking
about nothing but sex,

948
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,130
and yet you're living with a man,
and you don't let him touch you.

949
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:05,640
Why?

950
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,850
Let me make love to you.

951
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:11,610
I can make you happy.

952
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:13,560
No strings attached.

953
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,920
Just pure animal lust.

954
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,480
Just you and me.

955
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,690
Your body and my body,

956
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,640
right here and right now.

957
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,560
Oh, Viva!
You really turn me on!

958
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,100
God, you're fantastic.

959
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,030
Don't hold back!

960
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:46,200
Give me everything!

961
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,480
You know, Chris, I just can't
get Sheila out of my mind.

962
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,950
Do you think I should call her?

963
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,850
No way. Let her come
crawling back to you.

964
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,440
Show her who's boss.

965
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,530
Yes, I guess you're right.

966
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,690
But it sure is lonely
without any women around.

967
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:26,000
Are you kidding?

968
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,580
That's the whole point
about being a bachelor.

969
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:30,640
There are always women around.

970
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,160
You're right.

971
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,820
Why be miserable because of one woman

972
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,360
when there are tons of chicks
who can't wait to get into my pants?

973
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,310
- To the bachelor's life!
- To the bachelor's life!

974
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,110
Go and see who that is, will you?

975
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,620
Hi. I'm Kelly.

976
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,870
I just moved in next door.

977
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:04,200
These walls,
they're as thin as paper,

978
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,590
and I couldn't help but overhear
you two lonely guys talking.

979
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,000
May I come in?

980
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,080
Sure.

981
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,480
I'm Mark, and this is my brother Chris.

982
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,390
Pleased to meet you.

983
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,680
And what's this you're drinking?
Champagne.

984
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,330
Yes. Please, have a glass.

985
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,140
Don't mind if I do.

986
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,240
Listen, are you two gentlemen into acting?

987
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,680
Not me, but my brother Mark here

988
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,140
does it for a living.

989
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,960
Super-duper!

990
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,320
You should come to the audition for
the new musical "Oh Baby" tomorrow.

991
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,830
It'll be a real kick.

992
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,390
Are you going to be there?

993
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:47,440
Sure. I go to all the auditions.

994
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,770
Will you read with me?

995
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,730
Well, it's not a reading,
it's a musical.

996
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:54,390
So you'll need to prepare a song.

997
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:59,200
Then...let's prepare a song!

998
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,830
But I'm a little slow at learning songs.
We could be here all night.

999
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:06,830
Shame, shame!

1000
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,690
Hey, what about that song?

1001
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,690
Later!

1002
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:15,690
More champagne?

1003
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,060
There has never been
a better time to be a man.

1004
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,900
The willing women.

1005
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,450
The dandy clothes.

1006
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,900
The frills.

1007
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,900
The big rings and jewelry.

1008
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,660
The open shirts.

1009
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,760
The sense of entitlement.

1010
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:32,750
Take it from me:

1011
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,750
Savor this time,

1012
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,950
for it will soon be gone,

1013
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,900
never to return.

1014
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,000
Great, kids, great.
That's much better.

1015
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,370
Now for the song.

1016
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,450
Next singer, please.

1017
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,570
Your name?

1018
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:59,920
Mark Campbell.

1019
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,360
Ah! Mark Campbell,
the television star.

1020
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,300
Yes, I've seen your work.
It's very...television.

1021
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,360
Glad you're breaking out, Mark.

1022
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,910
Girls, stay with him.
Help him out. Make him feel good.

1023
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,190
Randy, we're doing
”You've Got To Love Yourself."

1024
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:21,060
What key?

1025
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,610
E flat.

1026
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,610
You got it, baby.

1027
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:32,160
If it feels like your bag

1028
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,850
Then wear it on your shoulder

1029
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,630
If it comes to you naturally

1030
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:42,930
Embrace it, face it

1031
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,610
Don't you want to feel proud

1032
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,230
that you're an individual?

1033
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:51,070
Wave your freak flag high

1034
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:53,070
and smile, oh, yeah

1035
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:56,080
You've got to love yourself

1036
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,430
Love your body, love your mind

1037
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:01,160
I'm thinking of myself,

1038
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,980
and I'm diggin' who I am

1039
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:08,900
I look in the mirror,
and I know I'm not perfect

1040
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:16,460
But I'm all I've got
so I've got to love me

1041
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,480
If it makes you feel good,

1042
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,030
then spread it all around you

1043
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,810
If it makes you feel bad

1044
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,810
Then deal with it, get with it

1045
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:29,990
Don't you want to feel groovy,

1046
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,210
weird, topsy-turvy?

1047
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,730
Paint a colorful world

1048
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,880
with your fingers, oh, yeah

1049
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,930
You've got to love yourself

1050
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:42,280
Love your body, love your mind

1051
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,980
I'm thinking of myself,

1052
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,800
and I'm diggin' who I am

1053
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:52,840
I look in the mirror,
and I know I'm not perfect

1054
01:25:52,860 --> 01:26:00,600
But I'm all I've got,
so I've got to love me

1055
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,440
I've got to love me,

1056
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:10,000
Love me!

1057
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,960
That was wonderful.

1058
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,260
Take a break, but don't go far.

1059
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,260
Now, the pollution number.

1060
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,000
Let's chop down another tree

1061
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:29,100
Much less air for you and me

1062
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,060
Let's put up a refinery.

1063
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,970
Who cares?

1064
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,280
Concrete paving is hard to eat...

1065
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:41,770
Acting isn't really my bag.

1066
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:44,560
But I sure go in for the auditions.

1067
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,000
Hey, Clyde's hosting an orgy
next weekend.

1068
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,710
It's going to be wild.

1069
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:54,390
It's a costume ball, too,
and you're all invited.

1070
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:56,840
Thanks. I'll be there.

1071
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:00,040
If Sheila could see me now.

1072
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:03,480
She's probably sitting at home right now
feeling sorry for herself,

1073
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,310
while I get invited to an orgy!

1074
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,720
Voila!

1075
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:20,660
What do you think?
V is for Viva.

1076
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:32,040
And C is also for Clyde...

1077
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,730
And for cocktail.

1078
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,450
And mine is dry.

1079
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:50,080
And V is also for vixen.

1080
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,790
And for voluptuous.

1081
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,880
And for virgin.

1082
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:01,820
A word I'm sure you're
quite unfamiliar with.

1083
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,940
Except with me.

1084
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,850
Now, why is that, Viva?

1085
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,520
Give me some time.

1086
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,800
After all, Rome wasn't built in a day.

1087
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,570
You're impossible.

1088
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,810
You're a devil!

1089
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:23,000
Shoo! Shoo!
Off! Off my sculpture!

1090
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:27,960
The only thing that matters is art.

1091
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,670
I will plunge myself in my art

1092
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,740
and forget all about you.

1093
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,440
And for this one, my dear Viva,

1094
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:47,500
you weren't even the inspiration.

1095
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:52,270
Agnes! Get your ass in here!

1096
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,310
I'm sick of showing you my ass.
Finish it from memory.

1097
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,960
Why doesn't anyone want
to cooperate around here?

1098
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,240
What's wrong with you two anyway?

1099
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,560
Hello?

1100
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,960
Oh, hi, it's you.

1101
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:19,410
Okay, I'll be right over.

1102
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,450
But I have to tell you…
I’m not pleased.

1103
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
Here you go, Mrs. James.

1104
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,080
Where's the rest of it?

1105
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,860
I'm not paying any more.
That's all she's worth.

1106
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,420
Well, what's the problem?

1107
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,490
I can't wait forever.

1108
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,560
I mean, the girl wants to be my friend.

1109
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:51,230
But honestly, who wants
to be friends with a girl?

1110
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:55,410
If she doesn't put out this weekend,
I’m going to have to move on.

1111
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,410
You know what I mean?

1112
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,560
Have you tried drugs?

1113
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,620
Drugs?

1114
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,660
No.

1115
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:05,330
I mean, I don't want to be
the Big Bad Wolf.

1116
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,440
No, wait.

1117
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,520
What am I saying?

1118
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:11,620
I should try drugs.

1119
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:15,170
Try these on her tonight.

1120
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:18,760
It will completely
release her inhibitions

1121
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,910
and then put her in a total trance state.

1122
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:25,170
Right.

1123
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,170
I've heard of this.

1124
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,220
All right, I'll try it.

1125
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,040
Thanks, Mrs. J.

1126
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,340
So this is where the
better set congregate.

1127
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,340
Interesting.

1128
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Luscious. Luscious.

1129
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,390
You want to know what?
You really turn me on.

1130
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:22,980
I turn you on?
I turn everybody on!

1131
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:47,720
Looks like you're dry, Viva.

1132
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:48,960
Here's another.

1133
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,170
Thanks.

1134
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,560
Hi, lover.

1135
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,430
Winston tastes good
like a cigarette should.

1136
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,880
You mean "as a cigarette should."

1137
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,800
What do you want,
grammar or good taste?

1138
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,920
Murray, peel me a grape.

1139
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,290
Who do you think you are? Garbo?

1140
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:21,300
That was Mae West, you ass!

1141
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:37,380
Agnes, my Amazon beauty,
come talk to me.

1142
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,860
So what do you think of the party?

1143
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,470
It has potential.

1144
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:45,760
Yes. I do have the best parties,
but that's because I work at them.

1145
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,910
Champagne, caviar,
the best pot and liqueur.

1146
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:51,120
You must try this new
Swedish vodka.

1147
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:55,270
It's the most pleasurable idea
from Scandinavia since the blonde!

1148
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,980
It's true that money
can't buy you love,

1149
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:04,810
but it sure can get you
a bunch of willing sex slaves!

1150
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:08,730
I wonder. At least one of your sex slaves
doesn't seem to be cooperating.

1151
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,250
Oh. Yes, that one. She is difficult,

1152
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,750
and none too discriminating, I hear.

1153
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,120
But her taste is about to improve.

1154
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,820
Far away, there is a drum

1155
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:07,030
I can hear it go thrum-thrum-thrum

1156
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:10,410
It echoes the beating of my heart

1157
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,690
I want to dance until the
deep, deep throbbing starts

1158
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,210
She's hot.

1159
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:20,090
Now, look, little missy,
Viva is mine tonight.

1160
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:24,150
If you so much as lay a finger
on her, I’ll crush you.

1161
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,330
Understand?

1162
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,880
Oh, my heart aches

1163
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:34,050
Oh, I want you to take me now

1164
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:45,520
While the evening is ripe
and full and heavy like a luscious fruit

1165
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,190
Do with me what you will

1166
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:52,900
Do it all

1167
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:57,560
I can't stop myself from throbbing

1168
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,820
Like a tender shoot

1169
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:03,690
Like a rosebud unfolding

1170
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:07,520
Like a Venus flytrap of love

1171
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,570
Holding you

1172
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,320
Also throbbing

1173
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,710
In my thrall

1174
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,970
Stop looking over there, lover boy.

1175
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:23,060
The action's over here, remember?

1176
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:25,130
Hey, isn't that Rick's wife?

1177
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:27,130
What's her name? Barbi?

1178
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:28,780
Yeah. Barbi.

1179
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,400
All laid out and ready for a feast.

1180
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,460
I could eat her alive.

1181
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,390
Eat me alive!

1182
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:49,970
Oh, my heart aches

1183
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:53,310
Oh, I want you to take me now

1184
01:37:57,190 --> 01:38:05,490
While the evening is ripe
and full and heavy like a luscious fruit

1185
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,370
Do with me what you will

1186
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:12,520
Do it all

1187
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:17,200
I can't stop myself from throbbing

1188
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,020
Like a tender shoot

1189
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,630
Like a rosebud unfolding

1190
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:27,200
Like a Venus flytrap of love

1191
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,080
Holding you

1192
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,080
Also throbbing

1193
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,600
In my thrall!

1194
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,920
Barbi!

1195
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,680
Mark!

1196
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,590
Barbi!

1197
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,400
No. Don't touch her.

1198
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,050
It's very dangerous.

1199
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,340
I'm the only one that knows what to do.

1200
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,490
Everyone, go back to
what you were doing.

1201
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,110
Oh, Viva.

1202
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:04,100
Hello?

1203
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,190
Hi. Viva?

1204
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:09,910
Just wanted to see how you made it home
from the orgy the other day.

1205
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:12,450
Hello? Hello?

1206
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:14,980
Viva? Is that you?

1207
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,420
So you see, Sheila, that's everything.

1208
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,160
You can see why
I feel strange about it.

1209
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,350
It's as if I became a different person.

1210
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:42,440
I really became this Viva,

1211
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,280
this sex goddess.

1212
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,530
And they all worshipped
me and wanted me.

1213
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:50,610
I became...how can I tell you?

1214
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:54,620
Totally a woman, and I liked it.

1215
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,150
But it was too much.

1216
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:59,390
I saw a side of myself that was
probably better kept hidden,

1217
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,880
a side that frightened me.

1218
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:03,440
It was so powerful.

1219
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,600
I became a female animal,
made only for pleasure.

1220
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,960
Do you know what I mean?

1221
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,260
Well, not exactly.

1222
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,730
What you're describing
sounds kind of dark.

1223
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:17,620
But I don't see what's so scary
about living for pleasure.

1224
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:19,520
I've done it all my life.

1225
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,320
I love to have a good time!

1226
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,930
But I think I'm finally done
with the wild life forever.

1227
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:30,350
Barbi, I have the greatest news.

1228
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,350
Mark and I are going to have a baby!

1229
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:34,130
But are you sure it's Mark's?

1230
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,690
Of course.

1231
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:40,660
Oh Barbi, you don't think I actually slept with
any of those guys at the agency, do you?

1232
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:45,620
Mark and I have
patched everything up.

1233
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:49,090
He came home as soon
as he heard about the baby.

1234
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:52,450
I've never been so happy in all my life.

1235
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:55,880
I mean, I sowed my
wild oats, and it was fun,

1236
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:59,970
but now I realize that all I ever really
wanted was Mark and this baby.

1237
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:04,510
I sold the diamond bracelet and the fur coat
I got from dear old Mr. Carlisle

1238
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:07,040
and put the money into
a trust fund for the baby.

1239
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,360
Oh, but we kept the horse.

1240
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:12,460
Isn't he cute?

1241
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,430
Barbi, don't look so shocked.

1242
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:19,870
Mark and I tell each other
everything, don't we, honey?

1243
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,890
And you thought I was bad.

1244
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,500
He went to an orgy!

1245
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,320
What's the matter, Barbi?

1246
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,230
Never been to an orgy before?

1247
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:34,240
So, what about you?

1248
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,040
What are you going to do now?

1249
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,500
I'm quitting the wild life, too.

1250
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,500
I’ve had enough.

1251
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,710
I envy you, Sheila.

1252
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:44,260
You look so happy.

1253
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:46,250
And I miss Rick.

1254
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,130
Don't worry, Barbi. He'll come back.

1255
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,360
I just know it.

1256
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,130
I hope so.

1257
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,730
Why don't you just give up on her?
She's not worth it.

1258
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,240
Something's not right.

1259
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,240
I need to go home.

1260
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,760
Telegram for Mrs. Rick Smith.

1261
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,150
Is that you?

1262
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:14,510
Yes.

1263
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,550
Oh, Rick! Rick!

1264
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Oh, Rick. Why don't you
ever use your key?

1265
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,370
Mark!

1266
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:52,130
I came over here because
I wanted to see you dance.

1267
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:55,840
Dance for me, Viva!

1268
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,140
Dance!

1269
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:02,350
Mark, you're drunk.

1270
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:04,800
I'm drunk.

1271
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:09,240
But not too drunk to...

1272
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,480
Always the shy little flower, huh?

1273
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,480
You certainly had me fooled.

1274
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,960
You're not just dirty, Barbi,

1275
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,040
you're abnormal.

1276
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,100
What are you talking about?

1277
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:33,000
Clyde told me all about you,

1278
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
and what you and Agnes did.

1279
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,560
You're not only a whore,
you're a filthy lesbian!

1280
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:42,130
Please leave, Mark.

1281
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:44,530
You're not yourself.
You don't know what you're saying.

1282
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,600
I don't, huh?

1283
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:49,250
Well...

1284
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:53,920
just because I'm going to be a father
doesn't mean I'm henpecked yet.

1285
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:59,110
I'm gonna teach you how to obey
a real man for a change.

1286
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:00,960
Mark! No!

1287
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,960
You little whore!

1288
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,250
You've had this coming for a long time!

1289
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:14,080
Barbi. I'm sorry.

1290
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,080
Please forgive me.

1291
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,240
Did I hurt you?

1292
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,840
No, I'm okay. But please go.

1293
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,760
Don't tell Sheila about this.

1294
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,850
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

1295
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:27,920
But go!

1296
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,440
Rick is coming home, and if he finds
you here, everything will be ruined!

1297
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:59,440
Barbi, I'm home!

1298
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,840
Rick!

1299
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:08,560
What's that scent?

1300
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,640
I recognize it.

1301
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,140
It's my perfume.

1302
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:15,660
No, it's not. It's...

1303
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,120
Mark's been here!

1304
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,240
I'd recognize that cologne anywhere.

1305
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,500
And his scent, it's all over you!

1306
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:25,880
Yes. Mark and Sheila came
to visit, but they're gone now.

1307
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,740
Oh, honey, it's so great to see you.

1308
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,710
Why is your negligee all rumpled
and your hair all disheveled?

1309
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:38,370
Mark's tie?

1310
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:41,840
Barbi, this is the last straw!

1311
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,240
No. I cannot forgive you for this.

1312
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,760
It's definitely over, Barbi!

1313
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,250
Rick! It's not what you think it is!

1314
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,710
You've got to listen!

1315
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,710
RIck!

1316
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,870
So, how's everything going?

1317
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:23,500
Not bad. I'm back on a TV show,

1318
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:27,290
so I'm keeping pretty busy
and staying out of trouble

1319
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,490
It's difficult, but I'm going to be a father now,
so I'm changing my ways.

1320
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:31,490
How about you?

1321
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:34,560
Things are going pretty good.
I can't complain.

1322
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,940
Barbi and I are taking a vacation next month,

1323
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,200
to the Riviera.

1324
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:41,280
Kinda like a second honeymoon.

1325
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:44,020
I've been spending
a lot more time at home lately.

1326
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,430
I'll tell you what -

1327
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:47,520
I kinda like it.

1328
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,630
Hey, Rick, I've got something for you.

1329
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:51,630
Hold on a minute.

1330
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,340
Go on. Open it.

1331
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,400
Wow. What is it?

1332
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,480
It's an antique wooden duck.

1333
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,260
I thought you and Barbi
would get a kick out of it.

1334
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:16,430
You know, a little bit of the old country,
and a touch of European class.

1335
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:18,520
Hey, I think you're right.

1336
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:21,230
I think it'll look great
up on our mantelpiece.

1337
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,710
Thanks, Mark.

1338
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,490
Don't mention it.

1339
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:31,550
Come on, everybody.

1340
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,580
You have to try my new crab canapé.

1341
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:36,170
I got the recipe from Playboy magazine.

1342
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,930
Sheila, are you still reading that?

1343
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:40,030
Of course.

1344
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:43,290
Where else would I get such
a fantastic gourmet recipe?

1345
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:46,240
You have to give me the recipe
so I can make it for Rick.

1346
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,830
You see? He loves it.

1347
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,430
Hello?

1348
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:21,790
Hello, Viva. It's me, Arthur.
How you doing, doll?

1349
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:23,720
Listen, sweetheart.

1350
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,790
I have a role for you.

1351
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:29,010
I've been putting it together in my head
ever since I saw you sing at the orgy.

1352
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:33,190
It's a new musical,
with a blonde and a brunette.

1353
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:34,420
Kind of partners-in-crime.

1354
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:37,510
And you don't have
to take your clothes off.

1355
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:39,720
People are bored to death with nudity.

1356
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,640
I need to give them something different,
and I'm going to give it to them.

1357
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,240
Showgirl costumes, sequins, vaudeville!

1358
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,300
A return to the Busby Berkeley
musicals of yesteryear

1359
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,400
with just a nod to Jacques Démy.

1360
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:54,240
Listen, come down to the theater
and I’ll tell you all about it.

1361
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:57,650
And if you've got a pretty
blonde friend, gbring her along.

1362
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:01,820
This is going to be the freshest
thing since Liberace!

1363
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:03,820
What do you say?

1364
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:12,170
I'll be right down.

1365
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:26,000
Rick, honey, I've been offered a job.

1366
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,960
That's fantastic, honey. What is it?

1367
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,960
It's an acting job.
It's what I've always wanted.

1368
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:35,340
I'm going to the theater now
to meet with the manager.

1369
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,650
Will you be back in
time to cook dinner?

1370
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:40,720
Of course.

1371
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,950
Oh, there, baby.

1372
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:55,950
All right.

1373
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,750
Now you get to see Mommy
become a big star!

1374
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,360
This is your chance, girls.

1375
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:03,360
Give it everything you've got!

1376
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:07,280
Take good care of him.

1377
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:23,000
We're just two girls
who have seen it all

1378
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,100
Things haven't always gone
the way we planned

1379
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:30,330
We've gotten into some
serious trouble

1380
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:33,940
But trouble be damned!

1381
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:39,600
We're just two little girls
from the suburbs

1382
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,250
But we can be lovers

1383
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,880
Mothers

1384
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,430
Singers

1385
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:46,880
Swingers

1386
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,290
Friends

1387
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:54,020
It all depends on your point of view

1388
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,860
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

1389
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:01,000
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo!

1390
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,200
We can be what we want to be

1391
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,720
We can be free

1392
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:10,490
We can have it all
We're having a ball

1393
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:15,160
We've come a long way, baby

1394
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:18,080
Let's drink to life!

1395
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,230
Vive la vie,

1396
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:24,330
Viva la vita

1397
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:29,890
Hey,

1398
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:39,880
We've arrived!
