1
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:59,944
Tonight, all eyes
are on the moon

2
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,079
as scientists
around the world
are piecing together

3
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,522
the causes
of this unprecedented
lunar phenomenon.

4
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:09,186
We're here on the campus
of Plymouth Institute
of T echnology

5
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:13,220
to speak with
staff astrophysicist,
Dr. Lana Gale.

6
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,563
Doctor, what
can you tell us?

7
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,501
Well, basically,
we've been blindsided.

8
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,597
The orbit of an undetected
asteroid has intersected
with the Moon's orbit

9
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,506
and the two
have collided.

10
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,976
While we would like
to think that we would see
something like this coming,

11
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,537
the sky is a vast place,
and unfortunately,

12
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,140
we don't have all
the resources that
we need to fully cover it.

13
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:36,017
And what can you tell us
of what we're seeing
up there?

14
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,919
What we're seeing
is an impact cloud

15
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,424
of debris
and regolith that
will eventually subside.

16
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,982
Regolith?

17
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,495
The powdery rock covering
the lunar surface.

18
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:47,532
So I guess
the more urgent
question would be

19
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,430
is there
any cause
for alarm?

20
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,264
These things are
always more alarming

21
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,827
when they happen
so close to home

22
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,032
but the best approach
is to wait and see
what happens.

23
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,540
React to what develops.

24
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,202
As my father used to say,
Dr. Lawrence Gale,

25
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:02,338
"The universe is a case
of unfinished business. "

26
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:04,609
Thank you very much
for your time, Dr. Gale.

27
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,877
My pleasure.

28
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,282
How was
it, Tony?

29
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,378
You were awesome!

30
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,720
You exuded confidence
and clarity
and strength,

31
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,625
and knowledge,
and expertise,
and--but, regolith?

32
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,253
That's what
it's called.

33
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,820
I know that,

34
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:23,061
but the average viewer
isn't that knowledgeable.

35
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,933
Did you eat anything?
'Cause I kinda
skipped dinner.

36
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,405
I'm sorry T ony,
please go home.

37
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,271
I'll see you
in the morning.

38
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,606
No. I'll pick us
up something;
we'll eat it here.

39
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:37,638
We'll celebrate.
My treat. Tuna salad,
no mayo, heavy Dijon.

40
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,481
Thank you.

41
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,614
Dr. Bender.
Can you tell us

42
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,123
whether the collision
on the moon poses
any danger here on earth?

43
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,058
Well, for obvious reasons
it's premature to launch

44
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,254
into any kind
of conjecture
at this time.

45
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,197
What I can say is that
we at ASI are assuming
the leadership role

46
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:05,202
in interpreting incoming data
gathered by the international
scientific community.

47
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,138
ASI is the definitive space
agency in the world today,

48
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,473
and we have our absolute
best people analyzing
this phenomenon.

49
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,377
Very shortly we'll, uh,
we'll be presenting
our analysis

50
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,473
to the White House,
where a press conference
will follow.

51
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,381
One more question,

52
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,682
what would happen
if a similar asteroid
were to hit the earth?

53
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,279
Depending on speed
and trajectory,

54
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,087
there would be
global repercussions.

55
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,665
Garth? Dr. Lana Gale
is on line two for you.

56
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,461
Yeah, I got
it. Thanks.

57
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,102
Lana? Thanks
for calling.

58
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,071
Have you seen
the latest?

59
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,439
I'm probably not as up
to date as you are.
What's going on?

60
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,412
Our information
on the halo
is a--concern.

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,311
What kind
of a concern?

62
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,850
Preliminary data shows
some of the asteroid fragments

63
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,376
on a course
that will bring them
into earth's orbit.

64
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,985
Hey, John.

65
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,791
You weren't
on the Moon
last night, were you?

66
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:09,231
Hey, John?
All that dust and
debris floating around,

67
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,565
it kinda looks
like your handiwork.

68
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,334
If I was up on the moon
last night doing my work?

69
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,136
It wouldn't be
there anymore.

70
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,234
Copy that.

71
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,278
Checklist.

72
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,334
Good to go?

73
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,380
Yep.

74
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,812
Let's blow
the building.

75
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,145
All right, Ollie,
how we looking?

76
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,585
Locked and
stocked, buddy.

77
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,852
Check it out.

78
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,052
Good. Right
on schedule.

79
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,493
Looks like you're
gonna owe me
20 bucks, homie.

80
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,461
I shake on that?

81
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,997
Oh, yeah.

82
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,726
Well, the building
ain't down yet.

83
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,469
Oh my God.

84
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,772
Abort right now.
Let's go. We gotta
stop the sequence.

85
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,044
Bryna, shut it
down now.

86
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,019
No, the system's
not responding.

87
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,078
Ollie?

88
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,818
I'm trying
to override it.

89
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,595
Okay, let's
have some fun.

90
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,295
What are
you doing?

91
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,698
Bryna.
Continue to rebalance
the sequence.

92
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,828
I'm gonna go
find that misfire.
Talk to me on the radio.

93
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,372
You can't
go up there!

94
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,931
We don't know how
that building's gonna
come down

95
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,977
unless we rebalance
the system. Ollie?

96
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,013
Figure out why that
clock is still ticking
and shut it down.

97
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,139
I'm on it.

98
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:31,204
I'll be back.

99
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,538
Okay, Bryna, give me
the location of that misfire.

100
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,342
Ninth floor.
8A.

101
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:06,009
OK, copy that! Ollie?
Have you stopped
the countdown?

102
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:09,178
John, the explosion
messed up
the whole system.

103
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,846
It's lit up like
the Vegas strip.

104
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,913
I'm tryin' to stop
the detonator but
it ain't happenin'.

105
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,721
I know you've got
my back, Ollie.
So make it happen!

106
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:20,959
Everything I'm seeing here
says that the charges did
not go off on their own.

107
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,762
I think someone's
in there.

108
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,598
Great. That's all we need.
Let's get the cops,
tell 'em what we got.

109
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,163
If someone's still in there
who might keep
settin' things off,

110
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,004
you won't have enough
time to fix it all.

111
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:36,412
No! I'll have plenty of time.
Cause you're gonna fix
that damn clock!

112
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:45,420
Hey! It stopped!

113
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,957
How we doin'
for time?!

114
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,926
There's no rush anymore.
The countdown stopped.

115
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,099
What? No!

116
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,735
That was the 5-minute warning.
That means that clock
is not off!

117
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,780
I'm gonna have to reboot
the whole system.

118
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,212
John, where
are you?

119
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,547
I'm on the 9th floor now.
Do I go left or right?

120
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:18,984
Left.
No, right!
My left, your right!

121
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,753
Come on, Bryna.
Focus, okay?

122
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,886
I'm coming up on
a large central room.

123
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,362
In the middle
of that room,
you'll find column 8A.

124
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,921
Hold on,
I think
I got it.

125
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,399
That's the one
that's missing
its charge.

126
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,274
C'mon, c'mon!

127
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,979
Aaaah!

128
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,488
Help!

129
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:55,219
Hey, Joe?
Double-check lines
21A thru F.

130
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,624
Okay.

131
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,094
Are they
still hot?

132
00:09:58,163 --> 00:09:58,993
Yep, they're hot.

133
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,361
Dammit.

134
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,663
Help!
Help me!

135
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,100
I'm coming!

136
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,874
Okay!
Looks good!

137
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,379
You're online and set
to go, now get
out of there!

138
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,437
Hello?

139
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,176
Help!

140
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,947
We're gonna get
you out of here.

141
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,979
I got a guy up here.
He's pinned down
by some debris.

142
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,547
I gotta get him out.

143
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,890
On three, I'm gonna
lift this up, pull
your leg out.

144
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,485
One, two, three.

145
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,160
Get out
of my house!

146
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,830
Hold on!
Stop!

147
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,066
This is
my house!

148
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,732
I'm trying
to help you.

149
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,299
Now listen to me.

150
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:48,505
Your house is about
to get blown
to bits, understand?

151
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,811
John, just get out
of there, please.

152
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,010
I'll be down
in 90 seconds.

153
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,546
Come on!

154
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,659
Less than
a minute left!

155
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,030
I've jacked the override
into your system.

156
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,591
See if you can
get access.

157
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,431
Watch out!

158
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,572
Come on!
You almost got it.

159
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:23,773
Go, go, go!

160
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:26,851
Come on!

161
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,348
John, you gotta get
outta there! Move it!

162
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,758
John, move now!

163
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,522
Go, go, go!

164
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,628
Oh my God!

165
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,750
We now have
three reported strikes

166
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,885
of asteroid debris,
and they're not
ordinary meteors, Lana.

167
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,519
We're missing something.

168
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,292
Why are so many of them
surviving atmospheric entry?

169
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,958
These objects
aren't that big.

170
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,399
They should be
burning up.

171
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,460
Then it's gotta be
the density.

172
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,736
The mass of the asteroid
must have been much bigger
than we anticipated.

173
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,571
But it makes sense.

174
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,169
Because you were right
about the ecliptic plane.

175
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,111
The lunar
orbit's shifted?

176
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,513
The numbers indicate
a very gradual shift.

177
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,176
And it could still
self-correct but

178
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,981
there's already a rise
in the sea levels

179
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,454
and the jet stream is taking
a complete nose dive south.

180
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,117
Which means a big
weather change.

181
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,356
Yeah, the kind
that triggers
an ice age.

182
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:50,162
Okay, have we located
the point of impact?

183
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:51,702
No, nothing
we can see.

184
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,260
But we've got
satellites in motion.

185
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:54,635
We should get
images soon.

186
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,072
Hey, Will,
how long before
we get a look?

187
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,133
The probes
are on their way.

188
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,575
I'm in my
office now.

189
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,237
Did you copy
Garth on this?

190
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,283
You should have
a spectral image
coming through.

191
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,817
Yeah, yeah,
I've got it.

192
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,649
Get your folks
to work on
that dark section.

193
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,622
We're having a hard time
seeing through the halo.

194
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,124
No problem.
Hey, Will,

195
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,285
take a look
at this area.
Get on that.

196
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:21,696
I hope you're not
sugar-coating this
to the suits in DC.

197
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:25,327
No, but that's why
I'd like you here.

198
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,030
They're gonna want
solid answers.

199
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,471
Which they'd rather
hear from someone else.

200
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,169
Nobody's gunning
for you here, Lana.

201
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:36,145
I was actually thinking
more of--knives.

202
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,910
Can we set aside
the past?

203
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,713
I need you.

204
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,310
You'll run
interference for me?

205
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:44,878
All I can.

206
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,885
Okay.

207
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,326
I owe you one.
I'll arrange a flight.

208
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,660
See you soon, Lana.

209
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,730
Remember when I said
I'd never go back to ASl?

210
00:13:58,803 --> 00:13:59,792
I lied.

211
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,064
Wanna beer?

212
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,200
Cheers!

213
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,335
Hey, next time,

214
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,609
try not to scare
the crap out of us.
That's all I'm sayin'.

215
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:11,876
Copy that.

216
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,748
So the deal with
the homeless guy was

217
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,754
this was his home and
he was just trying
to defend it.

218
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,086
So I guess
I can't blame him.

219
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,285
You're lucky
you got outta there.
You know that?

220
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,918
You almost died.

221
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,964
Yeah, but I didn't.
And the building
came down perfectly.

222
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,057
So, on to
the next one.

223
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,466
On to the next?
John.

224
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,437
You're not really
gonna bust my chops
right now, are ya?

225
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,465
Seeing as you
almost got crushed,
now is a perfect time.

226
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,103
You can't let
your work
own your life.

227
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,942
And yours does.

228
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,504
Come on,
take that vacation.

229
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,072
We don't have
anything coming up.

230
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:50,611
Well, actually,
we do have a demo
possibly in Florida.

231
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,954
OK, that's it.
I'm outta here.

232
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,552
Where you going?
Come on, don't go,
we're celebrating!

233
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,826
Hey. I almost
died today.

234
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,465
It's not funny
anymore, John.

235
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:09,564
She died three years ago.
You need to take
some time off.

236
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,632
Your wife's gone, John.

237
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,270
She'd want you
to have a life
where things

238
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:17,041
grow and thrive
and not just crumble.

239
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,711
Don't do that
to yourself.

240
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:26,351
G'nite.

241
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:34,024
Hey.
Twenty bucks.

242
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,657
Man, you gonna
hold me to that?

243
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,998
Oh, yeah.
Cough it up.
Let's go.

244
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,503
Buddy, buddy,
buddy.

245
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,596
Don't give me
any lip.

246
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,436
You want
my firstborn, too?

247
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,169
Nope. That
wasn't the bet.

248
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,870
See ya later.

249
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,173
I'll see ya later.

250
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,093
Look alive,
everyone.

251
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,136
Lunar SAT 1 is on course
for the outer edge
of the debris field.

252
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:15,036
We've got some delicate
maneuvering ahead.

253
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,404
Telemetry?
What's your status?

254
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:21,912
Telemetry is go for
live camera feed.

255
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,744
Multiple objects
on forward radar.

256
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,579
Calculating
flight path.

257
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,677
Maneuvering
thrusters engaged.

258
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:35,351
Will? We 've got
too many targets
on the flight path.

259
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,690
Guidance? Abort
this trajectory.

260
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,026
Flight? We've got
a proximity alert!

261
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:41,030
There it goes.

262
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,001
Flight? Lunar SA T 1
has signal loss

263
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,269
on all channels.
Repeat, signal loss
on all channels.

264
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:55,972
Rerouting lunar SA T 2
for orbital insertion.

265
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,087
Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hey.

266
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,853
You taking this?

267
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,088
T ony, I know
it was radical
at the time,

268
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,460
but my father might
have been on
to something.

269
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,056
Yeah, but what if all
those people saying

270
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:18,932
he was trying to preach
the apocalypse decide
to jump on you?

271
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,597
One person
led that charge.
victor Stevens.

272
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,632
He had a lot of followers,
most of them still
work at ASl.

273
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,440
They're not gonna be
too pleased to see
this manuscript.

274
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,310
Well, I have
to take
that risk.

275
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,077
If my father's work
is relevant, I have to
bring it to the table.

276
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:38,071
Baltimore PD just escorted me
to the crash zone.

277
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,707
And it's a mess.

278
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,184
OK, Ollie. Start settin' up
our site right away
and get me

279
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,016
all the structural data
you can find.

280
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:47,751
I'll call you
from the plane.
Thanks.

281
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,293
OK. Before you
say anything,
I'm sorry I'm late.

282
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,692
I ran over
as soon as
I heard.

283
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,196
With a stop
for coffee.

284
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:54,993
And gas,
without either l
wouldn't have made it.

285
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,227
I did get us flights
to Baltimore.
We land in 3 hours.

286
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,669
Seems to be
lots of things dropping
in on Baltimore lately.

287
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,729
They said that there
was some sort
of asteroid

288
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,435
hitting the moon
and that some pieces
could be headed this way.

289
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,035
Yeah.
I heard that too.
Let's go.

290
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,946
As the reigning
father figure
in my life,

291
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,286
tell me that everything
is gonna be okay.

292
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:24,658
Everything is gonna
be okay. Okay?

293
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,553
Okay.

294
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,731
Thank you.

295
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,776
Lana, it's been
a long time.

296
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,003
It has.

297
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,512
Thanks for getting
here so quickly.

298
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,275
Baltimore may not
be a unique event.

299
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,146
I'm working on
a theoretical model

300
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,684
but I'll need to get
on your system

301
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,686
and crunch the numbers
from the latest data.

302
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,432
Oh my God!

303
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,936
What is it?

304
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,768
It's lost mass.

305
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,205
What?

306
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,836
It's lighter.

307
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:20,646
According to these figures,
it's lost 762 billion
metric tons of mass.

308
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:25,052
Which means the meteors
aren't the asteroid debris.

309
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,057
They're the moon.

310
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,012
Took you long enough.

311
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,312
Flight was delayed.

312
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:29,216
This weather's not
exactly predictable.

313
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,585
It's not exactly
easy for search
and rescue either.

314
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,748
Everyone accounted for?

315
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,691
50 dead.
Almost 200 injured.

316
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,853
That's what they're
reporting so far.

317
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,692
All right,
what are we
looking at?

318
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,096
The buildings
toppled inward,
onto each other,

319
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,226
but enough of the bases
stayed intact to hold 'em
up for a while.

320
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:48,101
OK. So we've got
an hourglass.

321
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,366
Hourglass?

322
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,169
It's the most difficult
to bring down.

323
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,676
Tricky to manipulate
but you just gotta
be precise.

324
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,235
On top of which,
the local hospital
serving the wounded?

325
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,747
Is right across
the street.

326
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,942
This thing
just keeps getting
better and better.

327
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,946
OK, we've got a bit
of a challenge here.

328
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,114
Let's put
our heads together.

329
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,529
What's next, Garth?

330
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,088
While the team
is working over
your findings,

331
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:21,332
you can install yourself
here in my office.

332
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:23,032
Have you released
a statement?

333
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,507
We explained
the Baltimore event
was a meteor.

334
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,510
We haven't let on
about the possibility
of more.

335
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,741
And for the moment,
our analysis of
the lunar impact site

336
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,339
is on its way
to Washington.

337
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,509
The next statement
comes from
the White House.

338
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,576
What about
weather changes?

339
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,144
Tides are rising
all over the world.

340
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:41,123
Right now,
incoming meteors
are priority one.

341
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:45,026
This is the new data
on the crater coming
in from Lunar SAT 2.

342
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:48,031
We're gonna have
a departmental meeting
to discuss the situation.

343
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,567
I'd like you to join us.
Give us your views.

344
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,935
I can tell you right now,
we're gonna need
outside specialists.

345
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,906
What'd you have
in mind?

346
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:04,744
According to this city grid,
it looks like we've got

347
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,942
an acceptable fallout
zone to the northeast.

348
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,248
We can tunnel
under the foundations
from that corner.

349
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,154
Then we should be able
to place charges to direct
the hourglass collapse.

350
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,953
Excuse me.
John Redding?

351
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,459
Yeah, that's me.

352
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,427
Your services
have been requested

353
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,397
by the American Space
lnstitute right away.

354
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,626
What do they
want with me?

355
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,896
I'm not at liberty
to discuss details.

356
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,868
In all due respect, Sir,
take a look around.

357
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,875
I'm kinda needed
around here.
Can't this wait?

358
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,934
This order is authorized
by the President

359
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:36,309
requesting the best
in your field.

360
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,938
That's you.

361
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,116
Refusal is
not an option.

362
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,950
Well. God
bless America.

363
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,991
Ollie, you're back
in the saddle.
Can you handle this?

364
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,617
Yeah, but you just
get back quick.

365
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,820
I will.

366
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,055
John, listen--

367
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,892
Here's your shot
to prove yourself.

368
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,830
Now. First
chance you get

369
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,233
you email me
the structure CAD
and all the blast points.

370
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:00,702
Where are they
taking you?

371
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,899
Listen, you're my eyes
and ears on this one.
OK?

372
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,374
Fine.

373
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,071
Be careful.
I'll be back.

374
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:16,042
The data now coming
in from Lunar SA T 2

375
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,180
has completely changed
our understanding
of the lunar impact.

376
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,919
The meteorites were
originally thought to be
the remains

377
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,824
of the asteroid
that struck the Moon.

378
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,919
It has now been confirmed
that they're actually

379
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,591
massive pieces
of the Moon itself.

380
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,258
Instead of leaving
an impact crater,

381
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:33,667
this asteroid
has literally cracked
the lunar surface open.

382
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,467
The orbital shift
it caused is gradual,

383
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,564
however it's
already having
an adverse effect

384
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,303
on ocean levels
and the jet stream.

385
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,073
And this is
just the beginning.

386
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,341
The Moon is now
entirely unstable.

387
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,854
This computer graphic shows
the growth of the fissure,

388
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:57,689
which we're calling
the Rima Fault

389
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,060
because of its location
at the Rima Sirsalis.

390
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,363
As gravitational forces
continue to exert their pull
on the fractured moon,

391
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:08,235
the size of the Rima Fault
will increase until it moves
past the critical.

392
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:12,800
If this happens,
the result will be
a civilization-ending event.

393
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:15,744
For the moment,
there's little we can do

394
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:19,180
about deteriorating weather
or incoming lunar debris,

395
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,718
but we must stop
the breakup of the Moon.

396
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,085
Our only chance
is to find a way
to stabilize the structure

397
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,249
of the Moon,
specifically the Rima Fault.

398
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,186
This is our clock.
And it's unpredictable.

399
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:35,323
So we need to find out
how big the Rima Fault
actually is,

400
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,392
how fast it's growing,
moving, shifting, down
to the last millimeter.

401
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,463
If everything comes together,
we will have one shot,
one window,

402
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,102
to beat the deadline
and save the moon.
And we can't be wrong.

403
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,238
We're depending
on your calculations.

404
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:53,806
Thank you, Lana.
All right everyone.
You heard it.

405
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:55,146
Let's get back
to work.

406
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:06,260
Well, apparently
forecasting the apocalypse
runs in the family.

407
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,959
Although your daddy
never had such dazzling
visual aids.

408
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,264
Victor, if you think
things are exciting,

409
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,702
stick around,
they're about to get
very interesting.

410
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:18,230
Oh, I intend
to stick around.

411
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,209
See, my good friend,
The President,

412
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:23,075
yeah, he heard
we had some trouble
on the moon.

413
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,547
He thought it might be
a good idea for me

414
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:28,380
to come down here
and help...fix it.

415
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:32,252
Make sure we don't
go off half-cocked,

416
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:34,484
as they say.

417
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,220
I think now would be
a good time to run
that interference, Garth.

418
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,886
No, no, no.

419
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,158
Garth, don't bother.
Look, I don't wanna get

420
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,668
in anybody's way here.
But like you said,

421
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,727
we do only get
the one shot.

422
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:50,330
I just wanna make
sure it's right.

423
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,501
Well, that makes
two of us.

424
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,208
I will be
with you shortly.

425
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,269
Okay.

426
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,052
Thanks for
the heads up, Garth.
victor Stevens?

427
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:10,093
He's here
to help.

428
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,253
Yeah, help himself.

429
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,629
Mr. Redding, sorry
for all the mystery.

430
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,964
I'm Garth Pender,
this is Dr. Lana Gale.

431
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,594
Thank you so much
for coming.

432
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,502
You guys didn't give
me much choice.

433
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,438
Yeah. We're sorry
about that.

434
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:25,873
We're experiencing
a crisis.

435
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,433
I noticed.

436
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,172
I'm not sure you know
what caused the mess

437
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,645
you were cleaning
up in Baltimore.

438
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,545
A meteorite.

439
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,811
Right.
The first
of many.

440
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,353
Our moon has suffered
a great impact

441
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,821
and we believe
the damage runs deep
to the lunar core.

442
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,189
Please, I'd like
you to follow us?

443
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:55,605
We've prepared a mock up
here as a visual aid.
That's fine, thank you.

444
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,409
Wow, that's
some crack.

445
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,607
Immense pressure
continues to pull
this section open wider.

446
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,980
Eventually this
entire quarter
will break away

447
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,485
and find its way
into Earth's
gravitational pull.

448
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,020
And then what?

449
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:16,219
When that hits us,
we go the way
of the dinosaurs.

450
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,297
You guys
are serious.

451
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,666
You should know
what you're
up against,

452
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:29,706
if you're gonna
help us stop it.

453
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:33,265
I'm just
a demolitions expert.
On Earth.

454
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,403
I don't know anything
about the Moon.

455
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:39,848
Nobody knows more
about how things collapse
in on themselves than you.

456
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,147
Now we need
your expertise
to see if we can make

457
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,380
the walls
of the crevasse
cave in.

458
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:47,686
Just lock this entire
section in place.
Stop the breakup.

459
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,955
Wait a second.
You guys wanna put
charges on the moon.

460
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,460
Seriously, with
all due respect,

461
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,560
I really just think
I'm way out
of my league.

462
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,129
Nothing like
this has happened
in the history of Man.

463
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,368
This is way out
of everybody's league.

464
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,479
We're not asking you
to go to the moon.

465
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,038
We're just asking you
to be part of our team.

466
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,542
At this point,
the Atlantic is

467
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,987
one huge staging area
for a massive
hurricane activity.

468
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:23,220
In fact, there are several
Category Five storms
in different places,

469
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,852
all at
the same time.

470
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,489
This is something
that's never happened
in all the time

471
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,533
that man has kept
track of weather.

472
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,194
Call it an act of God,
call it an eco-nightmare.

473
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,736
One thing
is for sure.

474
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,567
This is a weather disaster
the likes of which

475
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,199
no one has seen
in the modern era.

476
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,745
T ell me what
you got.

477
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:47,613
Fresh lntel from ASl
on an incoming asteroid.

478
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,016
Big?

479
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,611
Latest estimate
gives it an 8
on the T scale.

480
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:59,052
We got birds
in the air?

481
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:02,121
Patrolling a 30 mile grid.
Ten minutes
awaiting orders.

482
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,996
What kind of payload
are we talking about?

483
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,194
Sidewinders, Sir.

484
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,260
Well, let's get
'em climbing.

485
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:11,274
Delta 1, Delta 2, Scramble
factor six. At 2 niner 2.

486
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,934
Trajectory uplink
in five.

487
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,638
Roger control,
we're on our way.

488
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,682
We're at 15, 000
tracking inbound.

489
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:28,054
We have initiated
afterburner climb
for intercept.

490
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,399
Got visual.
Arming.

491
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,831
All right, gentlemen,
let's make this happen.

492
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,642
Cloud cover.
Lost visual.

493
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,923
I've got visual.

494
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:13,032
Missiles away.

495
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,092
He took
the shot!

496
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,904
Target is destroyed.

497
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,402
He got it.

498
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:25,541
That was
too close.

499
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:26,947
We got lucky.

500
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,915
What else is
on its way?

501
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:33,286
We're tracking inbounds,
but nothing rating
on the T-scale.

502
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:34,688
Atmospheric burn-ins.

503
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,350
Keep on this,
Lieutenant.

504
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,796
I want jets in the air
and I want constant
updates from ASl.

505
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,664
The tricky part

506
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,260
is to calculate what
we call reaction mass.

507
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,328
It's how we decide
how big a blast
it's gonna be,

508
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,873
and where we're
gonna place it.

509
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,409
Can we determine that
from this information?

510
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:56,037
Well, I'm sure
that we can
ballpark it.

511
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,172
But I can tell you
right now.

512
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:00,239
This blast is gonna have
to be massive.

513
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:01,477
Definitely nuclear.

514
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,577
And the variables
will keep changing

515
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,246
with the fault
growing all the time.

516
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:08,951
Nuclear blasts. Well,
looks like I got here
right on time.

517
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,153
John Redding,
this is victor Stevens.

518
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,059
Chief adviser
to the White House.

519
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,461
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Redding.

520
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:16,021
Thank you.

521
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,624
Pleasure to meet a man
with such an illustrious

522
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,566
family tradition
of blowin' things up.

523
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,571
Although, before you go
putting the moon
on your resume,

524
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,335
I think you should both know
that I have informed
the President

525
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,070
of what happened
on Miranda.

526
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,374
We don't know
happened on Miranda.

527
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,913
That's sheer
speculation.

528
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,175
What's Miranda?

529
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,843
Miranda is one
of Uranus'
1 5 moons.

530
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:38,081
A research flyby
in '86 revealed

531
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:40,419
that she'd been struck
by a massive impact.

532
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,186
Cracked her surface
wide open. But--

533
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:45,956
over time see,
she put herself
back together.

534
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,294
There's absolutely
no conclusive evidence
to support that.

535
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:52,233
Besides, our moon
has a solid iron core,

536
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,998
which was shattered
just as my father predicted.

537
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:58,508
Nothing will stabilize
the moon unless we
do that ourselves.

538
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,601
The moon's structure
is much less rigid.

539
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:06,012
It's perfectly capable
of displacing the energy
from a massive impact.

540
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,211
Until I see something
that makes me
feel otherwise,

541
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,947
that is all
we're going to do.

542
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,218
There is a fracture
running clear through
the moon.

543
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,883
And you just want
to do nothing.

544
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,790
We do nothing,
the moon...

545
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,724
will do
something miraculous.

546
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,767
The moon does not
have an iron core.

547
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:27,133
Its gravity
will stabilize it.
Your father was wrong.

548
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,537
Look, this
isn't personal.

549
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,872
We are going to rely
on the prevailing wisdom
which is the best we've got.

550
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:37,812
Five hundred years ago,
prevailing wisdom said
that the earth was flat.

551
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:41,146
Just because it's popular
does not make it right.

552
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,020
Look at that.
The President.

553
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,684
Probably wants to hear
how we're reappropriating
his nuclear arsenal.

554
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,719
I think I'll tell him
we need three bombs:
the Nina, the Pinta and the--

555
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:56,095
and that other one,
whatever its name was.

556
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:56,996
Santa Maria.

557
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,295
Bingo!

558
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:00,632
Is this
a bad time?

559
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,433
No, it isn't.

560
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:06,567
Guys, please, I'd like
to introduce you
to our Mission Crew

561
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:10,909
for the shuttle Perseus.
Major Rachel Fine.
Captain Ben Halberstom.

562
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:11,970
Pleasure.

563
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,209
You're a demolition
expert?

564
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:15,183
That's me.

565
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:18,483
Why don't we go down
to the conference room
and I can brief you?

566
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,523
Good idea.

567
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,355
Hey, Garth?
Mission Crew?

568
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,861
What happened
to leaving
things alone?

569
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,057
I mean, what if
the moon could fix
itself and victor's right?

570
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,192
Well, what if Lana
is right and
we're unprepared?

571
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:35,466
Now he may have
the President's ear,
but this is still my agency.

572
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,700
And it is still
within my authority
to call for

573
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:41,210
full contingency
readiness. And I am.

574
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,011
Thanks.

575
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,988
Ma'am.

576
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,785
They just upgraded
the storm.

577
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,226
Oh, good.
Can't wait.

578
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,991
They just shut
down the 95.

579
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,225
The equipment
is not getting' here
anytime soon.

580
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,827
How are we gonna take
this thing down without
our pneumatic drills?

581
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,503
Forget l
said anything.

582
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,804
You wanna shut
this down?

583
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:16,972
We are not shutting down.
We are gonna do exactly
what John told us to do.

584
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,572
I hope they had a good
reason for pullin' him
outta here.

585
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,677
What would ASl
want with John?
And why now?

586
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:36,028
Radar has detected a cluster
of meteors coming in.

587
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,761
We should alert
the Mexican government
of possible strikes.

588
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:10,927
Hope you
don't mind.

589
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,993
I was flipping through
that book you have
on your desk.

590
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,402
Your Dad
wrote that.

591
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:18,464
Yes. And l
don't mind.

592
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:22,171
He would've wanted
somebody to read it.

593
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,146
And he predicted
all of this?

594
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,911
Pretty much.

595
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,852
Don't you think
he should be here
too, helping us?

596
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,846
My dad passed away
a few years ago.

597
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:40,024
Before he died,
he wrote a thesis based
on lunar anomalies.

598
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:47,333
Anomalies? You know?
I don't think
I got to that page.

599
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,067
But, he was
right. Right?

600
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:58,012
In the scientific community,
the debate between fact
and truth can get brutal.

601
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,481
Victor came out against
my Dad's theories.

602
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,418
Managed to destroy
his credibility.

603
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,485
I had just finished
school at the time.

604
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,361
I was trying to get
my foot in the door
at ASl.

605
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:20,369
And I made the mistake
of distancing myself
from the controversy.

606
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,406
I left my dad hanging.

607
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:27,705
So as to not tarnish
my reputation.

608
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,539
He passed away
shortly after that.

609
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,613
I'm sure he'd be
quite proud

610
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:37,744
of the work
you're doing now.

611
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:39,550
Listen.

612
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:42,456
If there's anything
I can do to help,
please let me know.

613
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,824
You could fly up
to the Rima Fault
and bring me back

614
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,625
some mineral samples.
That would help me out.

615
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:50,325
Yeah? Well,
no problem.

616
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,129
Lana!

617
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,501
victor's called an emergency
meeting to discuss
the Mexico impact.

618
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,439
The three meteors
that struck Mexico City

619
00:38:06,716 --> 00:38:08,581
were massive
in size.

620
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:10,620
Hey.

621
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,279
Hey.

622
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:13,845
We're tracking
additional lunar debris.

623
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,484
This probably won't be
the last time we get hit.

624
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,654
...Ieveling hundreds
of blocks of the city.

625
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:23,825
May I have everybody's
attention please?

626
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,772
Mexico City
and the surrounding
areas are gone.

627
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,775
Repercussions from
the latest impact
are being felt

628
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,437
all the way
to Oklahoma.

629
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:38,106
The moon's condition is
getting progressively worse.

630
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:40,945
Apparently, it is
not fixing itself.

631
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:45,181
So the White House has
given us a full go
for a shuttle mission.

632
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,518
Garth?

633
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:52,323
With the Rima Fault
continuing to grow,

634
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:56,126
and the weather
systems getting
progressively worse,

635
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,667
we have to launch
within 48 hours.

636
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:02,398
So let's talk specifics.

637
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:05,498
John? How are we
coming with those
reaction points?

638
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:10,911
Well, my initial calculations
show we've got four
potential blast points.

639
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:14,348
The problem is those
keep changing
all the time

640
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,112
because the fault
is growing.

641
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,814
And I've
got another question
about our blast targets.

642
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,550
What about them?

643
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm just trying
to figure out exactly
what kind of magnetic force

644
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,452
are we dealing with
when it comes
to the moon?

645
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,087
Minimal.

646
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,133
The magnetic forces
disappeared billions
of years ago.

647
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,065
Right.

648
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,729
So what if we were
able to bring it back?

649
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:37,295
Instead of thinking
about blasting,

650
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:41,970
what if we looked
at this as more
of a welding job?

651
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:45,746
I hate
to disappoint you,

652
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,045
but the moon is not
made of steel girders.

653
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:51,781
That still seems to be
a point of contention
around here, vic.

654
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:54,050
You say the moon
doesn't have an
iron core.

655
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:57,116
But Lana thinks
there's enough
to give us some pull.

656
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:01,358
We really just don't
know exactly what
the moon is made of.

657
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,331
So what I'm
wondering is

658
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,700
if we could create
a magnetic charge and
put it in the right spot

659
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,864
to one side
of the Rima Fault,

660
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,207
well then maybe,
we can get this thing
to fall in on itself.

661
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:18,543
Do you realize
the conductor you'd
need on that scale?

662
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,310
It's impossible.

663
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,146
A MEG.

664
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,053
Theoretically, it would
have enough conduction.

665
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:27,851
We have our solution.

666
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,984
There's no evidence the
moon has an iron core.

667
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,791
We are not going back
to the drawing boards.

668
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,990
You need to pin
down the coordinates

669
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,000
for the nuclear
blast points.

670
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,736
What's a M EG?

671
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,539
Mass Electromagnetic
Generator.

672
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,307
It's a device
that carries
a very large

673
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,747
electromagnetic pulse
wave as part of
the blast wave.

674
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:57,048
Sounds like
my kinda metal.

675
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,749
What if we could
get one big enough?

676
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:04,453
How do we
make this work?

677
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,757
Who's your
best engineer?

678
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,491
A MEG charge?

679
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:10,863
Are you on drugs?
It can't be done.

680
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,562
The materials are
way too fragile,
way too unstable

681
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,537
when combined which
makes them way way
too dangerous

682
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:17,664
to be handled
on Earth, let
alone in space.

683
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,106
Then I guess
it's a good thing

684
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:20,870
that the President's
boy's not here.

685
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:22,912
Albert, I can think
of a million reasons

686
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,277
why it won't work.
I need your help
with one that will.

687
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:27,009
If I was to come
up with a concept,

688
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:30,211
the only way to keep
this whole thing from
detonating on launch

689
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,949
is to keep the activators
separate until
you're in place.

690
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,320
So it is possible.

691
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,983
Did I mention that
the two main ingredients

692
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,721
in a MEG charge
are liquid helium
and uranium?

693
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:42,060
Do you have any idea
what happens when you
mishandle those two guys?

694
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,895
Can it be done?

695
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,868
And another thing.
You are not gonna pass
this off on some ASl pilot.

696
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:50,235
This is heavy ordnance.
Get this to someone
who knows what they're doing.

697
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,765
Who's that gonna be?
You? 'Cause it ain't
gonna be me.

698
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,038
Albert? We need
a straight answer.
Can it be done?

699
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,973
I'll come up
with something.

700
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:05,488
But what I'm most concerned
about is you launching
my shuttle in this storm.

701
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,358
She just wasn't
made for that.

702
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,791
Damn.

703
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:28,705
Yeah.

704
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:30,769
Hey. It's me.
You guys OK?

705
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,611
John. Can
you hear me?

706
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:35,947
Yes. What's
your status?

707
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:40,115
They've elevated
the winds
to gale force.

708
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,124
We can't get
any of our gear
in here, besides

709
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,184
these buildings are
not looking too stable.
Where the heck are you?

710
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,957
Wishin' I was still
there with you guys,
believe me.

711
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,932
The weather service says
this lightning's gonna
get a lot worse.

712
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,468
Conditions are not
gonna get any better
for blasting.

713
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:54,798
Should we
shut it down?

714
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,964
Yeah. I want you guys
to get outta there.

715
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,009
Evacuate everybody
out of the area
and shut it down.

716
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:02,544
I need you to do
one more thing
before you go.

717
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,477
What's that?

718
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:06,913
I need you to find
a piece of that meteor
and bring it to ASI.

719
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:08,143
Okay.

720
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:55,862
Bryna! Did
you get it?

721
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:57,422
Yeah.

722
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,695
Good, let's get
the hell out of here.

723
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:11,036
It's comin' down!

724
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,844
Let's go go go go!

725
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,213
Aaaaaaahh!

726
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:24,922
Come on, guys.
Pick it up.

727
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:28,822
John?

728
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:34,359
John, listen we have
two of our best
shuttle pilots,

729
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:38,271
but...on this one,
we need
a mission specialist.

730
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,241
That specialist
is you, John.

731
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,908
You want me
to go on
the shuttle.

732
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:50,544
I don't have
any training to go
to the moon. OK?

733
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,212
We need you
up there.

734
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:53,346
We only get--

735
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,913
One chance,
I understand that.

736
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,255
We can't force
you to go.

737
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,761
You'll have
first hand visual.

738
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:01,990
We'd feel
more comfortable
if it was you

739
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,362
up there, pulling
the trigger.

740
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:18,611
All nuclear
reactions have
a magnetic charge.

741
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:22,310
It's that entirely destructive
element of the nuke
we're trying to avoid here.

742
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,785
So, by using
the electromagnetic
pulse of the nukes

743
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:26,583
to boost
the magnetic
charge of our MEG,

744
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:28,089
we can create a force
powerful enough

745
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:30,955
to recharge
the magnetic field
of the Rima fault.

746
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,016
In theory.

747
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,756
For how long?

748
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,321
Long enough for
the moon's own gravity
to take over.

749
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,697
I'm just giving it
a jump start--
in theory.

750
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:40,633
I heard that
you were going to

751
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,364
accompany the M EG
on board the shuttle.

752
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,538
Well, with
the situation
being what it is,

753
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:51,477
yeah, I'm in.

754
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:56,780
Now listen Albert,

755
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:58,115
this MEG charge,
it's gotta--

756
00:45:58,187 --> 00:45:59,711
MEG what?

757
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,118
What's going on here?

758
00:46:05,194 --> 00:46:06,786
We're just
exploring options.

759
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:09,388
Ah.
Exploring options.

760
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:12,195
Well, we don't
need any options.

761
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:14,896
The nukes are
on their way.

762
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,438
And when they
get here,

763
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,633
I don't want so much
as a spit polish
to go on them

764
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,767
without my authorization.
Is that clear?

765
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:22,572
Yes.

766
00:46:22,645 --> 00:46:23,771
Good.

767
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,990
Some big seismic
numbers coming in.

768
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,533
How big?

769
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:48,266
That's a 40% jump
from the last one.

770
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,999
Will? What's
our status?

771
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,008
Launch site weather
is getting much worse.

772
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,474
Garth. This
is insane.

773
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:58,013
We can't go up
in this storm.
Nothing can.

774
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,878
That's not an option
and you know it.

775
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:03,282
Anyone you put up
in that shuttle is on
a one way trip to oblivion.

776
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,981
We're all
facing oblivion!
Get used to the idea.

777
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:09,684
If we lose power,
they'll be
flying blind,

778
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,249
that's lF we get
off the pad.

779
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:14,490
They will make
it off the pad.
There's no alternative.

780
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,294
Now the time for caution
and second guesses,
that's long gone.

781
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,200
This mission is a go.
Do you understand?

782
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,395
Then push it up.

783
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,668
Get them the hell
out of here before
it gets any worse.

784
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,972
victor, you can't
still be convinced

785
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,103
the nuclear warheads
are going to do
the job.

786
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,477
The moon is doing exactly
what my father
said it would

787
00:47:32,548 --> 00:47:34,607
indicating he was right
about the iron core.

788
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:37,414
You just go on like
the facts don't exist!

789
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,819
There are billions
of lives at stake!

790
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,689
We need to be rational.
And we need to be right.

791
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:47,159
We're pushing
the launch up.

792
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,993
Lift off is five
hours from now.

793
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,829
The weather leaves
us no choice.

794
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:53,869
John. I need
a moment.

795
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,499
I just got some news
from Baltimore.

796
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:01,304
Those buildings
have collapsed.

797
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,937
What about my team
and Bryna?

798
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:06,573
We don't know.
I mean, we could
try but--

799
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,349
John!

800
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,914
Tell me we have
a solid plan.

801
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,754
Yes.
We do.

802
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,090
We go
with the nukes.

803
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,102
Mr. Stevens, we'll
need your authorization, Sir.

804
00:48:55,364 --> 00:49:00,700
It's getting
pretty bad
out there.

805
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,761
If you want
to be alone,
I can wait.

806
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,272
No, come in.

807
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:09,836
I heard about
what happened.

808
00:49:09,912 --> 00:49:12,380
The buildings.
I'm sorry.

809
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:16,407
Garth has some folks
trying to contact
city officials

810
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,078
to locate
your colleagues.

811
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:23,421
Is that her?

812
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,393
No.

813
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:26,894
That's my wife.

814
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,557
She passed away
three years ago.

815
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:33,227
So when you said earlier
that you'd lost
somebody special,

816
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:35,793
I understood what
you were talkin' about.

817
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:41,537
I'm just standing here
wondering if she was
still around

818
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,045
would I still want
to do this.

819
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:45,808
Would you?

820
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:50,942
I think
you would.

821
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,218
The storm just
hit tropical status.

822
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:59,352
They're reporting
gusts of up to
75 miles per hour.

823
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,453
I've gotta get you
up in the air, John.

824
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:03,354
Let's go.

825
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,142
Launch pad wind velocity
63 miles per hour

826
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,018
from the southeast.
Doppler is showing gusts

827
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:02,887
to 71 mph
at 30, 000 feet.

828
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,459
Control? Payload
is secured.

829
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:10,226
OK, Shuttle Perseus,

830
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:12,893
we are at T minus
three to launch.

831
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,732
Hope everyone's
comfortable.

832
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,294
Comfortable?

833
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:18,897
I'm strapped
onto the world 's
biggest vibrating whale

834
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,408
about to blast
through a hurricane

835
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:22,000
and this guy's
talking comfortable.

836
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:22,908
Sorry, John?

837
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,776
You can
hear me?

838
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,475
Oh, yeah.
We're all
wired in.

839
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,949
visual, too.

840
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:32,283
OK. Sorry.
That's good
to know.

841
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
Control, we've
got full green

842
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,617
on O2 and Nitro,
tanks 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Please confirm.

843
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,285
Confirmed, Captain.

844
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,990
I'm handing over
full system access
to you now.

845
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:47,366
T emperature is holding
steady on nuclear pulse
engines 1 and 2, confirm?

846
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:51,668
Roger, Perseus.
Nuclear pulse engines
1 and 2 are solid.

847
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,801
Nuclear pulse?
I thought they were
in the test phase.

848
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,777
They are.

849
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,871
You're joking,
right?

850
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,508
You know a faster way
to get to the moon,
victor, I'm all ears.

851
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:06,419
OK Perseus. Looking
for your readiness to
proceed with launch. Over?

852
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:09,720
Roger control.
We are locked in,

853
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:12,818
temperature's a go,
pressure's a go,

854
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:16,922
Roger that.
T minus 2 minutes
to launch.

855
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:28,438
Control, we've got
some flashing red
up here. Standing by.

856
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,045
She's got a wind
sheer warning.

857
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:32,637
Bypass it.

858
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,614
OK flight directors,

859
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,353
I want a go no go
for launch.
CapComm Perseus.

860
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,224
Go launch.
Go for launch.

861
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,091
Retro?

862
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:47,959
Go launch.

863
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,019
Trajectory?

864
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:50,395
No go for flight.

865
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:53,458
I've got a no go
signal for flight.

866
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,367
Booster.

867
00:52:55,438 --> 00:53:00,137
No go, Flight Director.
Negative. I've got
a no go for launch.

868
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,676
Oh, perfect.

869
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:04,474
Four nuclear bombs, two
nuclear pulse engines

870
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,139
aboard a no
go flight.

871
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:08,046
T minus 1 minute
to launch.

872
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:15,089
Navigation? Give me
your pre-flight status.

873
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:21,494
Flight, navigation
is no go for launch.

874
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,156
We have red lights
across the board.

875
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:25,257
We cannot launch
this thing. We
must abort now.

876
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,926
30 seconds
to launch.

877
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,903
Don't.
It's not gonna get
any better out there.

878
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:32,839
They're gonna be thrown
around like deck chairs.
I can't do this!

879
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:36,344
Will, you listen to me.
I'd like to give you
70 degrees and sunshine

880
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:38,744
so you could
launch properly.

881
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:40,873
But I'm afraid that's
not gonna happen.

882
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,578
Now don't you
turn that key.

883
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:46,280
T minus 20 seconds
to launch.

884
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,294
Ten, nine, eight,

885
00:53:57,366 --> 00:54:00,028
seven, six, five,

886
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:01,831
four, three,

887
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:04,429
two, one--

888
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:13,915
We have main
engine ignition.

889
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,924
Shuttle Perseus has
cleared the tower.

890
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,552
We've got three
reds, Perseus.

891
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:58,252
Roger control. We sustained
a lightning strike.

892
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:05,256
Control, we are
losing trajectory.

893
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:07,598
Raise secondary
thrust 20 percent.

894
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,297
Copy that.

895
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:11,305
Standing by.

896
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,555
Control, we are
losing horizon.

897
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:31,082
Storm wind velocity has
hit 87 miles per hour.

898
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,855
Flight? They're
being blown
off course.

899
00:55:32,928 --> 00:55:35,658
Raise secondary
thrust 30 percent.

900
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:37,289
Come on,
come on!

901
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:41,631
Will, that's
not doin' it.

902
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:46,304
Perseus, we're going
to change course

903
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,673
heading to
straighten you out.
Adjust trajectory.

904
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:51,679
30 degrees
north west
with the wind.

905
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,307
Locking onto course.

906
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,915
Come on!

907
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,188
Stabilizing.

908
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:10,593
Control, roll maneuver
is successful.

909
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,691
We are back
on trajectory.

910
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,540
Shuttle Perseus has
booster separation.

911
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:31,280
Control, we
are hypersonic
and away.

912
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:35,716
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have safe lift-off

913
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,588
of Shuttle Perseus
lunar mission.

914
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,453
Godspeed.

915
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:50,237
You still with
us, John?

916
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,638
Yeah, most
of me.

917
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,142
With the risky launch
of the Shuttle Perseus

918
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:01,047
from storm-battered Houston,
there is now hope
that the ASI shuttle crew

919
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:03,983
can avert
the threat of disaster
approaching our planet.

920
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:07,113
Today we are one planet
without borders
or differences.

921
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:10,522
And every thought and prayer
is with the crew
of the Shuttle Perseus

922
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,324
as they set out
to achieve what
some say is impossible.

923
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:21,734
Well,

924
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,864
I never thought I'd
hear myself say it but--

925
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,807
that was better than
blowin' up a building.

926
00:57:34,883 --> 00:57:37,215
Control, we
are ready to
leave orbit.

927
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:38,913
Roger Perseus.

928
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,321
Proceed with
trans-lunar injection.
On your mark.

929
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:43,915
Nuclear pulse
engines engaged.

930
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,823
Nuclear pulse?

931
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:49,796
For when 20,000 miles
per hour just ain't
fast enough.

932
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,131
Hold on to
your hats.

933
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:10,816
Control? We
have a problem.

934
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:13,616
Advance radar
is tracking
incoming lunar debris

935
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:15,281
and it's right on
our flight path.

936
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,915
Roger Perseus.

937
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,789
You are cleared
for evasive action.

938
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:21,193
Repeat, you are cleared
for evasive action.

939
00:58:21,263 --> 00:58:23,993
Roger control,
we' re on the move.

940
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:00,995
Control? Evasive
maneuvers successful.

941
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,538
You'd better start
tracking those bogeys.

942
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:05,937
By my calculations,
they're in
the Earth's gravity

943
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:07,873
and heading
your way.

944
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:10,605
And a couple of those rocks
looked bigger
than the Mexico meteor.

945
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:16,749
Just in the last hour,
this storm has
really started

946
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:20,220
to bear down on the city.
Power is reported being
lost in two-thirds

947
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:24,089
of the homes and officials
are calling for a complete
and immediate evacuation

948
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,595
evacuation of the entire
tri-county area.
But with similar storms

949
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:30,154
storms ravaging
the entire coast
and the imminent mood

950
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:33,793
can be striking
anywhere at any time,
the question remains:

951
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:36,838
Evacuate to where?
For now, it appears

952
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:38,998
there's no escape
from this earthstorm.

953
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,548
What in the hell?

954
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:53,179
Everybody, stay calm.
Stay calm!

955
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:54,779
Go to generator power.

956
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:59,019
That's gonna put us
on a bit of a clock.

957
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:02,029
We got limited time
on the generators.

958
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:05,464
If we can't get
the power back up,
we'll lose them completely.

959
01:00:05,534 --> 01:00:07,968
They need us
to fly home.

960
01:00:08,036 --> 01:00:11,267
Will? I need a precise
time estimate on our
remaining power.

961
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,671
I'm workin' on it.

962
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:13,708
Someone to
see you.

963
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,107
What do you got?

964
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,077
OK, call downstairs,
tell 'em to crank it up.

965
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:24,084
I really need to see
my boss, John Redding.
It's very, very important.

966
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:26,644
Bryna? I'm
Dr. Lana Gale.

967
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:28,849
We are so glad
that you're OK.

968
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:32,121
Thanks. I really need
to see John Redding.
It's urgent.

969
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,786
Will you settle
for a video feed?

970
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:35,386
John's on
the shuttle Perseus,

971
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:38,900
a few thousand miles
from the moon.

972
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:40,992
The moon?

973
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:47,172
You can speak
to John right
over here.

974
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:51,103
Oh my God.

975
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,181
Will, pull up
a video feed
on John.

976
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,445
Uh, John,
you there?

977
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,080
Bryna, is
that you?

978
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:02,248
Yeah.

979
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:04,656
Oh, hey, can
you see me?

980
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,557
Yeah, I can.

981
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,528
Look, I know I said
you needed
to get away,

982
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:10,087
but this is
a little ridiculous.

983
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:12,565
Listen, thank God
you're alive.

984
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:13,828
How's Oliver?

985
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:15,426
Oh, he's fine,
he's fine,

986
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:17,369
he's banged up
and in the hospital
but, uh,

987
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,963
but he's gonna
be okay.

988
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:21,703
John, you're
coming back, right?

989
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:25,679
Oh, yeah. That is
most definitely
on this itinerary.

990
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:29,513
Good, because I went
to hell and back to get
that thing you asked for.

991
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:31,075
You got it?

992
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:35,715
Great. Be sure you get
it to a woman named
Lana Gale.

993
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:37,349
You be sure
you give it
to her.

994
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,884
Yeah. She's
right here
next to me.

995
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,328
You did great.

996
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:44,262
If you can believe it,
they've got me

997
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,858
overseeing a blast job
that's gonna save
the moon.

998
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:50,496
Now you get
that sample to Lana,
and I'll see you around.

999
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:51,937
Stay safe
down there.

1000
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:54,475
Yeah.
Bye, John.

1001
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,041
Where did you
get this?

1002
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:05,712
A meteor crater
in Baltimore.

1003
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:11,519
I'm in the lab!

1004
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,840
Perseus is
on target.

1005
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,433
Entering the outer phase
of the debris field.

1006
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,915
Control, we're taking
evasive action.

1007
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:38,885
Buckle up guys,
this could get
a bit rough.

1008
01:03:14,823 --> 01:03:15,619
What's that?

1009
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,715
Restraint.

1010
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,555
Something's wrong.

1011
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:20,618
Something's wrong
with the nukes?

1012
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,631
Yeah, I've got
to go and secure
the cargo hold.

1013
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,232
Continuing multiple
targets on forward radar.

1014
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:41,974
Ahhhh!

1015
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:43,477
Ohhh!

1016
01:03:46,855 --> 01:03:48,686
What the hell
is that?

1017
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,622
Flight, we've lost
communications feed

1018
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:52,057
and secondary
hydraulics.

1019
01:03:52,127 --> 01:03:53,116
We've been hit.

1020
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:54,423
How bad?

1021
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,726
All directors
report your status.

1022
01:03:56,798 --> 01:03:58,595
Communications, get
us back online.

1023
01:03:58,667 --> 01:03:59,793
Ben, you
all right?

1024
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:03,930
Ben!

1025
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,170
Rachel, Ben's down.

1026
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:09,642
What happened?

1027
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:12,436
I think
he's unconscious.

1028
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,724
Shuttle Perseus,
what's your status?

1029
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,022
Control, we're clear
of the debris field
for now.

1030
01:04:26,094 --> 01:04:29,325
The shuttle
sustained a hit
and Ben's been hurt.

1031
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,662
How about
the payload?

1032
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:34,531
Got knocked
around a little bit.
John's with Ben now.

1033
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:36,332
Just secure
that payload.

1034
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,667
Forget about Ben.

1035
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:39,468
John, do
you hear me?

1036
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:44,274
Yes, I hear you.
Now could you
shut up, victor?

1037
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:45,904
If that payload
gets damaged,

1038
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,505
nothing else
is gonna matter.

1039
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,119
I just hope Ben
doesn't have

1040
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,318
a serious
neck injury.

1041
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:06,934
I'm inspecting
the nukes now.
They seem to be OK.

1042
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,936
Just a detached
cargo clip.

1043
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:15,598
Payload secured.

1044
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:17,440
Thank you.

1045
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,555
Okay, how
much longer?

1046
01:05:29,624 --> 01:05:30,818
Hold on,
hold on.

1047
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,487
That's interesting.

1048
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,657
What?

1049
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,070
That's interesting.

1050
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:43,126
What?

1051
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,332
I'm printing.

1052
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,073
That's interesting,
right?

1053
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,182
Control, we're approaching
the Rima Sursalis.

1054
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,889
Our first clear view
of the fault should
be any minute now.

1055
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:22,038
John!

1056
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,737
Are you
seeing this?

1057
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:33,545
Whoa.

1058
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,648
Looks like we've
got our work cut
out for us.

1059
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,330
My father was
right, victor.

1060
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,299
The lunar core
is composed mainly
of dense metals.

1061
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:48,996
It's not a fantasy
anymore. It's a fact.

1062
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:53,234
It's full of uranium,
iron--the list
goes on.

1063
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:56,038
And it's far
from the structure
of M iranda.

1064
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,636
My father's theory
was just proven.

1065
01:06:58,713 --> 01:07:01,682
Correct me
if I'm wrong
but doesn't that mean

1066
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,015
we should've sent
a MEG instead
of the nukes?

1067
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,328
John?

1068
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:21,062
John, are you
there? It's Albert.

1069
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:23,104
That sample
that you sent
proves that the moon

1070
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:26,038
has more iron in its structure
than we were planning
for in our blast.

1071
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:29,201
Please tell me
that you guys are
kidding me right now.

1072
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:31,711
I wish I was.
But we're working
on a solution.

1073
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:35,716
Right. O K, you know
where to find us.

1074
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:37,513
Rachel, we can't
use the nukes.

1075
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,918
What?
Why?

1076
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:42,183
The moon surface
is too rigid.

1077
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:44,384
It wouldn't sustain
the shockwave.

1078
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:46,586
Make the whole
situation worse.

1079
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:59,271
John, come in.
This is Albert again.

1080
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,535
Yeah.

1081
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:01,974
We are gonna try
to convert the nukes

1082
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:03,237
up there into
a M EG charge.

1083
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,370
We almost have
it figured out.

1084
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:07,210
John, you
still there?

1085
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:09,944
John, I know it
sounds crazy

1086
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:12,248
but we've been able
to assemble a puzzle
down here

1087
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,117
using elements
of the shuttle
and the nukes

1088
01:08:14,189 --> 01:08:16,555
to come up
with a plan
that actually works.

1089
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,422
I hear you Lana.

1090
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,324
My only
question is

1091
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,226
obviously we
can't put
a M EG charge

1092
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:23,889
where we were
gonna blast.

1093
01:08:23,965 --> 01:08:27,196
OK, where do you
suggest we go?

1094
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:32,139
Will, are
you on?

1095
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,902
We're here, John.

1096
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:36,034
See if you can
figure out for me

1097
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:39,808
where the epicenter
of all this seismic activity
is within the fault.

1098
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:42,782
Can you do that?
Kinda find out
where the fulcrum is.

1099
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:46,412
Copy that, John.
I'll put the geology
team on it right away.

1100
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:47,455
Did you
get all that?

1101
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:48,819
Yep.

1102
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,551
Good.

1103
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,991
'Cause you're gonna
have to get us there.

1104
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:56,656
Right. I'm on it.
Just be careful
in here.

1105
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,897
This is Shuttle
Perseus to Control.

1106
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:05,667
Standing by
for instructions.

1107
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,141
Shuttle Perseus, you
are clear to maneuver.

1108
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,906
Roger, control.
We're on the move.

1109
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,710
All right, Albert,
what's the first step?
T alk to me.

1110
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,479
OK, John, we need
a timing trigger.

1111
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:21,613
There's a heating circuit
in your equipment that
you're not using right now.

1112
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,987
Where?

1113
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:26,118
Look for a bin
labeled MF431.

1114
01:09:26,194 --> 01:09:27,786
Look for
the orange label.

1115
01:09:30,031 --> 01:09:33,125
Orange MF431.
Got it. Go ahead.

1116
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:38,605
You are gonna pull
out the igniter module.

1117
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:41,039
And we can marry it
to the payload
circuit path.

1118
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,239
Ahh!

1119
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,939
If you see anything
green, don't touch it.

1120
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:48,312
Can you confirm
that message
for me?

1121
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:49,975
Nothing green.

1122
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:53,043
Are you digging?
Did you find it?
It's clearly marked.

1123
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,185
Right, got it.
Next?

1124
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,735
John? Go to the circuit
boards towards
the flight deck.

1125
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:11,033
You'll see a row
of black circuit panels.

1126
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,368
Which one?

1127
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,806
The one labeled
channel interface.

1128
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:21,739
Behind that panel
you'll find the tubing
that you need.

1129
01:10:30,725 --> 01:10:33,091
They're cut.
Next.

1130
01:10:45,173 --> 01:10:47,164
Follow that cable
to the junction box.

1131
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,176
Can I help you
find something?

1132
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:54,509
Hey. Good to have
you back, buddy.

1133
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:58,814
How can you maximize
the liquid hydrogen?

1134
01:11:02,123 --> 01:11:03,613
Will? Geology's
come up

1135
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:05,420
with a new drop
point coordinates.

1136
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,290
We're gonna have
to go straight
to the core.

1137
01:11:07,362 --> 01:11:10,923
We've calculated
a flight path down
through the fissure.

1138
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,360
Got new coordinates
coming in for you,
Perseus.

1139
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,735
We're taking you
down into
the fissure.

1140
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:23,543
Roger, Control.
Coordinates received.

1141
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,306
It's gonna be dark
down there.

1142
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,694
Definitely the weirdest
bomb I ever built.

1143
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,079
We've got
a problem.

1144
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:10,556
What is it?

1145
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:14,755
I've done
a recalculation
based on our solenoids.

1146
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:17,059
Solenoids? What
about them?

1147
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:19,896
The maximum power
you can expect to get
out of that contraption

1148
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,595
about one hundredth
of what you need.

1149
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:23,660
What?
No!

1150
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:24,932
It's the velocity.

1151
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:27,031
It won't give
you the pull
you need.

1152
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:29,668
He's right.
It's not
gonna work.

1153
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:34,804
We underestimated
the conduction
we got.

1154
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:47,792
John!

1155
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,090
Yes?

1156
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,563
You better hold
on to something.

1157
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,442
Control?
We're approaching
the new drop point.

1158
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,268
Oh, this isn't
lookin' good.

1159
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,935
John!

1160
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:05,802
We've got increasing
seismic activity.

1161
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:07,465
We've gotta get
out of here now

1162
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,567
or we'll
get trapped.

1163
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:12,112
Albert? Lana?
T alk to me guys.

1164
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,310
John, listen.
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

1165
01:14:16,384 --> 01:14:17,976
The M EG won't
work either.

1166
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:19,781
The lines of force
are too small.

1167
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:21,515
What do you mean,
too small?

1168
01:14:21,589 --> 01:14:23,853
I thought you guys
had this all figured out.

1169
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:25,392
We've got to blow
this thing.

1170
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,486
John, this
is Victor.
It won't work.

1171
01:14:28,563 --> 01:14:29,860
It's over.

1172
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:32,559
It's not over.
What is the problem?

1173
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,967
John, it's the magnitude
of force we
can't change.

1174
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:38,767
The maximum field
we can create up there
with what we've got

1175
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,774
is just not gonna
make a difference.

1176
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,867
Lana? Come on.
We are up here.

1177
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:44,935
Let's drop this sucker.
Maybe it will work.

1178
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:48,210
He's right.
This is all we have,
we need to go.

1179
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,649
No! There's gotta be
something we're
missing, Garth.

1180
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,016
We have got
to make sure
the shot works.

1181
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,749
Come on guys.
Help us out
up here, OK?

1182
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:58,155
Think. What do we
have on board
this ship

1183
01:14:58,226 --> 01:15:00,160
that'll make
this thing work?

1184
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:01,855
They just don't
have the power.

1185
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:04,762
We're draining crucial
generator time.

1186
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:06,299
We can't push
this any longer.

1187
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:10,133
Wait a minute!
The engines.

1188
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:12,138
They're sitting
on two nuclear
pulse engines!

1189
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:16,142
The pulse engines!
Ben, we can get
access to those, right?

1190
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,543
Is that an option, guys?
Can that be made
to work?

1191
01:15:20,915 --> 01:15:24,715
Albert? Lana?
Talk to me.

1192
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:28,517
I think so.
Yeah, it's
definitely possible.

1193
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,993
OK gang.
Here we go.

1194
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:41,034
John, we have got
to get out
of here now!

1195
01:15:41,102 --> 01:15:43,570
The seismic activity
is increasing.

1196
01:15:43,638 --> 01:15:46,505
Copy that, Rachel.
We're almost there.
What do I do next, Ben?

1197
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:48,633
The control panel
is above the engine.

1198
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:54,206
The access code
is 8491 1 38.

1199
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:57,618
1, 3, 8.
Got it.
Now what?

1200
01:15:57,685 --> 01:15:59,550
Now use the winch
to slide the MEG

1201
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,088
inside the engine.
But please be careful.

1202
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:04,090
Those engines are
extremely fragile.

1203
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:06,149
But the two charges
need to be balanced,

1204
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:07,489
and we don't know
that they are.

1205
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,359
The line of force could
still be too weak.

1206
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,455
But that's when
the moon's gravity
kicks in.

1207
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:13,227
Please for once,
just trust me.

1208
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:20,002
Fault index is
approaching the critical.

1209
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:25,840
Oh dammit.

1210
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:33,011
Everyone just listen up.
I want you to shut
everything down!

1211
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:35,578
Let's restart
those generators.
Where's Will?

1212
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:38,147
C'mon get me
voice-comm back
as soon as possible.

1213
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:39,318
You got it.

1214
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:43,563
Right, let's
load this sucker.

1215
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:52,966
Hold on!

1216
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,041
John!

1217
01:16:59,113 --> 01:17:01,138
Hang on!
Rachel? What
the hell is that?

1218
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:14,987
You okay back
there, John?

1219
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:16,461
Yeah, I'm fine.

1220
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:27,068
Control. This is
Shuttle Perseus.
Do you read?

1221
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:31,009
Get those back up
generators online now!

1222
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,875
Tell the President

1223
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:34,574
they're about
to deploy
the MEG.

1224
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:36,446
All right,
here we go.

1225
01:17:46,727 --> 01:17:50,026
Okay.
We're locked
and loaded.

1226
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:53,726
Come on.
Don't do
this to me.

1227
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:56,599
Control, this is
Shuttle Perseus,
do you read?

1228
01:17:56,671 --> 01:18:00,232
Albert?
Albert!

1229
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,799
John? We lost
all communication.

1230
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:04,640
Well, get 'em back
for me now.

1231
01:18:04,712 --> 01:18:07,306
I can't!
The problem's
in Houston.

1232
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:08,643
What happens now?

1233
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:10,445
Jettison the engines.
We detonate en route

1234
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,543
according to
your calculations.

1235
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,485
Copy that.

1236
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:21,121
All right.

1237
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:22,719
The MEG is
set to go.

1238
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:24,856
I can calculate
detonation timing
on the fly.

1239
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:27,560
Copy that.
Release those suckers.

1240
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:29,193
We gotta get
the hell
outta here.

1241
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,168
Got it.

1242
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:41,380
Shuttle Perseus?
Can you read me? Over.

1243
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:43,974
Shuttle Perseus?
Do you read?
Over.

1244
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:05,496
Here we go.

1245
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:14,504
Shuttle Perseus,
can you read me? Over.

1246
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:33,057
Rima fault has
hit the critical.

1247
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:36,695
Repeat. Rima fault
has hit the critical.

1248
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:39,069
Oh my God.

1249
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,472
We are recording
massive seismic

1250
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:43,601
disturbances and
rapid growth
in Rima Fault.

1251
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:55,278
John. If you
can hear me.

1252
01:19:55,356 --> 01:19:56,823
You've got
to detonate.

1253
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:09,959
Get out of
there John.

1254
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,839
He's coming apart.

1255
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:23,846
Hold on.

1256
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:36,954
What are you
waiting for?

1257
01:20:37,031 --> 01:20:38,362
I gotta wait
for a surge

1258
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:40,127
in magnetic density
within the fault.

1259
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:42,101
We are
recording ongoing

1260
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:43,693
and accelerating
seismic activity.

1261
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,671
Blow the damn thing!

1262
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,435
It's too late.

1263
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:56,713
There it is!

1264
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:09,589
Hold on.

1265
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:17,862
We have
a MEG detonation.

1266
01:21:17,938 --> 01:21:20,736
We are picking up
a magnetic spike
and MEG detonation!

1267
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,711
Magnetic amplification
of Rima Fault
has peaked.

1268
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:41,260
We have continuing
seismic activity
in the fault zone.

1269
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:53,204
The fault index
is dropping.

1270
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:54,764
It's stabilizing.

1271
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,344
Radar imaging shows
Rima Fault is closing.

1272
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,343
It's working.
It's working!

1273
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,857
The lunar orbit
is stabilizing.

1274
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,689
Repeat, the lunar orbit
is self-correcting.

1275
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:18,329
Shuttle Perseus,
do you read me?

1276
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,762
Shuttle Perseus,
can you read
me, over?

1277
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:28,798
Shuttle Perseus,
this is mission control
do you read, over?

1278
01:22:32,613 --> 01:22:36,310
Shuttle Perseus,
can you read me,
over?

1279
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:39,443
Shuttle Perseus,
this is mission control.
Do you read, over?

1280
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,284
Shuttle Perseus.
Can you read me?

1281
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:44,822
This is Shuttle Perseus.

1282
01:22:47,194 --> 01:22:48,821
We're coming home.

1283
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:15,654
Thank you all.
Good work.
Great job.

1284
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:18,453
The Perseus Shuttle
mission has succeeded!

1285
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:22,519
ASI just announced
that the lunar orbit
is returning to normal

1286
01:23:22,596 --> 01:23:26,692
and that Earth, its tidal
and weather systems
have averted disaster.

1287
01:24:09,176 --> 01:24:10,302
You finish it?

1288
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:12,504
Just now.

1289
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,242
Well, then this
will be right
on time.

1290
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:20,449
It's the foreword
that victor wrote.

1291
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:24,013
A foreword?
Should l
be concerned?

1292
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:26,855
No, it's actually
not too bad.

1293
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:29,521
He apologized
for everything
he said about your dad

1294
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:31,189
and he even
gives you
a compliment.

1295
01:24:31,265 --> 01:24:35,634
In his own kinda sorta
arrogant victor way.

1296
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:37,796
That must have
been humbling.

1297
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:40,932
So it's basically
seven days a week, 365.

1298
01:24:41,008 --> 01:24:42,976
So when do you
have time to go out?

1299
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:45,238
Like off campus
kinda stuff?

1300
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:46,210
Off campus?

1301
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,907
How are
we looking?

1302
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:51,042
Beautiful. The movers
are bringing in
everything as we speak.

1303
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:53,382
Lana, the offices are huge.
It's gonna be awesome!

1304
01:24:53,454 --> 01:24:55,251
Offices?

1305
01:24:55,322 --> 01:25:00,453
Garth wants me back.
And I want to be back.
This is where I belong.

1306
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,290
Speaking of where
people belong,

1307
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,853
are you ever planning
to come back to work?

1308
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:10,302
I've been thinking
about that whole thing.
Excuse me.

1309
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:21,677
And you've been right.
All along about this whole
taking more time off thing.

1310
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:25,378
I'm just gonna start
switching over the addresses

1311
01:25:25,452 --> 01:25:30,685
and of course lnternet,
because you can't live
without the lnternet.

1312
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,055
He's just like
you this one.

1313
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:35,823
Work, work, work.
Damn overachievers.

1314
01:25:35,896 --> 01:25:37,227
Where are you
taking me?

1315
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,732
T o engage
in some off
campus debauchery.

1316
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:42,967
You know what?

1317
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,698
What?

1318
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,000
He's in trouble.

1319
01:25:50,577 --> 01:25:52,511
So if you're not gonna
go back to work

1320
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:54,069
right away, what are
you gonna do?

1321
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,173
Think I'll heed
some advice

1322
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:59,242
about a vacation
I'm in desperate
need of.

1323
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,687
They say space
is the next vacation
hot spot.

1324
01:26:02,756 --> 01:26:05,054
Already been there.

1325
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:07,685
Do you like sailing?

1326
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:10,195
Is that
an invitation?

1327
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:13,165
Yes.
You accepting?

1328
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:15,258
Uhhh, yes.

1329
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,860
Caribbean?

1330
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:20,373
Gotta be careful.
It is hurricane season.
