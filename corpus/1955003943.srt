1
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,802
- Galleycat?
- Gawker.

2
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,772
- Slut.
- He's been out twice already.

3
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,107
Thanks.

4
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,283
Jack Bauman's office.

5
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,785
Oh, hi, Morgan.

6
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,388
Yeah, I'm sure he did read them.
Um, I did.

7
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,323
I thought it was amazing work.

8
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,991
So glad you could make it.

9
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,495
If you've got a minute,
let's go through my day.

10
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,131
- You know, I'm sure that he
would love to talk to you,

11
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,266
uh, but he's in a meeting
right now.

12
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,368
- And don't forget
to change my shrink appointment.

13
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,370
Got it.

14
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,907
- Oh, um, I need you to manage
another release for me.

15
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,509
- There's nothing
scheduled for months.

16
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,311
- It's for the e-book
of "waking eyes. "

17
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,213
We're tying in
the new edition.

18
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,550
- I thought that was
coming out next fall.

19
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,385
- A spot opened up
on "Charlie rose. "

20
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,954
We're moving it up.

21
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,488
Oh.

22
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,891
- I thought you'd be
the perfect person for the job.

23
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,259
What?

24
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,562
- Well, your father
is Milan's agent, right?

25
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,864
- Yeah, but...
- they sent me the arcs.

26
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,902
Get a list from publicity.
Let's put our heads together.

27
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,840
Alice?

28
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,242
All right, look,
I know it's not glamorous,

29
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,043
but I'm putting
my trust in you.

30
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,680
"Waking eyes" is the best seller
on our backlist.

31
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,950
All right, all right, look,

32
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,553
what if... what if
I read that manuscript

33
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,556
you've been
hounding me about, hmm?

34
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,458
- You will?
- Yeah, what's the girl's name?

35
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,093
- Karen Malone.
- Yeah, Karen.

36
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,161
- Malone.
- Okay.

37
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,896
- It's the best thing that
I've read since I've been here.

38
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,931
I said I'd read it.

39
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,232
Okay, but we have to hurry

40
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,934
because there might be
some interest...

41
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,269
- yes, Alan Mitchell,
please.

42
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,870
He's busy?
Ah. Well, fuck him.

43
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,974
No, I don't want
to leave a message.

44
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,577
- So you'll read
the manuscript this week?

45
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,646
Yes.

46
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,335
Hey.

47
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,437
You're doing
the "waking eyes" release?

48
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,272
- Did you know
they were moving it up?

49
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,374
Yeah.

50
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,144
That's the book
that made me love books.

51
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,112
I totally identified
with her.

52
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,181
Didn't you?

53
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,551
Alice?

54
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,430
- Well, these are friends
of my wife.

55
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,664
Nice to meet you.

56
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,500
- They've just
come over from some...

57
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,604
Hey, sport.

58
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,706
You having a good time?

59
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,407
- Sure.
- Say hi to everyone.

60
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,975
Hi.

61
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,478
- Alice wrote a terrific
short story last week.

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,548
She's gonna be
the real deal.

63
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,084
Oh, this is Milan Daneker.

64
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,686
This is my daughter, Alice.

65
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,054
Hi.

66
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,256
- It's a pleasure
to meet you.

67
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,325
- Milan is one of your mother's
undiscovered writers,

68
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,394
but he's written
a book, a good book,

69
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,229
and I'm going
to make sure it sells.

70
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,131
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

71
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,669
You got to meet Annette...

72
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,704
- All right.
- "Times book review. "

73
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,408
Lay a little
of that foreign charm on her.

74
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,580
<I>- "She dodged
the forced laughter

75
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,616
<I>and the vapid conversations. "

76
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,387
<I>"If she could just"...

77
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,621
oh, sorry.

78
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,059
I-I was just looking around,
and, um...

79
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,360
It's okay.

80
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,063
Can I?

81
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,132
Really?

82
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,009
So how is it to grow up
like this?

83
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,078
Uh...

84
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,479
It's a little lonely.

85
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,681
That's what I thought, yes.

86
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,750
Yeah.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,521
And you're
a writer too, yes?

88
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,223
Um...

89
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,559
I don't know.

90
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,162
- I would like
to read your story.

91
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,665
It's nothing.

92
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,235
- Why don't you
let me decide?

93
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,343
Well, I-I must...

94
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,580
okay.

95
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,397
<I>- "If she could just make
herself small enough"...

96
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,169
<I>"Completely unremarkable"...

97
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,496
Hi. Sorry.

98
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,564
- Here she is,
late as usual.

99
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,366
Mwah.

100
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,769
We were just discussing
this new film with, um...

101
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,404
What's his name?

102
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,806
Flavor of the month...
you know who I mean.

103
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,375
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Have you seen it?

104
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,511
- Yeah, Sadie and I went to see
it last weekend, actually.

105
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,212
Mm-hmm.

106
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,282
And?

107
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,351
We... we kind of enjoyed it.

108
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,186
- I thought
you were smarter than that.

109
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,388
Did you know Alice
won a scholastic writing award

110
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,723
when she was 16?

111
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,526
- Really?
- We'd like to order now.

112
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,793
What'll you have, sport?

113
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,395
Oh, get the beef cheeks.

114
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,663
They're fabulous here.

115
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,365
She'll have the beef cheeks.
And you?

116
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,499
Pasta puttanesca.

117
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,767
- Oh, I'll have
the puttanesca.

118
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,169
You have
the grilled chicken. Maya?

119
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,205
- She'll have
the grilled cheese.

120
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,342
- No, no,
a half order of calamari

121
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,878
and some fries for her.

122
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,147
Yeah.
Make it a whole order.

123
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,448
Kids love fried stuff.

124
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,551
Here's to you, pal.

125
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,653
- Oh.
What are we celebrating?

126
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,888
- Independent booksellers
love the book.

127
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,457
Word of mouth is fantastic.
- Thank you.

128
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,893
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

129
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,798
- Oh, I love
watching you eat.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,401
- I know, I know.
- You must.

131
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,869
You invite him to dinner
every night.

132
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,204
Anna.

133
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,372
That looks great.

134
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,907
So here's to me.

135
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,477
I discover talented writers,
develop them for years,

136
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,546
and then you steal them
away from me.

137
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,949
- Anna, you told me to get
a new agent.

138
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:47,552
- We're getting some great press
in the trades.

139
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:51,456
Milan is making headway
on the next one, right?

140
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,857
- Mm.
- Right?

141
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,428
- Yes.
- I'm talking to you.

142
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,296
You're drunk.

143
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,465
Fuck you.

144
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,736
- Your command of the English
language is astonishing.

145
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,705
Fuck you.

146
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,575
- I think
you said that already.

147
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,845
- Cursing was one of the first
words I knew in English.

148
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,947
- Really?
Who taught you?

149
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,817
The kid next door.

150
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,354
- Excuse me.
I'm going to go freshen up.

151
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,659
- Delicious, huh?
Mmm.

152
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,663
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.

153
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,698
How's yours?

154
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,909
Come over here.

155
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,467
- Hello.
- Hello.

156
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,436
I'm here to see Jack Bauman.

157
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:48,673
- Oh, yes. Go right in.
- Okay, thank you.

158
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,011
Oh, shit.

159
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,754
Oh, my god, look at you.

160
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,823
Hey.

161
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,363
- Uh, what are you
doing here?

162
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,899
- I just finished my first draft
of my new book,

163
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,935
so I'm here to deliver it.

164
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,703
- What, are you kidding?
We would've sent someone.

165
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,371
- It's better in person,
isn't it?

166
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,439
Congratulations.

167
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,907
Finally,
something worth reading.

168
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,010
- Thank you.
- Come into my office.

169
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,646
It's been far too long.

170
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,519
- Hey, where'd you go?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

171
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,694
- So is it done?
- Finally.

172
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,830
Great.

173
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,621
Alice, where's my lunch?

174
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,757
- Oh, uh,
Chez Louis, 1:00 P.M.

175
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,826
- If I'd known
you were gonna drop by...

176
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,996
- But maybe I could have lunch
with Alice.

177
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,699
- What?
- To celebrate.

178
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,002
- I... actually, I can't.
I've got...

179
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,104
- you have to eat.
- I really need...

180
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,672
- you could toss around
some marketing ideas.

181
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,107
- I... you know what?
Um...

182
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,875
She'd love to.

183
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,480
Please?

184
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,600
How are you?

185
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,634
Good, good.

186
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,469
Good, good.

187
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,839
Good.

188
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,545
So you're organizing the release
of the new edition, yes?

189
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,648
Ironic, huh?

190
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,484
It's nice.

191
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,220
Tell me about your day.

192
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,622
Uh...

193
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,658
You know...
School.

194
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,628
How was yours?

195
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,098
You know, writing.

196
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,133
I'm glad you could meet me.

197
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,702
Thank you very much.

198
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,570
When can I read your story?

199
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,039
It's, like, no big deal.

200
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,575
They, um...
they just printed it

201
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,611
'cause no one
really submits stuff,

202
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,880
and, um...

203
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,482
Um, they're
kind of desperate.

204
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,051
Come on.

205
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,504
This line here

206
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,941
is exactly
how it feels like

207
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,211
the first time you see someone
that you maybe love.

208
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,780
It's, uh...

209
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,849
You're a writer.

210
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,856
What about your writing?

211
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,090
I'm mostly not.

212
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,060
That's a shame.

213
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,765
I read your new bio.

214
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,767
It says that
you're teaching a lot.

215
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,036
Yes, I enjoy it.

216
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,571
I'm sure.

217
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:44,809
- You were my first
and best student.

218
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,578
I got to go.

219
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,949
Alice, I've missed you.

220
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,229
- Why don't you just say,
"hey, about that little thing

221
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,966
"that happened 15 years ago
that you never owned up to

222
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,133
"or apologized for
like you should have,

223
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,302
you motherfucker"...
sorry, Tyler.

224
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,937
- Okay, I should never
have told you.

225
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,939
Look, it's not a big deal.

226
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,808
But he hurt you, Ali.

227
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,310
You don't do publicity
for someone who hurt you.

228
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,878
It's my job.

229
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,580
- I thought your job
was to help find and edit

230
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,182
new and wonderful novels.

231
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,918
- Tell that to Jack.
- Why don't you?

232
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,653
Will you help me?

233
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,888
- Besides the fact that I think
it's a terrible idea,

234
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,223
what could I do?

235
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,726
- You're a successful
web designer.

236
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,361
Alice.

237
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:40,264
- Okay, fine. You're
a semi-successful web designer

238
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,067
whose best friend
thinks she's brilliant.

239
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,303
- Yeah, who gave up
her not-so-stellar career

240
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,071
to be a mommy.

241
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,640
- I need to build more
of a web presence for the book.

242
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,809
Oh, that's a great idea.

243
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,913
- Sadie, please,
don't make me do this alone.

244
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,752
- You're a real shit,
you know that?

245
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,955
Thank you.

246
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:07,191
All right, I need to go
and wrangle a radio spot.

247
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,192
Yay.

248
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,794
We didn't get to talk

249
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,195
about what you want to do
for your birthday.

250
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,797
- Hide in a closet
until it's over.

251
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,098
- You better have
a big closet.

252
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,299
You promised.

253
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,334
Come here, buddy.
Give me a hug.

254
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,403
I got to go. Hugs.

255
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,071
Alice, why are you always

256
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,272
running off somewhere
you don't want to go?

257
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,874
Oh, fuck off.

258
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,176
Sorry, Tyler.

259
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,879
All right.
- Bye. Call me later.

260
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,982
I will.

261
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,051
You want some?

262
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,981
Hello?

263
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,019
"It was a graceful
pas de deux,

264
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,987
"a dance of hate.

265
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,956
"He belittles her,
two, three.

266
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,827
She yells, two, three. "

267
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,762
<I>Hello?

268
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,164
It's me.

269
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,367
This is the new story.

270
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,004
So, uh, I'm not really sure
about the ending.

271
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,439
It feels really forced,

272
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:06,377
and to me, the dialogue
is really bogus.

273
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,446
So...

274
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,450
Do you have a pen?

275
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,520
Yeah.

276
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,588
Thanks.

277
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,226
I can't watch.

278
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,906
Is that your homework?

279
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,342
- Uh, yeah. I have, like,
100 pages of American history.

280
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,443
Come over here, kiddo.

281
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,946
Come, let's read together.

282
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,883
It's good.
- You made notes all over it.

283
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,253
- I wouldn't bother
if it wasn't good.

284
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,388
But it can be better.

285
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,856
It's too abstract.

286
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,159
It's, um...

287
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,996
So it only becomes real...

288
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,564
If you give it
concrete details,

289
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,166
concrete details.

290
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,934
Look, here.

291
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,136
It's too abstract.

292
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,007
If you move that one...

293
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,144
Here we go.

294
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:52,083
- Okay, so who has material
to hand out for next class?

295
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,451
- I need one more
volunteer.

296
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,119
I brought in some new pages.

297
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,622
Um, Alice?

298
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,290
- I had this really
radical idea

299
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,325
for this super weapon
the Xorgots are gonna use

300
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,194
to destroy planet earth.
Just wait till you...

301
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,528
- it doesn't have
to be complete.

302
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,465
Maybe we could give
you some... some ideas or...

303
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,201
- Well,
if she doesn't have anything...

304
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,471
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,541
- Okay, Josh,
what are those aliens up to?

306
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,652
Oh, my...

307
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:31,222
look at that view.

308
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,324
It's beautiful.

309
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,393
It's, um...

310
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,467
Come.

311
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,908
So tell me
about your day.

312
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,577
Um...

313
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,945
School.

314
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,914
School?

315
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,117
- Uh, it's the same every day...
totally boring.

316
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,386
- Oh, not for me. You know,
for me, it's like a movie...

317
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,990
cheerleaders, boys
in team jackets, holding hands.

318
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,658
- No.
- No?

319
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,093
Mm-mm.

320
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,029
Um, people
don't hold hands anymore.

321
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,931
They just hook up.

322
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,399
- They hook up?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,135
They hook up.

324
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,472
- And, uh,
no cheerleaders.

325
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,709
No, wait.
I guess we do have uniforms.

326
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,711
- Uniforms?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,113
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,315
- My best friend, Ruby,
just went Goth.

329
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,017
- She turned what?
- Goth.

330
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,685
- Goth?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,220
- Goth?
- Uh-huh.

332
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,688
Well, what...

333
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,691
- you know, like, uh...
like, uh, black eyeliner

334
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,993
and ripped shirts.
- Oh, yeah?

335
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,396
- And, uh, her mom would
freak out if she knew,

336
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,632
so, she, um... she hides her stuff
in the hallway every day

337
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,734
before she leaves.
- Uh-huh.

338
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:54,071
- And, uh, um...
- Yeah?

339
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,707
Um...

340
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,143
Uh...
- And, yeah?

341
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,212
- You... you want to hear
about this?

342
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

343
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:07,385
- Um, well, she says her mom
has no idea who she is anymore,

344
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,587
but maybe she never did.

345
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,655
Yeah.

346
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,597
So Thursday's a good day
for you?

347
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,298
- I guess so.
- Okay.

348
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,235
See you next Thursday, then.

349
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,176
I'm sorry, guys.

350
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:35,446
I know you're wasting
precious babysitter time.

351
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:38,682
I just want to eat
in front of the TV

352
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,751
and get sodden and pathetic.

353
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,587
- It is your day.
We will do whatever you want.

354
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,089
Thank you.

355
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,295
Together:
Surprise!

356
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,468
- I knew you were gonna
make us bring you home.

357
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,671
- Thank you. Aww.
I'm going to kill you.

358
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:04,241
Happy birthday.

359
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,477
You're really going to enjoy it
once you get used to the idea.

360
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,412
- Come on.
- Come on, help her blow it out.

361
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,816
One, two, three.

362
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,552
- Ooh, a little bit more.
Oh, oh. Yay.

363
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,153
One more, one more.
- Last one.

364
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,691
Whoo!

365
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,261
What?

366
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,200
What you writing?

367
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,269
My journal.

368
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,306
Come on.

369
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,543
Mm-mm.

370
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,612
I want to know you.

371
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,748
I can't.

372
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,817
One page.

373
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,642
Okay.

374
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,429
My heart is pounding.

375
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,665
I have to get up.

376
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,733
I have to get up.

377
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,305
A kiss.

378
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,883
A real one.

379
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,492
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's okay.

380
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,595
I was just...
I was reading.

381
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,663
Sorry. Do you need...
- no, no.

382
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:43,267
I-I was just looking
for a place to hide out.

383
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,674
My friend invited me.

384
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:54,578
I don't even know the girl
who this is for.

385
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
Yeah?
- Yeah.

386
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,881
- Well, happy birthday.
- Shh.

387
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,485
I'm trying to pretend
like I don't have to grow up.

388
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,923
- Is there anything
I can do to help?

389
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,992
Maybe.

390
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,731
Yeah.

391
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,799
Looks good.

392
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,709
So what are you reading?

393
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,679
Oh.

394
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,581
I love that character.

395
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,516
The female Holden Caulfield.

396
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,319
- Yeah,
that's what they say.

397
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,454
Not a favorite?

398
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,623
No.

399
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:44,294
- So why are you
sitting alone

400
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,830
in a bathroom
on your birthday reading it?

401
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,268
Work.

402
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,703
What do you do?

403
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,706
- That is not
an age-appropriate question.

404
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,541
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

405
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,482
Want some?

406
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,384
Definitely.

407
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,928
Alice.

408
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,368
Oh, Emmett.

409
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,437
Hi.

410
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,342
Hey.

411
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,480
What?

412
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,919
- You were right.
I did have a good time.

413
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:45,322
I'm glad.

414
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

415
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,726
Thanks for inviting me.

416
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,993
Yeah.

417
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,096
- Wait. You two
know each other?

418
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,531
- Uh, he was rob's
freshman year roommate,

419
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,000
but I actually met him first...

420
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,836
Freshman mixer.

421
00:28:58,838 --> 00:28:59,970
Oh, right.

422
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,406
- You're kidding.
- No.

423
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,874
Okay. College, wow.

424
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,709
Let me help you up.
- Thank you.

425
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,679
Can I help with the cleanup?

426
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,547
No, no, no.

427
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,484
We got this.
You've done enough.

428
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,555
You recycle?

429
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,625
Uh, I plead the fifth.

430
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,431
What about your mom?

431
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,433
She stayed home with us.

432
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,934
Do you have sponges?

433
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,103
Uh, uh...

434
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,606
Sorry.

435
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,443
- Yeah, they've been married
35 years,

436
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:43,847
sometimes happily,
sometimes not.

437
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:48,118
They're abnormally normal.

438
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,889
- Wow. You're, like, some kind
of almost extinct species.

439
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:54,792
They should breed
you in captivity.

440
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,801
- So, aside from not being
environmental activists,

441
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,104
what's your family like?

442
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,606
Um...

443
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,975
Not much like a family,

444
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,044
I guess.

445
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,048
And?

446
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,117
Nuts.

447
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,886
Oh, that explains it.

448
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,190
Thanks.

449
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,092
- Look,
just so we're clear,

450
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,929
I don't really do nuts.

451
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,865
I'll keep that in mind.

452
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,605
Hey.

453
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,139
Hey.

454
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,876
Hey.

455
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:21,778
How do you take your coffee?

456
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,747
Black.

457
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,816
Okay.

458
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,088
I'll call you later?

459
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,045
- So, while he was building
a bionicle,

460
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:59,750
I posted on New Yorker books,
Paris review, Galleycat.

461
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,819
Uh, what else?
- How am I gonna thank you?

462
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,589
- Oh, I don't know.
Foot massage?

463
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,761
Not too high, Ty.

464
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,901
- So Alice grew up
and became

465
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,971
a wife and mother
just like everybody else.

466
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,608
Isn't that sad?

467
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,145
Yeah.

468
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,815
But it would make me sadder
if she hadn't.

469
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,617
Your face is chapped.

470
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,285
When you're near 30,
you have to moisturize.

471
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,220
Trust me.

472
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,288
Kissing.

473
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,923
What?

474
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,192
Too much kissing.

475
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,661
- Never say that
to a married person.

476
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,042
Emmett.
- Yeah, I guessed.

477
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,714
Look at you.
- What?

478
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,717
I'm so glad.

479
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,219
- It's terrifying.
- And exhilarating.

480
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,922
- Mom?
- What is it, baby?

481
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,790
- Jesus Christ.
- Mom?

482
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,859
Okay.

483
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,017
- Alice.
- Dad.

484
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,219
- I forgot I need a jacket
for this thing tonight.

485
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,122
Here, this was in the middle
of the living room.

486
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,857
It's not mine.

487
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,893
- Well, where the hell
did it come from?

488
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,362
God, it reeks.

489
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,898
I think it's Milan's.

490
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,967
Milan's?

491
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,805
- He was here
this afternoon.

492
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,874
- Did he bring by
a new draft?

493
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,713
- He, uh...
he came to see me.

494
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,281
You?

495
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,783
Yeah.

496
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,352
He's been helping me
with my writing.

497
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,421
- What?
Wha...

498
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,091
since when?

499
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,160
A while.

500
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,097
Well...

501
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,867
You couldn't have
a better mentor.

502
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,036
You're a lucky girl.

503
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,672
Yeah.

504
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,874
- I expect great things
of you.

505
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,914
Good night.

506
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,252
Okay, here.

507
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,389
So this lady,
she hasn't voted in 20 years.

508
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,158
She starts reading our most
outrageous quotes of the day,

509
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,060
sees her senator waxing poetic

510
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,130
about the benefits
of hydrofracking.

511
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,099
Immediately promises
to volunteer

512
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,434
for anyone
who will run against him.

513
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,771
- Wow.
- And this guy... oh, my god.

514
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,706
I love the way
they curse in the south.

515
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,375
- You do realize
you're a fanatic, don't you?

516
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:16,046
- Yeah, sorry.
- Mm.

517
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,089
- You, uh... you want some
of my pakora?

518
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,259
- Yes, I want to try
your pakoras.

519
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:33,363
- I approved your entry,
so you can post it anytime.

520
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm the last one here,
so I'm gonna head out.

521
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:38,435
See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

522
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:41,004
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

523
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,474
- It's nice to know
somebody

524
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,043
who actually likes
what they do.

525
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,980
I always wanted to be a writer
when I grew up.

526
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,015
Are you?

527
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,316
Grown up?

528
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,986
No, writing.

529
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,091
No.

530
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,160
How come?

531
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,531
- I sit there waiting to hear
the characters speak,

532
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,766
and instead,
I have this voice in my head,

533
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:14,004
saying, "this is shit.
This is shit. This is shit. "

534
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,273
Come on, that voice?

535
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,941
Everybody hears that voice.

536
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,910
It's the same voice
that says,

537
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:23,914
"I can't believe you just said
that, you fucking moron. "

538
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,183
Everybody hears that voice.

539
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,317
You think?

540
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,219
Yeah.

541
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,922
Most people just ignore it.

542
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:35,292
- Really?
I just...

543
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,195
Succumb.

544
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,463
Yeah?

545
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:44,901
I like a girl
who knows how to succumb.

546
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,136
Really?

547
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,170
Really.

548
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:10,927
Shit.

549
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,359
Ah.

550
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,261
Well, good morning.

551
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,495
This the new jacket copy?
- Yeah.

552
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,930
- Great.
- I thought that you...

553
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,498
- can you get Harold Blake
for me?

554
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,333
- Did you get a chance
to read Karen's manuscript?

555
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,468
- Uh-huh.
Not yet.

556
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,503
The Fisher book's exploding.

557
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,938
But you will this week.

558
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,439
- As soon
as I get a free moment.

559
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,075
Now, Milan did an interview
with the press office.

560
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,378
Can you see if he said anything
we haven't heard before?

561
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,512
This week?

562
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,281
- I'm sorry?
- This week.

563
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,915
Oh, yes, of course.

564
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,485
I really need to talk
to Harold.

565
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,553
Harold's on line one.

566
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,198
"The only real rule
of good writing is generosity. "

567
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,037
- Rule number one...
generosity.

568
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,539
You must be willing
to share yourself.

569
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,275
Oh, I brought you a present.
- You did?

570
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,244
Yeah.

571
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,147
It's a birthday present.

572
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,482
I wrote you a poem.

573
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,318
- I didn't know
you write poetry.

574
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,654
- I don't,
but you inspire me, so...

575
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,690
Come.

576
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,052
Um...

577
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,130
What do you think?

578
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,033
- Uh, it's... it's...
it's nice.

579
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,137
"Nice"?

580
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,110
- I have a... I have
a precalc test tomorrow.

581
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:42,645
Jesus, I hate this stuff.
- Alice?

582
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,714
It's okay.

583
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,319
- Okay.
I'm glad you liked the poem.

584
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,457
Anything we can use?

585
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,626
- Nothing that we
haven't heard before.

586
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,194
Damn.

587
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:01,264
Get me Susan
at Simon & Schuster.

588
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,073
Sorry.

589
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,641
So are you ever on time?

590
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,310
- No.
But, um...

591
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,379
I got you these.

592
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,483
Thanks.

593
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,481
- Oh, wow.
Alfred marks began working

594
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,783
at the white house
at the age of 28.

595
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,286
Good for Alfred.

596
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,125
Louise Van Der Zwan...

597
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,793
okay, stop.
- All right, stop.

598
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,462
What?

599
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,331
- Is this what you do
every Sunday morning?

600
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,835
You just sit here
and envy other people's lives?

601
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:15,605
- No, that is pretty much
a full-time occupation.

602
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,173
- You know
it's pointless, right?

603
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,808
Yes, I do.

604
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,412
You can't write in front of me.
- What?

605
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:24,481
- No, I'm serious. If anyone's
gonna write in my apartment,

606
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,216
it's going to be me.

607
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,151
But you don't.

608
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,786
- Thank you
for pointing that out.

609
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,489
- Come on, it's not
like there's a finite number

610
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:33,590
of words in the room,

611
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,824
and if I use them all,

612
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,593
there won't be enough
left for you.

613
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,866
- Why does everything you say
have to make so much sense?

614
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,467
It's fucking infuriating.

615
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,109
Okay, shut up now.

616
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:08,558
- Seeing
anyone special, sport?

617
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,661
Not really.

618
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,564
- You know,
having children

619
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:17,867
is the most satisfying thing
life has to offer.

620
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,738
Yeah.

621
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,208
How's the writing going?

622
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,343
Oh, you know...

623
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:30,280
There is a book that I read
that I thought was terrific.

624
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:31,714
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm trying to get Jack

625
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,715
to read it.

626
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,484
Yeah?

627
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,287
- Um, well, I thought that
maybe you would have a look.

628
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,523
Maybe you'd want
to meet with the writer.

629
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,292
Jack hasn't read it?

630
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:43,793
- Don't worry about that.
I'll get him to read it.

631
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,629
I just... I just thought
you might want to meet with her.

632
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,699
Her name's Karen Malone.
She, um... she did "Iowa. "

633
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,301
She has this amazing
short story.

634
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:54,504
- No, no.
I'm going to call him up.

635
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:56,573
- No, dad. Please don't.
That's not what I meant.

636
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,341
- Well, I can fix it,
sport.

637
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,310
- Dad, dad,
I'll get him to read it.

638
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:03,212
I just wanted your opinion.

639
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,881
Okay.

640
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,216
- Dad, I mean it.
Don't call him.

641
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,918
- Okay, honey,
I won't call him.

642
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,387
Hey, tiger.

643
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,690
Are you having fun?
Huh?

644
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,638
Great work.

645
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,709
Um, Alice,
can you hang out a minute?

646
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,712
Look, do you want me
to refund your tuition?

647
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,415
What?

648
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,650
- It's past
the official deadline,

649
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,752
but I could ask them
to make an exception.

650
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,694
- It's not
that I'm not trying.

651
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,764
- Why don't you sign up again
when you feel like you're ready?

652
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,406
Thanks.

653
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,974
Yeah, I know he's doing a lot
of press right now,

654
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,809
but it would be great
if he could squeeze in

655
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,480
the "waking eyes"
re-release party.

656
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,616
Okay, no, I don't have
any confirmations yet, but...

657
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,418
I can hold.

658
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,420
- Is this
Jack Bauman's office?

659
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,022
- Yeah,
is he expecting you?

660
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,456
Karen Malone.

661
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,695
Karen, hi.

662
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,397
I'm Alice.
- Nice to meet you.

663
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:29,432
It's really nice
to meet you too.

664
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,367
- So could you tell him
I'm here?

665
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,469
- Hey, Karen,
come on in.

666
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:34,837
- Hi.
- Jack Bauman.

667
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,272
- So nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

668
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,940
- Alice. Hi.
- Dad?

669
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,542
Am I late?

670
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:42,912
See, sport,
I told you I'd fix it, huh?

671
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,581
Can I take you to lunch
when we're through here?

672
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,284
- Ben, good to see you.
- Hey.

673
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:49,652
- Hi.
- Karen.

674
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,988
- How are you?
- All right.

675
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,831
- Hi.
- Hi.

676
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,000
Uh, Keith.

677
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:41,037
I'm watching Tyler.

678
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,805
Oh, okay.

679
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,842
- We were at the park all day.
He's taking a nap.

680
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,977
- Um, I'm Alice.
- Yeah, um, hi.

681
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,112
Hi.

682
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,414
- Sadie's at, uh,
prenatal yoga.

683
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,950
Um, she'll be back in,
like, an hour and a half.

684
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,818
- Maybe you could just tell her
that I came by.

685
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,754
She could call me.
- Yeah, sure.

686
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,655
Okay.

687
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,758
You know what? Actually, maybe
I'll just check on Tyler,

688
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,827
if that's okay.
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

689
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,085
- He's such a great kid.
- Yeah.

690
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:32,922
I... we read this in my, uh,
modern lit class last year.

691
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:34,090
Oh?

692
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:37,160
I didn't finish it.

693
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:40,429
- Well, you can have that copy
if you want.

694
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,865
It's kind of dated.

695
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,477
What?

696
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,524
Keith?

697
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,799
What the fuck are you doing?

698
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,835
- Uh, what are you
doing home?

699
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:22,038
- I decided to skip
deep relaxation.

700
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,806
Is there someone in there?

701
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,875
Um...

702
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,112
- Keith,
get out of here.

703
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,547
Okay.

704
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,918
Um...
You owe me 40.

705
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,987
- Now.
- Okay.

706
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,893
- What the hell
are you doing?

707
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,728
I don't know.

708
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,929
- He's a kid.
- I know.

709
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,531
- If Tyler had woken up,
oh, my god,

710
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,832
he would've been so confused.
- I know.

711
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,534
- What about Emmett?
- I know, I know.

712
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,836
I don't know.

713
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,074
- Hey, honey.
- Mama?

714
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,742
Yeah, baby?

715
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:00,910
Aunt Alice!

716
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:04,313
- Aunt Alice
has to leave now.

717
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,788
Okay.

718
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,142
- Still waiting
on that updated guest list.

719
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,245
I'm working on it.

720
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:47,016
You could have told me that you
read it, that you liked it.

721
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,851
That we're publishing it.

722
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,319
You are?

723
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,154
- I thought daddy
would've spread the word.

724
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,023
- Well, who are you
assigning it to?

725
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,258
I'm editing it myself.

726
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,227
- It's not
your kind of book.

727
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,328
Eh.

728
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,830
I found her. I...

729
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,265
Alice, that's your job.

730
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,002
You cull the good stuff.
I decide if it's good enough.

731
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,770
- Yeah, but listen,
I have some great ideas...

732
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,772
- ...shh. Now, listen, there's no
way I'm going to let

733
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,842
an inexperienced editor work
with an inexperienced writer.

734
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,210
- I've worked here
for two years.

735
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,378
- And how many books
have you edited?

736
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,912
My point exactly.

737
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:18,714
I will cc you in my notes.

738
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,383
You can come to me with
your thoughts anytime you like.

739
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,819
Now, listen, Milan is expecting
you at the taping tomorrow.

740
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,888
The new novel
is almost unreadable.

741
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,257
Make sure he sticks
to "waking eyes," okay?

742
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,326
You're the best.

743
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,969
- So 15 years.
- Mm-hmm.

744
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:44,040
- You've written seven novels
since "waking eyes,"

745
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:48,277
and none has become
the kind of cultural icon.

746
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,947
No, unfortunately not.

747
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,250
What do you think makes it

748
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:57,319
so perennially popular?

749
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,388
Um...

750
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,894
What I think it is, is that
everyone has been a teenager,

751
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,296
and...

752
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:11,934
We all know how out of kilter
it makes you.

753
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:16,238
- All right.
Is it...

754
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,840
okay, so are you gonna
tell me the secret now?

755
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,408
- All right, I think
I'm gonna actually tell you.

756
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,810
Come here for a second.

757
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:22,244
No one can hear this,
actually.

758
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,184
Mm.

759
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:29,351
What?

760
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:32,054
I have to go.

761
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,890
So go.

762
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,849
It's not important.

763
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:06,856
- So the question
I have to ask...

764
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:10,493
- Which I probably have answered
many times before, so go ahead.

765
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:11,894
Possibly.

766
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,729
How does a man in his 40s

767
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:16,298
perfectly capture
the essence

768
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,135
of a teenage girl?

769
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,370
Um...

770
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,975
This opening paragraph
is self-indulgent.

771
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,277
95% of writing is rewriting.

772
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,979
You know that.

773
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,481
And here, here's
another dangling preposition.

774
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,985
The way you mangle
the English language is...

775
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:40,222
look at this.
I'm the immigrant here.

776
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:43,859
- I was hanging out
with my friend. I forgot.

777
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,165
I'm sorry.

778
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,307
I do this because I believe
in your talent.

779
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,376
I know.

780
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,013
Come here.

781
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,092
I do this
because I love you.

782
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,161
- I know.
- Yeah.

783
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:22,164
I met a boy.

784
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,567
Oh, I'm happy.

785
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,235
So glad.

786
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:28,437
I want you to be happy.

787
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,010
What can I do
to make you happy?

788
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,316
We all like a mystery,

789
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,218
but there's
no mystery girl in it.

790
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,953
It's all fiction,

791
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:47,556
and, um...

792
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,993
At that time,
I did walk around in the city

793
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,430
and listen in on subways,
coffee shops...

794
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,131
- Mm-hmm.
- Streets, you know,

795
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,033
and I still do,
now and then,

796
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,836
listen in to see
if girls have changed.

797
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,340
You know?
- Hmm. And have they?

798
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:07,243
Some things never change.

799
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,882
- Hi.
- Hi.

800
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,150
Special delivery.

801
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:18,420
- What the hell
are you doing here?

802
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,955
No, no,
you need to go.

803
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,324
I have somebody coming here.
- Another time?

804
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:23,959
No, no.

805
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,227
Why?

806
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,396
- Look, I just turned 29.
- Really?

807
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:29,164
- And I guess it
messed with my head.

808
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,332
Shit.

809
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,940
- Hey.
- Hi.

810
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,975
This is Keith.

811
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,543
Yeah?

812
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:44,179
- Uh, he's
Sadie's babysitter.

813
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,081
Yeah?

814
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,317
- You her husband?
- Yeah.

815
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,322
No.

816
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:56,292
Keith was just leaving.

817
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,494
Yeah, um...

818
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:02,031
Sorry, man.

819
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,566
I got us some wine.

820
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,938
Alice?

821
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,575
- I went to Sadie's the other
day, and I forgot that.

822
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,645
And?

823
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,348
- Well, I told him
that he could borrow it.

824
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,353
- Before or after
you forgot it?

825
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,961
Emmett.

826
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,663
Did you...?

827
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,202
Fuck.

828
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,440
- Emmett, can...
can we just talk about it?

829
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,475
Please, it was the day
that I found out

830
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:47,976
about the manuscript.

831
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,979
I was really upset.

832
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:53,315
I am never gonna
to see this guy again.

833
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:57,052
Emmett. Listen, let's just
talk about it.

834
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,256
Emmett.

835
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,760
- I will not let you make me
as crazy as you are.

836
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,410
- Dad?
- Hey, champ, come.

837
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:23,545
Come and meet Alana.

838
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,715
- You must be Alice.
- Hi.

839
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,051
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

840
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,487
Alana is
a fantastic conductor.

841
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:35,190
Women are really coming
into their own in that field.

842
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,728
What about Maya, dad?

843
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,530
- I'm gonna see her.
Yeah.

844
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:45,100
Helene just needs a little time
to cool down.

845
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,735
Oh, dad.

846
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,038
Hey, hey.

847
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,275
You know how it is,
right?

848
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,416
Sorry. I just, uh...

849
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:03,218
Suddenly started
to just feel...

850
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,253
- Alice?
- Excuse me.

851
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,455
Alice.

852
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,303
What are you doing here?

853
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,305
I brought food.

854
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:28,243
- You know how precious sleep
is to me.

855
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:31,280
- I need to talk.
Sadie...

856
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,216
- Emmett is my friend,
and Keith is our neighbors' kid.

857
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:36,518
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Good.

858
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,523
I brought Dulce de Leche.

859
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:45,661
- You know I love you
more than almost anyone,

860
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:49,198
except Tyler and rob
and my mother... Sometimes.

861
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:56,238
But I'm starting
not to like you very much...

862
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,374
And I'd never
forgive you for that.

863
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,750
I need to not see you
for a while.

864
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,691
What about the book?

865
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,726
Screw you, Alice.

866
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,406
- You know what?
I...

867
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:07,142
can we just...
can we just not?

868
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,477
What?

869
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:12,414
I'm really tired.

870
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:15,284
- No, I don't...
I don't think so.

871
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,188
Okay.

872
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,791
- We did things.
- "Things"?

873
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,860
Things.

874
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,407
You hooked up.

875
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,475
Yeah.

876
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,256
Was it wonderful?

877
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,558
It should be wonderful.
Was it?

878
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,697
Mm...

879
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:04,666
- Please,
tell me about it...

880
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:07,669
come on,
how it was like.

881
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,410
Did he make you come?

882
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,319
I want to make you come.

883
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,656
I want to be first person
to make you come.

884
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,993
Come here.

885
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,902
Look at me.

886
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,479
Don't close your eyes.

887
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,748
Open your eyes.

888
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,982
Don't close your eyes.

889
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,551
That's not the way
we do it.

890
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,563
Look at me.

891
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,921
It's just something that I do,
that I've always done.

892
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,857
I see that look
in a guy's eyes,

893
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,993
like he wants me.

894
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,595
I don't know.

895
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,064
It's the only thing
that makes me feel real.

896
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,736
I want you.

897
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,805
I know.

898
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,508
So?

899
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:41,977
So it wears off.

900
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,679
Like...

901
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,948
I start wondering,
"what's wrong with this guy?

902
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,885
Why can't he do better?"

903
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,989
That is unbearably sad.

904
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,559
I know.

905
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,963
But I probably can.

906
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,136
Yeah.

907
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,103
Hey.

908
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,172
Give me a hug.

909
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,976
- I got a hose.
- Cool.

910
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,678
It's an ambush.

911
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,013
- Where's my hat?
I need to be protected.

912
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,082
Here you go.

913
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,290
- I can't not be your friend
for one more day.

914
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,359
With friends like you...

915
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,299
Honey, be careful.

916
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,702
- I figure if even you
can't put up with me,

917
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,704
I'm gonna have to do
something about it.

918
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,075
Yeah, you better.

919
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,981
- Aunt Alice,
emergency, emergency!

920
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:29,084
You're on fire!
- I am?

921
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,721
Say "help"!

922
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:34,956
Help.

923
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,827
Um, hi.
My name is Alice Harvey.

924
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,062
I am a volunteer
for people for the people,

925
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:42,831
and I'm calling you because...

926
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,866
This is such
an important election,

927
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:47,635
and it's so important
that you...

928
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:49,871
hello?

929
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,906
Hey, you made it.

930
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,041
Of course.

931
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,709
Come on in.

932
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:55,810
Hi, nice to meet you.

933
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,946
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

934
01:06:57,948 --> 01:06:59,314
Everyone, listen up.

935
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,016
Let's take
a little five-minute break.

936
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,617
Put your phones down.

937
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,686
This is Emmett Grant,

938
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,788
who founded
people for the people.

939
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,923
He is the guy
that got us all here tonight.

940
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,358
Whoo-hoo!

941
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,894
- I didn't get you here.
You got yourselves here.

942
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:16,364
Everybody take a look
around the room.

943
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,936
I forgot to thank our hostess
for this evening.

944
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:23,972
Thanks.

945
01:07:23,974 --> 01:07:25,807
Did you look around?

946
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,642
It's a room
full of people, right?

947
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:30,045
See, we reached out to you.

948
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,279
Tonight you're here.

949
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,881
You're reaching out
to others,

950
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,349
and then with any luck,

951
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,351
those others are
gonna reach out

952
01:07:36,353 --> 01:07:38,787
on election day
and fill in the right bubbles,

953
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:40,789
and maybe together,

954
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:44,159
we can change
the political landscape.

955
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:46,061
If not...

956
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:52,167
We can because it's
the reaching out that matters.

957
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:54,736
It's the reaching out that
scares the shit out of them,

958
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,372
even when our guys don't win.

959
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,174
So please, please,

960
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:01,209
just keep reaching out.

961
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,410
Thank you.
- Whoo-hoo.

962
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,913
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

963
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,748
That was a really nice speech.

964
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,983
- I should have known.
- Listen, I love you both.

965
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:11,086
- You've got
about five minutes.

966
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,359
- How could you use this event
for personal reasons?

967
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,261
That's not fair.

968
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,864
I wanted to help you. I know
how important this is to you.

969
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,766
Keep calling.

970
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,267
Emmett...

971
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,871
- no, actions
have consequences, Alice.

972
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,240
Hey, we got to move on.

973
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:35,944
I'm reaching out.

974
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:38,513
I have to go.

975
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:36,971
<I>- Please, please, please,
just keep reaching out.

976
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,345
- What would you like,
sport?

977
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,115
- I'd like to start
with the arugula salad, please.

978
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:49,284
- You know, the duck
is fabulous here.

979
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,953
You should try it.
- And I'd like the filet.

980
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:54,022
- Why don't you bring her
the duck?

981
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,124
Milan...

982
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:59,194
You want to tell them?

983
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:00,261
It's all your doing.

984
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:02,063
Bullshit.

985
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:06,267
Bookseller preorders for
"waking eyes," unbelievable.

986
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,203
We may have a best seller
on our hands.

987
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,838
- Oh.
- You're a genius, pal.

988
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,974
- Hayworth's
marketing department is.

989
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:15,877
- Okay,
so we're all geniuses.

990
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,579
Please pass the rolls.

991
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,280
Sylvio is good,

992
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:22,283
but not if he doesn't have
something great to sell.

993
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,885
- Could you pass
the rolls, please?

994
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,420
- Would you just stop
kissing each others' asses

995
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:26,821
and enjoy the moment?

996
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:28,022
- Do you have to be
so crude?

997
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,557
- Do you have to be
so smug?

998
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,060
I'm happy.

999
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:35,196
Not that you'd have any idea
what that feels like.

1000
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:37,031
- Mm-hmm.
I wonder why.

1001
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:41,603
- Actually, I'd like
to stick to the filet.

1002
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:43,571
Okay, sport.

1003
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:47,508
And duck for me
and a side of spinach.

1004
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:51,879
So can anybody explain to me
the appeal

1005
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,515
of that... that... that guy
in that movie.

1006
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:59,020
Oh, jeez, you know the one,
the one that won best picture.

1007
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,957
- I can messenger a copy
over today.

1008
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,458
Yes, I will hold.

1009
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,361
Hi.
Um, one second.

1010
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,230
Uh, yeah,
I'll send it right over.

1011
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:46,267
Okay, great.
Thanks.

1012
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,137
- My agent said
that you gave him my book.

1013
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,471
<I>Shit!

1014
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,441
- I'm not sure
I did you any favors.

1015
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:57,312
- I was actually working on
something new before all this,

1016
01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:01,015
and, um, I would love
if you could take a look.

1017
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,216
Yeah?

1018
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:06,020
It's my first chapter.

1019
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,923
- I-I'd love to.
Um...

1020
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,958
- Great.
- Thank you.

1021
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:46,094
Look into the camera.

1022
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,695
Wave to the camera.

1023
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,264
- Yes, Greenstreet
is coming.

1024
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:53,968
Terrific.
How many guests will that be?

1025
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,169
Okay, great.

1026
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,238
Thanks.

1027
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,378
Alice.

1028
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,047
- He's just finishing up a call.
He should be right out.

1029
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:09,417
Could I take you to lunch?

1030
01:13:09,419 --> 01:13:12,387
Why?

1031
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:14,489
- Sorry to make you wait.
Hot off the presses.

1032
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:17,291
One for you.
One for you.

1033
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,559
It's got the new dedication.

1034
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,361
- Oh, that's great.
- Nice, huh?

1035
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,430
Come in, come in.

1036
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,615
<I>- "Still she haunts me
phantomwise,

1037
01:13:40,617 --> 01:13:43,751
<I>"Alice moving under skies,

1038
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,487
<I>never seen by waking eyes. "

1039
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,360
Milan Daneker...

1040
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:54,162
he'll be reading
from his new novel,

1041
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:56,097
"waking eyes. "

1042
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,498
Mr. Daneker.

1043
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,639
- Thank you, Martin.
- Mm-hmm.

1044
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:06,707
Sorry.

1045
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,451
Yes.

1046
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,321
"She was slouching
under the weight

1047
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:23,658
"of a too-big book bag,

1048
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,161
"cracking her gum fiercely

1049
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,597
"like a line of defense.

1050
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,636
"But her eyes cried out,

1051
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,439
'love me.
Oh, please, love me. '"

1052
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:42,376
"'a little lonely,'
she said.

1053
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:46,247
"'My mom has no idea
who I am anymore,

1054
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:48,316
"but maybe she never did. '

1055
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:52,320
"she swayed
with a graceful pas de deux,

brimming with surprise"...

"Pleasure,
and ineffable sadness. "

1063
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:18,779
Thank you.

1064
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,691
Alice?

1065
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,867
Alice, what is it?

1066
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:46,307
- I have to tell
you something.

1067
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:50,645
Fantastic night.

1068
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:52,613
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're a natural.

1069
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,682
- No, I was terrified.
- You were great.

1070
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:55,883
Wasn't he great?
- Mm-hmm.

1071
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,451
Yes,
it went very well.

1072
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:58,786
- I can't believe
that woman

1073
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:00,454
from the New York review
of books was there.

1074
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,822
She was interesting.

1075
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,625
- She was eating
out of your hand.

1076
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:06,694
Ben.

1077
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,401
Alice, um...

1078
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,404
Your mother
told me what you said.

1079
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,905
I had to.

1080
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,809
- Yes, I told him
it wasn't true.

1081
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,411
What?

1082
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:25,680
- It isn't true?
- It's what he said.

1083
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:28,516
I asked him.
He said it's understandable.

1084
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:30,251
Yes.

1085
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:33,254
Like I told him, you maybe
misinterpreted it somehow.

1086
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,289
- Is that what it is,
Alice?

1087
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,725
- I think it's
what you wish were true.

1088
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,194
- Alice?
- Stop the car.

1089
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:43,631
- It's perfectly natural
to have feelings for someone

1090
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,633
that you look up to.
- I'm flattered.

1091
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:47,368
- I really... I don't know
what to think anymore.

1092
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:50,471
- He said he may have used
details from your life...

1093
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:51,806
Writers are magpies.

1094
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:54,241
- To make the character
more real.

1095
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,243
Please stop the car!

1096
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:57,845
Alice.

1097
01:16:57,847 --> 01:16:59,914
Alice!

1098
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,368
Hey.

1099
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,670
What are you doing here?

1100
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:24,739
Are you okay?

1101
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,943
Alice?

1102
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,352
Are you all right?

1103
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:41,656
Oh, please, please.

1104
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:44,425
It's, um...
- is this the new book?

1105
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:47,261
Yeah.

1106
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,797
- Whose life did
you appropriate this time?

1107
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,866
No one.

1108
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,638
Uh, well, there's bits
and pieces here and there.

1109
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,807
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1110
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,876
Yeah.

1111
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:16,290
- It was such
a long time ago.

1112
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:18,359
What?

1113
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,362
What...
- Alice.

1114
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:24,765
Was such a long time ago?

1115
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,002
Concrete details.

1116
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:31,305
You must give me concrete
details to make it real.

1117
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:34,642
- I know at that age,
little things seem enormous.

1118
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:36,544
Your warm...

1119
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:40,314
Heavy arms around me...

1120
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:43,784
The smoky taste
of your tongue in my mouth.

1121
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:45,386
I was helping you.

1122
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,555
- The feel of your hard-on
against my thigh.

1123
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:50,024
- But nothing really happened.
- Yes, it did!

1124
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:52,093
- Yes, well, you seemed
to enjoy it at the time.

1125
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:56,931
- You were one
of the few people who ever...

1126
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,967
Actually seemed to see me...

1127
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,705
To make me feel real
and important.

1128
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:07,041
- But you are.
- You used me.

1129
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:08,976
- Oh, come on.
- You abandoned me.

1130
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,911
- Alice...
- you made me feel

1131
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,481
like I was nothing
all over again.

1132
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:15,616
- Not nothing.
It's...

1133
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,753
It's a beautiful character.

1134
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,621
I know.

1135
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:25,526
And I've been living
in her shadow for 15 years.

1136
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,467
Good-bye, Milan.

1137
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,542
Hey, Emmett.

1138
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:17,077
What?

1139
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,146
Come here.

1140
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:23,651
- What?
Did Jeff screw up again?

1141
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:26,720
- No, I just got
a Google alert.

1142
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,865
<I>- Reaching out scares
the shit out of them,

1143
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:40,568
<I>even when
our guys don't win.

1144
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:44,839
<I>So please, please, please,
just keep reaching out.

1145
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,039
<I>Because I love you.

1146
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,579
- Gentlemen.
How are we?

1147
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:26,847
Where's Alice?

1148
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:31,585
- I haven't seen her yet.
Sadie?

1149
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:32,786
Where the hell is Alice?

1150
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:35,256
- She had something better
to do.

1151
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:36,757
- What?
- Wait. Who are you?

1152
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:38,959
Her best friend.

1153
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,828
Are you ready to read,
Mr. Daneker?

1154
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,029
I am.

1155
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,099
Walk this way.

1156
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,888
Some old lady

1157
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:12,059
with a slight beard
let me in.

1158
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:15,229
Mrs. Rayburn.

1159
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:17,298
Oh.

1160
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,239
Emmett...

1161
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:33,314
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1162
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:39,286
Thanks.

1163
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,555
- I might not be ready
to take on the world,

1164
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,691
but I think...

1165
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:45,859
That I can remember...

1166
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:49,029
To think
about one other person.

1167
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:51,332
Yeah?

1168
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:57,304
I'd like that to be you.

1169
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,776
I'll think about it.

1170
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,948
Okay.

1171
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,018
100 was really good.

1172
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:38,078
- You're the girl
in the book, aren't you?

1173
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:43,283
Not anymore.
