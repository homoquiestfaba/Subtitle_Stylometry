00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,275
NARRATOR: The events depicted
in the following program

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,177
represent Barbara
Noel's point of view.

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,345
This is her story.

4
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,151
SECRETARY (ON SPEAKER):
Dr. Masserman,

5
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,586
your meeting with
the Psychiatric

6
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,421
Association has been postponed.

7
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:29,415
Barbara, you
shouldn't be up so soon.

8
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,752
I'm hungry and I
think I need some air.

9
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,187
Will you be able to
get home all right?

10
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,122
You still seem rather shaky.

11
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,123
I'm fine.

12
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,959
Really just fine.

13
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,161
Be sure to take a cab.

14
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,996
And call me when you get home.

15
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,372
Next Tuesday at 9:00?

16
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,043
I don't know.

17
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,044
I'll call you.

18
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,386
Watch it, lady!

19
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,529
The nearest hospital.

20
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,530
Hurry.

21
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,723
I've just been raped.

22
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,293
NURSE (ON PA): Maintenance
unit to radiology.

23
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,728
Barbara?

24
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,729
I'm Donna.

25
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm with the Rape
Prevention Center.

26
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,834
I know what you're
going through.

27
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,638
Barbara, the police are here.

28
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,106
They're going to have to
ask you a few questions.

29
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,475
Can you do that now?

30
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,911
Ma'am, I'm Detective Lewis,
unit area one violent crimes.

31
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,813
This is my partner
Sergeant Carter.

32
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,814
Hello.

33
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,116
Why don't you tell
us what happened.

34
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,457
I could feel this weight
on top of me pinning me down.

35
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,298
And after a while, I
realized he was raping me.

36
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,801
I didn't know who it was.

37
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,975
I was just coming out of the
amytal and I was so groggy.

38
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:09,876
Amytal?

39
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,878
Sodium amytal, it's a drug.

40
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,012
You were on drugs.

41
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,080
No.

42
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,515
Yes.

43
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,517
I mean, sodium amytal is a drug.

44
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,852
But it's part of my therapy.

45
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,654
Dr. Masserman gives it to me.

46
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,022
Your doctor?

47
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,091
My psychiatrist.

48
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:29,696
I couldn't believe it, that
he was doing this to me.

49
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,596
Did you scream?

50
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,998
Did you fight him off?

51
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,067
No.

52
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,569
I wasn't supposed
to wake up so soon.

53
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,539
You are sure you aren't just
mad at your shrink, ma'am?

54
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,541
You know, upset about
something he did?

55
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,211
Of course I'm upset about
what he did, he raped me.

56
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,680
Isn't it possible that
you dreamed all this?

57
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,682
I mean, since you were under
the influence of drugs?

58
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,050
I woke up.

59
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,785
I told you, I woke up.

60
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,320
It wasn't a dream.

61
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,421
You're sure.

62
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,322
It happened.

63
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,223
He raped me.

64
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,191
I know he did.

65
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,092
That's enough.

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,059
Please stop pushing her.

67
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,260
But you could
have been dreaming?

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,931
I could have
been, but I wasn't.

69
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,734
Well, we'll be in touch.

70
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,670
As soon as the test
results come in.

71
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,571
Thank you.

72
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,072
Thank you.

73
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,808
NURSE (ON PA): Lab
313 to emergency.

74
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,009
Lab 313 to emergency.

75
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,245
You don't believe
me either, do you?

76
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,714
Yes, I do.

77
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,715
It happened to me, too.

78
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,019
Barbara, you have to get
some help from somebody who

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,156
knows how to deal with this.

80
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,259
This is the card of a
psychiatrist I know.

81
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,762
I think you'd really like her.

82
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,030
You think after what I've
been through that I would

83
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,633
want to see another shrink.

84
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,335
You must really think I'm crazy.

85
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,004
NURSE (ON PA): Dr.
Daniels to emergency.

86
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,072
Dr. Daniels to emergency.

87
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,074
Please take this.

88
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,642
I'm getting out of here.

89
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,643
I'm going home.

90
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,491
[sobbing]

91
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,453
Hi, Dick.

92
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,354
Hi, Mary.

93
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,689
It's Barbara.

94
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,057
I wish you guys were home.

95
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,693
I really needed to talk to you.

96
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,994
But you aren't there.

97
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,298
It's OK.

98
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,299
It's OK.

99
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,523
Showtime, Curt, showtime.

100
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,158
You're late.

101
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,264
(SINGING) Walk in
the sun once more.

102
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,401
Can't go on.

103
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,471
Everything I have is gone.

104
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,839
Stormy weather.

105
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,711
Just can't get my
poor self together.

106
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,784
Keeps raining all the time.

107
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,693
Keeps raining all the time.

108
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:29,035
Keeps raining all the time.

109
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,314
[applause]

110
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,819
Barbara Noel,
ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,187
We're the Curt Times
Trio, and we're just

112
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,221
going to take a short break.

113
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,172
I need it, OK?

114
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,375
Tonight, I need it.

115
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,311
What's so special
about tonight?

116
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,580
You sound just like
an ex-husband of mine.

117
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,915
We've got to talk about this.

118
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,750
You're drinking is
interfering with the group.

119
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,986
It's not doing any of
us any good ignoring it.

120
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,722
Didn't I give you your
money's worth up there?

121
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,056
You're the best.

122
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,125
And you always are.

123
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,460
But someday you're
going to believe that

124
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,198
and I won't be able to
afford to hire you anymore.

125
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,433
Barbara, I don't understand.

126
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,836
Whatever it is
you're going through,

127
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,405
I want to be there for you.

128
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,874
I want to help.

129
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,644
I think I could if you'd let me.

130
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,214
Did something happened today?

131
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,882
Let's just say I woke up.

132
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,719
Barbara?

133
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,526
Barbara, it's Mary.

134
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,328
Barbara, are you in there?

135
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,935
Barbara, what happened?

136
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:10,903
We've been so worried.

137
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,838
That message you
left on our machine.

138
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,573
The phone has been
out all morning.

139
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,443
Mary, please.

140
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,377
Barbara.

141
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,780
Barbara, get dressed.

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,582
I just brought Dick home this
morning from the hospital.

143
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,051
You're coming to
our house for lunch.

144
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,052
Come on.

145
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,756
And then this
morning, the police

146
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,527
called and said they won't be
filing charges because there's

147
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,429
no trace of semen in the tests.

148
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,297
They say it must have
been just a dream.

149
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,274
Barbara, tell me right now
and don't even stop to think.

150
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,842
Were you dreaming?

151
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,344
No.

152
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,548
But I wish I had been.

153
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,118
Jules Masserman,
it's unbelievable

154
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,954
that a person of his reputation
could do such a thing.

155
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,228
And I can't tell you how angry
I am that he did this to you.

156
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,664
I trusted him.

157
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:17,002
First thing we're gonna do,
we're gonna get you a lawyer.

158
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,771
But you're my lawyer.

159
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,540
I'm in entertainment law.

160
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,908
That's no help.

161
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,877
I can't be any help.

162
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,979
No, no.

163
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,547
Is that what you
want to do, Barbara?

164
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,850
I mean, do you want
to take him to court?

165
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,320
She can't just let
Masserman walk away from this.

166
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
Dick, that's her decision.

167
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,425
The police said there's
no physical evidence.

168
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,160
There's no semen.

169
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,928
Masserman could have
been wearing a condom.

170
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,464
Did anyone think of that?

171
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,300
Well, forget about the police.

172
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,870
I'm going to get you the
best trial lawyer in Chicago.

173
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,386
Barbara, Jocelyn
Samuels, please sit down.

174
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,622
Thank you.

175
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,559
Dick Shelton, my friend
spoke so highly of you.

176
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,761
And he thinks it's great you're
being a woman, considering

177
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,931
the kind of case this is.

178
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,667
You're an actress.

179
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,803
A singer mainly
and a composer.

180
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,607
I do some acting and singing
in commercials and industrials.

181
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,577
I see you were in
therapy quite some time.

182
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,678
Well, yes.

183
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,380
But most of the time
I'd see Dr. Masserman

184
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,448
just like I would a friend,
you know, just to talk.

185
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,156
I'm sorry that
I can't help you.

186
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,424
I'm comfortable financially.

187
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,692
I can afford to
pay you, if that's

188
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,260
what you're worried about.

189
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,263
No, there's no case.

190
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,500
There's no evidence to
prove rape, no witnesses.

191
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,170
It's your word against his,
against Jules Masserman,

192
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,773
former President of the American
Psychiatric Association,

193
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,541
the American Academy
of Psychoanalysis,

194
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,276
current president of
the World Association

195
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,378
of Social Psychiatry.

196
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,382
As I said, there's no case.

197
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,284
But thank you for coming in.

198
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,722
Thank you.

199
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,645
I'm sorry, Ms. Noel, but
your prescription has expired.

200
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,380
I have to give Dr.
Masserman a call.

201
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,414
No, never mind.

202
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,485
Right across the way.

203
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,486
OK.

204
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,740
Hello, I'm Barbara Noel.

205
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,275
I just called about
seeing Dr. Galanti.

206
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,010
Oh, you're lucky you
called right after my 3

207
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,044
o'clock had canceled.

208
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,312
I was just about to go home.

209
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm Dr. Galanti.

210
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
My receptionist
is off sick today.

211
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,929
Who did you say
referred you to me?

212
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,733
Donna, I can't
remember her last name.

213
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,769
Look, all I really
need is a prescription

214
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,871
renewed for some Valium.

215
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,339
Is that all?

216
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,540
What is this,
a trick question?

217
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,644
Are you hungry?

218
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,780
I have an extra sandwich.

219
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,948
You really should eat, you know.

220
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,050
It's better than Valium any day.

221
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,786
And that's your
prescription, a sandwich?

222
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,088
That's what I get for taking
a referral from a stranger.

223
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,222
Why are you so angry?

224
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,691
Because I don't
want to be here.

225
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,831
Look, I just need something
to take the edge off.

226
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,766
Doesn't the drinking help?

227
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,867
I haven't been drinking.

228
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,768
Not today.

229
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,170
Very perceptive.

230
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,707
I just see what's in front of
me, a woman who's very upset.

231
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,015
Have you been
in therapy before?

232
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,323
Have I been in therapy?

233
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,663
You know Jules Masserman?

234
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,131
Yes.

235
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,467
I woke up during one of my
sessions and he was on top

236
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,503
of me raping me.

237
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,138
Jules Masserman?

238
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,272
Go ahead, tell
me I made it up.

239
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,741
Tell me I dreamt it all.

240
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,511
I wouldn't think
of telling you that.

241
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,413
How long were you
seeing Dr. Masserman?

242
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,914
Just give me the damn Valium.

243
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,452
I'll tell you
what, why don't you

244
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:05,124
sit down and talk to
me for half an hour

245
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,760
and then I'll assess
the situation.

246
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,362
And if I think it's appropriate,
I'll give you the prescription.

247
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,968
Half an hour.

248
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,605
Now how did all
this get started?

249
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,808
What sent you to Dr.
Masserman in the first place?

250
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,711
I wasn't crazy or anything.

251
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:30,749
I was performing in a band
with my husband Richard.

252
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,721
I just needed some
control over my singing.

253
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:43,295
(SINGING) Can't help
loving that man of mine.

254
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:51,136
When he goes away,
that's a rainy day.

255
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:56,975
But when he comes
back, the day is fine.

256
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,144
The sun will shine.

257
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,217
He can come home
as late as can be.

258
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,121
Home without him just
ain't home to me.

259
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,122
Ca--

260
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,596
Take a break, guys.

261
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,497
OK, guys.

262
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,498
Five minutes.

263
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,472
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,707
I got dizzy.

265
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,075
My voice again.
- Don't worry.

266
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,243
- I panicked.
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

267
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,678
I'm right here.
I'm here with you.

268
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
I know.

269
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,647
And then I get afraid
of letting you down

270
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,618
and it builds inside
me, all this panic.

271
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,386
And my voice just dies on me.

272
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,192
Maybe you should
get another singer.

273
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,965
What are you saying?

274
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,467
I want us to be together and
I want us to work together.

275
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,302
So whatever it is,
we'll figure it out.

276
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,637
We'll get you the help.

277
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,676
So we checked around.

278
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,546
Someone told us
about Dr. Masserman.

279
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,849
His credentials were impressive.

280
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:14,887
I couldn't believe my luck
when he was willing to take me.

281
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,488
Mrs. Noel, won't you come in?

282
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,492
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

283
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,475
Now, young lady, what seems
to have brought you here?

284
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,678
Are you having problems with
your husband, Mrs. Noel?

285
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,214
It's Noel.

286
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,815
And it's not problems
with my husband.

287
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,954
He's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

288
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,322
I just don't know what
I'd do without him

289
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,823
and I love him so much.

290
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,026
Maybe that's the problem.

291
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,362
I want to be everything to him,
the best wife, the best singer.

292
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,397
We perform together.

293
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,765
He's a musician.

294
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:06,038
And lately at rehearsal and
sometimes even in performance,

295
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:06,939
I lose my voice.

296
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,574
It just stops.

297
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,776
And I know I've been told
by my doctor there's nothing

298
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,011
physically wrong with me.

299
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,314
So you lose your voice.

300
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,183
Well, we'll have to look in
to see what that's all about.

301
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,285
And the more it
happens, the more I panic.

302
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,788
And I just don't understand why.

303
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,023
I mean, music, it's
always been something

304
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,992
I could count on in my life.

305
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,996
I myself play the
violin, you know, Mozart.

306
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:35,300
Mozart is my source of serenity.

307
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,903
My dear young lady,
I'm quite sure

308
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,473
that the problems you've brought
me can eventually be resolved.

309
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,943
And someday, in two years,
perhaps even as little as one,

310
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,512
I believe that with my
guidance, a different woman

311
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,847
will be sitting opposite me.

312
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:59,024
I trusted him about
everything, about the amytal,

313
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,727
about every aspect of my life.

314
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,395
Sodium amytal?

315
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:08,267
He gave it to me to access
deeply repressed memories.

316
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,737
Yes, it can be used as a
form of short psychotherapy.

317
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,505
Short?

318
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,340
How often did
he give it to you?

319
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,045
I would get amytal all
the time, two or three times

320
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,148
a month, often every week.

321
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,149
For years?

322
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,256
This is outrageous.

323
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,159
It should have never been
administered so frequently.

324
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,695
Sodium amytal can cause
respiratory failure.

325
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,231
And it is extremely addictive.

326
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll tell you what
I was addicted to,

327
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,702
I was addicted to him.

328
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,737
I needed him in my life.

329
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,005
I thought he cared.

330
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,940
I thought he was the only
person who could help me.

331
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,347
You don't believe me.

332
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,617
You don't believe what
he did to me, do you?

333
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,820
Barbara, I need to know more.

334
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,888
It's too late.

335
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,189
Your half hour is
used up, Dr. Galanti.

336
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,757
Now can I have my prescription?

337
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,626
I'm going to give you
a small prescription,

338
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,227
Barbara, because
you need something

339
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,196
to help calm yourself.

340
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,299
This is not the solution.

341
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,170
I wish you would think about
seeing me on a regular basis.

342
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,739
You're hiding from serious
problems that haven't ended

343
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,374
because you left Dr. Masserman.

344
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,752
BARBARA (ON PHONE): Hi,
sorry I can't take your call,

345
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,189
but leave me a message and
I'll get right back to you.

346
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,191
DR. MASSERMAN (ON PHONE):
Barbara, It's Dr. Masserman,

347
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,192
are you there?

348
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,597
Barbara, please
pick up the phone.

349
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,667
Barbara, I'm so
concerned about you.

350
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,369
You never called
after our last session

351
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,972
and you missed your
regular appointment.

352
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,708
Now don't hide from me, Barbara,
you know I can help you.

353
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,896
Ah, hey, look at that.

354
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,631
Isn't it a bit early
for hockey season.

355
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,769
No, it's never too
early for hockey.

356
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,205
Blackhawks, team.

357
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:32,577
Did I-- did you know that
I played hockey in college?

358
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,112
Maybe you missed your calling.

359
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,616
I wish.

360
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,520
Let's sit, OK?

361
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,721
No, no, I'm fine.

362
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,056
Mary made me promise
you'd take it easy, so sit.

363
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,344
So did you get a hold of that
new lawyer that I recommended?

364
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,480
Dick, what's the point?

365
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,116
What's the point?

366
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,820
Barbara, you have got to fight.

367
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,588
It's a terrible
thing that happened.

368
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,858
And the only way that you
are ever going to get over it

369
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,794
is if you fight
for what's right.

370
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:23,929
You know what
that psychiatrist

371
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,966
said to me, Dr. Galanti?

372
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,534
She said Dr. Masserman
shouldn't have

373
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,636
been giving the amytal
treatments all this time.

374
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:39,511
And I've been thinking,
what if he raped me before?

375
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,246
I wouldn't have known.

376
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,515
How could you have known?

377
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,251
I can't get people to
believe he did this to me.

378
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,119
And you're gonna
let that stop you?

379
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,100
Were you ever attracted
to Dr. Masserman, Ms Noel?

380
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,035
No, Mr. Flynn.

381
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,471
I never entertained the
slightest romantic or sexual

382
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:10,108
fantasy about Dr. Masserman.

383
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,410
I felt more about
him like a father.

384
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,013
I'm sorry, but the
question is bound to come up.

385
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,649
And it's better for you
to be prepared for it.

386
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,252
Well, based on what
you've told me,

387
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,621
I think we have enough
here to file a civil suit.

388
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,757
Excuse me, but are you
saying I have a case?

389
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,858
Oh, yes, absolutely.

390
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,528
In fact, I think you
have a very good case.

391
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,631
Now if you prefer, we can use
a Jane Doe with this complaint

392
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,832
to keep your name private.

393
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,334
Otherwise it will become
a matter of public record.

394
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,570
I'm not worried about
being embarrassed.

395
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,239
I want people to know
what he did to me.

396
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,074
Right.

397
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:47,779
Then it's Barbara Noel
versus Jules Masserman.

398
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,781
[phone ringing]

399
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,052
Hello?

400
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,922
Ms. Noel, it's Dr.
Masserman calling.

401
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,690
I've been quite
concerned about you.

402
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,392
Are you all right?

403
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,528
You cancelled your appointments.

404
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,730
I think it's time you
came in to see me.

405
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,198
Don't you?

406
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,203
If you have any questions,
please call my lawyer.

407
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,204
Just a minute.

408
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,616
555-3809.

409
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,117
Barbara, are you suing me?

410
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,614
I'm glad you
came back, Barbara.

411
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,415
I had hoped that you would.

412
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,184
I want to get over this.

413
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,019
That's what you're supposed
to do when you've been raped,

414
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,520
isn't it, get some counseling?

415
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,489
Well, your coming here today,
whether you know it or not,

416
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,691
represents real progress.

417
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,793
I want to stop
being so afraid.

418
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,061
What you're
suffering from right

419
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,896
now is really quite normal.

420
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,566
It's called post-traumatic
stress disorder.

421
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,602
It's what happens to soldiers
who return from combat

422
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,738
and to victims of violent acts.

423
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,611
What is it, Barbara?

424
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,612
What are you thinking?

425
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,717
This is so sick.

426
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,090
I don't know.

427
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,558
I'm even ashamed to say it.

428
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,533
Part of me misses him.

429
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,036
That's normal, too.

430
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,304
You were seeing him for years.

431
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,708
Patients often become dependent
on their psychiatrist.

432
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,610
But I wasn't just a patient.

433
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,944
I was special.

434
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,513
Every patient
wants to feel special

435
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,783
and wants to feel that
they're the favorite child.

436
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,185
I was different.

437
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,055
He'd bring me back
gifts from his trips.

438
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,926
Sometimes he'd ask me out
in his plane or on his boat.

439
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,028
Once he even invited me
to go with him to Paris.

440
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,369
Yet like David facing
Goliath, all we have is our aim

441
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,071
and the knowledge
passed on to us

442
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,308
by our great ones,
Freud, Jung, Adler.

443
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,645
They understood, as
William Shakespeare did,

444
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,649
that the fault, dear
Brutus, is not in our stars

445
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,883
but in ourselves.

446
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,453
[applause]

447
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,723
Marvelous.

448
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,690
Thank you, Nigel.

449
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,759
Mrs. Masserman,
this is my wife Helen.

450
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,527
Oh, I'm not Mrs. Masserman.

451
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,462
I'm Barbara Noel.

452
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,097
I'm a friend of Dr. Masserman's.

453
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,898
It must be your divine
music that attracts

454
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,168
such a beautiful woman.

455
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,037
Dr. Masserman,
you embarrass me.

456
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,306
Now, now, my dear child.

457
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,441
This isn't a Chicago suburb.

458
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,977
There's no point in
trying to explain it.

459
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,913
To your health and to
the wonders of Paris.

460
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,184
Barbara, everything
you've just told me,

461
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,121
the gifts, the
afternoon on his boat,

462
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:20,024
the trip to Paris, that's
all incorrect, inappropriate

463
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,926
therapeutic behavior.

464
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,394
But I went along with it.

465
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,130
I guess I encouraged it.

466
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,998
You are not the
guilty one here.

467
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,267
Masserman is the one
who knows what good

468
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,936
therapy is and what it isn't.

469
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,372
He took advantage of you.

470
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,074
I thought he cared.

471
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,910
Not in a romantic way, I
thought he cared about me.

472
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,647
Barbara, given what you said
about the amytal treatments

473
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,251
and here in his own
book, Dr. Masserman

474
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,921
writes that the drug should
not be used in most cases

475
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,657
and that any gains achieved
during the drug interview,

476
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,894
and this is a quote,
"offer no lasting advantage

477
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,695
unless they are
reviewed and applied

478
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,965
by the patient in actual life."

479
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,468
So what did Dr.
Masserman talk to you

480
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,103
about after the amytal sessions?

481
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,145
We never talk.

482
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,816
He never told me anything
about what I had said.

483
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,651
And when was the first
time he gave you amytal?

484
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:29,861
It was I guess around the
time of my father's death.

485
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,830
I couldn't stop crying.

486
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,233
I couldn't sleep.

487
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,036
And then one day
after a session,

488
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,706
he said he wanted to
see me with my husband.

489
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,541
Now let me tell you
about this drug therapy

490
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,710
that I call the sodium
amytal interview.

491
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,579
I've used it with great success.

492
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,680
A drug?

493
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,781
What kind of drug?

494
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,250
It's a short
acting barbiturate.

495
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,452
Barbiturates are
addictive, aren't they?

496
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,486
Yes, of course.

497
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,121
But how can I become
addicted when only

498
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,657
I can administer it to her?

499
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,392
Well, how often would
she have to go through it?

500
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,061
Well, now that's
very difficult to say.

501
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,897
See each patient has different
responses, different needs.

502
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:09,033
But I can assure you it is a
very safe and even pleasant

503
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,702
experience.

504
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,204
Now I suggest this therapy
to speed up the process

505
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,773
so we can access Barbara's
unconscious more easily

506
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,175
so we can get down to
talking about what's

507
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,944
really bothering her.

508
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,313
Well, Barbara,
you know, I mean,

509
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,115
you're the one who
has to go through it

510
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,116
so it's your decision.

511
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,056
So it's all detailed
right in here.

512
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,959
This is my book, "Practice
of Dynamic Psychiatry."

513
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,860
Take it home.

514
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,262
Read it carefully.

515
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,468
I thought the
amytal would help me.

516
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,603
And Richard said he just
wanted me to be happy.

517
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,843
Ah, yes, Mrs. Noel.

518
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,278
Why don't you go into
my examination room

519
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,914
and get yourself ready.

520
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,048
What do I need to do?

521
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,183
Oh, disrobe, take off
whatever constricts you,

522
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,953
and get under the blanket.

523
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,888
You want me to
take off my clothes?

524
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,723
No, I want you
to be comfortable.

525
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,126
You'll be asleep for several
hours after the therapy.

526
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,527
No need to wrinkle
you're pretty dress.

527
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:36,988
I'm ready.

528
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,830
Are you comfortable?

529
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,404
Now, it's your job not to
worry about anything, my dear.

530
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,353
Now make a fist.

531
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,021
I really, really hate shots.

532
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:10,922
Why?

533
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,090
You have such lovely veins.

534
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,397
There.

535
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,602
Now you'll start to feel drowsy.

536
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,338
And I'll ask you
a few questions.

537
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,173
And you'll be able
to answer in ways you

538
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:32,110
couldn't without the amytal.

539
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,747
Whole new areas of
memory will open.

540
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,815
Your subconscious will
reveal itself to you

541
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,451
in new and exciting ways.

542
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,621
You know, Barbara, sometimes
this world can seem

543
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,590
like a very frightening place.

544
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,162
But now you'll begin to
relax, to feel safe and happy.

545
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:55,967
And all the bad feelings of
the past will begin to melt,

546
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,301
melt away.

547
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,542
You feel nice, huh?

548
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,547
A little too nice?

549
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,782
Here come the steps.

550
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,682
Are you looking?

551
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,683
Mm-hmm.

552
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:30,301
What happened to
you and Richard?

553
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,236
I thought the amytal
would bring us together.

554
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,875
I never read his book.

555
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,211
Why would you?

556
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,446
He was the expert.

557
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,281
You trusted him.

558
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,384
People don't question
their doctors.

559
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,452
I trusted him.

560
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,523
Even though sometimes my
instincts were telling me

561
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,659
something was wrong.

562
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:59,130
The air was filled with
the smell of honeysuckle

563
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,200
and it gets so hot.

564
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,971
Everything would slow down and
become like a dream, a trance.

565
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,807
Are all your childhood
memories happy ones, Barbara?

566
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,409
Oh, yeah.

567
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,710
All my friends
when I was little,

568
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,779
they'd say if they had their
pick, they'd choose mine,

569
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,780
my family.

570
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,918
Seems like our session
has come to an end.

571
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,763
Doctor, last time I
noticed after the amytal

572
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,333
I had these bruises on my arms.

573
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,467
And?

574
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,469
I wondered how I got them.

575
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,472
Mrs. Noel, sometimes
you flail your arms

576
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,375
during the amytal interview
and I have to restrain you.

577
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,343
I'm sorry if you're bruised.

578
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,812
You bruise easily, huh?

579
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,714
Yes.

580
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,116
But I even have a
bruise on my pubic bone.

581
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,520
How did I get that?

582
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,388
How dare you.

583
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,658
How dare you occupy my time with
these silly trivial concerns.

584
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,861
How and where you bruise
is of no concern to me.

585
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,596
And if you ever raise
your voice to me again,

586
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,598
you'll never get
another drop of amytal.

587
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:11,135
You understand me, Mrs. Noel?

588
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,704
What were you
afraid of, Barbara?

589
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,540
Learning the truth?

590
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,942
Or getting cut off from amytal?

591
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,911
You keep saying that, but
I'm not addicted to amytal.

592
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,811
How could I be?

593
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,079
I haven't had any in weeks.

594
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,115
No, you're drinking.

595
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,185
You're drinking gin, am I right?

596
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,487
Gin is the closest
thing to an amytal high.

597
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,294
Barbara, I know how difficult
it is for you to trust again,

598
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,896
but I need you to trust me.

599
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,199
You may have much
deeper problems.

600
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,401
And I think that
we can get to them

601
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,169
by meeting on a regular basis.

602
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,105
And then maybe someday
when you're ready,

603
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,308
I would like to try
hypnosis with you.

604
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,943
Hypnosis, why hypnosis?

605
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,080
I think it would help us, help
us uncover something important

606
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,416
since Dr. Masserman
never revealed what came

607
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,617
out of the amytal sessions.

608
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,997
Mr. Flynn, hi.

609
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,533
You wanted to see me.

610
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,704
Yes, Barbara, I did.

611
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,074
This is Masserman's resume.

612
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,576
It's 30 pages long.

613
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:29,146
It lists his awards, all
the books he's written,

614
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,216
president of this,
president of that for life.

615
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,884
You sound surprised.

616
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,020
You knew how important he is.

617
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,588
Important?

618
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,524
Barbara, this man
is beyond important.

619
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,527
I mean, he's a
giant in his field.

620
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,696
Look, I've talked to all
kinds of psychiatrists.

621
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:49,033
No one is willing to
testify against Masserman.

622
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,902
It's down to your
word against his.

623
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,038
And the bottom line is--

624
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,207
the bottom line is I
can't win this case.

625
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,275
I'm going to have to withdraw.

626
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,175
But you can't.

627
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,011
You already filed the complaint.

628
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:03,281
I'm sorry, but I didn't get
in this business to suffer

629
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,583
personal embarrassment.

630
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,585
And you, according
to this letter

631
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,454
that I received from
Masserman's attorney,

632
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,989
are a very troubled person.

633
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:17,428
Barbara, it's Masserman's expert
opinion that you're unstable.

634
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,863
They got to you, didn't they?

635
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,269
You have three weeks
to find a new attorney

636
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,905
or the court will
dismiss the complaint.

637
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,941
You want my advice,
Barbara, give it up.

638
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,111
You're not believable.

639
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,112
They'll cut you to pieces.

640
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:39,917
Good day, Mr. Flynn.

641
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:58,569
(SINGING) But for
tonight, forget it.

642
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:06,711
I'm in the mood for love.

643
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,255
Barbara Noel,
ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,390
We're going to
take a short break.

645
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,391
We'll be right back.

646
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,461
Be right there.

647
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,339
I'll pick up in the next set.

648
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,508
If there is a next set.

649
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,576
It's not the drinking.

650
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,379
I'm under a lot of pressure.

651
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,215
Yeah.

652
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,418
Well, me too, pressure
from the guys.

653
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,486
They're getting fed up.

654
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,754
There's not enough gigs.

655
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,389
We're losing ones we've
always been able to count on.

656
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,423
They're not happy, Barbara.

657
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,058
Neither am I.
- What are you saying?

658
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,226
I'm fired?
You want to fire me?

659
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,160
Is that it?

660
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,028
What the hell is
going on with you?

661
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,530
It's like nobody
exists besides you.

662
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,332
You're all locked up in
your own little world.

663
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,707
Curt, I--

664
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,741
What?

665
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,543
There's something
I need to tell you.

666
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,850
It's OK, Curt,
nobody believes me.

667
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,653
I've been through
two lawyers already.

668
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,924
My friend Dick's got a
new one lined up for me.

669
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,094
Why didn't you tell me
about all this before?

670
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,662
It's an old habit.

671
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,997
I can only talk
about my feelings

672
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,233
to people who charge
me a lot of money.

673
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,569
I can send you a bill if
it makes you feel any better.

674
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,208
Barbara, sometimes
I look at you and I

675
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,342
feel like you're made of glass.

676
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,715
You're so fragile,
you could break

677
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,017
just from being looked at.

678
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:59,256
And I want to do is hold you
and keep you from breaking.

679
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,931
I'm OK.

680
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:07,932
I'll be OK.

681
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,502
Sorry.

682
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,643
Well, we better get back.

683
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,814
At least 10 people down there
are hungry for our music.

684
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:31,856
Barbara, this-- this thing that
happened to you, don't give up.

685
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,468
Ken Carroll, Barbara,
pleased to meet you.

686
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:45,369
Hello.

687
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,403
Sit down.

688
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,404
Thank you.

689
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,075
How is Dick?

690
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,910
Is his condition any better?

691
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,579
He's in the hospital this
week for more cancer tests,

692
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,015
but he's hanging in there.

693
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,684
I've discussed your case
with some of my colleagues

694
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,053
here at the law school.

695
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,723
The first thing is the rape.

696
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:09,393
It's extremely doubtful that
we can prove that it happened.

697
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,795
I'm used to hearing this.

698
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,430
Look, if you don't
think I have a case--

699
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,201
Barbara, the rape is
difficult to prove because you

700
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,236
perceive Masserman's
behavior coming

701
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,405
out of a semi-conscious state.

702
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:24,375
But I think we got him
on the sodium amytal.

703
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,143
I've talked to a few
experts and they all

704
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,646
agree that it's
unusual, if not to say

705
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,714
highly dangerous
that he administered

706
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,350
it to you as often as he did.

707
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,286
Whatever he did to me
with the sodium amytal

708
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,288
just doesn't
compare to the rape.

709
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,256
Barbara, I want
you to know that I

710
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,659
think you'd be thoroughly
credible in the courtroom.

711
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,661
But if you let me go
after him on the issue

712
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,564
of medical malpractice,
then you've got

713
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,332
yourself legal representation.

714
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,703
It's a very important
case, Barbara,

715
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,004
one I think we can win.

716
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,684
Good morning, Dr. Masserman.

717
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,158
What do you think he's
telling me with that look?

718
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,726
Case closed?

719
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,728
This is simply
Masserman's deposition,

720
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,129
his side of the story.

721
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,231
It's not a case yet, not until
the judge decides that there's

722
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,600
enough to go to trial with.

723
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,168
Most important thing
we've got to do

724
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,338
is to get him to admit that
he gave you the sodium amytal.

725
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,239
If he doesn't, we're dead.

726
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,410
We have no other way
of proving he did.

727
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,481
Doctor, how would
you describe Ms. Noel?

728
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,285
I would say that she is
personality maladaptable,

729
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,054
with episodes of
anxiety and depression

730
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,457
and suicidal preoccupation.

731
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,726
I see, and in layman's terms?

732
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,962
She's always having
unfortunate relations with men.

733
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,632
And after these
promiscuous affairs,

734
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:59,169
she is subject to self isolation
and episodes of alcoholism.

735
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,071
Her insistence on
being a singer is also

736
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,107
a source of depression for her.

737
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,542
She sang a little bit in
my office and I could tell,

738
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,745
I could judge from her
voice that she was not

739
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,748
likely to become a prima donna.

740
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,350
Now doctor, in your
treatment program,

741
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,086
what was to be the
role of sodium amytal?

742
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,821
It was used only
when she was seriously

743
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,392
depressed, agitated,
and required

744
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,260
relief from excessive tension.

745
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,564
So you admit to administering
sodium amytal to Barbara Noel?

746
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,466
Yes, certainly.

747
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,901
Now, doctor, how
often did you administer

748
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,703
sodium amytal to Ms. Noel?

749
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,306
Well, I have no way of
knowing this for certain.

750
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,575
Was it once a year?

751
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,510
It depends on the year.

752
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,411
Twice a year?

753
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,578
10 times a year?

754
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,013
I really can't say.

755
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,548
You can't?
Why not?

756
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,582
You don't remember?

757
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,818
You don't have any
records to refer to?

758
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,653
At this time I would like
to produce Dr. Masserman's

759
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,922
notes regarding Ms. Noel.

760
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,029
Three pages?

761
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,635
These three pages are the
totality of your notes

762
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,704
on Ms. Noel's treatment?

763
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,539
To my knowledge, yes, sir.

764
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,607
Well, doctor, I
mean, these don't add

765
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,211
up to almost 10 years of notes.

766
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,613
I mean, how can you possibly
describe her case to us?

767
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,017
Do you know how many
times you saw her?

768
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,252
I can't tell
you how many times

769
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,456
I treated this patient, sir.

770
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,792
We're trying to determine,
doctor, how often you injected

771
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,561
Ms. Noel with sodium amytal.

772
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,629
Was it once a month?

773
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,530
Five times a month?

774
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,598
10 times a month?

775
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,701
Perhaps once every
three or four months,

776
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,203
depending on her needs.

777
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:40,237
Good.

778
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,805
Thank you.

779
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:46,043
So according to your own count,
over the course of 10 years,

780
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,513
you injected Ms. Noel with
sodium amytal at least

781
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,349
30 times, even though
the best medical opinion

782
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,585
states that she could
have become dangerously

783
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:55,986
addicted as a result.

784
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,888
I do not agree with that, sir.

785
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,458
Amytal is not addictive
because it is a category 2 drug

786
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,927
and can be obtained
only by prescription.

787
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,196
And that is your explanation
of an addictive drug,

788
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,998
that a patient can
obtain it on the street?

789
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,637
Do you recognize this book?

790
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:17,341
Yes, sir, I am the author
of that book and many others.

791
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,344
Do you stand by the
statements in this book,

792
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,580
"The Practice of
Dynamic Psychiatry?"

793
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,450
Of course I do.

794
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,453
Doctor, would you read
the underlined text?

795
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,397
Sodium amytal drug sessions
offer no lasting advantage

796
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,500
and are contraindicated
in most cases.

797
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,636
And doctor, would you
explain in layman's terms,

798
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,171
what contraindicated means?

799
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:52,843
Yes, it means, sir, that a
procedure or drug is not to be

800
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,311
used in a particular case.

801
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,181
But Ms. Noel's case
was entirely different.

802
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,649
Entirely different.

803
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,750
Yes, it was.

804
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,518
And we're getting to
that, doctor, right now.

805
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,055
September 21 of last year.

806
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,358
You administered sodium amytal
to Ms. Noel on that day,

807
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,726
did you not, doctor?

808
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,663
She had requested the amytal
on two previous occasions.

809
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,299
And I thought it inappropriate
to give it to her then.

810
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,401
But this time she had
been drinking again.

811
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,103
Therefore she again
requested the amytal.

812
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,073
So I asked her to go
into the next room

813
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,876
and as usual make
herself ready for it.

814
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,245
What did you mean
by make herself ready?

815
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,682
As is usual, to lie down on
the cot, cover herself over,

816
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,318
and have only her arm
available for the amytal.

817
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,919
I never asked her to disrobe.

818
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:36,854
She did so and so--

819
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:37,721
Objection.

820
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:38,989
I want that last
remark stricken.

821
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:43,160
Doctor, do you deny lying
upon Ms. Noel in that room

822
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,263
where you administered sodium
amytal on September 21?

823
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,564
- Yes, sir.
- OK, that's it.

824
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,465
That's enough.

825
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,000
My client needs to take a break.

826
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,669
Doctor, under your
care, this woman

827
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,872
who you described as
merely maladjusted

828
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,141
became addicted to
sodium amytal and then

829
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,044
to alcohol when the sodium
amytal wasn't available.

830
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,981
She did not turn into
an alcoholic in my care.

831
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,016
She elected to become one.

832
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,619
Doctor, she was
under your care.

833
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,854
You injected her
with sodium amytal,

834
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,258
by your own count over
30 times, if not more,

835
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,394
even though you knew she
was becoming an addict.

836
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,730
You destroyed this woman.

837
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,131
Did you not, doctor?

838
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,033
Who's trying to destroy who?

839
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,370
Have you seen the police report?

840
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,772
She says she dreamt
the whole thing up.

841
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,622
What happened?

842
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:46,957
He became dehydrated.

843
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,959
He's OK now.

844
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,495
He's just sleeping.

845
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,963
They said he could
go home tomorrow.

846
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,134
How did the deposition go?

847
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,569
He couldn't wait to find out.

848
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,371
Fine.

849
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,639
Tell him it went just fine.

850
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:03,540
Good.

851
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,541
Good.

852
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,547
What is it?

853
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,182
Some new developments.

854
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,586
OK, look, if you decided
to withdraw from my case,

855
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,155
can we just get this over with.

856
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,557
Masserman's attorney
has contacted me.

857
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,128
They want to discuss
a settlement.

858
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,096
What?

859
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,364
Why?

860
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,199
Because two women who were
also patients of Masserman

861
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,801
have gotten in touch with me.

862
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,537
They want to file
lawsuits against him.

863
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,305
They went through
the court records

864
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,007
to find out whether
anybody else had

865
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,608
a similar complaint
against Masserman

866
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,677
and they saw your name.

867
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,713
You should be proud
of yourself, Barbara.

868
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,681
Your refusal to hide
behind a Jane Doe

869
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,451
gave them the strength they
needed to come forward.

870
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,719
Can I meet them?

871
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,287
Absolutely.

872
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,455
Congratulations.

873
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,557
We finally have the
corroboration we need.

874
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,133
[chatter]

875
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,642
Excuse me, are you Lorna?

876
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,643
Barbara.

877
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,583
I saw you, but I wasn't sure.

878
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,419
I thought, not her, she
looks too together to have

879
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,687
been with Dr. Masserman.

880
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,589
Oh, I thought
the same about you.

881
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,990
Yeah?

882
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,860
But me, people think,
she's just a singer.

883
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,363
When I heard about you, you
being a university professor,

884
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,467
I thought this doesn't make
me look so bad anymore.

885
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,236
Uh, just coffee, thanks.

886
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,846
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me.

887
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,716
I've been blaming myself
so much over this.

888
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,551
When I heard this had
happened to other women,

889
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:59,589
it made all the difference.

890
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,491
So what made you go
to Dr. Masserman?

891
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,665
A few years ago, I met a
man that I really cared about.

892
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,535
I didn't want to make the
same mistakes with him that I

893
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,905
had in my other relationships.

894
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,741
I've always had
trouble trusting men.

895
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,810
I could never really
commit myself emotionally.

896
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,878
But I didn't know why.

897
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:27,317
And that's what led
me to Masserman.

898
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,920
But whenever I wanted to
get down to the heart of it,

899
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,855
he'd say why do you
go out of your way

900
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:32,923
to seek negative attention?

901
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,524
You're nothing but
a spoiled brat.

902
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,525
Bad little girl.

903
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,265
A bad little girl.

904
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,366
Did he ever give you amytal?

905
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,606
On and off for a few years.

906
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,275
Do you know if he ever--

907
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,310
Had sex with me?

908
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,651
I started having strange
dreams about him.

909
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,154
I-- I met this woman
at my health club.

910
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,290
She's the other woman
that's suing Masserman.

911
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,625
We had a lot in common.

912
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,994
Turns out we had
Masserman in common, too.

913
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,295
And then she told
me about the dreams

914
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:16,333
that she'd been having,
dreams of Masserman

915
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,569
sexually abusing her.

916
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,905
Same dreams as mine.

917
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,407
That's when we realized
that they weren't dreams,

918
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,510
they were memories of what
had happened under amytal.

919
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,915
I felt really foolish.

920
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,651
I felt so stupid.

921
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,654
I want him to pay
for what he did.

922
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,390
And then I want to forget
that he ever existed.

923
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,193
I wonder if we'll
ever be able to forget.

924
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,430
So what about you?

925
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,598
You have kids?

926
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,934
No, no kids.

927
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,136
Husband?

928
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:57,040
I had a husband, Richard.

929
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,689
Hi.

930
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,958
Don't.

931
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,159
Well, her skin's on fire.

932
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:20,530
She's got the gin out,
hostile attitude--

933
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,933
guess who's had an
amytal session today?

934
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,668
I'm not hostile.

935
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,571
Anyway, Dr. Masserman says
it's normal to release

936
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,839
negativity after amytal.

937
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,244
I am sick to death of hearing
that man's name in my house.

938
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,146
You're the one who
said I needed help.

939
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,114
Well, you're not
getting help, are you?

940
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,483
I mean, look at you.

941
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,419
You don't go out anymore.

942
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:43,320
You don't talk to anyone.

943
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,654
You don't talk to me.

944
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,057
You're not interested
in having sex with me.

945
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,959
This isn't about
sex, and you know it.

946
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,671
Come on, sweetheart.

947
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,572
What happened?

948
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,141
We used to be so good together.

949
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,277
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

950
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,751
It should have been simple.

951
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:19,623
We both wanted the same
thing, to be together,

952
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,491
keep loving each other.

953
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,660
Would you have
stayed together, if it

954
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,196
hadn't been for Masserman?

955
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,132
I don't know.

956
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,567
But we were better
together before I

957
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,102
started seeing Dr. Masserman.

958
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,240
Sorry I'm late.

959
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,409
Barbara was worried
you might not show up.

960
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,479
Well, I said I was sorry.

961
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,015
Mr. Noel, Barbara has asked
me to see what I can do to help

962
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,952
you reconcile your differences.

963
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,488
I sense you're not
happy to be here.

964
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,389
Oh, really?

965
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,490
You could tell that?

966
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,159
There's no need
for sarcasm, sir.

967
00:54:56,259 --> 00:55:00,597
Now, why don't you just
tell me what you're feeling?

968
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,500
You're controlling her, OK?

969
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,302
I mean, that's what I'm feeling.

970
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,670
I mean, you say jump, she jumps.

971
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,140
You say amytal, she sticks
out her arm for you.

972
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,109
I mean, you have turned this
woman into a junkie, doctor,

973
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,377
or haven't you noticed that?

974
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,213
I think you should attempt
to control yourself, sir.

975
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,016
I mean, a few dizzy spells
that's why she came to see you.

976
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,185
I hardly think you
are qualified to assess

977
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,854
the situation, Mr. Noel.

978
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:28,391
I'm the expert here, and
your wife is doing very well.

979
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,727
Doctor, do you
have any idea what

980
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,096
the amytal does to this woman?

981
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:36,533
All right, it takes one complete
day for her to sleep it off.

982
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,867
Then when she
finally does get up,

983
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,436
she gets herself drunk
on Gin because she wants

984
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,770
to keep the feeling going.

985
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,706
I mean, do you call
that a good therapy?

986
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,774
I mean, I want to hear this.

987
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,344
Certainly, you are free
to seek out other opinions,

988
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,478
other therapies.

989
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:53,883
Richard, I asked Dr.
Masserman to help us,

990
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,552
help us find what
we lost together.

991
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,922
Sweetheart, don't you
get it, he can't help us.

992
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,157
Only you can, you have
to get off amytal.

993
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,459
You have to leave him.

994
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,095
Now, why don't we just
calm down and discuss this.

995
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,396
No, that's it, OK?

996
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,564
I've had it.

997
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,932
I'm sorry.

998
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,333
Barbara, we're gonna go now.

999
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,234
We're gonna leave here.

1000
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,335
You're gonna come with me.

1001
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,003
And you are never
coming back here.

1002
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,072
Barbara, I must tell you
that to leave you a therapy

1003
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,108
now would be quite disastrous.

1004
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,377
Think of the progress
you've been making.

1005
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,112
You're growing confidence.

1006
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,082
Sweetheart, let's just
get out of here, OK?

1007
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,584
Come with me now.

1008
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,386
Because if you--
don't look at him.

1009
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,920
Because if you
don't, you don't have

1010
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,789
a prayer Not a hope in hell.

1011
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,157
So come on, OK?

1012
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,158
Come on.

1013
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,970
Do you see?

1014
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,639
You see what you've done to her?

1015
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,542
Barbara, you're just
throwing your life away.

1016
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,077
You're just throwing us away.

1017
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:58,948
Barbara, I love you.

1018
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:17,867
Richard.

1019
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:26,109
Barbara, it's all
in the past now.

1020
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:32,182
Masserman wants to settle.

1021
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,418
If the terms are right,
I intend to accept.

1022
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,420
I'm going to put this
behind me and forget.

1023
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,590
I really think you
ought to do the same.

1024
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,359
I wish I could.

1025
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,629
I really wish I could.

1026
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,165
The terms of Masserman's
proposed settlement

1027
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,600
are extremely generous.

1028
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,869
This has nothing to
do with money, Ken.

1029
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,738
They're offering you $200,000.

1030
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,040
So what?

1031
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,976
After your fee, it'll just
cover what I paid Masserman.

1032
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,144
Then you'll be even.

1033
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,947
I'll never be even.

1034
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,615
I could have had a husband.

1035
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,784
I could have had a life.

1036
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:11,688
Barbara, I hope you know how
much this case means to me,

1037
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,891
not just because it deals
with an important man's abuse

1038
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,261
of power, but because of you.

1039
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,597
You are a remarkable person.

1040
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:24,100
You have a lot to teach
people about courage.

1041
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,171
Nobody believed me, not
until Lorna and the other woman

1042
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,873
came forward.

1043
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,708
But now finally
he's going to have

1044
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,710
to admit what he did to me.

1045
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,512
You'll never
get that from him.

1046
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,847
I'll never get it
from him if I settle.

1047
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,182
Barbara, I think
you should know

1048
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,783
that the other two
women have already

1049
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,018
agreed to settle with him.

1050
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,087
We had a trial date.

1051
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,555
The judge agreed we had a case.

1052
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,324
It's not for four years.

1053
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,960
What I'm trying to tell you
is four years is a long time.

1054
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,695
What if, for example,
Masserman dies?

1055
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,163
That could happen, you know?

1056
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,000
If that happens, we
could lose the case.

1057
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,802
But this way, his
settling with you

1058
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:04,574
acknowledges his responsibility,
the harm that he's done to you.

1059
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,446
I strongly recommend
that you accept.

1060
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,516
And if I don't?

1061
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:17,086
This is all I can do for you.

1062
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,557
Barbara, be glad it's over.

1063
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,129
Oh.

1064
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,765
This is really something,
just like the pros.

1065
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,808
How do I look?

1066
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,043
Adorable.

1067
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:49,519
So-- how about you?

1068
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,854
What did you decide?

1069
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,990
I took the settlement.

1070
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,158
It feels so wrong.

1071
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,462
Well, you didn't
have much choice.

1072
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:05,301
Barb, I gotta tell you something
that you don't want to hear.

1073
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:09,472
I know that it's been tough
dealing with all this.

1074
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,476
But from now on,
it's all up to you.

1075
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:21,884
There's not going to be any
change, real change for you

1076
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:27,657
until you stop drinking,
kick your addictions,

1077
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,727
get yourself together.

1078
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,196
You can do it, Barb,
I know you can.

1079
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,902
[chatter]

1080
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,563
Why don't you read
what's in the paper.

1081
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,532
It's about Dr. Masserman
and his settlement

1082
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,034
with you and the
two other women.

1083
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,936
He's still denying there
was any sexual abuse.

1084
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:16,673
Masserman regrets the
unfortunate publicity.

1085
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,009
Wishes only to get on with
his work and resumes practice.

1086
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:35,825
Please keep in touch with me.

1087
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,427
I really feel there's
more you need to know.

1088
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,128
I know as much as I need to.

1089
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,129
Thanks, anyway.

1090
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,668
Excuse me, are
you Jeannie Wilcox?

1091
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,569
Yes.

1092
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:47,537
Are you Barbara Noel?

1093
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,438
Yes.

1094
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,040
Great, come on in.

1095
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,776
I'm not exactly sure why
you asked to meet with me.

1096
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,479
Have a seat.

1097
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,348
I've launched an investigation
into Dr. Masserman's practice

1098
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,450
and I need your help.

1099
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,719
Well, I've already
settled with him.

1100
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:03,753
Isn't it too late?

1101
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,722
No, not for us it isn't.

1102
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,925
See, we're responsible for going
after licensed practitioners.

1103
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,827
The article in the Trib
is what alerted us.

1104
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,329
I read it and I was stunned.

1105
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,997
Jules Masserman is
the most prominent

1106
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,632
psychiatrist in the world.

1107
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,102
But the more I read about
the allegations against him,

1108
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,738
the more I wondered why this
guy is still practicing.

1109
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,639
The woman that you
just saw leaving,

1110
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,642
she's a patient of Masserman's
and she's still seeing him.

1111
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,145
To her, Masserman is a god.

1112
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,115
She thinks that the 10 women
who came forward with complaints

1113
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,183
against him are all delusional.

1114
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,451
10 women?

1115
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,819
Yes.

1116
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,022
The stories are all similar
to yours, the amytal sessions,

1117
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,092
the disrobing, memories
of bizarre incidents.

1118
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,128
Some of them had
unexplained bruises.

1119
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,131
Some woke up and he
was fondling them.

1120
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,499
What are you going to do?

1121
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,934
I'm going to go
after his license.

1122
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,270
But I need all the
help I can get.

1123
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,404
Are you in?

1124
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,572
Absolutely.

1125
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,143
Hi.

1126
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,043
I brought you a sandwich.

1127
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,945
Oh, thanks.

1128
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,282
You know, proper eating is
better than a Valium any day.

1129
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,550
Do I really sound like that?

1130
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,086
Yeah, but it helped me.

1131
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,287
Well, I'm starving.

1132
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,822
I haven't been able to
leave the office all day.

1133
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:15,024
My receptionist
is off sick again.

1134
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,561
I think she's working another
gig and you don't know it.

1135
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,396
So how are you?

1136
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,098
Fine.

1137
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,568
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.

1138
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,569
What is it, Barbara?

1139
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,307
10 other women came
forward with allegations

1140
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,276
against Masserman.

1141
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,377
And you know what else?

1142
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,145
Most of them figured
out within a year or two

1143
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,280
what he was doing to them.

1144
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,749
But me?

1145
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,784
So you're angry with yourself
that it took you so long?

1146
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,252
It's not as if I
didn't have clues.

1147
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,758
Why didn't I know?

1148
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,760
Or did I know?

1149
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,662
And am I guilty,
guilty of letting

1150
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,997
it go on year after year?

1151
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:58,034
What do you think?

1152
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,036
I didn't want this to happen.

1153
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,771
I didn't choose this.

1154
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,406
I kept trying to
get away from him,

1155
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,241
but something kept
bringing me back.

1156
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,642
Something?

1157
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:07,643
Or amytal?

1158
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,683
You're going to have
to acknowledge this.

1159
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,518
As long as you don't deal
with your addictions,

1160
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,653
you're going to have Masserman
in your life controlling you

1161
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,021
as though you never left him.

1162
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,690
He hasn't left me.

1163
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,958
I'm afraid to pick up the phone.

1164
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,259
I'm afraid to fall asleep.

1165
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,794
Are you having nightmares?

1166
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:25,995
Mm-hmm.

1167
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,130
It's always the same.

1168
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,933
I'm in a grassy field
near a riverbank,

1169
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,203
a river where we used to go to
have picnics when I was a kid.

1170
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,608
And I'm nine, eight, seven.

1171
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:43,312
And it's hot and I can
smell the honeysuckle.

1172
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:47,850
And I-- I guess I've fallen
asleep because something

1173
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,318
starts waking me up.

1174
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,588
And I'm having trouble
opening my eyes.

1175
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:59,528
And I hear sounds, breathing
sounds, wind in the trees.

1176
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:04,700
And someone is on top of me,
crushing me with her body,

1177
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,168
hurting me.

1178
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,537
And I open my eyes
and it's Masserman.

1179
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,410
Barbara, I think it's
time that we started

1180
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,012
discussing your childhood.

1181
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,380
Why?

1182
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,782
I didn't come here to start
going through all that again.

1183
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,685
You have a lot of
unanswered questions.

1184
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,587
There's nothing to say.

1185
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,323
I was a normal kid, two
parents, end of story.

1186
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,257
Go on.

1187
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,959
Say whatever comes
into your mind.

1188
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,695
What's coming into my mind
is that this is pointless.

1189
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,130
Keep going.

1190
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,831
I was happy, OK?

1191
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,500
I was feisty.

1192
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,270
I was a real tomboy and
always getting into trouble,

1193
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,173
climbing trees,
finding a wasp's nest,

1194
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,109
bringing it home with the
wasp, stuff like that.

1195
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,778
I was an ordinary, regular kid.

1196
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,850
My parents though,
they were the ones who

1197
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,422
were special, gifted musically.

1198
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,656
They were really very glamorous.

1199
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,926
I loved listening to
them play music and sing.

1200
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:10,066
And I wanted, I really wanted
them to approve of my singing,

1201
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,535
especially my father.

1202
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,070
Listening to Masserman
at the deposition,

1203
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,305
the way he put down my
singing reminded me so much

1204
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,008
of my father.

1205
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,643
One time when I was seven, I--

1206
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:28,184
What were you going to say?

1207
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,920
I don't remember.

1208
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,788
You don't remember what
you were going to say

1209
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,357
or the incident?

1210
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,358
I don't know.

1211
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,463
Well, what can you
remember about being seven?

1212
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,566
Nothing.

1213
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,437
Nothing specific.

1214
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,909
I can't remember.

1215
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,811
That's OK.

1216
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,215
There are other ways to access
your memory, through hypnosis.

1217
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,683
I told you I'm not sure.

1218
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,118
It's not sodium amytal.

1219
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,388
You'll be conscious
the whole time.

1220
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,089
I don't know some day maybe.

1221
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,191
Why not today?

1222
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,496
Barbara, I know how tough it is
for you, giving me your trust.

1223
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,770
Hypnosis is simply a
process of relaxation,

1224
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,372
a way for you to go
deep inside yourself.

1225
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,810
OK.

1226
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:28,711
Good.

1227
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,945
I'll just come a little closer.

1228
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,721
Will you be able to
make me do silly things

1229
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,923
like bark like a dog and
give you all my savings?

1230
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,760
All I really want you to
do is to feel comfortable.

1231
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,496
I want you to relax.

1232
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,434
I want you to think of
yourself lying in warm water

1233
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:55,071
and feel how the
water relaxes you.

1234
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:58,874
All of the tension
is slipping away.

1235
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:03,646
Your eyelids begin to
feel heavy and your hands

1236
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,183
lose all of their tension.

1237
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:15,658
As you float,
float, relax, relax.

1238
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,565
Now Barbara we're going
to go back in time,

1239
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,401
back to when you
were 10 years old,

1240
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:30,139
to when you were nine years
old, and now you're eight.

1241
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,608
Now you're seven.

1242
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:36,112
You're seven years old.

1243
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,781
Barbara, I want
you to look around

1244
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:42,485
and tell me where you are.

1245
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:47,790
We're having a picnic
next to the river.

1246
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:51,026
Is there anybody with you?

1247
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:55,965
My parents, they're gone.

1248
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:56,966
I'm all alone.

1249
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,937
Barbara, is something wrong?

1250
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,005
Mm-hmm.

1251
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,006
What is it, Barbara?

1252
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,944
My eyes are closing.

1253
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,980
I'm afraid.

1254
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,381
I know it's going to happen.

1255
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,816
What Barbara?

1256
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,585
He's going to hurt me.

1257
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:20,322
He's going to fall
on me, on top of me.

1258
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,323
It's going to hurt me.

1259
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,225
Who, Barbara?

1260
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:27,396
He's going to hurt
me, in my private place.

1261
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,998
Who, Barbara, who?

1262
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,132
I can't see him.

1263
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:31,967
I'm afraid to open my eyes.

1264
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:32,935
Open them, Barbara.

1265
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:33,836
Who is it?

1266
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:34,970
Who is hurting you?

1267
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:35,938
Daddy!

1268
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:36,939
Daddy!

1269
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,850
How could this have happened
to me and I didn't know?

1270
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,585
It was too deeply buried.

1271
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,720
You couldn't let yourself know.

1272
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,890
But Dr. Masserman,
why didn't he know?

1273
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,659
Or did he?

1274
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:00,296
I was pretty sure
by our third session.

1275
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:04,366
You had all the signs of
childhood sexual abuse.

1276
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,001
And I'm hoping that
what you learned today

1277
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,771
will help you stop
blaming yourself.

1278
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:09,972
You're the perfect victim.

1279
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:23,786
(SINGING) The moon
belongs to everyone.

1280
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:30,326
The best things
in life are free.

1281
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:42,972
The stars belong to everyone,
they shine down on you and me.

1282
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:47,076
The flowers in
spring, the robins

1283
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:53,415
that sing, the sunbeams
that shine, they're yours,

1284
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,917
they're mine.

1285
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,452
And love can--

1286
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,594
Our apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.

1287
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,500
Great, great, good,
you read my mind.

1288
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,501
Because I've had it.

1289
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,502
I've had it with you.

1290
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,403
Getting drunk again?

1291
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:15,304
I wasn't drunk.

1292
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,472
Now it sounds like a great idea.

1293
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:17,740
Don't you ever think
of anybody but yourself?

1294
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,641
Don't touch me.

1295
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,309
I don't want anyone to touch me.

1296
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:27,216
[phone ringing]

1297
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,822
BARBARA (ON PHONE): Hi,
sorry I can't take your call.

1298
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,859
But leave me a message and
I'll get right back to you.

1299
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,062
MARY (ON PHONE): Uh,
Barbara, it's Mary.

1300
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,664
I'm at the hospital.

1301
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,534
And Dick passed away, dear.

1302
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,882
There, there.

1303
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,392
He just loved you--

1304
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,393
loved you like a daughter.

1305
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,332
A daughter who gave
him a lot of worries.

1306
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,072
OK.

1307
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:35,684
An old friend of mine used
to say, you can do it, Barb.

1308
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,152
My name is Barbara Noel.

1309
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,053
Hi, Barbara.

1310
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:38,921
Hi.

1311
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,356
And I'm an alcoholic.

1312
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,396
I want to stop
destroying myself.

1313
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:48,864
And I know I can do it.

1314
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,672
Barbara, I'm so proud of you.

1315
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,273
Five weeks?

1316
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,809
Six, six whole
weeks without a drink.

1317
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,782
Dick would be proud, too.

1318
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:10,953
Except he'd say,
what took you so long?

1319
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,890
Oh, that is fabulous.

1320
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,159
They look great
under a spotlight.

1321
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:21,096
Do I hear a singer who wants
to get back on the stage?

1322
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,132
I've been thinking about it.

1323
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,576
What is it?

1324
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,678
NEWSCASTER (ON TV): Prominent
Chicago psychiatrist Dr. Jules

1325
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,415
Masserman was celebrating
with friends and colleagues

1326
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,417
last night in Rio
de Janeiro, where

1327
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,918
he was honored by
the International

1328
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,453
Psychiatric community.

1329
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,990
Dr. Masserman was named honorary
president for life of the World

1330
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,026
Association of Social
Psychiatry in recognition

1331
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,496
of a lifetime of meritorious
service to mankind.

1332
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,965
Dr. Masserman recently
announced at a press conference

1333
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,234
is retiring from his
practice in order

1334
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,869
to concentrate on research.

1335
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,604
Are you all right?

1336
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,173
Yeah.

1337
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,374
I don't know how
I'm going to manage

1338
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,210
facing him at the hearing.

1339
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,780
You're going to do
just fine, Barbara.

1340
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,116
Barbara, there isn't
going to be any hearing.

1341
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,050
What happened?

1342
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,685
Dr. Masserman
offered to give up

1343
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,254
his medical license and his
controlled substance license.

1344
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,389
It was an offer
that my department

1345
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,957
felt was too good to refuse.

1346
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,325
It means he can't
practice anymore

1347
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,260
and that's what we wanted.

1348
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,129
But in exchange--

1349
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,998
He denies all allegations.

1350
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,900
No wonder he's
smiling on the news.

1351
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,636
He spent years abusing
me and other women

1352
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:37,105
and now he's gotten
away with it again.

1353
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,274
And on top of it, they
give him an award.

1354
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,077
He can't counsel
patients, not anymore.

1355
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,479
Can't he?

1356
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,546
Are you sure?

1357
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,914
What about that woman
patient of his you

1358
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,916
met, the one who was
still going to him

1359
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,085
even after she'd heard about
all the charges against him?

1360
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,988
She was there in Rio with him.

1361
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,123
Who knows how many women he's
still treating privately?

1362
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,992
And why wouldn't they go to him?

1363
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,927
His reputation is
still as good as ever.

1364
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:02,264
As far as everyone's concerned,
he hasn't lost his license,

1365
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,734
he's just retired to devote
more time to research.

1366
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:10,205
Margaret, you're right not
to be satisfied with this.

1367
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,340
I have a suggestion.

1368
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,443
Go to the American
Psychiatric Association.

1369
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,144
They have an ethics committee.

1370
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,247
Demand an inquiry.

1371
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,815
If they punish
Masserman, it will

1372
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,383
be an important admission
that he betrayed

1373
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,417
the trust of his patients.

1374
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,860
Several former
patients have come

1375
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,463
forward with serious allegations
against Dr. Masserman,

1376
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,864
not just me.

1377
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,000
The Department of
Registration has

1378
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,735
statements from many of them.

1379
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,737
I'm asking that your
association open

1380
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,972
an inquiry into what happened.

1381
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,642
Thanks for submitting
this, Ms. Noel.

1382
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,844
We'll examine the
matter in due course.

1383
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,546
When can I expect
to hear from you?

1384
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,581
I'll reach a decision
within nine months.

1385
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:55,017
Though, of course, it
could be sooner than that.

1386
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,652
Fine.

1387
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,587
If I don't hear
from you, doctor,

1388
01:15:58,687 --> 01:15:59,688
you'll be hearing from me.

1389
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,043
I saw your ad about
the auditions.

1390
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,946
I was wondering if
I could try out.

1391
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,080
Why not?

1392
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,415
Curt?

1393
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,416
You bring any music?

1394
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,365
[music playing]

1395
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:50,672
(SINGING) Skylark.

1396
01:16:54,009 --> 01:17:00,248
Have you seen a valley
green with spring?

1397
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:03,619
Where my heart can
go a journeying.

1398
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:15,497
Over the shadows and the rain
to a blossom covered lane.

1399
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:21,470
And in your lonely
flight, haven't you

1400
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,940
heard the music in the night?

1401
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:33,081
Wonderful music, faint
as a will o' the wisp.

1402
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:43,125
Crazy as a loon, sad as a
gypsy serenading the moon.

1403
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:54,302
Oh, skylark, I don't know if
you can find these things.

1404
01:17:54,403 --> 01:18:00,742
But my heart is
riding on your wings.

1405
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:11,053
So if you see them anywhere,
won't you lead me there?

1406
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,563
You look great, Barbara.

1407
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,331
Sounds amazing, too.

1408
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,534
Whatever you did,
it did good for you.

1409
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:26,635
Thanks.

1410
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:27,803
Guys, that's it for now.

1411
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,813
Where have you been?

1412
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,981
Getting my act together.

1413
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,684
In a few more months, I
become a proud graduate

1414
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:46,388
of the Grant Hospital
chemical dependency clinic.

1415
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:47,989
It's been great.

1416
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,558
And I've been learning
a lot of new songs

1417
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:51,893
because half the music
industry is there with me.

1418
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:11,513
Curt, I don't expect
that you take me back.

1419
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,516
I came today because
I wanted to thank you.

1420
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,884
To thank me?

1421
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:19,654
Yeah, for saying you wanted
to keep me from breaking.

1422
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:23,191
I'm sorry if this is
embarrassing for you.

1423
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:24,526
It's just I've
spent my whole life

1424
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:29,030
keeping secrets, holding back.

1425
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,834
And I don't want to
hold back, not anymore.

1426
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,209
Rehearsal tomorrow at 11:00.

1427
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,664
Oh, the guys are really great.

1428
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,699
We're having so much fun
together at rehearsal.

1429
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,602
But Curt is so aloof.

1430
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,805
He's just being careful.

1431
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,873
He's got good reason.

1432
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:16,011
Oh, Mary, what if he's already
involved with someone else?

1433
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,146
Has he said anything?

1434
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,581
He's divorced.

1435
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,817
He was just going
through his divorce

1436
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,919
when we first started
working together.

1437
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:27,422
But he's never said anything
about another woman since then.

1438
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:28,690
What if I ask him?

1439
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,425
Or is that even
something people ask?

1440
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:34,362
Barbara, when was the last
time you were on a date?

1441
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,032
If a man were interested in
you, you wouldn't even know.

1442
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,702
You wouldn't be able
to recognize the signs.

1443
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:41,937
Just take your time.

1444
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,939
But let him know that you care.

1445
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,907
There's nothing wrong with that.

1446
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,275
Unless it's the
last thing he wants.

1447
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:52,514
What is it?

1448
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,049
It's from the ethics
committee from the American

1449
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,985
Psychiatric Association.

1450
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,286
They've agreed to hear my case.

1451
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,598
Patricia, the ethics
committee said I could bring

1452
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,866
someone else to the hearing.

1453
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,101
And I thought another woman
who'd been through this--

1454
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,339
No, Lorna hasn't
returned my calls.

1455
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:22,711
Do you know someone
else I could call?

1456
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:23,712
Yeah?

1457
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:29,918
Got it.

1458
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,686
Yeah.

1459
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:32,587
Thanks.

1460
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,756
Thanks, Trish.

1461
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:35,857
I understand.

1462
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:42,697
[chatter]

1463
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,640
Sam, why don't you
come to my office later

1464
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,807
and we'll discuss it further.

1465
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:01,082
Barbara, I was
going to call you.

1466
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:03,652
No, you weren't.

1467
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,787
I know what you want, Barbara.

1468
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:06,821
And I can't do it.

1469
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,556
Why?

1470
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,158
Because I don't want
to embarrass my husband.

1471
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,193
Because I don't want to
compromise my position here.

1472
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,395
Do you want other reasons?

1473
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:14,296
Why me?

1474
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,830
What about the others?

1475
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,999
Everyone's glad
I'm doing this.

1476
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,936
And just as glad it's not them.

1477
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,105
Lorna, if I go to
the committee alone,

1478
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,308
I'm worried it'll look like
I'm on a personal vendetta.

1479
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,881
It's over for
me, Barbara, over.

1480
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:36,985
Is it?

1481
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,824
I hate this.

1482
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:45,126
I hate having him in my head.

1483
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,929
I hate having him in my life.

1484
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,131
You know, I still
have nightmares.

1485
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:53,635
I still have images, memories.

1486
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:01,142
Waking up naked with
him standing over me,

1487
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,178
fondling my breasts
and saying, oh

1488
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,679
you have such lovely breasts.

1489
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,716
Lorna, it wasn't your fault.

1490
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,817
You don't understand.

1491
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:21,863
The part that is so horrible
is that I felt flattered.

1492
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:24,232
I felt proud.

1493
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,736
And I hate myself for that.

1494
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,905
It makes me sick when
I think about it.

1495
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,574
I can't forgive myself.

1496
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,143
There's nothing to forgive.

1497
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,879
It wasn't you reacting like
that, it was the amytal.

1498
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,549
No, it wasn't the amytal,
it was me, wanting his love,

1499
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:42,550
wanting his approval.

1500
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:46,554
I can't.

1501
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:50,592
I can't be near him.

1502
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,293
I can't be anywhere near him.

1503
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:54,062
It's not just for us.

1504
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:56,097
It's for all the other women.

1505
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,067
If you can't do it for
yourself, do it for them.

1506
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,035
I can't.

1507
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,772
Barbara, I'm sorry.

1508
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,782
Curt, don't worry if
I'm a bit late tonight.

1509
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,650
That meeting, I told
you I was going to,

1510
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,218
I'm not sure exactly
when it'll be over.

1511
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,187
Did you find someone
to go with you?

1512
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,288
I'm going alone.

1513
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,222
I'll go with you.

1514
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,991
It's not right
that you go alone.

1515
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:24,659
I'll be OK.

1516
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,795
Hey, Barbara, I
wish I understood

1517
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,997
what you were going through.

1518
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:31,199
I know you needed that from me.

1519
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,801
You did what you could.

1520
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,669
No one could get close to me.

1521
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,637
And now?

1522
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,009
I guess I'd better go.

1523
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:02,764
I'm really glad you're here.

1524
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,265
I couldn't let him
get away with it.

1525
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:17,345
I woke up and he was
stroking my bare breasts.

1526
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,881
I was revolted.

1527
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,483
But I couldn't react.

1528
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,084
I was too groggy
from the amytal.

1529
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,056
And later I wanted to believe
that I had been dreaming

1530
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,924
because I had too much
respect for him to believe

1531
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:33,595
that he could do such a thing.

1532
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:35,096
To this day, I
don't understand how

1533
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,331
he could have done this to me.

1534
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:40,401
Ms. Lucas, are you 100%
sure this really happened?

1535
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:41,803
Yes.

1536
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,138
Ms. Lucas, the
facts are clear,

1537
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,106
you were coming out of
a semiconscious state

1538
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:46,241
at the time.

1539
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,843
Isn't it possible your
memory is at fault here?

1540
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,012
My memory is quite clear.

1541
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,347
How do you know?

1542
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,883
It might even have been a dream,
as you yourself suggested.

1543
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,985
I wasn't dreaming.

1544
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,753
Is this how you expect
to get to the truth?

1545
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:00,655
How can you be so sure?

1546
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:03,725
Because it happened.

1547
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,094
I don't doubt my
memory on that incident

1548
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,196
nor do I doubt my
memory about the time

1549
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:11,900
that Dr. Masserman,
knowing I was pregnant,

1550
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,336
administered sodium
amytal to me.

1551
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:16,704
He said that I
needed to find out

1552
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:19,174
if I really wanted this child.

1553
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,075
I was so much under his
control that it never

1554
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,577
even occurred to me
to ask him if this

1555
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,113
might cause a miscarriage.

1556
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,114
And it did.

1557
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,054
Professor Lucas.

1558
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,490
No, I have nothing left
to say to you people.

1559
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,125
You've all made up your
minds and nothing that we

1560
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:40,028
say can change any of that.

1561
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,932
I think you're all
despicable, all of you.

1562
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,474
I'm sorry, Barbara.

1563
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:54,842
I'm so sorry.

1564
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:55,743
Don't say that.

1565
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:57,045
You were fantastic.

1566
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:01,616
Ms. Noel, we're not likely
to reschedule this meeting.

1567
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:06,020
I suggest you speak to us
now, if you still intend to.

1568
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,021
You OK?

1569
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,531
Or the sounds of
washing, the jingling

1570
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:19,167
of coins in a pants pocket.

1571
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,203
And I thought it might
be safe if I could

1572
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,538
open my eyes, even
just a little,

1573
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:25,240
to see who had done this to me.

1574
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,346
It was Dr. Masserman.

1575
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:34,616
The man who raped me
was Jules Masserman.

1576
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,485
Ms. Noel, you want us to
believe this really happened,

1577
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,022
yet you did nothing at the
time of this alleged rape.

1578
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,824
According to what you just
said, you simply lay there,

1579
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,192
didn't you?
- I was drugged.

1580
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,727
I was just coming
out of the amytal.

1581
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,362
But you did open your eyes.

1582
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:50,131
And you say the man you
saw was Dr. Masserman.

1583
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:52,066
Now surely at that point,
you could have screamed,

1584
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,270
called for help, tried to defend
yourself, yet you did nothing.

1585
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,439
Would you call that a
normal response to rape?

1586
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,242
I don't know what a
normal response to rape is.

1587
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,150
I would like the committee to
study the police report written

1588
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,286
on the day of the
alleged rape in which

1589
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:16,291
Ms. Noel admitted to the police
she dreamt the whole thing.

1590
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,859
I never said that.

1591
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,194
That is not what I meant.

1592
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,230
Ms. Noel, I hardly think
your memory is credible.

1593
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,364
Are you not an alcoholic?

1594
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:24,432
Yes, but I--

1595
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:25,800
And is it not
true that you have

1596
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,835
also been an outpatient at a
clinic for chemical dependency?

1597
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,370
Because I am
addicted to sodium

1598
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,673
amytal into alcohol as a result.

1599
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,909
I would also like to call into
question Ms. Noel's character.

1600
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:37,211
Dr. Lindros, I don't
see how this is relevant.

1601
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,314
Are we to believe a
woman who, following

1602
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,748
her divorce from
her husband Richard,

1603
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:42,950
embarked on a series of
promiscuous adventures--

1604
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:43,885
Ms. King.

1605
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,055
Doctor, this woman
is an alcoholic.

1606
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,958
She is a sexually promiscuous,
embittered woman who now seeks

1607
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,694
to blame a man of
international stature

1608
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:53,761
for the failure of her life.

1609
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:57,031
That will do, Ms. King.

1610
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,834
Ms. Noel, we thank you
for your testimony.

1611
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,803
That is all we
require at this time.

1612
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,204
I'd like to make a statement.

1613
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:04,205
Doctor, I object.

1614
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,879
Go ahead, Ms. Noel.

1615
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:21,756
For so long, I didn't know
why I had this terrible sadness

1616
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,157
inside me.

1617
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:27,195
I recently learned with the
help of a caring therapist

1618
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:31,065
that I was sexually
abused when I was a child.

1619
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:32,600
And this knowledge
helped me understand

1620
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,136
the hurt, the pain
I was carrying when

1621
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:37,772
I first went to you for help.

1622
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,607
But what did you do?

1623
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:41,476
You drugged me.

1624
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,711
You promised the amytal
would free me from my pain,

1625
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:46,948
but it just drugged me.

1626
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:52,587
And while I was defenseless
and vulnerable, you used me.

1627
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:56,657
And you made sure when I woke
up that I remembered nothing.

1628
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:59,494
I remembered nothing.

1629
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,362
But I carried in me
a terrible poison,

1630
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:05,767
an addiction that kept me coming
back to you year after year.

1631
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,236
It's not just that you raped me.

1632
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:13,040
It's all the years you took away
from me, all the wasted years.

1633
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:19,113
And whether these men and
women, your colleagues,

1634
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:24,018
choose to believe me, there is
something I want you to know.

1635
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:26,387
I have survived.

1636
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:31,793
I have become strong
without you, despite you.

1637
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:35,129
This is who I could have been
all those years ago if you had

1638
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,933
honored your commitment
to me, the sacred vow

1639
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:42,069
that all doctors make to heal.

1640
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:52,613
Dr. Masserman, for what you did
to me, you should feel shame.

1641
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:01,189
That hurt little
girl is still in me.

1642
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:05,993
But I love her and
she's starting to heal.

1643
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:09,363
And today, my life begins again.

1644
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,678
Darn, my zipper is stuck.

1645
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,146
Can you do it up for me?

1646
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:26,080
Oh, I don't know, Barbara.

1647
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:26,981
I don't know if I should.

1648
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:27,882
Why?

1649
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,250
What do you mean?

1650
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,385
Well, you always told
me not to get too close.

1651
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,386
Try me.

1652
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,605
NARRATOR: Dr. Jules Masserman
has never been convicted

1653
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:53,040
in a court of law and continues
to deny all the allegations

1654
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,442
brought against him.

1655
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:57,645
In October of 1991, the American
Psychiatric Association appeals

1656
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:00,281
board voted to suspend Dr.
Jules Masserman from the APA

1657
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:01,916
and the Illinois
Psychiatric Society

1658
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:04,018
for five years for
violation of the principles

1659
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:05,586
of medical ethics.

1660
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,588
Barbara Noel is still
living in Chicago

1661
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:09,190
and is enjoying
success in her career

1662
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:10,558
as a singer and songwriter.

1663
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,427
She has become a spokesperson
for victims of sexual abuse.
