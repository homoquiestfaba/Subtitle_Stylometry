That's horrible, horrible news
about Aunt, um...

169
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,416
Rose.

170
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,250
Is everything okay?

171
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
- No.
- Uh...

172
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
- Could I please have a moment in private?
- Sure.

173
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,791
Just give me a second.

174
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,416
I'm stepping into the office
to take a second to process this.

175
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,791
Why are you pretending to be my dad?

176
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
It was the only way I could think
to get you on the phone.

177
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh, that is not true.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,250
[clatters]

179
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
No, it is true.
You barely call, and when you text,

180
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
you send
these weird two-word text messages

181
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,625
- like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon."
- [sighs]

182
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Are you breaking up with me?

183
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,583
What? No, no, no, no! The opposite.

184
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
Then what? Why?
Why are you ignoring me?

185
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
I... I don't know, I...

186
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,583
I guess I'm just...

187
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,125
I'm trying to be mature and not come off
like some clingy girlfriend.

188
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,583
Elle, I told you
that I wanted to make this work.

189
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,583
I know, but people always say that
when they leave.

190
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
I just wanted to give you space

191
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
so that you could figure out
if this is really what you want.

192
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
Space. Space. I don't...
I don't want space.

193
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>Space is not what I want, I told you.</i>

194
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
I don't want space. I want you.

195
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
I want you around me all the time.

196
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
I want you with me right now, actually.

197
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,750
- I just... I just want you, okay?
- [chuckles]

198
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
Text me, call me,

199
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,541
send me a messenger pigeon,
whatever it is, okay?

200
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
Whatever it is,
just don't give me space, okay?

201
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,208
Okay.

202
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,416
Okay.

203
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,875
[clears throat]
First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

204
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,666
Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited
about this year's fundraiser

205
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,458
and the opportunity before us.

206
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Based on the earnings from last year,
we believe that it would be beneficial...

207
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,208
Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing
a kissing booth again for the fundraiser,

208
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
- please signify by saying "Aye."
- [all] Aye.

209
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
- [all] Aye.
- All those against, say "Nay."

210
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,166
Nay.

211
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
Wait, no, I don't actually know
why I just said that.

212
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
Let the record show the Ayes have it.

213
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
The kissing booth is approved.

214
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,500
- [cheering]
- [laughing]

215
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,416
Whoo!

216
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,458
And now that that's settled,
what we're all actually curious about is

217
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,958
who you've selected
for the lineup of kissers this time.

218
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,708
Because without Flynn as a headliner
to draw in business,

219
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
the booth may not do so well this year.

220
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,208
- Uh, that's a good point.
- Last year is gonna be hard to top.

221
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
- We...
- So hard.

222
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Quite true. Thoughts?

223
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,416
Well, actually,
the thoughts we're having...

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
Right. Right.
That's a good point. Great point.

225
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,500
Well, you know, we have decided to keep
this year's list a secret. Yeah.

226
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,416
But do not worry because I know
who a lot of you are already thinking of,

227
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,166
and the answer is yes.

228
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,666
They will be there.

229
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,875
[all cheering]

230
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
Whoo! Thank you!

231
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,458
So, we didn't actually get anyone yet,
did we?

232
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
- That is correct, yes.
- Okay.

233
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
- [Noah] <i>So how's Aunt Rose?</i>
- Oh, come on.

234
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
- You can stop smirking now.
- [laughs]

235
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,708
I miss you, jerk.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,333
I miss you more.

237
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,333
So, you Big Man on Campus yet?

238
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,166
[chuckles] No, not exactly.

239
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,875
It's kinda different here.

240
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
What do you mean?

241
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,916
Well, uh...

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,291
What's wrong?

243
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,708
Nothing! No, nothing's wrong.
Just... doesn't matter.

244
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,875
[sighs] Hey, it's okay to be homesick.

245
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,875
I'm... I'm fine. I'm... seriously,
I'm fine. It's just, you know...

246
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
What about you? How about you?
Have you applied to any more schools?

247
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
[groans]
Don't even get me started on Berkeley!

248
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm...

249
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,125
Don't tell me you've only applied
to one school, Elle.

250
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,458
I know,

251
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,166
but it's literally the only school
we've ever talked about going to.

252
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,208
Well...

253
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,458
you know what you could do?

254
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,000
- [Elle] <i>My God. Is he about to ask me to...</i>
- Apply here.

255
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,083
[scoffs] As if I could get into Harvard.

256
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,875
[chuckles] Elle, there's over 30 schools
that you could apply to in Boston.

257
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,333
<i>And your point being that at least one
of them would accept my sorry ass?</i>

258
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,333
[laughing] No! My point being
that if you don't get into Berkeley...

259
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
maybe you can come to school here.

260
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,166
<i>With me.</i>

261
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,666
I'd like that.

262
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,416
[Elle] <i>You obviously couldn't see this,</i>
<i>but my heart just did a backflip.</i>

263
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,416
Um...

264
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,041
Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that.

265
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Maybe you'll think about it.

266
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,166
<i>- Okay, you can just think about it.</i>
- [chuckles]

267
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>You know, all the books you have to read
if you go here, seriously...</i>

268
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,833
[Elle sighs] <i>I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>about rule number 19,</i>

269
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

270
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>Who knows if I'd even get accepted
into a Boston school?</i>

271
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>And if I didn't,</i>

272
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,583
<i>what would be the point in telling Lee now
and getting him upset over nothing?</i>

273
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,166
<i>Right?</i>

274
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
[man] You have excellent grades,

275
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,000
great test scores, soccer, Dance Club.

276
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
And I also have a podcast
about video games.

277
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,416
Oh! So you're an influencer.

278
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,916
How many subscribers?

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Thirty-seven.

280
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,000
Thirty-seven thousand!

281
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
- We can work with that.
- No, no, no, um...

282
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Thirty-seven.

283
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
[laughs] You're kidding, right?

284
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,666
Oh. Well, uh... [clears throat]

285
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,166
To get into top-tier colleges
like UC Berkeley and Harvard,

286
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
you really need to wow them
with your personal essay.

287
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,541
And yours is...

288
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
How shall I put this? [snores]

289
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,833
- Really? I thought I killed it.
- Hmm? What? No.

290
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,166
You didn't even wound it.

291
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,541
[Elle] So, I'm redoing my personal essay.

292
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,916
Apparently it sucks.

293
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
- Oh! New level!
- [video game music playing]

294
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,625
Wonder if mine sucks.
I should probably look into that.

295
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,500
Don't want that keeping us out
of Berkeley.

296
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
Um, yeah. Definitely.

297
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
So, have you seen the new kid Marco yet?

298
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,791
Yeah. Devastatingly handsome.

299
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
Some are even saying
he's hotter than Noah.

300
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,666
- Really? What?
- Yeah.

301
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,666
That's crazy!

302
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,541
- [beeping]
- Oh, Lee! New level, Lee!

303
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
- Lee? Lee! No! Lee!
- [game beeps]

304
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,958
We discussed this.
I need a regular feeding regimen

305
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,583
during my hands-free
<i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> experience.

306
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,083
What the hell is that?

307
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,750
Top score is "MVP"?

308
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,416
"Most Valuable Player"? Well,
somebody thinks highly of themselves.

309
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
I kind of always just figured
we'd be number one forever.

310
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,666
Look at me.

311
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,250
We are going to need slushies, churros
and an ass-load of quarters.

312
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
[sneers]

313
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,375
- [man chatters]
- [all] Surprise!

314
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,708
[party favors honk]

315
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,583
[whistling]

316
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,416
Hey, Evans. Come here.

317
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,000
What's up?

318
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,291
That new guy Marco, someone snagged
a video of him working out.

319
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,083
- [scoffs] Oh, come on.
- [feedback whining]

320
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
How hot can this guy actually be?

321
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
He can't be that hot.

322
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
[echoing] <i>Hot.</i>

323
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,041
- [laughs]
- He's just a guy... whoa! Sweet mercy!

324
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,541
Jeez! Hello!

325
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,708
God! The OMGs were right!

326
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,291
<i>- This guy is a snack indeed!</i>
- [all laughing]

327
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,708
Maybe an entrée!
Maybe he's also the dessert too!

328
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,125
Tell me more!

329
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,291
No, no, no.

330
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,333
Maybe he's the after-after dessert!
He's a big meal that we're having now!

331
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,041
- [Lee] Oh, shit! Sorry.
- [grunts]

332
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,208
- [girl] Oh!!
- Sorry about that. Whoa! Oh!

333
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,333
He could bench you,
us together at the same time!

334
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,583
Yeah, definitely.

335
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,875

00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,333
- Okay?
- Yes! Come on!

846
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,166
Okay,
that's not what that case was at all.

847
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,166
Oh, Citizens United was a classic example
of judicial activism, right?

848
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,416
- [man] True. Correct.
- After conservatives bellyached for years

849
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,916
- about the liberal Supremes.
- [man] Same thing.

850
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,500
- You are a hypocrite at its finest.
- Told you they were intense!

851
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,875
[man] No! That was not...

She knows virtually everybody in here!

She knows how to work a room.

861
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:11,666
So I hear you got something special
for us tonight? I'm excited.

862
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,125
- Hello, hello, hello!
- [man] Hey! How are you?

863
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,750
- [Chloe] You look so good! So dashing!
- [man laughs] Nice to see you!

864

[Chloe] Oh, hello, gorgeous. Mmm!

865
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,625
- So good to see you.
- You look beautiful.

866

Thank you! [laughs]

867

- [man 2] Thanks for answering my call.

868
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,333
- So, where were you?
- [Chloe] I actually have no excuse,

869
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,333
but I'll make it up to you tonight
on the dance floor. [laughs]

- Yeah.

- [Elle] <i>I bet you do.</i>

881
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,208
[man] So, where were you?

882
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,750
[Chloe] So, today, total disaster.
The sculptor dropped out...

883
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,125
So, I'm in Zimbabwe, ten years old.

884
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,708
My mom was doing a research paper
on the Ndebele tribe,

885
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,708
and we're gliding down the Zambezi River,

886
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,083
and suddenly, we realize we're
in the middle of a mother hippo

887
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,708
and a baby hippo, and suddenly,
this mouth opens up...

888
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,958
- [man] Get out of here!
- Out of nowhere and bam!

889
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,541
Bit off the front of the boat!
So, the boat starts sinking,

890
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,958
and everyone is swimming to the side,
and my mother's like,

891
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,958
"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, are you okay?"

892
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,291
I open my eyes and I'm like...

893
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:35,416
- [gasps, laughs] "Can we go again?"
- [man] No way! You are insane.

894
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,666
All right! Shots! [bangs table]

895
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,083
[man] Shots, shots!

896
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,291
You know, we actually... we need to go.

897
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,125
No! So early?

898
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,291
No. Elle's got college interviews
tomorrow, so...

899
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,666
Well, in that case,

900
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,000
here's to Elle kicking ass
at her interviews tomorrow.

901
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:49,958
- [man] Let's do it.
- To Elle.

902
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,000
- [all] To Elle!
- [Chloe] You're welcome.

903

<i>Tell you whose ass I'd like to kick.</i>

904

Well, Miss Evans,
that seems to be about it.

905

Thank you for coming in today
to meet with us.

906
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,583
Thank you for having me.
It was a pleasure.

907

- Elle.
- Yeah.

908
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,791
Do you mind
if I give you a piece of advice?

909
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,291
I had the feeling that you were searching

910
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,875
for the perfect answer
to a lot of my questions.

911
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,708
You should know that we're less interested
in meeting the person

912
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,250
you think we want you to be

913
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,625
and far more interested in getting to know
the person you really are.

914
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,000
Thank you.

- [zips bag]
- Is everything okay?

921

Talk to me. What's up?

922
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,000
If you wanna talk to someone,
just check your phone.

in the opposite direction.</i>

927

<i>Dad, I just wanted to explore my options,
okay?</i>

932
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,875
Elle, it's not about any of that.

933
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,375
It's about you asking yourself

934
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,583
if you think a relationship
with Noah's gonna last

935
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:41,375
and if it's worth changing all
of your plans for him.

Well, um...

947

It's okay.

1013
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,375
Wait, actually...

1014
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,625
you know who could totally replace me?

1015
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,041
No, no, no!

1016
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,916
Yeah, yes! MVP! Come on! He's perfect!

1017
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,916
No!

1018
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,041
Don't you still need the money for school?

1019
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:23,625
Yeah, but...

1020
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,958
Well, he's better than me,
and we both know it.

1021
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,416
With him, you could actually win.

1022
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,541
[scoffs]

1023
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,125
- Well, he's not gonna wanna do it.
- I'll <i>get </i>him to do it.

1024
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,541
There's no way I'm gonna do it.

1025
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,666
Why not?

1026
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,625
I'm already doing your kissing booth,
which I didn't want to do, and now this?

1027
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,375
I'm only asking 'cause of my ankle.

1028
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,833
- I can't believe she'd want me to do it.
- No, she does.

1029
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,291
She knows how good you are.

1030
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,541
- And she really wants you to.
- Really?

1031
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,250
[Lee] Hey.

1032
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,166
[Elle] Oh, hey.

1033
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,541
- So what is it?
- He'll do it.

1034
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,250
- What?
- He's totally on board.

1035
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,625
- What did you have to do?
- Nothing! He really wanted to.

1036
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,541
Really?

1037
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,000
There you are.

1038
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,291
I'm here.

1039
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,000
Great.

1040
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,041
First of all, I just wanted to say

1041
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,541
thank you for filling in for Lee.

1042
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,833
So I thought we could start
with the step patterns.

1043
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,458
Yeah, I mean,
I guess we could start there.

1044
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,000
What?

1045
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,750
Well, I just thought it might be better
to get the choreography down

1046
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,541
and then focus on the step accuracy.

1047
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,666
Listen, I've watched hours
of these competitions,

1048
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,083
and the winners always have
near-perfect footwork.

1049
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,541
But in freestyle,
the step accuracy is a given.

1050
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,166
It's the choreography
that wins over the judges.

1051
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,625
Yeah, exactly, which is why we're
going to start with the step patterns

1052
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,750
and then go to choreography, okay?

1053
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,416
Okay.

1054
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:51,958
Great.

1055
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,833
If that's the way you wanna do it.

1056
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,291
[huffs]

1057
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,666
[clears throat]

1058
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,041
Good morning, Los Angeles Country Day.

1059
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,708
<i>Hope you all have your costumes ready</i>

1060
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,708
<i>- because the seniors have secured...</i>
- Hey!

1061
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,416
<i>- A very special venue...</i>
- Where's Lee?

1062
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,208
<i>For the Halloween gala next weekend!</i>

1063
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,041
Our quote of the day is brought to you
by William Shakesp... what the...

1064
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,750
<i>- Give it back! Don't, Lee!</i>
- [Lee] <i>Sorry. I'm sorry. Vivian!</i>

1065
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,916
- Give that back!
- I'm sorry. Vivian, please, please!

1066
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,333
<i>I'm sorry. I just need a second.</i>

1067
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,375
- Thank you.
- [feedback whines]

1068
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:32,583
Hey, Rachel, it's me, Lee. Lee Flynn.

1069
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,875
Look, I'm uh...
I am totally getting detention for this,

1070
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:40,000
but it's worth it because I really
just needed to talk to you.

1071
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:44,041
I am so, so sorry
about everything that happened,

1072
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:48,125
[sighs] but most importantly,
I wanted you to know something.

1073
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,333
I never told you this before, but...

1074
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,833
I love you, Rachel.

1075
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,791
And I'm really hoping
that you love me too.

1076
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,041
So would you please text me
a smiley face emoji for yes

1077
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,416
and a poop emoji for no, please?

1078
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,958
[students laughing]

1079
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,500
All right, Mr. Flynn. The show's over.

1080
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,500
- Ahh.
- Let's go. Time for detention.

1081
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,416
[outgoing message swooshes]

1082
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,625
- [man] Let's go.
- Okay.

1083
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,500
Come on. Let's go.

1084
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,083
- [cell phone dings]
- Yes! Whoo-hoo! I got a smiley face!

1085
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,250
- Yeah! Whoo!
- [all cheering]

1086
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,666
I got a smiley face! There's no poop!
Ha ha ha!

1087
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,333
There's no poop here! [shouts]

1088
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,750
[Elle] <i>Hmm. He said he'd figure out a way.</i>

1089
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,500
<i>Guess Lee doesn't tell me everything.</i>

1090
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,541
Well, I'm just glad you finally said it.

1091
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,041
So, what we talked about,

1092
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,583
Elle always being around,

1093
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,791
did you speak to her?

1094
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,583
Don't worry. I took care of everything.

1095
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,000
She will be giving us plenty of space.

1096
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,250
[Rachel chuckles]

1097
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,916
Oh, my God,
loved your speech yesterday, Lee.

1098
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,833
It was hot.

1099
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,500
Thank you. I was driven by love.

1100
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,625
And Rachel is so sweet.

1101
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,000
- And you, I'd be devastated.
- So devastated!

1102
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:28,958
About what?

1103
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:33,666
You mean you haven't seen the Insta photos
of Flynn's new supermodel?

1104
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,958
- Bye, Lee.
- [Lee laughs]

1105
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,916
[Elle] <i>Sometimes there are things that get</i>
<i>so stuck in your head,</i>

1106
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,583
<i>that there's only one way to get them out.</i>

1107
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:55,958
[sighs]

1108
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:03,083
- [cell phone ringing]
- [grunts, exhales]

1109
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,333
Hey, I'm at the gym. Can I call you back?

1110
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,916
Um, I kinda need to talk to you now,

1111
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,250
<i>actually.</i>

1112
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,000
Okay. What's up?

1113
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,000
[Elle] <i>Okay. Here I go.</i>

1114
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,250
Um...

1115
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,666
part of the reason I was so upset...

1116
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,583
<i>when I left Boston</i>

1117
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,791
was because I found something
in your room.

1118
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,916
Okay, what'd you find?

1119
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,250
An earring,

1120
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,500
<i>under your bed,</i>

1121
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,916
and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe.

1122
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,208
Elle, I promise you,

1123
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,000
I have absolutely no idea
how an earring got in my room.

1124
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,416
That may be so, but... it was there...

1125
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,291
Okay, I know what you thought.

1126
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,708
All right.
But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay?

1127
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,416
I promise you. It could have been there
before I moved in.

1128
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,416
It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's.
There's countless reasons.

1129
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,208
It's just that knowing your past,
it's hard not to think...

1130
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,083
That's not fair. At all.

1131
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,125
Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?

1132
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
No.

1133
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me.

1134
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,208
Please.

1135
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,041
[Elle] <i>It was heartbreaking</i>
<i>to hear Noah talk this way,</i>

1136
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:21,000
<i>and I knew everything for us depended
on what I said next.</i>

1137
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,208
All right.

1138
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,000
I believe you.

1139
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:30,916
Okay.

1140
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,333
I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but...

1141
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,250
I'm glad you told me.

1142

[Elle] <i>When you're not sure</i>
<i>where you stand,</i>

1143

[dance music playing]

1145

Okay, okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
You're missing all the steps.

1146
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,166
How can we fix that?

1147
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,208
Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that.
The precision will come.

1148
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,750
What we need is something
that'll really blow the judges away.

1149
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,375
We can't even get this routine right,

1150
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,208
- and you want to make it more complicated?
- I want to make it more fun!

1151
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,833
That's what the audience wants.

1152
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,958
Something like this.

Walking pretty well, aren't we?

1161
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,083
I'm sorry. Okay?
You had a better shot with Marco,

1162
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,000
and I knew you wouldn't kick me
off the team, so I did it for you.

Are you mad?

- Okay.

- Oh, shut up! I'll show you a hurt ankle.

1168
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,375
- It is just fine.
- Really?

1169
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,708
No. Don't even ask.

1170
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,458
Oh! By the way, so I know we were gonna go
as s'mores for the Halloween dance...

- I think we have a winner!

for our Halloween costume

that I wanted to run by you.

Check my bag. [chuckles]

1175

Uh, yeah!

[man] <i>Flynn's phone.</i>

1184
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,916
Uh, hi.

1185
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,875
Is, uh... is Noah around?

1186
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,750
I think he went to a concert.
I guess he left his phone here.

1187
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,500
Oh, um...

1188
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,250
Any idea who he might have gone with?

1189
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,125
I think he went with Chloe.

1190
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:33,125
Oh. Uh...

1191
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,291
okay, uh, thanks.

1192
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,375
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

1195
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,500
Seriously?

1196

What is the big deal?

1197
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,250
Oh, my God! The big deal is that
the competition is literally in four weeks

1198
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,416
- and the routine is a complete nightmare!
- I think you're exaggerating.

1199
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,250
No, listen, if you don't want to take this
seriously, we should just call it off.

1200
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,041
Okay, time out.

1201
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,375
So I'm using every free hour I have,

1202
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,583

for this competition

1203

that you asked me to help you with,

1204
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:15,208

1205
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:20,500
No.

1206
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,500
No, I'm sorry.

1207
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,375
I'm just kinda going through some stuff
right now.

1208
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,166
Look, you have to trust me.

1209
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,166
If we can't have fun, it's gonna show
in our scores with the judges.

1210
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,208
I'm having fun.

1211
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,625
Sure about that?

1212
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,666
Watch yourself. I recorded us.

1215
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,291
- You're just thinking too much.
- [sighs]

1216
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,250
You just gotta let go, feel the music.

1217
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,041
Why did you and Lee start doing this
in the first place?

1218

so much shit.

1222
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,583
Ah, it's okay.

1223
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,916
I'm starting to think I really need
to work on my footwork.

1224
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,833
- [laughing] Shut up!
- Look at this!

1225
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:29,750
You hungry?

[riders screaming]

1227
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,458
- [Elle] I'm so glad we took a break.
- [Marco] Yeah, for once.

1228
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,916
- [chuckles] I can be a little obsessive.
- You put a lot of pressure on yourself.

1229
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,458
Yeah, well how else
are you gonna get what you want?

1230
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,416
I don't know.

1231
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,458
I don't like making plans.
I just kinda roll with things.

1232
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:49,500
Yeah, but...

1233
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,166
what do you wanna do?

1234
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,041
Not sure.

1235
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,375
Be happy, I guess.

1236
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:05,291
But I gotta say, you inspire me.

1237
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:06,958
Me?

1238
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,125
You know what you want,
and you go after it.

1239
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,041
No.

1240
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,458
No, no.
That is the wrong impression of me.

1241
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,291
I have no idea what I want to do
with my life.

1242
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,833
You make things happen.

1243
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:18,791
I admire it.

1244
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,250
Well, I was gonna say that I...

1245
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,583
admire <i>you</i> for just wanting to be happy.

1246
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,625
I really am grateful for your help,
by the way.

1247
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,833
I'm not exactly rich,
so this is is kinda like my moonshot

1248
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,083
to pick where I wanna go to school.

1249
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,000
What do you mean?

1250
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,708
It's like something amazing
that you want really badly,

1251
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,666
but it's not super likely to happen.

1252
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,833
Like winning the DDM tournament.

1253
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,500
No pressure.

1254
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,333
Hmm.

1255
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,083
"Moonshot."

1256
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,625
Feels like pressure.

1257
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:03,291
- Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure.
- [both laughing]

1258
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:14,041
[Marco] So... Noah's in Boston and...

1259
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,250
and I mean...

1260
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:22,125
I don't need to get into all the details,
but there's this girl...

1261
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,416
And you think he's involved with her?

1262
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,250
I don't know. I mean...

1263
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,750
I mean, he says he's not.

1264
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,916
It's funny 'cause when he left,
I kinda had just assumed

1265
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,666
that he would meet someone else

1266
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,208
and then it would just be over for us,
you know?

1267
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,166
Do you think
you and Noah were meant to be together?

1268
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,958
I always thought we were.

1269
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,416
But now...

1270
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,166
I don't know.

1271
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,833
It's like I'm trying so hard
to hold on to this...

1272
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,875
thing, and it just feels
like it's slipping away.

1273
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,500
I don't know Flynn,

1274
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,166
but if I found someone who I loved,

1275
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:19,083
that was smart and funny

1276
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,458
and liked the same stuff I liked,

1277
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,500
I'd never make her feel like that.

1278
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,708
Wouldn't let her get away, huh?

1279
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,458
I don't see it like that.

1280
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,958
You can't really hold on to someone.

1281
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,833
'Cause the tighter you hold on to them,
the more they wanna slip away.

1282
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,333
All you can do is love them...

1283
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:47,041
and make sure they know
that you're never gonna slip away.

1284
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,458
[chuckles] Uh, I don't know
if I'm saying that right.

1285
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,500
No, you're... saying it perfectly.

1286
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,791
So are you gonna go
to the Halloween dance?

1287
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:06,833
I don't know yet.

1288

01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,916
[Elle] <i>The next day,</i>
<i>Noah still wasn't answering my texts.</i>

1680
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:13,958
<i>And for some reason, neither was Lee.</i>

1681
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:18,708
- [Mrs. Flynn] Hey! The Evans clan arrives!
- Hi!

1682
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,875
[Elle] <i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>Thanksgiving dinner at the Flynns</i>

1683
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,500
<i>would take care of both problems.</i>

1684
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:25,041
[chattering]

1685
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,541
[Elle] Wait! Rachel!

1686
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,666
Rachel, I've been trying to text you!

1687
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,375
[sighs] Elle, I'm not in the mood.

1688
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:36,458
- I know that you're upset, but...
- Seriously, Elle.

1689
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:40,291
Seriously, can you just talk to me?
Like, I don't know what's going on.

1690
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,875
- [Lee] Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.
- [woman] Happy Thanksgiving, Lee!

1691
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,708
[sighs] Dude, what the hell?
Rachel's still so pissed at me.

1692
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:48,333
Yeah, well, that would make two of us.

1693
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:49,958
Why are you mad?

1694
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:52,750
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the answer is in here.

1695
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,333
[papers slam]

1696
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:57,666
Shit!

1697
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,750
Gosh, wait, Lee. Listen to me. I'm...

1698
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,833
- [Noah] We're back!
- [Mr. Flynn] Hey!

1699
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:05,375
- Ah, Chloe! Good to finally meet you.
- Well, it's lovely to meet you too.

1700
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,541
- Yeah. Come inside.
- Ooh! Wow.

1701
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,750
Oh, and Elle, you are here!

1702
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,541
Yeah, and so are you.

1703
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,625
[chuckles] Noah said he wasn't sure
that you would be.

1704
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,000
Really? Is that what he said?

1705
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,000
Dinner's ready!

1706
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:29,791
Careful with those yams.

1707
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:33,833
[chuckles] You're can get drunk off those.

1708
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,875
Lee, do you wanna go talk for a second?

1709
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,208
Not really, no.

1710
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,541
Can we please just go talk?

1711
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,791
Talking. I always feel like talking's
better when it's face-to-face.

1712
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,333
- [sighs] Lee.
- So, Chloe, I hear Boston sucks.

1713
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,458
[chuckles]
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

1714
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,125
It's fine if that's where people want
to live, but you shouldn't lie about it.

1715
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:53,041
Lying. Lying is an interesting topic
of conversation.

1716
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,583
Of course, people aren't always
making decisions alone.

1717
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:58,583
You know, sometimes they need convincing
to do the really stupid shit.

1718
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,166
- Lee!
- You need to shut your mouth.

1719
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,041
You need to leave Lee out of this.

1720
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,541
Why are you acting like I'm the one
that did something wrong?

1721
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,375
Noah, you...

1722
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:08,583
you don't wanna go there right now.

1723
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,000
And, Lee, listen.

1724
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:14,833
I am actually really sorry about applying
to schools in Boston, and, Rachel,

1725
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,875
I don't even know
why you're mad at me right now.

1726
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,208
So you're just gonna pretend
that Lee never told you

1727
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:23,458
that we needed space
from you constantly hanging around us?

1728
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,583
What?

1729
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,458
[scoffs]

1730
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:30,708
Lee, you never...

1731
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:35,333
- Lee, you never said that.
- Yes, he did! Lee, tell her.

1732
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:40,833
[sighs]

1733
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:42,958
[silverware clatters]

1734
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,458
I tried to, but...

1735
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,916
Rach. Rach.

1736
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,458
- Oh, my... I am so...
- Rach.

1737
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,875
Thank you for the invitation. I just...

1738
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,500
- Rachel.
- [Lee] Rachel.

1739
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:05,666
Rachel.

1740
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,833
Rachel. Rachel, please!

1741
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,375
She's my best friend.

1742
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,750
You lied to me!

1743
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:19,333
And you let me say all
of those horrible things to her.

1744
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:24,000
I heard what you said
at your birthday party when Elle ran out.

1745
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,250
[Lee] <i>Elle, what's wrong?</i>

1746
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:27,958
I followed you two.

1747
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,875
[Elle] <i>I love you.</i>

1748
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,750
But being my best friend

1749
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:36,541
doesn't give you the right to tell me
who I can love.

1750
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:38,791
It's like with Rachel.

1751
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,833
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

1752
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,083
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- [Elle] No, you see,

1753
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,541
you shouldn't have to do that

1754
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,833
<i>just because I didn't want you
to be with her.</i>

1755
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,958
But you don't have to break up with me

1756
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,750
because I can't be in a relationship
with you and Elle anymore.

1757
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,125
It's just too much.

1758
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,583
Rachel. [exhales]

1759
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:07,083
I am grateful for family,

1760
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:10,875
uh...

1761
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,208
my new friend,

1762
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,541
and...

1763
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,458
my motorcycle.

1764
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:22,666
Um, okay. Elle...

1765
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:24,833
Oh.

1766
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,708
Wow, what a tough act to follow.

1767
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,125
Let's see.

1768
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,791
I'm thankful for my family,

1769
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,375
for that I just, you know,
won some money for school,

1770
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,791
and... oh, yeah, oh, my God,

1771
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,750
I am super-duper thankful

1772
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,791
that, um, that I found Chloe's earring.

1773
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,958
Oh, my God. Where did you find it?

1774
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,250
Under Noah's bed.

1775
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,833
But what I'm most thankful for is
that I found the earring...

1776
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:03,875
before I did anything crazy,
like rearrange my whole life for someone.

1777
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:13,000
You know, it kind of looked to me
like you'd already rearranged your life.

1778
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,916
I think that maybe we should just...

1779
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,291
You know what? This has been lovely.
Chloe, always a pleasure,

1780
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,458
but I think it's time
for me to head out too. So...

1781
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:26,750
[Elle sniffling]

1782
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,708
[Mr. Evans] Elle.

1783
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,458
Where are you going?

1784
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:36,458
To fix something
that's actually worth saving.

1785
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:50,333
And with Noah gone,
I was just... lonely, you know?

1786
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:53,333
- I didn't realize that I was even...
- Cock-blocking?

1787
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:59,250
Not sure if I would have phrased it
like that, but, yeah, I guess.

1788
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:00,833
[chuckles, sobs]

1789
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:04,416
The idea that I had something to do
with you guys breaking up,

1790
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,750
- I feel so...
- No. Lee did this.

1791
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,291
And he'd do it again
because that's how much you mean to him.

1792
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,500
Rachel, he loves you so much.

1793
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,041
And now that I know the problem,

1794
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,666
- I can absolutely fix...
- [sighs] Elle!

1795
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,625
It's rule number 16.

1796
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:24,958
You know?

1797
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:30,000
{\an8}[Elle] <i>Rule number 16: when
your bestie needs you there,</i>

1798
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,541
{\an8}<i>you need to be there for your bestie.</i>

1799
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,166
[Noah]
You know what I can't figure out though?

1800
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,500
How did your earring get under my bed
in the first place?

1801
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:41,708
Okay, about that...

1802
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,041
Um, don't get pissy,

1803
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,208
but when you were out of town
for a football game, I...

1804
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,916
sort of crashed at your place
after getting into a fight with Jason

1805
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,541
and the earring must have
just fallen off then.

1806
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,250
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1807
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:57,916
- That's just...
- I said <i>don't </i>get pissy.

1808
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,000
Now that we know what's happened,
we can fix this.

1809
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:03,958
Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna fix it.

1810
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,833
You know,
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

1811
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,875
I can't believe that she thought
that I'd actually cheat on her, you know?

1812
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,041
That's the reason I was lying
about us hanging out in the first place.

1813
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:18,250
I was trying to avoid
this whole situation.

1814
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:19,833
Listen to me.

1815
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:23,333
Just to give you things
from Elle's point of view,

1816
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,458
you used to have
quite the reputation, right?

1817
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:32,250
And Elle has no idea that I am one
of the few women on the planet

1818
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,708
immune to the charms of Noah Flynn.

1819
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:40,083
And then she finds my earring,
which couldn't have been very helpful

1820
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,875
to a woman who's missing her guy

1821
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,250
all the way on the other side
of the country.

1822
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:48,833
I don't like it when you're right.

1823
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,833
Well, I do sleep where I'm not supposed to
from time to time,

1824
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:54,291
but overall,

1825
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,666
- I'm a very talented individual.

01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,958
- Can I help you before I go? Just...
- [Mrs. Flynn] No, no, no.

1830
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,250
I'll take care of this mess.

1831
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,333
- You go take care of yours.
- [scoffs]

1832
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:19,291
But, Elle, before you go,
I just want to say this afternoon,

1833
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,250
I noticed the three of you doing
a lot of talking

1834
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:24,458
and maybe not as much listening.

1835
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:26,708
I just want to tell you make sure

1836
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:29,458
that you really listen
to what the other person has to say.

1837
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:31,833
Just hear them out, okay?

1838
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:33,916
Okay.

1839
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,833
Okay.

1840
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,208
Oh! I almost forgot.

1841
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,958
There's a thing I wanna take with me.

I need to say this.

2103
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:40,833
When I started this school year,

2104
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:43,083
I was pretty lonely,

2105
01:57:43,416 --> 01:57:45,958
and I wasn't really doing so well
in my classes.

2106
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:47,958
Why didn't you say anything?

2107
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,125
'Cause I was embarrassed.

2108
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,333
Then I met, uh, Chloe,

2109
01:57:57,166 --> 01:58:00,208
and she showed me around,
introduced me to her friends and...

2110
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:02,375
And...

2111
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:07,000
I know we used to make fun of you and Lee
and your rules,

2112
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,375
but I see what you guys have.

2113
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:17,250
I guess a part of me just kinda wanted
to have the same thing with her.

Noah.

2115
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:22,375
So then when you didn't believe
that her and I could just be friends,

2116
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:25,833
it reminded me of what you used to think
about me...

[shudders]

2118
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:29,208
And I didn't like that.

2119
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:32,208
That was...

2120
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:36,375
that was less about you and more just...

2121
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:40,416
I just compared myself to her.

2122
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:48,458
And when you left, I just kind of figured
that we would end,

2123
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:50,583
so when I found the earring,

2124
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:53,583
I made that the thing that would end it,
you know?

2125
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:55,958
I know,
I wanted to stop you feeling jealous,

2126
01:58:56,041 --> 01:58:58,208
so I stopped telling you things.

2127
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:01,375
I was so scared
you were gonna get on that plane...

2128
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:05,833
before I could tell you
that I really didn't want you to go.
