MILITARY BAND

2
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,203
CHEERING

3
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,953
'It was a good dream - my best one.'

4
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:06,390
'Everything was perfect.'

5
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,776
'My mother was proud of her son's wings.'

6
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:31,009
'My half-sister, Meg, lost her braces.'

7
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:41,081
'My other half-sister, Gloria, had realised my intellectual superiority'

8
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,120
SHE GROWLS

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,398
..And was quietly respectful to me.'

10
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,583
BOOING

11
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:07,698
'My step-fathers were slaves, captured in battle.'

12
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:19,128
'And, there was a Wac by my side.'

13
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:24,284
'Not too bright, not too loud. Hugely attractive.'

14
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,522
'It's a good dream.'

15
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,878
'A John Wayne meets Hugh Hefner philosophy...

16
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,473
..if you consider Hef a philosopher, or John Wayne.'

17
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:44,266
'But whatever the dream, there's always a face that I can't see...

18
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:52,220
..that I keep missing, out there beyond the edge of the crowd.'

19
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,497
BAND STOPS PLAYING AND WIND HOWLS

20
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,637
- RADIO: 
- "This is WJB Boston."

21
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:23,033
"It's 70 degrees on the first day of summer, 1968...

22
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:27,429
..a good day to be born a woman..."

23
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,429
"# If you are born a woman..."

24
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:32,985
Turn it up, I love this song!

25
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:32,985
It's too loud already.

26
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:32,985
Turn it up!

27
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,985
Turn it down, Meg.

28
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:37,900
I like this song, Gloria.

29
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,900
White-trash music.

30
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,900
It's good!

31
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,735
Mother, will you reason with her?

32
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,735
MUSIC STOPS

33
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,735
Mother, I was listening to that!

34
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:46,613
Don't whine. It's so unattractive.

35
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:50,250
It was wearing down the battery.

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,126
No, it wasn't. Batteries can run for hours like that.

37
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:59,881
Thank you, Charles.

38
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:59,881
What an engineer(!) I thought airplanes were your forte.

39
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:03,598
Was I talking to you?

40
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,598
This is our pilot, Charles Norstadt.

41
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:08,434
< Yeah, was he talking to you? Come on, Gloria, spare us.

42
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,432
'It was a good dream.'

43
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,670
THEY ALL ARGUE

44
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:30,935
Did you see that? They ate right out of my hand!

45
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:33,453
Chuck? Wake up!

46
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,453
What?

47
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:39,008
You're doing that thing again.

48
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:39,008
What thing?

49
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,008
You get that look on your face.

50
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:44,243
Where do you go when you do that? He came this close to my eyes.

51
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,995
Hi.

52
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,992
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

53
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:01,269
Are you married?

54
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:09,262
He's really shy.

55
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:09,262
You're nuts.

56
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:09,262
I'm just trying to help Mother.

57
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:09,262
She doesn't need help.

58
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:13,498
Marriage is her hobby, like bridge or dog-breeding.

59
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:18,574
I wanna be sure the next guy's nice. More like my dad than Gloria's.

60
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:22,331
Or mine.

61
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,331
I didn't say that.

62
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:27,966
Doesn't matter. I won't be here much longer.

63
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:27,966
How? You flunked.

64
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,803
I can take the exam again.

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:36,998
What's so funny?

66
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:36,998
I didn't say anything. Anyway, she'll never let you go.

67
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,670
Look.

68
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,907
Mother, I'm trying to read.

69
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,907
Oh, come on!

70
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:57,261
Oh!

71
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:57,261
Isn't it clever?

72
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,261
What is this?

73
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,979
Mom?

74
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,578
Mother?

75
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,655
What is it, Charles?

76
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,173
I wanna retake the exam.

77
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,932
You've had your chance, Charles.

78
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:11,768
I can retake it at the end of August.

79
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,726
I don't want you at boarding school.

80
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:17,004
It's my dad's school.

81
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,602
That'll convince her(!)

82
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:19,761
Shut up!

83
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,880
I don't want you at a military academy.

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,598
They're fascist and unnatural.

85
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,236
Well, there's no risk letting him take the exam.

86
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:30,232
Can you see him cramming Latin and geometry at the cottage?

87
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:33,470
Look, I'm already studying! Mother?

88
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,629
All right, Charles.

89
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,906
If you wanna give up your whole vacation, you can try again.

90
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:39,744
No, not the whole summer.

91
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,701
You know it takes you longer than other children.

92
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,740
GLORIA LAUGHS

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,298
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

94
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:56,650
You're stupid, you're stupid, you're stupid!

95
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,967
Now you're slow!

96
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,325
You know you're Goober Pyle!

97
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,122
TYRE HISSES

98
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,297
DIL!

99
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:36,296
Down, boy! Lie down!

100
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,131
I'm, er...

101
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,249
I'm so...sorry.

102
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,884
This tyre's been vandalised.

103
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,602
What?

104
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:52,602
Yeah. Look.

105
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:55,439
Half a dozen deliberate punctures.

106
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,434
Oh, my God! Who would do something like that? That's crazy!

107
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:04,392
Oh! My God! Come here!

108
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,392
What?

109
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:09,187
Isn't that Hamburger-Head? You know, McLeod?

110
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:12,505
I thought he never left his dungeon.

111
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:15,942
Don't stare. We're not at a circus.

112
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:27,052
'"Will I actually commit the crime? That is for the coin to decide."'

113
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:32,408
< "Which face will it show? The whole, or the ruined?"

114
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:37,723
"The coin has decided. And so, Two-Face must strike...

115
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:42,479
"as the bells of Gotham City ring out into the murky night."

116
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,034
Charles! Lunch! >

117
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:48,034
Oh, no! Here she comes. Better get you out of here, Mac.

118
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,872
Shut up.

119
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,469
Charles, what are you doing?

120
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:56,307
I'm studying.

121
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:58,865
You're not gonna get lunch in bed. Come on!

122
00:08:58,865 --> 00:08:59,904
SHE SNEEZES

123
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:13,412
Charles!

124
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,651
What?

125
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:17,928
I told you I don't want that rabid beast in the house.

126
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:21,485
I keep Mac outside.

127
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,484
I am in earnest, young man.

128
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:26,321
That cat is so disgusting.

129
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:29,159
< That's enough, Gloria.

130
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:35,034
- Where are you going? 
- I'm going to study.

131
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,432
If you need any help...

132
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:51,819
Hey, Chad! What's that kid's...? Chuck! Have you seen Gloria?

133
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:55,656
Er, yeah. She went off with some guy in a Mustang.

134
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:00,172
What guy?

135
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,172
I don't know. >

136
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,291
Who's the guy?

137
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,170
I dunno. Just...some guy.

138
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,166
When?

139
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:07,166
Just now.

140
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:14,760
< Chuck! Wait up!

141
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,760
Jeez!

142
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:19,436
Chuck, I said wait up!

143
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:21,634
What are you, my shadow?

144
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:25,470
Don't compensate by using me as an emotional punching bag.

145
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,868
You're too young to talk like that.

146
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:33,224
Gloria's right. You'll never pass it on your own.

147
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,422
- Shut up! 
- Why don't you let me tutor you?

148
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:40,178
- You're ten years old! 
- So? You know I'm smart enough.

149
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:43,775
You're a genius. A fender-face genius!

150
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:50,369
And you're a jerk! I hope you fail and have to live with us forever!

151
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:55,405
What are you gonna do, ask Gloria for help?

152
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,723
Don't be such a boy!

153
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:11,511
Hey, Norstadt!

154
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,669
You're still a virgin!

155
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,025
Catching up on a little reading?

156
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,342
School's over, you know, wing-nut.

157
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:24,300
Thanks for the newsflash, brillo-head.

158
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,696
Shut up!

159
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,696
What's goin' on, guys?

160
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,696
Pearson's got his old man's boat.

161
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:32,173
- Where are you gonna swim? 
- Freak beach. You want in?

162
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:36,010
- You up to it? 
- Let's go. 
- Sure.

163
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,368
- What are you waitin' for? 
- Come on.

164
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,446
Can I come?

165
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,164
No flat chicks allowed!

166
00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:45,122
Shut up, you sexist pig!

167
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,359
- Whoa, bra-burner! 
- Trainer bra-burner!

168
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:52,636
The only bra you'll ever see is your momma's!

169
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:59,550
What a stupid world.

170
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,186
We could divide all chickdom into Ginger and Mary-Anne...

171
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:09,141
but why not let visitors onto this island paradise?

172
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:12,339
Guest stars. Top of the list, Agent 99.

173
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,495
- Agent 99 sucks. 
- Bewitched would be good. 
- Bewitched is married.

174
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:19,053
- So? 
- He'd probably do it with Mrs Howell.

175
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:22,730
THEY LAUGH

176
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,845
- You guys ever seen the Freak? 
- McLeod? He won't let you see him.

177
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,923
- I saw him. 
- Oh, screw you!

178
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,721
I saw him on the ferry!

179
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,399
Why would Hamburger-Head go on the boat?

180
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,554
He travelled below. The Hound from Hell was with him.

181
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:42,553
His wolf?

182
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,471
The Freak was this close to me.

183
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:50,866
Why would the Freak go to Boston?

184
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,866
Mafia meeting, probably.

185
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,866
Porno. He writes porno books.

186
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:52,145
Get outta here!

187
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:55,662
He gets parcels from porn publishers.

188
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:57,700
How's a freak gonna write porno?

189
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,139
What would he write about?

190
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:03,375
I don't know. Maybe his dog!

191
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:08,051
Wait. Did you hear that?

192
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:12,007
What?

193
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,007
Listen... What was that?

194
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:19,161
(I'm scared.)

195
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:19,161
(Shut up, don't let him see you.)

196
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:19,161
Ow, my finger!

197
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,161
(Shut up, man!)

198
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,994
- Wait up, guys! 
- Come on!

199
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,312
Start the motor! Come on!

200
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:47,257
Boy, was that close! Jeez! Was that a wolf?

201
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:53,971
Did you see the Freak up there, man?

202
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:53,971
He was scared of the wolf. He was pissin' in his pants!

203
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,969
We gotta go back!

204
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,646
I left my books there! Come on! I left my books!

205
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:04,163
We gotta go back!

206
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,163
Tell the school the dog ate 'em. >

207
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:10,717
What subject was it, Latin? Screw-us you-us! >

208
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,516
< See ya later, pizza-head!

209
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:04,031
If he's a cannibal, I'll just tell him I have bone cancer.

210
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:33,806
'I don't know what to do when he gets that stupid look on his face.'

211
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:36,483
'What do you see in the ink blot, Charles?'

212
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:40,800
'What do you think I mean by "passive aggressive"?'

213
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,278
'He's his father's son all right.'

214
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,554
'Eric was my third husband and my one real mistake.'

215
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,991
'That's very funny, Charles. What do you really see?'

216
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:56,586
'You don't care about anybody but yourself.'

217
00:15:56,586 --> 00:16:00,303
'What do you see in the ink blot, Charles?'

218
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,821
John Wayne.

219
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,696
< What are you doing here?

220
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:17,688
What's wrong with you? You got any idea how long you been here?

S...sorry.

225
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,952
It just went off. It's a funny clock.

226
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,708
Funny "ha-ha", funny strange?

227
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,465
Not sure.

228
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:37,100
Says you taught at, erm, Barrett Academy.

229
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,818
Is that a good school?

230
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,815
What do you teach?

231
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:47,011
- What's your name? 
- Erm, Chuck. Chuck Norstadt.

232
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:51,328
Well, Chuck Chuck Norstadt, where do you live?

233
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:54,365
Just the other side of the harbour.

234
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:59,241
Then you'd better drink this and go.

235
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:02,278
Oh, great. Thanks.

236
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,436
Come on, Mickey. Heel.

237
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:15,307
Mickey really doesn't seem the right name for your dog.

238
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:18,664
It's like naming Godzilla "Bambi".

239
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:24,299
You name him after Mickey Metal or Mickey Mouse?

240
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,937
How's your mother's front tyre?

241
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:29,975
Fine.

242
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:35,889
It's a bright night. You should be able to find your way home.

243
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,408
Yeah.

244
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,646
You found your way here, didn't you?

245
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:42,044
Mm-hm.

246
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,317
It's my bike.

247
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:56,112
Hey, you still do any teaching?

248
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,230
Reason I ask is...

249
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:04,625
This may sound crazy, but I could really use some help on an exam.

250
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,062
- Why does that sound crazy? 
- I don't know,

251
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:12,338
I just never thought of you as a teacher.

252
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:16,015
Nobody does. Not that I know anything about you or anything.

253
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:22,130
It won't take long. It's just to get into this second-rate boarding school

254
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,328
Misunderstood, are we?

255
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:32,321
I'm just sick of living with three females, all brilliant, and being the family retard.

256
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:37,596
I see. Nothing at all to do with pre-pubescent angst, then?

257
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:42,113
It was the school my father went to.

258
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:47,668
He was in Korea, then he died in a jet crash.

259
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:52,344
Some kind of experimental spy plane.

260
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:56,380
- If it's a matter of money, I can pay you. 
- No, I don't think you can.

261
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:03,414
Nice to have met you, Mr McLeod.

262
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,453
Bucket-head.

263
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:10,728
There's Great Grandfather MacNeil. He built the cottage.

264
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,726
Far out.

265
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,764
Oh, look at those Presbyterian eyes.

266
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,041
Ooh, terrifying!

267
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,838
I can't believe you're interested in all this ancient history.

268
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,996
I am, it's all research.

269
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:28,313
All for my book on the Robber Baringer mine shaft.

270
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:32,110
That is such an important topic.

271
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,066
It looks like Mark Hughes is writing the foreword.

272
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:39,343
Mark Hughes?

273
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:43,060
Charles? Come here, dear.

274
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,499
Hi, man.

275
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:49,175
I want you to meet Professor Hartley of Yale. This is my son, Charles.

276
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,294
Just call me Carl.

277
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:56,529
I don't need any of that imperialistic authoritarian crap.

278
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,726
Hi... Carl.

279
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:05,401
THINKS: She hasn't caught a fish, she's vacuumed up a hairball!

280
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:08,159
Hi, Chuck.

281
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:11,636
Go put some dry clothes on.

282
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,232
Good night.

If I had a dog like you, I'd put a bag over its head.

00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:15,250
Yes, I would, you flea-infested sack of worms...

Beautiful day, isn't it?

00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,030
Um...

297
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,228
I'm here.

I know you're pressed for time and everything...

299
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:50,140
but I was wondering,

300
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,694
maybe you'd be interested in some Latin exercises...

301
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:59,731
just to look over 'em.

302
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:08,924
I realise you're busy, Mr McLeod...

303
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:13,040
but how much work is a couple of Latin passages?

304
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,077
Maybe a little geometry?

305
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,469
I'd like a hole.

306
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:31,944
I don't understand.

307
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,944
Three feet, cubed. Right here.

308
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:35,621
Stay.

309
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:42,535
Listen, I said I could pay you, didn't I?

00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:09,032
You can sit here.

315
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:22,860
Now, I'd like you to write an essay.

316
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,339
Any topic you'd like.

317
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,577
Why? It's not on the exam.

318
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,094
Why did you come here?

319
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,731
Quickly! Don't think, just answer.

320
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:35,809
For some help. You know.

321
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,167
No. Do you want help or not?

322
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,725
I guess so, if you're a teacher.

323
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,843
I guess so...sir.

324
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,681
I guess so, sir.

325
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,879
Good.

00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:53,394
This is the way it works - adisca alt disceda. Learn or leave.

327
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:57,750
It's of no consequence to me one way or the other. Understood?

328
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,549
Yeah.

329
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,744
Except the bit about digging shithouse holes and writing bullshit.

330
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:08,821
I haven't got a lot of pity.

331
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,618
You can go now.

332
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,490

00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,030
No, thanks.

337
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:49,785
According to my sources, he was a mad professor like Carl. "Dr McLeod"

338
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,824
Must be a Harvard man.

339
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:55,021
< No doubt.

00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:55,021
Thank you.

< It was a classic murder-suicide.

00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,531
< Ask Gus the barber.

345
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:11,327
That's not what Gus told me.

346
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:11,327
When you were getting your hair cut?

347
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:15,044
He said he didn't kill his wife, but his boyfriend.

348
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:17,682
Carl!

349
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:21,318
I wanna know what he thinks plastic surgery is for.

350
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:23,716
Unless he doesn't have the money.

351
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:30,990
Someone told me, and I do not believe this, that he was one of the Kennedys

352
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,347
The Kennedys? Well, he certainly resembles one.

353
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:37,704
- SHE LAUGHS 
- No, I didn't mean that.

354
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,142
I can't believe you said that.

355
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:44,379
Becky, how many years has McLeod been here?

356
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,337
Six - no, seven.

357
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:49,254
Every summer we talk about him. >

358
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:54,090
So?

359
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:54,090
One day I'll knock on his door and end all this.

360
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,487
Oh, Todd, where's the fun in that?

361
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:01,084
Hey, how's the scholar doin'?

362
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:03,602
Gonna make it to West Point yet, are we?

363
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:05,720
Don't remind me.

364
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,199
You know how I hate the idea

365
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,236
of him becoming one of those brush-cut fly boys.

366
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:13,474
Come on, Catherine, you like to fly.

367
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:18,989
I like to have the garbage picked up but I don't want him doing that!

368
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:24,224
This air force bit is something Chuck's just into for the moment.

369
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:28,181
Once he understands what the Pentagon is doing in Vietnam...

370
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,219
Are we having this argument again?

371
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:35,055
No, because I'm talking to Kitty. Besides, I'm too drunk.

372
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:38,932
I'm just glad he's way too young for the draft.

373
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:46,206
Y'know, there's nothing I'd rather do than drop napalm for a living.

374
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,115
I... Are you gonna let that...?

375
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,273
Television.

376
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:15,900
Mine's vodka. What's your excuse?

377
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:19,737
You gonna marry the hair... Er...

378
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:24,772
Carl? I don't know, Charles. Do you think I should?

379
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,765
Your mother's not much use to you these days, is she?

380
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:38,441
I'm sorry. I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket.

381
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:43,676
I never expected to have three children, let alone by three husbands.

382
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:46,154
Can I ask you something?

383
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:47,873
Sure.

384
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,311
You promise not to get mad?

385
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:52,549
Charles.

386
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:55,066
Why does Gloria hate me?

387
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:58,384
Oh, Charles, she doesn't...

388
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:03,419
Because you were born, baby.

389
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,056
But that wasn't my fault.

390
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:11,452
No, but she didn't know that. She was four years old.

391
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:16,208
All she knew was she had a rival for your father's affection.

392
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:20,684
She hated my father. She's always telling me what a jerk he was.

393
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,843
The way you do.

394
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:28,278
Oh, Charles, I never meant that.

395
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:30,516
I just didn't know how to...

396
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,834
- GLORIA YAWNS 
- Morning, all.

397
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,948
(Hey, we didn't always feel that way about him.)

398
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,785
About who? Who are we talking about?

399
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,864
Charles' father.

400
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,102
Oh, yes?

401
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:22,431
Whoa.

402
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,946
Is this what you wanted?

403
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:33,102
"Why the system must be changed now!"

404
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:37,379
Exclamation point. "By Charles E Norstadt."

405
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:41,855
I had no idea you pondered such weighty issues, Charles E.

406
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:46,850
I did what you asked. Are you gonna keep up your end?

407
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,529
All right.

408
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:53,964
I'd like a hole. Three feet across, three feet deep.

409
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:59,999
And how about a triangle? Two by two by three. Three feet deep.

410
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:02,197
Just near the paddock, left of the entrance.

411
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,795
If you need a hole, hire a contractor.

412
00:32:04,795 --> 00:32:06,274
I don't need a hole.

413
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,545
I'm interested in your title.

414
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:20,342
I was wondering how you came to choose it.

415
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:25,937
Erm, it's about how... how people have to change things.

416
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:28,774
What kind of things? Sit down.

417
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:31,452
What kind of things?

418
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,810
The Government, you know.

419
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,647
What would you change about the Government?

420
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:41,484
Me? Erm, lots of things.

421
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,122
Such as?

422
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:45,440
Such as...

423
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,518
Such as how the word is spelt, for example.

424
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:50,596
What?

425
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:58,389
Judging by your essay, it seems you hope to change the spelling of "government", "democracy"...

426
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,667
and "Richard Miltown Nixon".

427
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,785
So, I'm not too good at spellings.

428
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:07,501
I see that, but if you're going to plagiarise, you might at least show the courtesy of...

429
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:11,618
- What are you talking about? 
- Don't! Who wrote this? Who?

430
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,295
Bill Garfield.

431
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:18,612
Never heard of him.

432
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,612
He's at Colombia.

433
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:21,849
Oh, so you're a high-class cheat.

434
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,366
I'm not a cheat...

435
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,366
You are!

436
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:33,199
I hate writing. It sucks!

437
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:33,199
< Adisca alt disceda.

438
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:33,199
It's a waste of time! It's like digging those shitty holes!

439
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:53,382
I'll write you a stinkin' essay!

440
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:31,349
"Why Spiderman sucks worse than the Silver Surfer!" Very good.

441
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,787
Are you happy now? Can I go?

442
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:35,546
You invited yourself.

443
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:44,178
Tonight, I want you to look up ten alternatives for the slang "to suck"

444
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,857
Shit!

445
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:50,613
And find me the Latin equivalent of your other favourite descriptive.

446
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:53,530
Mickey!

447
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,282
I gotta go.

448
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,317
< # If you're born a woman

449
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:13,793
< # You're born to be hurt

450
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:17,630
# You're born to be stepped on

451
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:23,065
# Lied to, cheated on and treated like dirt. #

452
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:34,495
I followed you this morning.

453
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:41,569
You tell, and you're dead.

454
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:43,727
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

455
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,485
I'm not gonna tell anybody IF...

456
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,563
What? If what?

457
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,400
You tell me all about him. What were you doing there?

458
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,757
You swear. Swear by Thor.

459
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:03,870
- I did what you said. I got a tutor. 
- The Freak's a teacher? Come on!

460
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,027
- I think he is. 
- What does he teach?

461
00:36:07,027 --> 00:36:09,945
He makes me dig holes.

462
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:16,139
You liar! I'm gonna tell Mom, and she'll never let you near him again!

463
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,377
Keep your mouth shut!

464
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:21,175
OK! Get off, you maniac!

465
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,612
What's he like? Do you like him? Does he like you?

466
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:28,649
He hates everybody. I mean, look at him.

467
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:32,206
Sometimes I think I'm gonna be sick, just watching him.

468
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,723
Let me come with you. Please!

469
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:37,201
< Come on, Chuck.

470
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:48,911
Lunatic!

471
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:55,146
< Hello?

472
00:36:56,744 --> 00:36:58,823
Mr McLeod?

473
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:03,579
Sir?

474
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,653
Hey, Pukehead! You home?!

475
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,249
Guess not.

476
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:45,091
Porno.

477
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:50,607
DOOR OPENS

478
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,841
Take it easy. OK.

479
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:57,880
MICKEY WHIMPERS

480
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,238
Lie down.

481
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:04,275
I'll be right back, fella. OK?

482
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,901
Hey, when did you get back?

483
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:10,898
I went for a walk when I finished my homework.

484
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,296
Jeez, what happened to him?

485
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,134
He encountered a porcupine.

486
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:17,053
Excrementum!

487
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:20,689
Stiltus puer.

488
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:23,047
What? What does that mean?

489
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:27,284
"The foolish boy"... digs a three-foot hole.

490
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:32,399
If we assume that he has dug his cube properly...

491
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,677
what will be the volume if he fills up half of it? >

492
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:46,467
Now, stiltus puer wants to erect a pole at the centre of his circle.

493
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:49,225
But how does he find that centre?

494
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:51,463
Think, Norstadt, reason.

495
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:54,980
No? Write this down.

496
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,178
Draw a circle. A,B,C.

497
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:03,732
Draw within it any straight line, AB.

498
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:10,567
Bisect AB at D and draw a straight line, DC, at right angles to AB.

499
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,325
With me, Norstadt?

500
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:13,604
Yes, sir.

501
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:17,201
OK. Any other straight line - AC.

502
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:20,838
Bisect AC, and you get the centre of your circle.

503
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:24,035
Good.

504
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:37,064
Euclid's Proposition 47. This is the famous one.

505
00:41:39,022 --> 00:41:41,860
In any right-angled triangle...

506
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:52,371
Have a good look. Get it over with. Then we'll continue. Enough?

507
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,248
Good.

508
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:57,966
In any right-angled triangle,

509
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:04,241
the square on the side subtending the right angle, is equal to... what?

510
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:08,037
Equal to the sum of the squares on each of the two sides, sir.

511
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:10,195
Thank you. >

512
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,231
Take away the moustache, lighten the hair...

513
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,350
McLeod?

514
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,466
Shouldn't it mention that the man has no face?

515
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:23,304
You don't know what they keep back.

516
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:28,020
Give it a rest. Last week you thought it was Fidel Castro.

517
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,419
I said take away the beard.

518
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,177
How's that, Wayne?

519
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:34,335
Oh! Very nice, Gus.

520
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:40,609
All right, Wayne, but nobody lives like that unless they've got history.

521
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:42,088
Who's business is that?

522
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:47,084
This man has not bothered a soul since he's been here.

523
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:49,681
Any reason why you think he would?

524
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,079
Some other haircut.

525
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:04,229
"Strange fits of passion have I known

526
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:08,146
"and I will dare to tell but in the lover's ear alone"

527
00:43:08,146 --> 00:43:10,544
GETTING FASTER: "What once to me befell,

528
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:15,180
"when she I loved looked every day fresh as a rose in June..."

529
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,976
Don't bludgeon it completely.

530
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:20,895
I hate poetry!

531
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,453
It's all love this, love that.

532
00:43:23,453 --> 00:43:26,370
It's boring, snoring, smothering.

533
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:32,325
You don't like poetry or you don't like the word "love"?

534
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:41,437
Not every poem's a love sonnet. There's the "Ode to my Goldfish".

535
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:44,235
"Oh, wet pet".

536
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:46,673
That's it?

537
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:46,673
That's it.

538
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:50,190
What kind of a plane did you say your father flew?

539
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,468
U2.

540
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:57,743
157. Take it home and read it.

541
00:43:57,743 --> 00:44:03,019
Take it. It's all of 20 lines. I'm sure you can manage that.

542
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:23,121
Hey!

543
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:28,357
Oh, Chuck. You know my kid brother, don't you?

544
00:44:28,357 --> 00:44:29,396
I guessed, yes.

545
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:31,834
Were you on "The Flintstones"?

546
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:37,149
What?

547
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:37,149
You know - Fred, Dino. You know - yabadabadoo?

548
00:44:37,149 --> 00:44:40,426
That's funny. Good. Funny kid.

549
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:46,221
Let's eat.

550
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:46,221
You sit down. I'll find something.

551
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,738
What have we got here?

552
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:56,413
What have you got in your sandwich?

553
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,731
You wanna give him my sandwich?

554
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,449
Calm down.

555
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,687
What's this, poetry?

556
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:07,843
You stupid brat! You did that on purpose!

557
00:45:07,843 --> 00:45:09,162
Take it easy!

558
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:11,919
Shut up, Douglas! Come down, Slime!

559
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:16,436
What are you hiding? Idiot Charles doesn't read poetry!

560
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:18,634
It's just a little spilled milk.

561
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:26,027
'Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth

562
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:30,344
'And danced the skies on laughter's silvered wings.

563
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:36,618
'Sunward I've climbed, joined the tumbling mirth of sun-split clouds

564
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:41,974
'And done a hundred things you have not dreamed of.

565
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:44,571
'Wheeled and soared and swung,

566
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:48,728
'and while with silent lifting mind I have trod

567
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:51,925
'the high, untrespassed sanctity of space,

568
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:56,042
'put out my hand, and touched the face of God.'

569
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:01,956
KNOCK AT DOOR

570
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:03,795
BARKING

571
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,987
That's promptness.

572
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,503
I didn't need that back today.

573
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:21,180
No, it was good. I just thought I should return it.

574
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,218
Why?

575
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:25,496
Remember I told you about Gloria?

576
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,854
- Your sister? 
- My half-sister.

577
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:31,411
What's evil half-sister done now?

578
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,449
Speak up. I've got an egg boiling.

579
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:38,845
She saw the book. She'll snoop around till she finds out what I'm doing.

580
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:41,443
I don't follow.

581
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,999
You haven't told your mother that you're coming here, have you?

582
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,957
That's it, isn't it?

583
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:50,755
Why the blazes not?

584
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:52,673
If I did, she wouldn't let me come.

585
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,711
Then you can't come.

586
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,109
No! I've got to, just for a little longer!

587
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:59,547
If she's letting you take the exam,

588
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:03,024
she's not totally opposed to the idea of a boarding school, is she?

589
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:07,940
She won't let me come because it's you.

590
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:14,494
That's why. They don't know you. People are afraid of what they don't know.

591
00:47:14,494 --> 00:47:17,731
Thank you, Herr Doctor, I must be sure to write that down.

592
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:22,447
I just meant...

593
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,447
What are you playing at?

594
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,447
Nothing. Nobody has to know!

595
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,285
Do you want this exam?

596
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,640
Good.

597
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,798
Then take some responsibility for what you want.

598
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:37,115
Talk to her, Norstadt, convince her.

599
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:40,392
Convince me.

600
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,264
DOOR CLOSES

601
00:47:56,378 --> 00:47:59,096
'Mother, I could not believe it.'

602
00:47:59,096 --> 00:48:01,254
Attacked in my own home.

603
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,092
Oh, Gloria.

604
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:04,092
I'm not exaggerating.

605
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:10,086
Why do you baby him? That's what the psychiatrist said.

606
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:10,086
You know what his father...

607
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:12,165
Mother, I was there.

608
00:48:12,165 --> 00:48:14,683
< Then you should be more patient.

609
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:20,038
He's not the only one with bad dreams.

610
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,038
It's not the same.

611
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,673
Charles, what are you doing?

612
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:27,392
I've just got home.

613
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:32,627
Is there something you wanted?

614
00:48:32,627 --> 00:48:33,666
No.

615
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,260
Did he hear us?

616
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,858
I dunno.

617
00:48:44,777 --> 00:48:47,694
< Hey, Mickey. Good morning.

618
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:55,088
What's all this?

619
00:48:55,088 --> 00:49:00,044
My mother said I had to pay my way if I was going to keep coming here.

620
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,039
It's no trouble. I can do it every morning if you like.

621
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:08,556
Oh, erm...

622
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:14,151
What's this?

623
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:14,151
It's her phone number. She said to call if I was any trouble.

624
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:18,947
I don't have a telephone.

625
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,947
I'm no trouble. You could write her.

626
00:49:20,306 --> 00:49:24,023
Scratch my back, I'll scratch the horse's.

627
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,657
Here, you're going the wrong way.

628
00:49:31,816 --> 00:49:34,974
Go downward, long strokes.

629
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,131
Like this?

630
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:43,526
"Believe me, you are marvellously changed."

631
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:50,201
"I hold the world but as the world, Grat...iano, a stage."

632
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:55,636
It's not a cereal box you're reading

633
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,636
Why can't I read it silently?

634
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:55,636
Because it's a play, Norstadt.

635
00:49:55,636 --> 00:50:00,432
You perform it. "I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano.

636
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:03,989
"A stage, where every man must play a part,

637
00:50:05,427 --> 00:50:07,865
"and mine a sad one."

638
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:10,023
And what's his reason?

639
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:11,982
"I am a Jew."

640
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,297
"Hath not a Jew eyes?"

641
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:21,374
"Hath not a Jew hands,

642
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:25,730
"organs, dimensions,

643
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:29,886
"senses, affections, passions?"

644
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:37,520
"Fed with the same food? Hurt with the same weapons?

645
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,676
"Subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means?

646
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:45,713
"Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?"

647
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:49,989
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?

648
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:53,746
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

649
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:57,583
"If you poison us, do we not die?

650
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,660
"And if you wrong us...

651
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:04,457
"..shall we not revenge?"

652
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:13,089
"By my soul, I swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me. I stay upon my bond."

653
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:17,645
"Most heartily I do beseech the court to give their judgement."

654
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:26,158
"Why, then, thus it is. You must prepare your bosom for his knife."

655
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,158
"No!"

656
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:28,316
"Yes!"

657
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:32,433
"Aye, his breast. So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?"

658
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:36,030
"'Nearest his heart' - those are the very words."

659
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:42,704
Is it my line?

660
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:42,704
No, it's mine, but it's late.

661
00:51:42,704 --> 00:51:46,421
We'll finish this tomorrow.

662
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,421
No, we started. Let's finish.

663
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,419
Tomorrow...

664
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:54,774
..and tomorrow...and tomorrow, creeps Charles E.

665
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:03,326
Hello?

666
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:03,326
< Supper's in the oven.

667
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:05,564
I'm not hungry.

668
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:11,799
Do you know Shakespeare?

669
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:11,799
Know him?! I was his Ophelia at Radcliffe.

670
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:16,475
How does The Merchant of Venice end?

671
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:16,475
I don't know. Why?

672
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:22,030
Does the guy get his heart cut out?

673
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:22,030
Well, probably. Somebody dies.

674
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,187
Somebody always dies at the end of Shakespeare.

675
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,865
I thought you said you knew it.

676
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:32,261
I studied those plays years ago. Why's it so important?

677
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:34,260
It's not!

678
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:40,015
Is he doing drugs?

679
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:43,092
HE SINGS LOUDLY

680
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,127
Hey, Norstadt! Forget the horse!

681
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:53,084
Let's see if the guy gets his heart cut out!

682
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:59,358
"Do you confess the bond?"

683
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,358
"I do."

684
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,394
"Then must the Jew be merciful."

685
00:53:01,796 --> 00:53:04,394
"On what compulsion must I? Tell me that."

686
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:07,711
"The quality of mercy is not strained.

687
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,026
"It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.

688
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:19,421
"It is twice blessed. It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.

689
00:53:19,421 --> 00:53:24,217
"It is enthron-ed in the hearts of kings.

690
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:27,814
"It is an attribute to God himself,

691
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:33,129
"and earthly power doth then show likest God's

692
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:36,526
"when mercy seasons justice."

693
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:53,911
What did she say she wanted?

694
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:53,911
Um, cookies and rice.

695
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:55,950
They're over there.

696
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:04,662
Which one... Which type? >

697
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:07,340
How many types are there?

698
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,977
THEY CHAT

699
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:31,039
I need suntan lotion. Hi, Chuck.

700
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:31,039
I'm sorry.

701
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,039
Sorry? For what?

702
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,078
Oh, nothing.

703
00:54:33,078 --> 00:54:35,715
THEY GIGGLE

704
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:44,588
Sir?

705
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,588
Yeah?

706
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:52,901
Did you ever wonder...why men and women are attracted to each other?

707
00:54:55,698 --> 00:55:00,694
It's called sex, Norstadt, and it's not on your exam.

708
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:04,251
I don't mean like that.

709
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,647
I mean, why is it so difficult?

710
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:12,844
Why can't they stay together, stay attracted?

711
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:21,076
You know I never did consider myself a source of advice for the lovelorn.

712
00:55:22,315 --> 00:55:24,593
Why, weren't you married?

713
00:55:24,593 --> 00:55:26,832
Yes, I was.

714
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:28,950
A long time ago.

715
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:35,025
Still, that hardly qualifies me for any reasonable answer to that question.

716
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:46,335
All right. Do you want the short answer or the long one?

717
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,089
Short, I guess.

718
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,089
Good.

719
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:56,006
The problem is one of water.

720
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:59,004
Water?

721
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:59,004
Water.

722
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:03,880
Women have about 5% more of it than men,

723
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,677
making them subject to different forces of gravity.

724
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:10,194
Don't take my word for it, you can look it up in Newton.

725
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:11,873
It's there.

726
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:14,391
Can they be drained?

727
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:17,948
I'm serious!

728
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:23,663
Well, I believe they're waiting for us to drink more fluids.

729
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:36,532
What now?

730
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:42,167
I was wondering if...

731
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:47,682
..you really...write pornography?

732
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:58,233
HE LAUGHS

733
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,547
Is that the latest rumour?

734
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,104
Come here. I'll show you what I do for a living.

735
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,338
Here.

736
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,894
Tutoring doesn't pay what it used to.

737
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:37,479
Here's a few you might have seen.

738
00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:44,793
- You did these? 
- Yeah.

739
00:57:46,432 --> 00:57:49,149
Wow. Yeah, I've seen this one.

740
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:50,868
Well, what do you know?

741
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:07,893
Well, we don't get a lot of live specimens at the castle, do we?

742
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:19,363
Come on, back to Caesar's Gaul.

743
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:23,000
How did it happen?

744
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,758
Was it in the war?

745
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:30,914
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

746
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:36,709
That's all right. Everyone does, sooner or later.

747
00:58:36,709 --> 00:58:38,467
It was in a car crash.

748
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:42,144
- I'm sorry. 
- So am I.

749
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:45,461
Not just for this, but...

750
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:49,697
There was a boy killed in that car crash and he burned to death.

751
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,889
Let's pick up the slack tomorrow, huh?

752
00:58:58,889 --> 00:59:00,968
8.30, sharp.

753
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:13,077
Double sixes! Big Julie is dead!

754
00:59:13,077 --> 00:59:18,233
He gets the hook, new King of the Mountain.

755
00:59:18,233 --> 00:59:20,671
I won! I won!

756
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:24,428
Just don't forget, Norstadt, that on the exam Caesar wins, OK?

757
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:27,705
Wiseacre.

758
00:59:28,704 --> 00:59:31,861
Do you want to be Romans or Gauls this time?

759
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,179
Sir?

760
00:59:36,537 --> 00:59:38,975
It was a lousy thing to happen.

761
00:59:40,694 --> 00:59:44,171
- What? 
- Lots of people die in accidents.

762
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:46,609
It wasn't your fault.

763
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:51,285
Norstadt...

764
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:51,285
No, look.

765
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:55,361
Even if it was, it doesn't matter.

766
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:59,318
It doesn't matter to me.

767
00:59:57,239 --> 00:59:59,318
Norstadt!

768
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,062
Hey, look who it is!

769
01:00:17,062 --> 01:00:19,460
Who is it, bat boy?

770
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:23,617
Hey, Norstadt!

771
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:28,173
Hi, Chuck.

772
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,608
Come on, you're hoggin' it. Over here.

773
01:00:38,004 --> 01:00:40,402
How's the scholar doin'?

774
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:42,680
How's your freaky friend?

775
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,957
He's all right... for a Hamburger-Head.

776
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:50,594
How d'you know?

777
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:55,389
I gave your sister a pink belly till she squealed like a pig!

778
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:55,389
Jerks.

779
01:00:55,389 --> 01:01:02,224
Just don't tell anyone, all right?

780
01:00:58,427 --> 01:01:02,224
Why not?

781
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:02,224
Just don't. Not till I take the exam.

782
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:04,382
You're gonna hate that army school.

783
01:01:04,382 --> 01:01:07,339
I don't care. I just want out.

784
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:10,976
Do you know how he hurt his face?

785
01:01:08,818 --> 01:01:10,976
Yeah, how'd the Hamburger get burnt?

786
01:01:13,014 --> 01:01:15,732
Car crash.

787
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:18,010
He got burnt and a kid got killed.

788
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,647
The Freak killed a kid? No shit!

789
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:26,523
Listen, guys, don't say anything about McLeod. All right?

790
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:30,799
Who would we tell? My friends hate me and I don't know anybody else.

791
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,836
LAUGHTER

792
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:36,354
What? It's true. >

793
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,943
- SLURRED: 
- Hello, Charles.

794
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,977
Would you come down here, please?

795
01:01:56,977 --> 01:02:02,212
What's the matter, can't you hear me? I said come down here!

796
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:06,089
Who you been talkin' to, you little bastard?

797
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,926
- Huh? 
- BARKKING

798
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:10,805
Who did you tell?

799
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:12,683
GLASS SMASHES

800
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:16,999
Come down here, I said! Or are you deaf as well as stupid?

801
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,237
Who's there? Who's that?!

802
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,514
Get down here! Or do I have to come up and get you?

803
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:25,592
It's three in the morning! > 

804
01:02:25,592 --> 01:02:28,629
Who you been talkin' to, you little bastard?

805
01:02:28,629 --> 01:02:30,868
Do you realise what you've done to me?!

806
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:48,652
SOBS

807
01:03:12,392 --> 01:03:14,030
Help yourself!

808
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:18,267
Morning, Chuck. What's happening, man?

809
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,743
- Charles... 
- We have some big news.

810
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:24,501
Go ahead, tell him.

811
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,258
Your mom and I are going to be married.

812
01:03:31,695 --> 01:03:33,174
Charles... Is there something you want to say?

813
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,691
You may be tall but you're stupid.

814
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:38,170
Gloria! You're practically naked!

815
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,848
So what? It's my house!

816
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:41,127
Heard the news?

817
01:03:41,127 --> 01:03:42,646
I heard it yesterday.

818
01:03:42,646 --> 01:03:45,683
Don't freak with delight(!) It might go to my head.

819
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:48,841
- Congratulations, Carl. 
- Watch out, she bites.

820
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:50,479
- You bite! 
- Butt out!

821
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:53,277
- Shut up, Gloria! 
- Be quiet, and...

822
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:54,596
..Think happy thoughts.

823
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,674
Are we going to live with you in Connecticut?

824
01:03:56,674 --> 01:04:02,629
Sure. Your mom and I are going looking for a new home, and you're coming with us.

825
01:04:02,629 --> 01:04:04,787
You want to come along too, man?

826
01:04:04,787 --> 01:04:07,185
What about me? I don't get a say in where we live?

827
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:09,303
Of course you do, come along, then.

828
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:13,180
- I can't, because I'm going to Dad's, remember? I told you, Mother! 
- How convenient(!)

829
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:17,376
I can't go. I've got to study and take care of my cats!

830
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:21,213
Oh, Charles!

831
01:04:18,056 --> 01:04:21,213
- I don't take milk. 
- Oh, you don't take milk...

832
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:25,769
- Your cat brother has developed a fetish for my underwear! 
- No accounting for taste!

833
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:31,844
I think we should put it to sleep.

834
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:31,844
I think we should put you to sleep.

835
01:04:29,246 --> 01:04:31,844
You touch Mac and you're dead!

836
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:36,680
- What are you... 
- I'm trying to eat!

837
01:04:33,882 --> 01:04:36,680
THEY ALL ARGUE

838
01:04:37,439 --> 01:04:40,676
Don't hit your sister!

839
01:04:38,238 --> 01:04:40,676
What about his background?

840
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:46,471
That's enough, Gloria!

841
01:04:42,275 --> 01:04:46,471
He started it!

842
01:04:44,193 --> 01:04:46,471
That's enough!

843
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:01,099
It's OK, it's OK.

844
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,175
Morning.

845
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:07,053
Sorry to be late.

846
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:08,932
That's all right.

847
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:14,727
I wanted to talk to you, about what happened yesterday.

848
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:19,003
Seems I'm not so good with people anymore.

849
01:05:20,842 --> 01:05:26,277
I've forgotten how to be with them, I guess. Can you understand that?

850
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:29,634
Doesn't matter.

851
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,634
Doesn't it?

852
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,792
Why should it?

853
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,028
So, can we start?

854
01:05:37,787 --> 01:05:38,946
All right.

855
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:44,901
Your turn, Dougie.

856
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:50,976
B-E-D. Bed.

857
01:05:50,976 --> 01:05:52,734
Six. Very good, Doug. Excellent.

858
01:05:52,734 --> 01:06:00,248
Triple word score, double letter on the F. 48 points.

859
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,124
Have you heard the latest on the F-R-E-A-K?

860
01:06:04,124 --> 01:06:09,240
Gloria, don't call him that.

861
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:09,240
Sorry. The reclusive deformed warpo.

862
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,037
He killed a kid when he got that face.

863
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:15,155
So Rob's mother said.

864
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:22,549
She thinks he's JFK...

865
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:22,549
Mom, I think you should know that...

866
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:22,549
Erm, who's winning?

867
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:25,786
Um...I think I am.

868
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:36,457
Charles, I can't send you to the Lansings' with a carton of beans.

869
01:06:36,457 --> 01:06:41,013
What about this? You like this.

870
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:41,013
No, I like beans.

871
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:44,929
Sorry, Mrs Camlin.

872
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:49,885
Take your time. We always stay late on Thursdays for Mr McLeod.

873
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,444
Oh, that's nice of you.

874
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,599
Ah!

875
01:06:59,117 --> 01:07:03,194
What?

876
01:07:00,356 --> 01:07:03,194
I... I have to go to the bathroom.

877
01:07:03,993 --> 01:07:06,191
Wait until we get home.

878
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:11,986
Mom, I have to pee so bad I'm gonna wiz out my ear!

879
01:07:09,548 --> 01:07:11,986
Downstairs to the left.

880
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:29,371
Good evening.

881
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:29,371
It's almost ready, Mr McLeod.

882
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:31,649
Thank you.

883
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:36,565
Er...

884
01:07:38,723 --> 01:07:43,999
There you are. That does it. Thank you.

885
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,877
Thank you.

886
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,988
Bye, honey.

887
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,988
Bye, Carl.

888
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,466
Call us when you get there!

889
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:02,783
Bye-bye!

890
01:08:06,899 --> 01:08:10,136
Want a beer?

891
01:08:07,778 --> 01:08:10,136
Yeah. Want a beer?

892
01:08:11,695 --> 01:08:14,013
Yeah.

893
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:20,647
Quidem magistri discipulos tanta

894
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:24,684
cumata dulcebant ut ipsi discipulis.

895
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,442
Now...

896
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:32,517
Right. "Some teachers used to teach their pupils so well..."

897
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,517
With such great art.

898
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:35,075
Erm... .."that..."

899
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:37,952
This is Latin, not Swahili.

900
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:41,829
You had this a week ago. What's the matter with you?

901
01:08:45,826 --> 01:08:48,863
Good afternoon.

902
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:48,863
Afternoon.

903
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:51,980
Good hunting?

904
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:51,980
Can't complain.

905
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:59,854
All right. Quidem magistri discipulos, tanta cumata...

906
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:03,171
What are you lookin' at?

907
01:09:03,331 --> 01:09:06,768
I said what are you lookin' at?

908
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:06,768
Norstadt, come here!

909
01:09:09,286 --> 01:09:11,484
Assholes!

910
01:09:26,191 --> 01:09:30,387
Better bring it up, Norstadt, whatever it is.

911
01:09:35,143 --> 01:09:40,858
I told how you got hurt, and how the kid died.

912
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:44,216
Now everybody knows.

913
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:45,295
And why did you do that?

914
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:49,251
It was... I got...

915
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:52,528
I... I was really angry.

916
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:57,684
You're a hard marker, aren't you?

917
01:09:57,804 --> 01:10:04,518
People are either in or they're out. Strictly pass or fail.

918
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:04,518
I'm sorry. I betrayed you.

919
01:10:04,518 --> 01:10:08,595
I stabbed you in the back, and I don't even know why.

920
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:12,631
Come on, we're not doin' Julius Caesar now.

921
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:14,390
What?

922
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:18,546
Et tu, Chuckus? It's all right, I'll live.

923
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:27,738
You mean you don't hate my guts?

924
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:27,738
No, I don't hate your guts. Come on.

925
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,135
Do you think I'm crazy?

926
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:39,808
One of those kids who offs himself and writes a letter blaming Ed Sullivan.

927
01:10:39,808 --> 01:10:44,684
Why?

928
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:44,684
The shrinks at school thought I was twisted.

929
01:10:44,684 --> 01:10:50,599
Probably because you're interesting.

930
01:10:47,361 --> 01:10:50,599
Sometimes I blank out, and I feel bad...

931
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:57,752
I think about the past - my mother, my father. I don't really know how he died.

932
01:10:58,392 --> 01:11:01,229
My parents split up when I was four.

933
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:07,064
The stuff about spy planes and pilots - I made it all up to impress you.

934
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:11,101
To make me tutor you.

935
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:11,101
Yeah.

936
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:17,096
You needn't worry, Norstadt, you're not crazy. You're shrewd.

937
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:23,330
People spend too much time thinking about the past.

938
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:27,807
Whatever else it is, it's gone.

939
01:11:27,807 --> 01:11:31,563
You know, everybody else would be all over me with questions. 

940
01:11:31,563 --> 01:11:37,239
"What do you mean you're crazy? Is your brain hot?" You never do that.

941
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:43,753
- It's just habit. I like privacy. 
- What about living alone? Do you like that?

942
01:11:46,031 --> 01:11:47,430
- It likes me. 
- What do you mean?

943
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:52,106
I've become a proper fairy-tale troll here, Norstadt.

944
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,502
Tourist Board ought to pay me.

945
01:11:56,502 --> 01:11:58,580
You're not a troll.

946
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,580
I'm a troll.

947
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:05,414
That's my job, Norstadt. My part. You want this?

948
01:12:05,414 --> 01:12:07,652
No, you keep it.

949
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:15,086
By the way, I'm setting you a practice exam tomorrow.

950
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:16,685
But I haven't studied!

951
01:12:16,685 --> 01:12:17,844
"Then I'll make ya.

952
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:27,316
"You're soft.

953
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,150
"Won't anything make a man of you?

954
01:12:43,422 --> 01:12:45,900
"For 14 years I've been scared but it's gonna be all right!"

955
01:13:16,473 --> 01:13:18,072
Time's up.

956
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:22,508
Pens down, time's up. Come on, Norstadt. Come on!

957
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:25,186
Good.

958
01:13:27,344 --> 01:13:30,421
- Can you mark it now? 
- No, tonight. You're too excited.

959
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:34,858
I didn't get the third one because we didn't do reciprocal proportions.

960
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:37,176
- Go home, Norstadt. 
- No!

961
01:13:38,215 --> 01:13:40,053
Patience.

962
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,929
Thank you.

963
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,237
I'll try some of this tonight.

964
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:59,237
< Good.

965
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:10,467
Say, Chuck, were you out hiking lately?

966
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:10,467
Er, no, not me.

967
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:13,185
Up north, Mr McLeod's place?

968
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,060
No, not me. I'm in a real hurry here.

969
01:14:21,258 --> 01:14:22,537
I don't know.

970
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:43,878
Well?

971
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,878
Well?

972
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:50,073
Are you going to tell me?

973
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:50,073
Get in.

974
01:14:46,596 --> 01:14:50,073
Tell me! Or do I have to kill you?

975
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,351
84 per cent.

976
01:14:52,351 --> 01:14:56,308
84 per cent? No way, that is great! 84 per cent!

977
01:14:56,507 --> 01:14:59,825
I'm a genius! I am a genius now!

978
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:01,863
I am one of the geniuses!

979
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:06,259
All right, it's only a practice exam. Get in.

980
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:11,015
I'm brilliant! I am a regular Einstein!

981
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,015
Norstadt!

982
01:15:11,015 --> 01:15:15,451
OK, how come we're not studying if I'm so stupid?

983
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:15,451
Because it's carrot day.

984
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,168
Put your belt on.

985
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:34,515
Wow, look at the seaplane!

986
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:34,515
It's not a seaplane, it's a carrot.

987
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:41,549
You're kidding?

988
01:15:36,393 --> 01:15:41,549
What are you waiting for? Take off. Go on.

989
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,878
Now you can tell him you've flown.

990
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:39,059
Think you can handle this yourself?

991
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:39,059
Really?

992
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,518
- Did you see us dive up there? 
- Yes.

993
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,037
How fast do you think we're going? 100? 125?

994
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,595
'I don't know. About...

995
01:17:07,595 --> 01:17:09,993
No. 165 miles an hour.

996
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:15,668
John says we get great wind. John says it's not like a passenger plane.

997
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:18,506
John flew a Starfighter once.

998
01:17:18,506 --> 01:17:19,625
As a matter of fact, I did.

999
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,943
He flew a Starfighter.

1000
01:17:20,943 --> 01:17:24,420
Can you imagine the G-force on something like that?

1001
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:30,295
And the instruments... You should have seen the dials on this.

1002
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:33,852
On the jet, it had to be ten times as many, at least.

1003
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:44,763
What, you thought it was Brigitte Bardot driving?

1004
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:44,763
No.

1005
01:17:44,763 --> 01:17:48,000
No, I was just thinking, it's weird.

1006
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,158
What?

1007
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,158
I can't see your scars anymore.

1008
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:54,315
I can hardly even tell they're there.

1009
01:17:54,794 --> 01:18:00,350
What about you?

1010
01:17:56,273 --> 01:18:00,350
It's different for me.

1011
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:00,350
Yeah.

1012
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,227
Did you ever try to have it fixed?

1013
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:08,942
No. I thought about it, but it just never seemed right.

1014
01:18:08,942 --> 01:18:14,497
My sister wanted to know if maybe you'd be interested in our mother.

1015
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:22,371
She could keep me in the attic. Can she cook?

1016
01:18:17,495 --> 01:18:22,371
Hello, no, but she's gorgeous.

1017
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:24,009
You could save us from the hairball.

1018
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:25,728
- He's number five? 
- Yeah.

1019
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:28,525
- He can't be that bad. 
- What?!

1020
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:45,911
I can wait for you if you like and then drop you off at the Lansings'.

1021
01:18:40,915 --> 01:18:45,911
It's OK. I've got to feed the cat.

1022
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:48,948
All right.

1023
01:18:51,945 --> 01:18:53,024
Thanks a lot.

1024
01:18:54,343 --> 01:18:55,862
Hey, Mac, you hungry?

1025
01:18:55,862 --> 01:18:58,380
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

1026
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:02,296
No, get down. Come on, come on.

1027
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:09,370
I guess you were hungry.

1028
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:12,088
CLATTERING

1029
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:45,180
What are you doin'?

1030
01:19:40,344 --> 01:19:45,180
Get out!

1031
01:19:41,383 --> 01:19:45,180
You heard her. Get out!

1032
01:19:42,582 --> 01:19:45,180
What a day!

1033
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:48,297
What a perfect day!

1034
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,815
- What a day... 
- Doug, do something! >

1035
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:53,013
- Come here! 
- Uh-uh.

1036
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:57,929
Come here! You going to keep quiet?

1037
01:19:57,929 --> 01:20:01,965
Flintstone, you could kill me, and I'd die happy telling Mother.

1038
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:06,601
You keep your mouth shut, you hear?

1039
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,039
- You hear me? 
- Forget it!

1040
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:14,155
NO! MAC!

1041
01:20:18,031 --> 01:20:19,510
Bastard!

1042
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,667
Let me go! He's hurt!

1043
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,186
Calm down, kid, you're crazy!

1044
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,864
His father was a psychotic maniac!

1045
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,263
Shut up, you stupid cow!

1046
01:20:28,263 --> 01:20:30,301
- Gloria? 
- He should know.

1047
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:36,576
Your father was an abusive drunk who killed himself in a mental hospital. And you will too.

1048
01:20:36,576 --> 01:20:39,133
Liar! I'm gonna smash your lyin' face!

1049
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:44,089
You don't believe me? Bottom drawer of Mother's dresser.

1050
01:20:41,931 --> 01:20:44,089
Liar! You're dead!

1051
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:48,405
You're going to be good? I'll let you up if you're good.

1052
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:53,721
Don't listen to her, man, she's just tryin' to get you goin'.

1053
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:27,212
BARKING

1054
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:28,691
MCLEOD!

1055
01:21:32,048 --> 01:21:34,046
MR MCLEOD, SIR!

1056
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,683
Charles? What's the matter?

1057
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:40,401
Charles? What's wrong?

1058
01:21:45,157 --> 01:21:46,835
Charles?

1059
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:02,981
They were in bed... He hurt Mac... She said...

1060
01:22:02,981 --> 01:22:05,020
Take it easy. Go slow.

1061
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,738
She said...

1062
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:14,012
I don't have a father...cos he walked out on me to be a drunk.

1063
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:17,489
To be a crazy fucking drunk!

1064
01:22:19,487 --> 01:22:21,605
He killed himself in a mental institution.

1065
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,160
Here, sit down.

1066
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:48,462
Morning, Mr McLeod.

1067
01:22:48,462 --> 01:22:50,541
Good morning, Chief...?

1068
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:52,139
- Stark. 
- Chief Stark.

1069
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:54,697
- Can I come in? 
- Oh, please. Come in.

1070
01:22:55,576 --> 01:23:02,211
- I'm looking for the Norstadt boy. Is he here? 
- He is, yes. 
- He is? Oh, that's a relief.

1071
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:08,845
The Lansings are in quite a state. They had a family melodrama there.

1072
01:23:08,845 --> 01:23:14,840
He was very upset when he arrived. I'm sorry I don't have a telephone. I would have called.

1073
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,076
- I hear you're tutoring Chuck. 
- Yes, that's correct.

1074
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:23,552
- Fine. Can I see him? 
- He's asleep. I'll...

1075
01:23:23,552 --> 01:23:24,831
- Where would that be? 
- Upstairs.

1076
01:23:24,831 --> 01:23:29,387
It's all right. I'll just take a peek, see if he's all right...

1077
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:30,746
What's goin' on?

1078
01:23:33,783 --> 01:23:38,579
- It's time for you to go home, son. 
- It's all right. Nothing to worry about.

1079
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:44,814
- You've given a lot of people a fright. 
- I don't wanna go. I'm staying here. 
- Charles.

1080
01:23:44,814 --> 01:23:47,811
Your mother's worried. She's on her way back.

1081
01:23:47,811 --> 01:23:50,489
I don't care. I'm staying here!

1082
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,726
- Why don't you get your clothes and let's go. 
- No!

1083
01:23:53,726 --> 01:24:00,001
Charles... I want you to get dressed and go with Chief Stark.

1084
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:04,717
What?

1085
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,717
You have to. It'll be all right.

1086
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:17,586
Why d'you lie to me the other day?

1087
01:24:18,025 --> 01:24:20,264
I don't know.

1088
01:24:21,582 --> 01:24:24,420
You like your teacher, don't you?

1089
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,578
He's my best friend.

1090
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,156
Charles...

1091
01:24:52,516 --> 01:24:54,794
I'm sorry.

1092
01:24:57,671 --> 01:24:59,110
I'm sorry.

1093
01:25:03,506 --> 01:25:05,145
Is that why you divorced him?

1094
01:25:06,384 --> 01:25:07,903
Cos he was psycho?

1095
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:11,500
That was wicked of Gloria.

1096
01:25:12,059 --> 01:25:13,977
Charles, it was just wicked.

1097
01:25:17,574 --> 01:25:18,933
Your father wasn't...

1098
01:25:19,772 --> 01:25:22,050
Your father was a wonderful man.

1099
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:25,567
But he had problems, and when he drank...

1100
01:25:27,406 --> 01:25:28,725
..we just couldn't handle it.

1101
01:25:30,723 --> 01:25:31,842
He hurt us, didn't he?

1102
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,600
Oh, my poor boy.

1103
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:41,274
My poor Chuck. Oh, what a time you've had.

1104
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:46,549
Y'know, I always blamed you.

1105
01:25:46,549 --> 01:25:48,708
I know, baby, I know.

1106
01:25:49,627 --> 01:25:52,145
It's all right.

1107
01:25:55,542 --> 01:26:00,937
Charles, why didn't you tell me you were going to see Mr McLeod?

1108
01:26:00,937 --> 01:26:05,054
I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd let me go.

1109
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:08,371
You're mad, aren't you?

1110
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,968
No, Charles.

1111
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:15,525
See, he's my tutor, but he's also my friend.

1112
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:18,882
I can tell him anything.

1113
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:26,635
Last night, did he... or at any other time...

1114
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:28,753
..did he...touch you?

1115
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:31,151
Yeah, sure.

1116
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:39,224
How did he touch you?

1117
01:26:34,748 --> 01:26:39,224
Why are you asking me this? I told you he's my friend.

1118
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,501
Just tell me.

1119
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:48,256
Chief Stark told me something about your friend.

1120
01:26:48,256 --> 01:26:51,134
A boy was killed in a driving accident.

1121
01:26:51,134 --> 01:26:53,572
I know, he told me. So what?

1122
01:26:53,572 --> 01:26:56,729
He went to prison for three years.

1123
01:26:58,008 --> 01:27:02,324
The boy that was killed was a pupil of his.

1124
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:05,921
He was in the car with McLeod and they were having...

1125
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:13,675
He was abusing the boy, Charles. Do you understand what that means?

1126
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:18,870
No.

1127
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:26,184
No. You don't want me to love anyone else, so you hate him. You hate him.

1128
01:27:26,184 --> 01:27:27,902
Charles!

1129
01:27:27,902 --> 01:27:35,456
- Charles, please! Listen to me! I'm only trying to protect you! 
- You're a liar! Leave me alone!

1130
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,885
Get out of my sight!

1131
01:27:47,885 --> 01:27:49,404
Sorry.

1132
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,506
Hello, Mrs Palin. My name is...

1133
01:28:10,506 --> 01:28:14,023
I know who you are. What do you want here?

1134
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:18,939
I came to see Charles and I wanted to explain...

1135
01:28:16,301 --> 01:28:18,939
What you've been doing to my son?

1136
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:21,417
I haven't done anything to your son.

1137
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:23,894
What? You expect me to believe that?

1138
01:28:23,894 --> 01:28:29,210
How do they let people like you walk around?

1139
01:28:26,332 --> 01:28:29,210
You're being irrational. Let me...

1140
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:34,086
What?! You want to see irrational? I'll show you irrational! Get out!

1141
01:28:34,086 --> 01:28:35,844
Get out!

1142
01:29:12,373 --> 01:29:13,971
Ah, Doctor.

1143
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:20,446
Mrs Palin, this is Dr Talbot. He's come all the way from Bangor to see us.

1144
01:29:20,446 --> 01:29:23,803
Hello, Charles. Just call me Lionel.

1145
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,198
John Wayne.

1146
01:29:30,797 --> 01:29:33,035
- And how do you feel about that? 
- What do you mean?

1147
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:39,709
Do you feel good about seeing John Wayne, or does it make you uneasy?

1148
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:43,666
I don't know. Why do I have to feel anything?

1149
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:48,901
You don't. But you don't want to keep things hidden that could hurt you.

1150
01:29:51,699 --> 01:29:55,855
There's no right or wrong answer here...OK, Chuck?

1151
01:29:58,453 --> 01:30:00,531
Let's try another.

1152
01:30:06,646 --> 01:30:12,481
- It's a very sensitive issue, Mr McLeod. The mother's concerned. 
- Have you talked to Charles or not?

1153
01:30:12,481 --> 01:30:16,917
- Yes, we have. 
- Then what do you need a meeting for? What did he say?

1154
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:21,553
I can't discuss that. We just want a little meeting.

1155
01:30:21,553 --> 01:30:23,871
You mean a trial.

1156
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:29,986
It's just an informal get-together to get the facts straight.

1157
01:30:29,986 --> 01:30:32,744
You don't even need a lawyer.

1158
01:30:32,744 --> 01:30:37,939
Mr McLeod, I would appreciate it if you didn't try to see the boy now.

1159
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:40,497
Not till after the meeting.

1160
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:43,135
I'd appreciate it.

1161
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:49,689
I came here to get away from your meetings and...

1162
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:58,442
Seven years I've lived here... alone in this house, and in peace.

1163
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:04,197
Maybe it would have been best all around if that's the way things had stayed.

1164
01:31:09,712 --> 01:31:15,587
- You promised me! 
- How can I possibly let you take that exam after everything that's happened?

1165
01:31:15,587 --> 01:31:19,504
Nothing's happened! Nothing! Why won't you believe me?

1166
01:31:19,504 --> 01:31:24,979
It's out of my hands. The authorities will decide if there's anything to decide.

1167
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:29,455
Oh, my gosh, I cannot live here! I can't live here!

1168
01:31:29,455 --> 01:31:35,010
- There's perfectly good schools in Connecticut. 
- I'll run! I will run!

1169
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:39,806
OK, Charles. OK, Charles. Charles, I'll talk to Gloria.

1170
01:31:39,806 --> 01:31:43,443
It's not Gloria I can't live with.

1171
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:53,155
I'm sorry.

1172
01:31:50,277 --> 01:31:53,155
Do whatever you want, all right?

1173
01:32:20,931 --> 01:32:27,965
Mr McLeod, I'm afraid we're getting too old to stay open so late.

1174
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:34,599
You'll just have to come back at our regular hours. Sorry for your trouble.

1175
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:13,366
HORN BLARES

1176
01:33:49,655 --> 01:33:54,011
Charles, would you please take this out to the car and give it to Carl?

1177
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,100
Good luck in the exam.

1178
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,256
Thanks.

1179
01:34:43,249 --> 01:34:44,568
Oh, oh. I got it.

1180
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:48,404
Here. Careful, it's fragile.

1181
01:34:49,523 --> 01:34:50,962
I got it.

1182
01:34:54,519 --> 01:34:58,476
Put Gloria's in first. Mum's too. Put mine in last for easy access. >

1183
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:12,064
Mom!

1184
01:35:30,328 --> 01:35:31,487
Asshole!

1185
01:35:46,954 --> 01:35:48,393
MR MCLEOD!

1186
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:51,990
MR MCLEOD!

1187
01:35:55,627 --> 01:36:00,263
I'm not allowed to talk to you, Norstadt. You have to go.

1188
01:36:00,263 --> 01:36:02,421
No! No!

1189
01:36:04,539 --> 01:36:07,496
- I want to know! 
- You always want to know!

1190
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:13,132
I want to know the truth!

1191
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:13,132
About what? Life? Religion?

1192
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:15,410
Why did you go to prison?

1193
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:21,165
I was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. You can look it up.

1194
01:36:21,165 --> 01:36:26,560
Did you? The boy in the car, the boy that died. Did you molest him?

1195
01:36:28,398 --> 01:36:32,075
What do you think, Norstadt?

1196
01:36:28,478 --> 01:36:32,075
Stop playing the teacher. Tell me!

1197
01:36:32,075 --> 01:36:35,472
I think you've already made your mind up, haven't you?

1198
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:41,028
Looks like I've fallen off that pedestal you put people on. Strictly pass or fail, isn't it?

1199
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:48,461
I don't know what to think!

1200
01:36:42,426 --> 01:36:48,461
You're just lazy! I couldn't teach you a thing!

1201
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:51,019
- Just tell me! 
- Did I ever abuse you?

1202
01:36:51,019 --> 01:36:58,253
Did I ever lay a hand of anything but friendship on you? Think, Norstadt, reason.

1203
01:36:58,253 --> 01:37:03,808
Did I? Can you imagine me ever doing so?

1204
01:37:09,763 --> 01:37:12,081
Then what about the past? What do you see?

1205
01:37:12,081 --> 01:37:16,277
- Tell me you didn't. I'll believe you. 
- No! No, sir!

1206
01:37:16,277 --> 01:37:20,793
I didn't spend all summer so you could cheat on this question.

1207
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:31,584
I'm sorry.

1208
01:37:31,584 --> 01:37:33,902
I didn't know what to think. I'm sorry.

1209
01:37:37,259 --> 01:37:41,056
It's all right, Charles. It's not your fault.

1210
01:37:46,092 --> 01:37:47,850
You're a good student, Charles.

1211
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:51,927
You're a very good student.

1212
01:38:04,356 --> 01:38:06,115
You better go.

1213
01:38:12,389 --> 01:38:14,188
Goodbye.

1214
01:38:16,586 --> 01:38:18,264
Sequari deum.

1215
01:38:41,604 --> 01:38:43,243
Gentlemen, we're ready.

1216
01:38:44,721 --> 01:38:46,480
Good luck.

1217
01:39:10,379 --> 01:39:15,215
You have five minutes left in section A. Five minutes.

1218
01:39:23,528 --> 01:39:25,766
Pencils down.

1219
01:39:25,766 --> 01:39:30,802
In section B, you will translate the passage from Cicero,

1220
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:34,039
on the value and nature of friendship.

1221
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:38,555
Pencils ready.... Begin.

1222
01:39:51,264 --> 01:39:55,740
Mr McLeod, I'd like to introduce Miss Fletcher from Children's Aid,

1223
01:39:55,740 --> 01:40:02,095
Dr Talbot, Judge Sinclair, Mr McDowell from the DA's office.

1224
01:40:03,893 --> 01:40:06,012
Is your legal counsel not with you?

1225
01:40:10,128 --> 01:40:14,085
- I was told that this was an informal meeting. Isn't that right? 
- Oh, no, that's correct.

1226
01:40:14,085 --> 01:40:16,603
William, why don't you begin?

1227
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:24,955
Why didn't you go to the mother and make sure that Charles had told her about the tutoring?

1228
01:40:24,955 --> 01:40:27,753
Because I...

1229
01:40:27,753 --> 01:40:31,310
- You've never taught, have you? 
- Taught? No.

1230
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:38,544
- You can't teach a thing without giving away your trust. 
- I don't follow.

1231
01:40:38,544 --> 01:40:44,539
Let's say I was teaching you, as a lawyer, to be honest.

1232
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:52,012
I couldn't trust you to tell the truth, then run round the courts to see whether you were lying.

1233
01:40:53,211 --> 01:40:56,209
Not unless I was absolutely sure that you were lying.

1234
01:41:02,483 --> 01:41:04,761
Perhaps you should tell us about Patrick Scott.

1235
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,479
What would you like to know?

1236
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:09,717
Whatever you feel is relevant?

1237
01:41:11,595 --> 01:41:13,594
Nothing.

1238
01:41:13,594 --> 01:41:15,592
Please, humour me.

1239
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:23,265
Patrick was an outstanding student. He could have done anything.

1240
01:41:23,265 --> 01:41:25,503
He was also very troubled.

1241
01:41:28,421 --> 01:41:32,218
He was from a broken home, full of guilt and violent fantasies.

1242
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:33,537
Not unlike the profile of Charles.

1243
01:41:33,537 --> 01:41:38,772
No, not unlike it. He too had a hard time with authority.

1244
01:41:38,772 --> 01:41:42,849
I was one of the few, if not the only one, that he connected with.

1245
01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:47,964
He developed a fixation with me that I didn't know how to deal with.

1246
01:41:49,683 --> 01:41:51,441
I was 26. I didn't know a thing.

1247
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:59,434
When I did confront him with it, on the way back from Boston, I was too frank, too hard.

1248
01:42:01,313 --> 01:42:07,547
- He became enraged, tried to step from the vehicle into the highway. 
- That's not what the jury found.

1249
01:42:07,547 --> 01:42:14,781
- You asked me what I knew of Patrick Scott, not what the jury thought it found. 
- But you lost your job?

1250
01:42:14,781 --> 01:42:17,659
Yes, I lost my position.

1251
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:21,855
Then why, ten years later, would you pick a strange boy as a pupil?

1252
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:25,532
Second chance.

1253
01:42:25,532 --> 01:42:30,528
Charles needed my help. I guess I needed his too.

1254
01:42:32,806 --> 01:42:34,364
How would you define "needed"?

1255
01:42:34,364 --> 01:42:39,640
I'm a teacher, Dr Talbot. I make my living otherwise, but I'm a teacher.

1256
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:44,795
Afraid I don't follow. You were expelled from the profession.

1257
01:42:44,795 --> 01:42:48,312
I'm not talking about a piece of paper.

1258
01:42:48,312 --> 01:42:51,869
I'm talking about a moment of grace.

1259
01:42:53,468 --> 01:42:57,704
A moment to prove that I could do it well and true.

1260
01:42:57,704 --> 01:43:03,779
And did you?

1261
01:42:59,383 --> 01:43:03,779
Yes. Charles is a good student.

1262
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:06,577
You're very fond of him.

1263
01:43:07,016 --> 01:43:10,333
Yes, I'm very fond of him.

1264
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:17,727
- As fond of you were of Patrick Scott? 
- No, much closer. Is that my crime?

1265
01:43:17,727 --> 01:43:23,722
- Is that what I'm accused of? 
- We're simply interested in finding out the truth.

1266
01:43:23,722 --> 01:43:26,200
- I wish you were! 
- I beg your pardon?

1267
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,797
You're interested in the appearance of the truth.

1268
01:43:29,797 --> 01:43:36,591
You haven't the slightest comprehension what bond of friendship I have with Charles.

1269
01:43:36,591 --> 01:43:39,149
- Perhaps you could enlighten us? 
- I don't think I can.

1270
01:43:39,149 --> 01:43:43,545
The tragedy of that is, I don't know why I can't.

1271
01:43:43,545 --> 01:43:48,581
Is it this? Is this what you see?

1272
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:51,898
I assure you, it is human.

1273
01:43:54,336 --> 01:44:00,730
If that's all you see, then you don't see me. You can't see me.

1274
01:44:07,764 --> 01:44:12,600
- Perhaps we all need a short recess. 
- When you charge me, what will happen to Charles?

1275
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,319
Mr McLeod, no-one has....

1276
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:18,875
Will he have to testify?

1277
01:44:15,358 --> 01:44:18,875
This panel....

1278
01:44:16,477 --> 01:44:18,875
Will he be examined, probed?

1279
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:21,113
That's enough!

1280
01:44:21,352 --> 01:44:26,428
Obviously the boy will be involved. That goes without saying.

1281
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:34,661
Your implication that this is some sort of violation is offensive in the extreme! Do I make myself clear?

1282
01:44:35,261 --> 01:44:37,898
I apologise.

1283
01:44:39,417 --> 01:44:46,691
And I will cooperate with any course you feel necessary to resolve the problem with fairness, discretion.

1284
01:44:51,646 --> 01:44:52,766
Thank you.

1285
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:23,539
Walker...

1286
01:45:19,982 --> 01:45:23,539
Yes, sir?

1287
01:45:20,861 --> 01:45:23,539
I think it's from your mother.

1288
01:45:23,539 --> 01:45:26,417
Mr Smith-Baker.

1289
01:45:24,338 --> 01:45:26,417
Sir.

1290
01:45:26,417 --> 01:45:29,854
Mr Gablon.

1291
01:45:27,336 --> 01:45:29,854
Thank you, sir.

1292
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:29,854
Mr Norstadt.

1293
01:45:29,854 --> 01:45:32,252
Check the address on that.

1294
01:45:32,252 --> 01:45:34,370
Mr Libby.

1295
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:06,182
Hop in!

1296
01:46:36,796 --> 01:46:43,750
'Hello, Norstadt. I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to see you.

1297
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:49,186
'I'm not allowed to talk to you, I'm not allowed to write this letter.

1298
01:46:49,186 --> 01:46:53,822
'These are my concessions and their conditions...

1299
01:46:53,822 --> 01:47:01,175
'..or, what I hope any good teacher would call "a lesson in the tender mercies of injustice".

1300
01:47:03,293 --> 01:47:05,731
'But, strangely, this is nothing to grieve over...

1301
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:13,165
'..because you know the truth, and I now know that you can outgrow a part, even a sad one.

1302
01:47:14,604 --> 01:47:16,482
'You taught me that.

1303
01:47:17,361 --> 01:47:23,076
'You gave me what I never expected to find again - a gift of your trust and love.

1304
01:47:24,835 --> 01:47:27,273
'And nothing can take that grace away.

1305
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:33,428
'The best is yet to be, Norstadt, so do it well.

1306
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:38,743
'I remain, as ever, your tutor, Justin McLeod.'

1307
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,656
..Those who persevere in faith.

1308
01:47:46,656 --> 01:47:47,695
Once again,

1309
01:47:47,695 --> 01:47:55,089
congratulations on achieving the goals set out before you four years ago.

1310
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:00,324
Class of 1972...dismiss!

1311
01:48:02,842 --> 01:48:04,801
'Everything was perfect.'

1312
01:48:22,386 --> 01:48:23,465
Charles!

1313
01:48:25,383 --> 01:48:28,500
- Darling, I am so proud of you. 
- Thank you, Mother.

1314
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:32,297
Charles, your mother and I are pleased.

1315
01:48:30,259 --> 01:48:32,297
Thank you, sir.

1316
01:48:35,015 --> 01:48:39,571
We'll see you at dinner, honey!

1317
01:48:37,373 --> 01:48:39,571
See you at eight!

1318
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:42,049
I'll see you guys later.

1319
01:49:34,084 --> 01:49:36,562
'But there's always a face before me now...

1320
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:39,359
..somewhere beyond the edge of the crowd.'
