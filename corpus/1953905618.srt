00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,981
( Instrumental music playing )

2
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:53,054
Man narrating: Now let me tell you
a little bit about before your time.

3
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,223
Some misguided fools

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,935
couldn't quite warm up to the idea
of bowing down to me.

5
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,229
They wanted my business,

6
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,023
but they didn't have
the skill that we have.

7
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,944
See, I got a background.

8
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,990
See, I worked for the government
for a long time.

9
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,617
And I learned from the best.

10
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,079
And I took my skills
after I left the government,

11
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,789
brought 'em here to do what I do.

12
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,417
- So they sent about...
-( beeping )

13
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,961
four or five hit teams out.

14
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:29,591
Man, it must have been
like 12, 13 people.

15
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,093
And, well, my boy and I,

16
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,181
we sent them all back dead in a box.

17
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,141
Some of them,
we cut their heads off

18
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,311
and gift wrapped 'em,
got creative and stuff.

19
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,104
Really made a statement, you know?

20
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,774
I think that was the last time I left.

21
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:50,862
And that was the last time
I questioned this young man's integrity.

22
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,031
( Footsteps approach )

23
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,429
All it takes

24
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:21,184
is one dumb motherfucker
to come in

25
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,853
and try to tear everything down.

26
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,983
You broke the code, Sasha.

27
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,152
You a motherfuckin' rat.

28
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,780
Please.

29
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:37,659
Mr. Alexander, don't kill me.

30
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,494
Give me chance to redeem myself.

31
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,540
Now I gots to get involved
myself personally.

32
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,297
You understand?

33
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,260
I'm gonna have to make
an example out of you.

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,681
You want to redeem yourself?

35
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,100
See,

36
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:06,604
I don't want to use
the word seppuku,

37
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:10,483
'cause that has something to do
with folks who had honor,

38
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,027
which you don't have.

39
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,238
So why don't you cut
your motherfucking throat,

40
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,865
or I'll do it for you?

41
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,210
Ah! God!

42
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,775
( Chain rattling )

43
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,078
Ah!

44
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,596
( Bone cracking )

45
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,353
I think I need to get a new suit, man.

46
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,897
This motherfucker got me all dirty.
Look at this shit.

47
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,066
Believe that?

48
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,925
See these here guns?

49
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,471
They were bought with my blood.

50
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,890
And now I'm giving them to you.

51
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:10,228
Now you delivered me Sasha,
and I appreciate that.

52
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:13,523
That's how you work your way
to the top and earn my trust.

53
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,316
Now you're by my side, right?

54
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,492
I've got a job you're gonna
have to finish.

55
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,245
And it's gonna be a long road.

56
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,372
But you can do it.

57
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,291
All right?

58
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,215
Not a problem.

59
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,347
We have to send a message.

60
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,100
We're gonna take out a mark,
and Dante set it up with his crew.

61
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,185
They on the inside.

62
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,230
I just need confirmation
when it's done.

63
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,697
( Chains rattling )

64
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,493
Alexander:
There'll be a prison transfer.

65
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,079
You're gonna have a small window,
do you hear?

66
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,793
Confirm the mark,
do the job and get out,

67
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,837
destroy the envelope after you read it.

68
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,214
You know the drill.

69
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,632
All right.

70
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,721
Don't fail me, Hurst.

71
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,193

72
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,119
( door buzzes )

73
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,339
Man:
New transfer coming in.

74
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,966
( Door buzzes )

75
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,844
Time-- 10:29.

76
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,889
A secure. B secure.

77
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,432
Pod C secure.

78

( Door buzzes )

79
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,274
Okay, you rug heads,
30 minutes fun time.

80
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,153
Man: I remember the first time
I stabbed him.

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,907
There was that one
in a white state prison, right?

82
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,160
I was on a mission to stab
this one rat nigger, Monster, right?

83
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,623
It was the same damn time, right?

84
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,709
'Cause I get behind
the nigger Monster, right?

85
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,921
Homies tend to hit the nigger
in the lungs first, right?

86
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,589
Shut the nigger down.

87
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,758
( Conversation continues )

Inmate:
The next thing I know,

89
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,016
he jumped on my motherfuckin' back.

90
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,309
We were wrestling.

91
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,187
I threw the nigger.
Piledrive the nigger down, right?

92
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,649
I stabbed this nigger, like,
five or six times, maybe 15.

93
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:05,820
( Conversation continues )

94

About to go down, baby.

96
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,315
That's what's up.

97
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,525
Young nigger get to put some work in.

98
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,069
( laughs )

99
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,286
Inmate: Motherfucking knife
in the neck the first time,

100
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,956
pulling that shit out--
blood and everything.

It's easy.

103
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,717
'Cause I can't even feel it, right?

104
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,969
Next thing I know,

105
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,430
he jumped
on my motherfuckin' back.

106
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,229
I stabbed this nigger,
like, five or six times.

107
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,484
I get to jag
on this nigger Monster, right?

108
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,237
Goin' back and forth with Monster
and this other guy, right?

Where you goin', cuz?
Where you goin'?

119
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,235
Why you so nervous?

120
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,862
Anyway, I--
I'm on this nigger, right?

121

Cheese-eater must die!

122

Fuckin' jigs always try to stir it up,
unravel cell wars.

128
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,478
I'm gonna go knock some sense

Where Benny at?

Man, that stupid motherfucker
done drifted off.

138

I'm fixin' to go get strapped.
I'll be right back.

That J-Bird gonna be
a dead nigger soon, you ask me.

He's not the one.

143
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,694
The one is behind you.

144
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,004
You dead, Benny.

145
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,641
You killed the wrong motherfucker!

146
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,977
You was supposed to kill Benny,
motherfucker!

( beeps )

Alexander:
Hurst, talk to me.

153
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,063
It's done.

154
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,190
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

155
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,798
Hurst:
Constantine.

156
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,929
Alexander: Well, your palms
are really itching now.

157
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,057
I learned from the best.

158
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,767
Ain't that right?

159
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,936
Free of the drama.

160
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,104
You know Dante.

161
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,774
Of course.

162
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,028
Take my girls.

163
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,238
Give me a little break here.

164
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,792
Dante is aware that I sent you there

165
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,004
to personally close this issue.

166
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,090
Problem is you took out
the wrong brother.

167
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,636
You deaf or something, white boy?

168
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,890
My little shadow boy here
is good at what he do.

169
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,809
And that's why I felt that

170
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,770
him and I always gotta be good.

171
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,357
That's the first time in 15 years
he's missed a mark.

172
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,984
So I'm fixin' to find out
what happened there.

173
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,988
But in the meantime,
you need to know we have rules.

174
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,823
And we got respect.

175
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,533
I respect you, I respect him.

176
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,663
But if somebody fuck up,
somebody gotta face the music, so...

177
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,040
I killed the man
marked by our contact.

178
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,172
But if I made a mistake,

179
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,549
then I'm willing to take
the consequences.

180
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,844
You see,
he's a man until the end.

181
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,765
Now I can't have you
missing no mark.

182
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:59,395
In the meantime, I can't be embarrassed
by my business associates.

183
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:04,191
So there gonna have to be
some kind of consequence.

184
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,693
For now you've retired.

185
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,528
(thuds)

186
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,034
Dante:
I want him dead, Mr. Alexander.

187
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,870
Alexander: I'll let you do
whatever you got to do.

188
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,331
- Don't kill him.
- Hurst: Fucker! Fuck you!

189
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,874
- Alexander: Don't kill him.
- ( shouting )

190
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,042
Stay with me, motherfucker!

191
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,627
- Wake up. Stay with me!
- Ah!

192
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,629
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

193
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,881
- I said bow down, motherfucker!
- Ah!

194
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,299
Fuck you!

195
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,260
Ooh!

196
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,179
Better be glad Mr. Alexander
got a hard-on for your ass.

197
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,014
The man with a plan
says you can live?

198
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,976
- A'ight. You can live.
- Fucker.

199
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,395
We ain't done yet.
He only needs one motherfuckin' hand.

200
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,188
- ( Grunts)
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

201
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,566
You see that motherfucker?
You see that motherfucker?

202
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,485
It's clean right now, baby.
It's clean right now.

203
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,779
Now here's what I want.
Here's what I want right here.

204
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,281
Guess what, dog?

205
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:55,743
Man says you go home broke,
consider yourself broke, motherfucker!

206
00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:00,247
( Screaming )

207
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,085

( train rattling )

210
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,089
Alexander:
I'm puzzled.

211
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,426
Dante: He killed Dre,
my tank boss inside.

212
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,094
Alexander:
Well, I'm fixin' to figure out

213
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,181
if and how he made the mistake.

214
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,850
But in the meantime,

215
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,229
I can't have you missing no mark.

216
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:09,691
In the meantime, I can't be embarrassed
by my business associates.

217
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,860
For now you've retired.

218
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,998
Hey, Oso.

219
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,042
Aw, come on.

220
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,211
Put 'em in the cans for once.

221
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,712
( Speaks Spanish )

222
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,548
Go upstairs.

223
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,424
Leave the departamento.

224
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,469
Woman:
Hurry up, Oso!

225
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,807
You take breaks every 10 minutes.

226
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,809
The kitchen is behind already.

227
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,686
Talk to the drunk.

228
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,063
Woman:
Yeah.

229
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,693
Had enough to drink?

230

( knocking at door)

233
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,418
Hey, yo, man.
How you feelin'?

234
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,137
See, in the past,

235
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,974
every time we went to war,

236
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,309
we always fought side by side.

237
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,436
You paid for your mistake.

238
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:55,065
Now it's time to get better,
time to get your strength back.

239
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,028
They took my hands.

240
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,617
I can't help you anymore.

241
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,579
Yeah, well, I ain't asking
for your help at all.

242
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:14,084
I'm fixin' to get you some money
and ask you to leave.

243
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,879
Get out of here, go as far
as you can go, start a new life.

244
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,091
If I get through this okay,
we'll hook up again.

245
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,343
You're family.

246
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,182
It's like that.

247
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,241

( engine turns off,
music stops )

249
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,591
I was inside for two years.

250
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,051
Now that I'm out,

251
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,887
I'm curious to know
why your boy wasted Dre

252
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,140
instead of that piece-of-shit weasel
you put the green light on.

253
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,642
Alexander:
That's the distant past.

254
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,187
But for now, it'd be really good

255
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:19,733
if you could tell me
something relevant right quick.

256
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,069
( Chuckles )

257
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,695
You like games?

258
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,988
No, sir.

259
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,575
Well, I think I got a game
that you gonna like.

260
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,829
How'd you like to play
"Pop the Pifiata"

261
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,082
with old Benny the rat himself?

262
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,001
- Tell me.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

263
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,836
Yeah, we got him.

264

It's a gift from 6-0 to you

265
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,883
to show our respect.

266
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,927
- That right?
- That's right.

267
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,806
Man, if that's true,

268
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,934
you might could have a job,

269
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,937

Iceman?

270
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,523
You can call me Ice.

272
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,780

Neighborhood.

279

Let's start by delivering
your gift to Dante.

280
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,426
Make sure he do things right.

We gonna do it the 6-0 way--

-( Hitting )
- ( man crying )

291
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:23,190
But I saved a little something special
for what you did to Dre.

292
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,818
- What the fuck?
- That's right-- what the fuck?

293
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,904
If I were you, I'd let him down.

294
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,366
Let him die like the rat fuck he is,
begging for his life,

295
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,453
not tied up like some damn pifiata.

296

Go ahead, look around you.

See, all these folks got a reason
to have you dead.

I'm just interested in having you
pay back Mr. Alexander.

305

Now,

316
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:10,046
why don't you let me and my boys
do the housekeeping?

317
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,132
You go on back
and tell Mr. Alexander

318
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,636
that his pit bull needs a muzzle

319
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,723
or he could end up like Benny here.

Iceman:
I ain't doing shit.

321
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,148
Knock some sense into this nigger.

Here you go.

Man:
We have a problem with Cesare.

357
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,205
Alexander:
Constantine is taking care of it now.

358
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,665
- Copy that.
-( phone beeps )

359
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,876
Here's that Infinity
I was telling you about.

360
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,295
An amazing gun--
long slide, wide body.

361
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,006
Got almost 15 rounds in a .45.
Can you imagine?

362
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:43,092
Very accurate.
Spectacular pistol.

363
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,845
This is that .50
I was telling you about.

364
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,890
Guncrafter-- amazing.

365
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,352
Flat, fast, no overpenetration,
great distance.

366
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,396
You know, great velocity.

367
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,734
Here's one
of my Longslide Caspian .45s

368
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,319
that I've carried a lot around.

369
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,862
Beautiful gun.

370
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,783
Series 70 Colt,

371
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,702
1938 National Match.

372
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,748
It was one of the smallest .45s
ever made.

373
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,042
It's one of my backups--
one of my personal backups.

374
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,752
Isn't that amazing?

375
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,424
The only reason he lets you
operate in this city, ese,

376
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,720
is because you draw a lot of heat
away from him.

377
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:32,141
Kind of defeats the purpose
if he's in fucking business with you.

378
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,227
And I'm finished here.

379
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,483
( Slow music playing )

380
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,795
I spoke with Cesare.
Now let's go fix this mess.

381
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,405
( Muffled music playing )

382
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,884
( doors open )

383
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,386
What you got in the bag, ese?

384
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,930
Groceries.
You want dinner?

385
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,308
I look like a fucking cook to you?

386
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,192
Hey, keep walking, puto.

387
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,661
Now what say you give me
that box?

388
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,663
No, I can't do that, ese.

389
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,956
I said give me
the fuckin' box, homes.

390
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,218
(grunting )

391
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,349
( man shouts )

392
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,324
How'd you do that?

393
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,743
You didn't even use your hands.

394
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,381
Not bad for a cripple.

395
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,064
( Chuckles )

396
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,198
( rap music playing )

397
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,828
( music stops )

398
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,468
( country music playing )

399
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,473
( doorbell chimes )

400
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,142
I fuckin' hate this town.

401
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,603
Nowhere to find a good burger
after midnight.

402
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,897
Kitchen closes in 15 minutes.

403
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,943
Your burgers any good?

404
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,612
The best in town.

405
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,490
Make yourselves at home.

406
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,625
( Doorbell chimes )

407
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,433
You dropped this.

408
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,522
Thank you.

409
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,236
Hey.

410
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,571
Hey.

411
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,325
Don't I know you?

412
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,543
Doubt it.

413
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,920
( Doorbell chimes )

414
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:40,199
Hey, you know them black dudes?

415
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,244
Keep 'em away from Karen, all right?

416
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:46,038
Her old man is like my ace deuce.

417
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,749
Kind of makes her a daughter.

418
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,711
So keep the trash away from her.

419
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:55,089
Then why don't you pick up
the trash yourself for once?

420
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,785
So what's so important
about that box of yours?

421
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,663
Special ingredients
used for my cooking.

422
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,419
What happened
to your hands, anyhow?

423
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,588
I'll tell you all about it.

424
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,342
- ( Country music playing )
- Karen: Gotta shut her down.

425
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,928
Can't afford to lose
my liquor license.

426
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,100
You know who owns this place, right?

427
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,729
Starts with Alexander,
ends with don't-even-think-about-it.

428
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,399
So Mr. Alexander,
he own you too?

429
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,946
Your tab.

430
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,948
Added an extra $26

431
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,867
for the two hours OT I owe Oso
for hanging around.

432
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:08,412
Pay it, you can come back.

433
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,381
I don't think she likes me.

434
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:22,802
I know goddamn well
that nasty OG don't like me.

435
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,470
Fuck him.

436
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,682
Cesare:
Don't fuck with me.

437
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,976
If Mr. Alexander says no,

438
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,936
I gotta eat it.

439
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,854
That's life.

440
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,733
You sound like you scared
of that name.

441
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,236
Mr. Cabron,

442
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,155
Mr. Alexander has
a lot of triggers he can pull

443
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,825
if we go to a ground war.

444
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:49,161
And I don't feel like
getting shot today.

445
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:52,289
I don't know,
maybe it's just me.

446
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,459
( Chuckling )

447
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,920
Mm-hmm.

448
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,178
Peep this-- Constantine runs
the chop shops.

449
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,264
Right?

450
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,016
Not for long.

451
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,517
You feel me?

452
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:15,229
Mr. Alexander wants your product.

453
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,274
But he wants it done quietly.
The quieter, the better.

454
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,569
That's where a nigger like me
comes in.

455
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,113
I'm gonna say this
and I'm only gonna say it once.

456
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,073
Jimmy Falcone is dead.

457
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,325
I own this club.

458
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,494
I'm about to own
the chop shops too.

459
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,705
That's our neighborhood,
you feel me?

460
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,800
A gift.

461
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:57,188
That could be your future.

462
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,615
One more thing--
we partners now.

463
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,909
Once I cap Constantine,

464
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:14,038
I expect 10% of everything we move
through the chop shop.

465
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,873
Okay.

466
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,628
Vamonos.

467
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,276
CIGY:
Hey-

468
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:49,281
( laughing )

469
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,367
Oh, you bitches, you.

470
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,661
( Gunfire continues )

471
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,683
Oso made you some food.

472
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,520
He wanted me to tell you
thank you for your help.

473
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,253
Thank you for your help...

474
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,172
Roman.

475
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,852
( Police radio chatter)

476
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,379
( phone ringing )

477
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:28,881
Alexander:
Hurst.

478
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm sorry to call.
I just--

479
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,302
Alexander:
How you feelin'?

480
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:36,889
Alive, which is more than I can say
for Constantine.

481
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,894
- It was a hit.
- Yeah, I heard.

482
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,604
Look, I just want to warn you,
if Constantine is dead,

483
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:44,772
then that means--

484
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:46,398
Alexander: You don't have to warn me
about nothing, man.

485
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,108
I know who hit him,
why they hit him,

486
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,652
how they hit him,
and when they hit him.

487
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,237
They all want my business.

488
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,323
That's all right, man.
I got a little surprise coming up.

489
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:59,411
So where you stand in all this, son?

490
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,040
You retired me, remember?

491
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,584
( Phone beeps )

492
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:37,283
Man: Come on, let's go!
We're out of here in 10 minutes, people!

493
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,118
10 minutes!

494
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:46,917
(machinery humming )

495
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,639
( machinery whirring )

496
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:17,072
Man:
Nice to be in business.

497
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,659
Right.

498
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,455
You sure all this
is going to fit in those cars?

499
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,499
You leave that to me
and you get used to it.

500
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,336
'Cause the day is coming
when I'm going to be the boss.

501
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,796
Mr. Alexander?

502
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,882
His days are numbered.

503
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,554
Crazy gangsters.

504
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:47,186
Who's that dude?

505
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:49,480
- That guy there?
- Yeah.

506
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,023
I don't know.
Never seen him before.

507
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,108
He's not with us.

508
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,698
Impress upon him
the value of discretion.

509
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:04,745
I'm gonna go take a leak.

510
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:09,875
Let's go, back it up!
Come on!

511
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:12,669
Hey, don't be shitting in my toilet,
man, all right?

512
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,800
What the fuck you doing in here,
white boy?

513
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,177
Hmm?

514
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:23,305
Don't I know you from the diner?

515
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,560
You hear me fuckin' talking to you?

516
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,901
That's enough, Bruce Lee.

517
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,322
( Iceman's voice echoing )
He's not the one.

518
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:43,325
The one is behind you.

519
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:45,869
(fifing)

520
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,130
Uh-uh.

521
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,053
Iceman:
Thought you were dead.

522
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:07,224
Mr. Alexander sent you up here, huh?

523
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:09,601
Hid you under Constantine.

524
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:14,106
Protected his favorite son
by keeping him out of sight, is that it?

525
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,693
Look, I don't know
what the fuck happened to you,

526
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,154
but I'm the big dog here now.

527
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,031
And my bite is far worse
than your bite would ever be.

528
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,534
Yeah, all that karate shit?
That shit is cool.

529
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:30,247
But we 6-0, nigger.
We put one to the dome, you feel me?

530
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,542
Now you're lucky I promised my mama
I wouldn't shoot anybody today,

531
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,544
or your ass would be dead.

532
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,213
That's our neighborhood.

533
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,674
Let the bitch live.

534
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,058
Hey, Hurst, you okay?

535
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:33,227
Man, you need to lay off that shit.

536
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:36,563
You want to talk,
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

537
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:18,105
(grunts)

538
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,399
( gun fires, glass shatters )

539
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:26,947
Fuck! Ah!

540
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,574
Yo, dog, what's going on?

541
00:49:10,741 --> 00:49:12,618
What do you want to do?

542
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,703
Bring the bitch to the club.

543
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,204
Okay.

544
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,670
( Gasps )

545
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,218
Where you going?

546
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,850
- Grab her legs.
-( Karen squeals )

547
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,528
Get the fuck up.

548
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:51,573
( Karen screaming )

549
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,408
( man grunting )

550
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:57,454
-( Karen screams )
- ( man grunts)

551
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:08,131
( doorbell chimes )

552
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,474
-( bell chimes)
- What's going on, gentlemen?

553
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:21,770
No, no, no, no, don't touch her.
What's happening?

554
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:24,940
You know we've got bosses
and we've got orders.

555
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,651
I see.
Well, you can't follow these orders

556
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,404
because this is my house,

557
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,656
and that's my girl.

558
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:34,574
I guess it's on, then.

559
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:37,285
( Men grunting )

560
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,969
(fifing)

561
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,559
Quit playing around.

562
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:52,360
You all right?

563
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,198
- You okay?
- Yeah.

564
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,706
( Speaks Spanish )

565
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,082
( laughs )

566
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:10,045
( greeting each other in Spanish )

567
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:12,172
- ( speaks Spanish )
- Trouble?

568
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:13,381
( laughs )
Fuck, yeah.

569
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,759
( Both speak Spanish )

570
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:18,094
Alexander:
It's gonna get stupid around here.

571
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:20,931
So you listen to me and my friends
and listen to him.

572
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:24,684
- We got you. You heard?
- Yeah.

573
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:29,189
( Speaking Spanish )

574
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,237
You two get out of here.
I'll deal with the cops.

575
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,072
No, ese, I can't do that.

576
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,074
These men belong to Iceman.

577
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:41,117
He's going to come after you for this.

578
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,704
Trust me, this is the best way.

579
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,665
This Iceman, he ain't shit.

580
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:50,836
I done worse shit in an afternoon
than that puto's done in a lifetime.

581
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:54,714
I'm not afraid of no AG.
And neither should you be, homes.

582
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,175
There's more to this
than just Karen and Ice.

583
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:00,220
Let me take this.
Standing my ground.

584
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:03,098
Making sure I'm taking care of Karen.

585
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:06,685
Two gangsters coming
after my white girl?

586
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:08,353
Nah.

587
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,230
Too bad for them.

588
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:14,860
- Is this weapon clean?
- Yeah.

589
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,153
Okay, both of you bounce.
Get out of here now.

590
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,614
- You can't get into this.
- Are you kidding me?

591
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:21,366
An old Mexican con

592
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,411
and a former mob--
whatever you want to call it--

593
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:27,080
explaining to the cops
why these two dirty gangbangers

594
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,832
ended up all busted like they did?

595
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,042
No way.

596
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:34,004
They attacked me in my place

597
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,673
and I used the gun that my daddy
gave me forjust such an occasion,

598
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,260
and I don't know what happened,
but I am really glad it did.

599
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:42,220
Okay?

600
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:47,601
Okay?

601
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:49,769
Okay.

602
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:56,985
Hey, Roman?

603
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:59,362
Thanks.

604
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:20,467
( Mariachi music playing )

605
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,554
Who is this chinga de madre?

606
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,264
Hey, boss?

607
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:29,142
Three of lceboy's men
just got whacked.

608
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,770
Where?

609
00:54:31,937 --> 00:54:34,272
At the diner on 525.

610
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,071
They're gaming us
with Mr. Alexander.

611
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:43,365
( Speaks Spanish )

612
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:47,744
Go there, get something-- anything.

613
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,830
- You got it?
- Yeah.

614
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,832
I'm on it.

615
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,049
( Shouts in Spanish )

616
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,680
Jackie?

617
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,360
I might have to take care of this
my own motherfuckin' self, ya hear?

618
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:04,738
Yes, sir, Mr. Alexander.

619
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:24,257
That crazy motherfucker thinks
he can go up against Mr. Alexander.

620
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:26,593
Shit just got real.

621
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,428
Come on.

622
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:39,773
( Bass beat thumping )

623
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,155
( muted rap music playing )

624
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,395
( music continues, filtered )

625
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:27,195
- Where Ice at?
- He knows who you are.

626
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:30,406
But you just can't be walking through
this motherfucker like you own it.

627
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,576
Why don't you ask Junior to walk up
in there and tell him I'm here?

628
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,829
I ain't telling him shit.

629
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,251
I think it's time for you to go.

630
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:57,559
( Shouts )

631
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:05,024
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Yo, chill out.

632
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,777
Ice said he'll meet with you.

633
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:11,281
All right.

634
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,616
I thought he might change his mind.

635
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,911
I've been doing this a long time,
you know?

636
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,210
And, uh...

637
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:26,212
I'm kind of tired of all this shit.

638
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,464
And I know what you're thinking.

639
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,343
I don't blame you,
and I like your style.

640
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,554
You know?

641
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,056
But this could go two ways.

642
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:40,977
One way it could go is, like, stupid,

643
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,229
and it'll turn into a war.

644
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:46,107
And war ain't no good for business.
It ain't good for nobody.

645
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:48,860
To the people who run countries,
wars are great for business.

646
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:51,988
But we street people, man.
We ain't gonna make no money warring.

647
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:54,324
So I was thinking

648
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,577
I'll go back up
in the mountains of Thailand

649
00:58:57,744 --> 00:59:00,580
where I learned
all my original bad habits,

650
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,415
leave all this to you.

651
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,417
But you know what?

652
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,586
I'd like to leave with my face,
you know?

653
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:10,423
So give me a little bit--
just enough to wet my beak.

654
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,717
-( laughs )
- It's about respect. It's about face.

655
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:14,302
And I'll be gone.

656
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:17,931
I thought if you could come over
to the house in the next couple days,

657
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,141
one night, and let's sit down

658
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:22,936
and just have
a little business discussion.

659
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:25,605
You a businessman.

660
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:27,523
And I ain't talking about
business-business.

661
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,400
I'm just talking about
leaving with respect.

662
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,569
What do you say?

663
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:35,365
Chitty chitty bang bang,
Crips and things, baby.

664
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:38,201
Hmm.
We'll work out a number for you.

665
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:40,161
That's what I'm talking about.

666
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,121
Neighborhood.

667
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,003
I'll bring my neighborhood with me,

668
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:53,466
- you can have this one.
-( Iceman laughs )

669
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:58,012
- I like you, nigger.
-( laughs )

670
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:01,975
All right, fool.
I'll see you then.

671
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:13,152
Get the homies strapped up.

672
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,739
Neighborhood.

673
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:28,167
You know how it is, Eric--
tactics of gun-fighting.

674
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,336
If you don't maneuver,
you will be outmaneuvered.

675
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:33,298
If you're outmaneuvered,
you will be killed.

676
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,842
So let's go home,

677
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:38,928
get our gear in order,

678
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,389
and prepare for war.

679
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:43,933
Do what we do best.

680
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:48,187
( Phone ringing )

681
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:51,858
( ringing continues )

682
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:01,534
( beeps )

683
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:08,875
- Hurst?
- Alexander?

684
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:11,961
- Hurst: I can't leave.
- Yeah, I know.

685
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:14,213
But I wanted to give you
a chance, you know?

686
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,884
Iceman and his folks would
sort of like to have me retire early,

687
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:20,511
if you know what I mean.
But you know how I am, man.

688
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,598
I'm not too partial to people
having to try to tell me what to do

689
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,850
and when and how and where.

690
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:30,104
So I was just thinking, man,

691
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:34,692
I know you retired,
but I need to bring you back.

692
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,153
No matter how all this go down,

693
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,405
I figured when it goes down,

694
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:42,116
you could take that money
that I gave you

695
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:45,411
and give some to Karen
and get her out of here.

696
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:47,246
Know what I mean?

697
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:50,083
I could do that.
But what about Oso?

698
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,001
Alexander:
Don't worry about Oso.

699
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,420
He's got his own
marching orders now, son.

700
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:56,756
Yes, sir.

701
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:07,767
(grunts)

702
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:16,609
Sorry, bro.

703
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,116
( Birds squawking )

704
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:40,174
(grunting )

705
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:44,720
Ah! What the fuck
are you doing? Oh!

706
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:46,514
( Filtered )
Relax, Roman.

707
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,267
I'm what they call a curandero.

708
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,814
- Mexican witch doctor.
- Oh! Fuck that shit.

709
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,441
You relax!

710
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,192
Ahh!

711
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:01,195
Look, I gotta get you all fixed up.

712
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:02,905
You all badass now.

713
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:06,409
You can only imagine the pain
you can inflict with two good hands.

714
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,494
Now...

715
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:13,541
this is an old family medicine.

716
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,251
It goes way back

717
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:18,963
to Mayans or Incas or some shit--
I don't know. Old, though.

718
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:25,178
- This is a very rare scorpion.
- Ah!

719
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,680
(grunts)

720
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:35,438
One of the rarest in the world--
most poisonous too.

721
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,190
They live right up here
in the high desert.

722
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:40,401
Very few people know about them.

723
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:43,029
Now these...

724
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,702
Now this one will kill you a lot faster.

725
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,748
Now it's very important

726
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:58,503
to get the sting
right in the right area,

727
01:03:58,669 --> 01:03:59,795
where all the meridians are--

728
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,714
where all the meridians
are all tangled up.

729
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:03,758
(grunts)

730
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:11,557
(groaning )

731
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:16,187
( sounds distorting )

732
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,233
Can you believe that shit?
Meridians.

733
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,068
What the hell do I know?

734
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:24,445
I'm just a cook.
( laughs )

735
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:28,908
These poisons will work together
with your body,

736
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:31,202
help you find your hands again.

737
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:33,704
I didn't ask for your help.

738
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,791
Oso:
Actually, Mr. Alexander did.

739
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,211
That makes us amigos.

740
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,257
Now we cool?

741
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:52,932
- Let's do the other hand.
-( Hurst cries out)

742
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:58,854
( bass beat thumping )

743
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:02,275
( rap music playing )

744
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,461
( music continues, filtered )

745
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:27,425
Bitches, leave.

746
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:29,302
Don't get up.

747
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:31,262
Just listen.

748
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,351
Fuck you, nigger.

749
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:44,734
Enough of this shit.

750
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,611
You make a deal with the Mexicans,

751
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:49,405
you moving powder
against Mr. Alexander's wishes?

752
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,657
What do you think, Dante?

753
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:55,244
I think you're a crazy nigger.

754
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,788
You got no idea, baby.

755
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:00,791
It's business, Dante.

756
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,836
It's called consolidating power.

757
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,922
Now I don't expect you
to understand that.

758
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:12,094
But you know how much y'all be making
working for me-- you and your boys?

759
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:14,096
You know how much you'll be making?

760
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:18,392
Any of y'all want to make
five Gs a week?

761
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,187
You really think you can buy me?

762
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:23,397
Nigger, you already bought.

763
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:27,234
Now it's either me
or the white man Mr. Alexander.

764
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:30,529
What difference does it make?
You still getting paid, Tom.

765
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:31,781
(grunts)

766
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:34,367
The difference is respect.

767
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,702
You see, I got nothing but respect
for Mr. Alexander.

768
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,287
You?

769
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:41,499
You can go fuck your mother.

770
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,376
6-0.

771
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:53,052
Why'd you have to make that comment
about my mama?

772
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:58,557
What's up with these niggers, homie?

773
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:00,434
Oh, these niggers straight.
These the homies-- they with me.

774
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:01,769
Okay, put 'em to work.

775
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:04,480
You needs to get that nigger--
drag that nigger body outta here.

776
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:17,743
What's up, nigger?

777
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:22,873
I want you to call Bear Claw

778
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,211
and hit up No Name.
Be back here in two hours.

779
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:29,797
- Neighbors.
- Neighbors.

780
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:48,983
Oso:
Good, good.

781
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,360
Poison seems to be working.

782
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:53,028
You're dying, ese.

783
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,740
And this will fix my hands?

784
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,325
How the hell is scorpion poison
gonna fix your hands?

785
01:07:58,492 --> 01:07:59,702
It'll kill you, though.

786
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:02,913
That's why we mixed it together--
slow down the toxins

787
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,791
so they'll work on your broken bones--
fix them as good as new.

788
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,586
Wait, what broken bones?

789
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,714
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait-- wait a minute.

790
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:14,133
I gotta separate the bones again

791
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,844
so the poison helps them reset--

792
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:19,764
fuse them together,
twice as strong.

793
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,724
- Trust me.
- Okay, wait, wait.

794
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:25,519
So, wait-- so you've done this before.

795
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,565
- Well, I've seen it done before.
- Okay, you said--

796
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:33,152
Okay, at least knock me out
with something first.

797
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:37,740
I think the adrenaline from the fear

798
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:39,325
has to work with the poison.

799
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:42,703
I just-- I think that's how it is.

800
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,997
(grunting )

801
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,833
( screams )

802
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:53,172
( screaming echoing )

803
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:02,681
-( Hurst grunting )
- Oso: Finished.

804
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,065
Somebody's coming.

805
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,318
Close the door, close the door.

806
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:20,366
Make sure it's locked.
Can't let anyone find him like this.

807
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:24,745
Oso:
Help me move him. Come on.

808
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:26,705
Get him up! ( grunting)

809
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,542
Ah! Go on!

810
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,502
( Karen screaming )

811
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:33,462
Move it!

812
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:36,590
(all grunting )

813
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,892
- Ah!
-( Karen screaming )

814
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,573
Get off of me!

815
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:10,457
I know you, right?
You're Alexander's girl.

816
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,751
(grunting )

817
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:18,966
That's right.
That's right, you keep on pushing.

818
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:25,681
Grab this bitch.

819
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:29,226
Get him in the fucking truck.

820
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:01,216
( Bass beat thumping )

821
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:07,723
( speaks Spanish )

822
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:13,687
Karen, right?
You're Alexander's girl.

823
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:16,482
-( laughing )
- Karen: You can go to hell.

824
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,400
( Oso grunting )

825
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:23,072
Hey, boss, I found
the scrapper upstairs,

826
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:25,157
but there's another one
inside the truck.

827
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:27,952
Drunk-- useless if you ask me.

828
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:30,537
( Speaks Spanish )

829
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,331
( speaks Spanish )

830
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,047
You gotta take a look
at his hands, right?

831
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,674
But you gotta look up close.

832
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,259
There's something weird about it.

833
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,346
- ( Speaks Spanish )
- Yeah?

834
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,431
- He's dead.
- Huh?

835
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:51,767
He's dead.

836
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,478
Fuck me!

837
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:59,274
- Who the fuck is he?
- He's just a drunk. He lives upstairs.

838
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,902
Hey, look at his hands.
He's got some kind of disease.

839
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,988
It's all full of puss.

840
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:06,657
( Speaks Spanish )

841
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:09,451
What? What are you
standing around for?

842
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:12,913
Get rid of him.
Bring the fucking plague into my house.

843
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,082
Fucking pendejos!
Take him out to the desert,

844
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:18,252
plant him deep enough
the animals don't bring him back.

845
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,213
( Speaks Spanish )

846
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,299
Hey, boss, what about
this one here?

847
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,261
Cesare:
Por favor, chale, string her up.

848
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:30,139
- Yeah, my pleasure.
-( phone ringing )

849
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,557
Fuck!

850
01:12:31,724 --> 01:12:34,101
I'll get the answers out of her myself.

851
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:35,352
Fuck it.

852
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,729
- What?
- Man: Where's the fucking chain?

853
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,188
( Speaks Spanish )

854
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:39,356
What's up, amigo?

855
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,525
You got any new jokes for me today?

856
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:43,152
Cesare:
You fucking psycho.

857
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,945
- You know...
- ( chains rattling, Karen grunting )

858
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:47,406
Manny was really attached
to his tongue.

859
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:49,074
( laughs )

860
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:51,869
The airplane coming in.
Say "ah," motherfucker.

861
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:53,537
- Say "ah!"
- Ah!

862
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:55,164
Fuckin'...

863
01:12:56,832 --> 01:12:58,417
( Manny grunting )

864
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:00,586
Cesare: So I'm thinking,
maybe you and me,

865
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:02,296
we finish doing business, huh?

866
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,256
Look, man, that's a casualty of war.

867
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:06,633
You know how Mr. Alexander
does business.

868
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,053
Once Alexander's gone,

869
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,138
everything's going to be fine, baby.

870
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:15,225
I'll handle distribution.
You sell everything to me. You feel me?

871
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I think it is you

872
01:13:18,187 --> 01:13:19,938
who's going to have to take
my word for it.

873
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:23,192
You see, I have the little puta
from the diner.

874
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:25,110
You know, Alexander's girl.

875
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:27,654
She's going to come in handy.

876
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,239
Oso:
Tell you what--

877
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:33,619
you bring her
and bring a couple of your soldiers.

878
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:35,871
I'll handle Mr. Alexander.

879
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:39,750
And if you like, I'll bring you
his tongue in a yellow box.

880
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,085
Now what do you say to that?

881
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:43,128
Ooh.

882
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:46,423
I say I love doing business with you.

883
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,175
( Phone beeps )

884
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:53,680
Alexander:
All right, gentlemen,

885
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:55,307
we've got a little sand tipper
going on here.

886
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:56,850
Before we start,

887
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:59,686
I just want to say
nobody kill Ice but me.

888
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,522
Everybody else free game, you hear?

889
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,148
Heard that.

890
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,650
All right, what I'm told
is they're going to do

891
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,693
a dynamic entrance from the front.

892
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,322
And they'll get on line here
and start shooting straight up

893
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:13,492
into the compound
like a bunch of dumb-ass gangsters.

894
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:15,744
I'm gonna be hiding
in this black hole here,

895
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:17,329
and we'll put Josh up on the balcony

896
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:18,831
and have him start throwing
some shit down.

897
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:19,998
Man:
Yeah.

898
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:21,583
Soon as they turn
towards him to return,

899
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,627
I'll come up here over the side
and kill him.

900
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:27,256
Motherfucker, about damn time
you picked up the phone.

901
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,133

This is a very rare scorpion.

913

These poisons will work together
with your body,

918
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:27,232
I'm not going to even give you a chance
to tell me what's going on.

919
01:15:28,817 --> 01:15:31,153
Give her four.

He's gonna get you.

927

One fucking shovel?
One shovel?

You idiot! You know how long
it's going to take us

933
01:16:45,894 --> 01:16:47,229
to dig a hole with one fucking shovel?

934
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,606
Why didn't you bring your own shovel?
You got a fucking car.

935
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:51,275
Shit, homie, get him out of the trunk.

Man: Cesare says to be careful
with that guy you got there, all right?

Why? He's fucking dead.

945
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:23,181

Just take care of it.

Ain't nobody like me around
no more, so...

used all that to make a lot of money.

1058

But this is a bad life,
and I regret much of what I've done.
