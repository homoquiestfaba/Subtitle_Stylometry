"Harlot."

507
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:42,059
Okay. Are we talking
about the same Alcmene?
Her husband's Amphitryon.

508
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,528
Her husband's dead.
He went off to war.

509
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,032
But Alcmene couldn't
be bothered to wait.

510
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,036
She's with child.

511
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,038
What do you think?

512
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,397
This is getting us nowhere!

513
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,767
I told you it wouldn't!

514
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,771
Now, listen to me.
If we work together,
we can find a way out of here!

515
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:31,275
For you, you mean.
Even if I did help you,
and we found a way out of here,

516
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,494
you would still try
to leave me in here.

517
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:36,230
Fine. Then I'll
do it on my own.

518
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,717
Sure! Go ahead,
for all the good it'll do you.

519
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,219
[ Scoffs ]
You're an idiot, you know that?

520
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,589
You know nothing about me.
Oh, yes, I do.

521
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,976
[ Laughs ]
Oh, yeah. See,
I've watched you in here.

522
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:52,146
You should make people
worship you,

523
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:55,549
tremble in fear.

524
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:57,551
But what do you do?

525
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:01,555
Oh, you help them out.

526
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:05,059
You solve
their puny problems.

527
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,312
You're pathetic.

528
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:13,000
Maybe you're the one
who's pathetic.

529
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,002
You ever think about that?

530
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:17,922
Are you so happy
with your own life?

531
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,675
Forget it!
Wait!

532
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:26,480
You said you watched me
in here. How?

533
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:35,289
I was thinking about you
putting me in this place,

534
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,260
and a window popped up
in that pool,

535
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,662
and there you were.

536
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:51,822
I tried to reach through it
to... strangle you.

537
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,626
Callisto and Ares didn't
put us in here on their own.

538
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,130
They had help
of some evil force.

539
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,582
I saw him.

540
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:04,335
Now Iolaus is alone
back there with what--
[ Water Sloshing ]

541
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,988
whatever it is.

542
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,526
Iolaus?

543
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:18,466
Get used to it.
It's torture.

544
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,635
We can see the outside world,
but we can't get back to it.

545
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:23,888
There has to be a way.

546
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,110
There's always a way.

547
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,312
There must be.

548
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,819
[ Chuckles ]
The baby kicked again.

549
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,821
He's so strong.

550
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,194
Our baby, Amphitryon,
no matter what anyone says.

551
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,699
I know it was you in
my bed that night,

552
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,202
even though they say
it's not possible.

553
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,707
They say you were killed
before the night
you came to me.

554
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,710
If that's true,
I have to believe,

555
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,714
because our love was so strong,
that you came to me
in spirit.

556
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,317
I know it was you.

557
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,103
I'll always love you.

558
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,006
Alcmene!

559
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,926
Um, uh,
you don't know me.

560
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:20,794
Uh, I'm a friend.

561
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,730
Iolaus.

562
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,984
Tell me, have you seen
any strangers around here?
A woman?

563
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,286
No. Just you.

564
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,288
What about Iphicles,
your son?
Is he inside?

565
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,290
No, no,
he's away with friends.

566
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,509
Who are you?
What do you want?

567
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,795
We haven't
got time for this.
He's with my mother.

568
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,114
I'll tell you in a moment.
We gotta get out of here.

569
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:42,366
Come on.
It's dangerous.

570
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,535
What are you doing?
Come on. I told you.
I'm a friend!

571
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,804
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

572
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,174
- But wait!
  You don't understand!
- [ Gasps ]

573
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,147
- Callisto.
- Hello. Can I help you?

574
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,116
Yes.

575
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,603
N-- No!
