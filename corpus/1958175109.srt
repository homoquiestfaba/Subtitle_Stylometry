1
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,077
Hello?

2
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,829
Fear splits a glimmer of hope
in two,

3
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,132
like lightning
strikes an old me.

4
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,269
Beyond it, a vision of futures,
dreams realized.

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,172
Dancing like golden ghosts,

6
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,843
we emerge
from behind a veil of fog

7
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:16,911
on the horizon.

8
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,060
Thank you.

9
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:41,629
Ramy!

10
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,864
Uncle Hani.

11
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,799
Good to see you.

12
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,233
You made it.

13
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:57,310
This is your room.

14
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,782
Make yourself at home.

15
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,552
I'll make us some tea.

16
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,944
So...

17
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,545
Medical school, huh?

18
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,682
It's a tough university
to get in to.

19
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,117
Yeah I suppose so.

20
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,752
You made it this far.

21
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,655
Your dad must be very proud.

22
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:15,923
I guess he is.

23
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,426
But it's mainly for my mom
that I'm doing this.

24
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,895
Hmm.

25
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:27,602
Oh, Alya was a loving lady,
filled with so much life.

26
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,738
What a loss.

27
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,543
I'm glad you're finally here,
really.

28
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,779
Thank you, Uncle Hani.

29
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,585
Fear splits a glimmer of hope
in two,

30
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,655
like lightning
strikes an old me.

31
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,591
A glimmer of hope

32
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,295
A glimmer of hope
strikes fear in two,

33
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,429
behind a veil of smoke,

34
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,800
on the hori--

35
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:42,844
Tamer?

36
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,152
Uh, heard there was an infidel
takin' over my digs!

37
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:52,153
The fuck?

38
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,590
What's up, cuz?

39
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,290
Cuz!

40
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,531
Yo, man,
sorry to drop in on you so late.

41
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,200
I uh, I lost my keys on tour.

42
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,270
Oh,
and I didn't wanna wake up dad.

43
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,137
Fuck.

44
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,105
It's your room.

45
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,439
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,210
It's uh,
it's nice to see you, cuz.

47
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,578
Same here.

48
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,848
-So, you like it?
-Quite a bedroom.

49
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,650
Really. Do you speak any French?

50
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,719
Haven't had a chance
to learn it.

51
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,087
I went to
a British private school

52
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,222
where mom used to teach.

53
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,958
A British school!

54
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,493
Fuckin' hell, mate.

55
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,663
Ain't we proper jammy?

56
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,134
You like those?

57
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,202
I'm not familiar with them.

58
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,139
The classics.

59
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,173
Thanks.

60
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,543
What, they didn't teach you
about the Pistols

61
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,811
in English class?

62
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:51,913
Afraid not.

63
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,982
Shit, what kinda English
do they teach over there?

64
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,652
Yo, I want you to listen this,
okay?

65
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,120
And tell me what you think.

66
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,106
What do you think?

67
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,581
It's a bit like spicy food.

68
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,618
Takes getting used to,

69
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,689
but once you're there,

70
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,992
it's like a--
a whole world opens up.

71
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,128
That's it.

72
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,232
You fucking nailed it.

73
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,634
You fucking nailed it.

74
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,136
Tabarnak!

75
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,040
What are you doing Saturday?

76
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,943
I'm recording a video
at a cool club called "L'Esco".

77
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:56,944
You'll love it.

78
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,047
You should come out, hang out.
Meet some people.

79
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,749
I'd love to.

80
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,918
You know about Montréal girls,
right?

81
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:04,952
What?

82
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,771
Hmm.

83
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,831
Thank you.

84
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,100
Of course.

85
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,236
Mmhmm.

86
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:49,116
Hi, what's his name?

87
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,619
It's Phénix.

88
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,820
Phoenix?

89
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,888
Hi.

90
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,423
Sorry, I don't speak French,

91
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,260
but that was
an incredible performance

92
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,128
you just gave there.

93
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,730
Was it?

94
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,432
A performance
you couldn't understand?

95
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,736
Perhaps I was simply
reciting my grocery list, no?

96
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:15,743
Well, I aspire
to perform poetry one day.

97
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,744
Like you.

98
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,813
Ooh, like me! Is that so?

99
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:22,149
And what is stopping you?

100
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,184
I don't know.

101
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,621
I mean...

102
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,088
I'm gonna give you
the best piece of advice.

103
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,827
You see, one needs to go
into the dark void.

104
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,362
Have his soul crushed.

105
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,600
Burned.

106
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,069
Chaos. Disorder. Anarchy.

107
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:47,007
Then rise again
like a phoenix from the ashes.

108
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,110
You have to live
and breathe poetry.

109
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,246
Sometimes you won't even
have a dime in your pocket,

110
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,248
but your heart is on fire.

111
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,282
Why?

112
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,985
Because it's been stepped on
a thousand times

113
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,788
and can only exist
by bursting into flames

114
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,790
every second of the day.

115
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:05,826
Forget it.

116
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,162
It's no life for

117
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,465
Have you ever even loved?

118
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,400
With the fire of a dozen suns?

119
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:20,874
Follow the sheep, boy.

120
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,876
You'll be much happier that way.

121
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,985
Okay, this is gonna be a take.

122
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,855
Raise the energy, everybody!

123
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:12,359
Action!

124
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,990
Hi!

125
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,575
Sorry?

126
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,076
Do you work with the crew?

127
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,511
No. Why?

128
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,111
Oh, never mind.

129
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,185
Do you want one?

130
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,486
Sure.

131
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:15,289
Alright, do you like reds,
darks, or blondes?

132
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,461
Your beer.

133
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,196
Whatever. You decide.

134
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,799
Here you go.

135
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,934
Two blondes
for the price of none.

136
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,538
Désirée.

137
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:04,806
Ramy.

138
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:06,875
Enchantée.

139
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:07,742
Nice to meet you.

140
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:08,976
Wooh!

141
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,678
- Cut!
- Thank you, thank you.

142
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,980
Beautiful fuckin' people!

143
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,617
Alright, this next one's
dedicated to my cousin

144
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,017
who's new in town

145
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,554
and lookin' for a good time,
ladies.

146
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,757
Ladies, he's right back there,
Doctor Ramy!

147
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,695
Uh, if you're feeling hot
and bothered,

148
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,564
the doctor's in town
to check you out!

149
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,365
One, two, three four!

150
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,734
Your cousin?

151
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,136
He's a legit
fuckin' cheese ball.

152
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,272
But he's family.

153
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,567
So, is it true?

154
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,034
What?

155
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,572
Are you Doctor Feelgood?

156
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,039
I'm working on it.

157
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,041
Santé.

158
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:19,581
Have fun.

159
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,941
Amazing! And cut.

160
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,984
You had fun at the bar?

161
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,351
It was quite an experience.

162
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,987
Okay, so, who--
who do you like best,

163
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,255
us or them?

164
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,757
Can't tell the difference yet.

165
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:05,793
Oh, everyone's a critic!

166
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,127
Everyone's a critic now,
did you know?

167
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:10,665
Hey, guys!

168
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:16,771
Madam. Yazzie.

169
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:17,739
Where you've been hiding,
beautiful?

170
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,109
You guys know each other?

171
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,211
Cuz, everyone knows me!

172
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,848
I'm a local fuckin' legend!

173
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,683
This is my friend, Yasmina.

174
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:32,119
She's a band promoter,
sometimes models for me.

175
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,621
My partner in crime.

176
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,292
Pleasure to meet you, Yasmina.

177
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,862
You can call me "Yaz".

178
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:44,666
Okay, shots for everybody!

179
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:48,937
Okay, I'd like to
propose a toast to Doctor Ramy

180
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,972
for pretending
he likes our music

181
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,875
and for being a good sport.
Okay.

182
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,475
- Wooh!
- Cheers.

183
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,781
He said our music is like uh--
what did you say?

184
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:01,950
Spicy food?

185
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,520
It goes down tasty,
but it comes out burning your--

186
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,186
What was it?

187
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,289
So, he's got
a sense of humour then?

188
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,325
Either that, or he knows
what he's listening to.

189
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,494
Oh! Pain!

190
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:16,598
Hey, are you tryin' to say
we're crap, Dési?

191
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,165
Look, Punk is dead.

192
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,499
I hate to break the news to you,

193
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,769
you're not even
fashionably late.

194
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,237
Okay, God forbid,
you take one of these girls

195
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,840
to a respectable club.

196
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,842
Nobody appreciates culture
anymore.

197
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,611
I'm with Ramy.

198
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,178
I think it's like spice.

199
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,748
Too much and you lose the taste.

200
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:38,452
You need just the right amount
to make something delicious.

201
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,188
Too much or too little
and you've lost everything.

202
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,258
God, you girls.

203
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,963
- You're so bad.
- You have no idea.

204
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,938
This party is getting so lame.

205
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,673
Please entertain me, Ramy.

206
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,944
Well,
Dési is definitely having fun,

207
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,478
isn't she?

208
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,720
Shooter! Wooh!

209
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:28,770
This is burning my throat.

210
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,773
- Yeah?
- Do you need an inspection?

211
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:32,774
Do you need another one?

212
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,881
Uh, sorry about that, officer.

213
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:43,483
Okay, everybody, time to go!

214
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,252
Thanks for coming.
Time to go, party's over.

215
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,253
Go, go, go!

216
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,455
Come on, fuck out!

217
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,692
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

218
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,459
- Out, out!
- Come. Let's go, Ramy!

219
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,861
Sorry about that.

220
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,531
Do you always walk girls home,
Ramy?

221
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:59,634
I couldn't let you girls
walk alone at night.

222
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,337
I need water.

223
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,008
Come on, we're almost there.

224
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,048
He's such a gentleman, isn't he?

225
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:14,816
Oh, my--

226
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,118
Are you okay?

227
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,218
Yeah, I'm good.

228
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:22,557
Ow. Okay, here we are!

229
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,763
Are you coming in?
Habibi?

230
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,345
Wait you're gonna pull me.

231
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:20,815
Hey.

232
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,151
Big pockets.

233
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,952
Oh, so you like tickles, really?

234
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,587
How about you?

235
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:27,889
Oh, my gosh, don't even try.

236
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:28,923
Yeah, she's totally--

237
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,062
Okay, I'll be right back.

238
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,039
So, Ramy, what's your story?

239
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:47,374
My story?

240
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,544
In three sentences or less.

241
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,615
Medical student-to-be.

242
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,917
Hmm.

243
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,051
Aspiring poet.

244
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,085
Mmhmm.

245
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,723
Missing dead mother.

246
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:08,930
Hmm.

247
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,899
And what is your story?

248
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,037
I know nothing about you.

249
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,876
Well, maybe
that's what turns you on.

250
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,646
Why ruin it?

251
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,692
Your lips are nice.

252
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,161
With a little bit of training,
you could be a good kisser.

253
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,964
You are so unusual.

254
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,699
Why is that?

255
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,902
You seem so carefree, I guess

256
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:23,170
So unpredictable.

257
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,273
I've never met a girl like you.

258
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:26,741
Enjoy it then.

259
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,910
My neighbours
are allergic to fun.

260
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,918
So, what did I miss?

261
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,296
Mm, you smell so nice.

262
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:11,018
Whoa, what kinda desperado
calls you this late?

263
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,086
No one.

264
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:22,363
Oh, I have to go.

265
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,798
Come on, are you sure?

266
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,901
Why don't you stay over?

267
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,069
I can't.

268
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,804
Come on.

269
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,106
We could show around town
to Ramy tomorrow.

270
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:38,346
I have to go. Come on.

271
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:44,552
You want to share a ride?

272
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,922
Sure. Call it.

273
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,834
- Ramy, are you coming?
- The sun is rising.

274
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,238
It's been fun. Thank you.

275
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,307
Yeah, let's hang out.

276
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:08,275
Sure.

277
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:11,712
Bye.

278
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:38,005
Sir, you can drop me off
at La Ruelle.

279
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,974
Um, just-- just here.

280
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,810
Thanks for the ride.

281
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:46,614
I'll text you.

282
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:47,982
Sure.

283
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:01,689
So, let's begin.

284
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,725
This one-year
preparatory curriculum

285
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:09,063
will prepare you
to excel in the medical program.

286
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:10,698
Can you do it?

287
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,466
I have faith that you can.

288
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:16,737
Hard work, dedication,
and listening.

289
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,140
So, you are here,

290
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,009
because your passion
for medicine and science,

291
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,746
and your dream
to become a doctor

292
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,149
are your life's mission.

293
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:30,718
We're here to help,
we're here to give.

294
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,754
Let's do this together.

295
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,959
Welcome to your first day
of pre-med.

296
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,896
This is the start
of your future.

297
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,166
Now, you'll have courses
in molecular biology,

298
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:48,102
physiology, metabolism,
cell biology.

299
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,738
Also, we operate courses
in humanities

300
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,106
and social sciences.

301
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,742
Then, you'll be able
to move forward

302
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:55,910
into the main program.

303
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,946
But-- it's a big but.

304
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:29,276
Humanities and social sciences,
but-- and this is a big but,

305
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:33,047
you must maintain a 3.5

306
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,249
cumulative grade point average.

307
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:18,325
When your mother passed,

308
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:22,429
your father
became completely closed.

309
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:27,935
I used to ask him
how he was doing,

310
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:33,173
and he would answer,
"I can't afford emotions."

311
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,844
Can't afford.

312
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,416
Always balancing the books.

313
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:46,453
Perhaps he was trying to--
to protect his sanity

314
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:47,555
or his heart.

315
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,192
Your mom, she had a good soul.

316
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:58,132
She always insisted
on emotional honesty, always.

317
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:01,969
If she were here today,

318
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,306
she would demand it
just the same, hmm?

319
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:13,480
My own son
doesn't think he needs me.

320
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:19,119
But I want you to know
that if you need to talk,

321
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,488
I'm here for you.

322
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,269
Isn't she pretty?

323
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,446
Yaz, hey, did you get any sleep?

324
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:36,731
Ramy.

325
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,165
- Yo, cuz!
- What the fuck?

326
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,635
Oh, don't tell me
I caught you jerkin' off.

327
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,038
Can't you knock?

328
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,108
You tryin' to traumatize me?

329
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,977
How come you're still in bed,
man?

330
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:54,148
What is that?

331
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,384
This your idea of porn?

332
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,789
She's hot. Not my type.

333
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,189
Terrible tits.

334
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,727
But to each their own.
To each their own.

335
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:06,861
Funny.

336
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,197
-What you got there?
-Nothing. Verses.

337
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:12,332
Really? Can I read 'em?

338
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,434
They're not finished yet.

339
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:15,703
- Come on.
- You know, I write poetry, too.

340
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,105
Check this out. New lyrics.

341
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:32,052
You're a lowly fucked disgrace.

342
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:34,889
Blow it out your ass.

343
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:37,525
I don't like your fuckin' face.

344
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,527
Blow it out your ass.

345
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:42,062
It's called "BIOYA".

346
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:44,532
Does that stand for
blow it out your...

347
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,300
Ass!

348
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,367
Correct.

349
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,904
Okay, now, let me read yours.

350
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,238
Okay, just...

351
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,307
Shit...

352
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,276
Huh! Ooh.

353
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:04,384
Your emerald eyes
sparkle in the desert moon.

354
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:09,591
Rosewater scents surround us
as we kiss under kh--

355
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,359
The fuck is that?

356
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,128
It's a bit obscure.

357
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:20,067
Not sure
about the translation yet,

358
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:25,540
but it's you know,
the bear constellation.

359
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,308
It's an expression.
The back of the bear.

360
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:32,346
So you're kissing
under a bear's ass?

361
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:35,884
Come on, what is that?

362
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:38,987
Blow it out your ass, seriously?

363
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,388
It's political.
I don't have to explain.

364
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:42,757
Anyway, it sounds a lot better
with music.

365
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,525
Trust me.

366
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,161
Yeah, at least
we agree on one thing.

367
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:49,196
What's that?

368
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,265
We're both ass men.

369
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:57,972
When's your next show?

370
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,440
Oh, you wanna see us again?

371
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,912
Already hooked on the spice,
are we?

372
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,980
- Mmhmm.
- I'm flattered.

373
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:07,916
Uh, we play in a few weeks.

374
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,584
Will Yaz be there?

375
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:11,553
Oh, you snake.

376
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,154
And this whole time I thought
you liked my song writing.

377
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,323
Look at you.

378
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:25,633
Trust me, Yaz is a lesson
you don't wanna learn.

379
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,336
Fuck, that's a good line!

380
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,873
That girl is a lesson
you don't wanna learn.

381
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,354
<i>Hey, did you get any sleep?</i>

382
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,450
<i>Hi Desiree, do you</i>
<i>wanna hang out?</i>

383
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:48,983
Hey.

384
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,852
Hey, Ramy!

385
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:59,226
-Nice to see you.
-You made it.

386
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,896
Yeah, sorry,
I was lost somewhere around.

387
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,666
I didn't know
there was another viewpoint.

388
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

389
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,468
But this view looks far better

390
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,239
Yeah,
I hike up here all the time.

391
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:14,709
It centres me.

392
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,660
What's that for?

393
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,831
I'm collecting portraits
for a photo exhibit.

394
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:52,446
Let me show you
my favourite spot.

395
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:54,082
Sure.

396
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,282
Let's go.

397
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:18,906
Thank you for bringing me here.

398
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,212
So, young doctor,

399
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,215
besides carousing
with Montréal Girls

400
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:30,350
on your spare time,
what else do you do?

401
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,823
I write verses.

402
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,025
Oh, let's hear some.

403
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,326
I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

404
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,062
No, some on. Don't be like that.

405
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,664
Own it if you care about it.
Otherwise what's the point?

406
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,667
You're right.

407
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:58,513
A glimmer of hope
strikes fear in two,

408
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,950
like lightning
splits an old tree.

409
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:07,855
Beyond it, a vision of futures.

410
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,357
Dreams realized

411
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,795
dance like golden ghosts,

412
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,364
behind a veil of smoke

413
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:20,635
on the horizon.

414
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:23,604
Nice.

415
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:24,639
Hmm.

416
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,474
I got a few others in there.
check that out.

417
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,705
Ever had a muse?

418
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,406
Not sure.

419
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,408
How would I know if I had?

420
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,610
You would know.

421
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,047
Something...

422
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:10,651
...or someone...

423
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,532
...who just perfectly embodies
that vision

424
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:28,936
that you're striving
to give voice to.

425
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,705
Beckoning you,

426
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:34,709
like a star that's pulling you
into its gravity.

427
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:38,112
You can't explain why.
It just happens that way.

428
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,281
And you follow,
sometimes blindly,

429
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,149
hoping that by being near them,

430
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,653
by grasping their essence,

431
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:48,556
you might find the perfect way
to say what you want to.

432
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,601
Your poem reminds me of Rumi.

433
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:03,738
"The soul which cannot endure
fire and smoke

434
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,406
won't find the secret."

435
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,210
What's the secret?

436
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,281
Wow!

437
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,085
That's up to you to figure out.

438
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,335
Did we really just
get the same text?

439
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,337
It looks like it.

440
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,873
You'll love Bloodshot Bill.

441
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:39,941
Are you going?

442
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,243
Yaz is the promoter.

443
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:19,547
Alright.

444
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:20,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,616
This next one, we're gonna do
it
for all you Montréal girls

446
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:24,552
out there, here we go.

447
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,688
Bloodshot Bill!

448
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:34,095
- That's so funny.
- Are you serious?

449
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:34,996
Yaz.

450
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,166
Hi.

451
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,267
Ramy.

452
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,405
- Where's Dési?
- I don't know.

453
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,574
She got the invite
like everyone else.

454
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,909
Did you get my texts?

455
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:49,910
Oh, shit.

456
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,580
Excuse me man!

457
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,882
Ètienne Tremblay!

458
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:56,684
Alphonse Legrand!

459
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,224
Mm.

460
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,528
I've never seen you around, huh?

461
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,336
What are you drinkin'?

462
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,906
Adios motherfucker.

463
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:52,907
What?

464
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:54,642
That's what I'm drinking.

465
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:58,479
Excuse me there!

466
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:00,848
Two adios motherfuckers, please.

467
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:01,949
Yeah, two.

468
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:02,817
Doubles.

469
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:05,219
Oh!

470
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:06,921
- Thank you so much.
- Have a great night.

471
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,195
Wooh!

472
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:18,866
Oh, my God.

473
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:24,105
I think I have too much blood
in my alcohol system

474
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:27,007
Well, you might need
to do a blood test.

475
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,710
-Oh!
-Here let me give you a shot.

476
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:44,792
What's that?

477
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,962
Uh, you wanna make out?

478
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,998
I'll be back.

479
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:25,232
I'll be here.

480
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,005
Hey, guys,
anybody wants some poutine?

481
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:32,206
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

482
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:33,374
Gotta roll, man!

483
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,748
Why!

484
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,758
-Need a ride home, huh?
-Hmm.

485
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:00,301
Better that than to ride
with him on his tiny moped!

486
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,773
Mopeds... They're fun, huh,

487
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,141
until your friends see ya
ridin' them

488
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,680
Just ignore them, Ramy.

489
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:24,491
Come on, Etienne.

490
00:45:24,593 --> 00:45:25,660
What?

491
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:27,161
Don't be so immature.

492
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:28,062
Oh.

493
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,997
Fast. He's fast.

494
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,940
Are you always this forward
with girls?

495
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,713
A girl spying on a boy.
Isn't that called "stalking"?

496
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:48,816
Well, I came here to save you
from that rousse Marie-Claude.

497
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:52,453
That chick's like Chiclets.

498
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:53,821
Sweet on the outside,

499
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,824
but she'll stick to you
like bubble gum.

500
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:03,430
Is that what you want?

501
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:23,284
You've got pumpkin lipstick
all over your mouth.

502
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,857
This isn't a Halloween party.

503
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,570
Who's that pervert Etienne?

504
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:45,005
A friend of yours?

505
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,241
Friends don't know the way
that I taste.

506
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:05,185
Are we more than friends now?

507
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,989
I don't know, you tell me.

508
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:21,669
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voicemail box of...</i>

509
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,970
<i>Ramy Salama.</i>

510
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,540
Salut, Ramy!

511
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,142
Sorry, I can't come out tonight.
I was working late.

512
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:31,311
<i>I just booked</i>
<i>two photo exhibits.</i>

513
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:33,414
<i>The first one opens</i>
<i>tomorrow night, 7:00 p.m.,</i>

514
00:48:33,515 --> 00:48:35,048
<i>at Gallatin Island</i>

515
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,818
<i>I'd love you to come.</i>

516
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,986
<i>I-- I really hope you can come.</i>

517
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,288
Okay, bye.

518
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:06,213
- What the fuck?
- Etienne. Etienne!

519
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,449
- Stop!
- Etienne!

520
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,135
Yaz!

521
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:29,236
Yaz!

522
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:40,748
I guess
you're not havin' poutine.

523
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:49,323
You must have a poet's heart.

524
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:51,693
You're so easily seduced
by fantasy.

525
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,128
Hello.

526
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,096
Check.

527
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:56,931
- Ramy?
- Ramy.

528
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:58,432
- Ramy!
- Mama.

529
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,981
Saw Yaz last night.

530
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,649
Uh-huh, and?

531
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:15,683
She vanished.

532
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:21,188
Of course she did.
She's a fuckin' mirage.

533
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,527
Cuz, cuz, cuz, listen to me.

534
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:27,896
Don't let me catch you
hangin' over Yaz.

535
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:29,162
Those chicks,
they're like buses.

536
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:31,699
You miss one,
you catch the next.

537
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:33,200
Do you understand?

538
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:35,670
Okay.

539
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:41,609
You know, Tam, before mom died,

540
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,012
I promised her
that I would study hard

541
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,513
to become a doctor.

542
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,222
And now, she's gone.

543
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,292
And I wonder,

544
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:02,564
"Does any of this
even matter anymore?"

545
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:08,135
I don't know, man.
Nothing really matters.

546
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,407
We're just germs
spinning on a rock

547
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:14,742
in the universe,

548
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,746
and we have to get jobs
on top of it.

549
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:21,616
That's bullshit.

550
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,597
Sometimes I feel
like I'm wasting my time.

551
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,436
I love the old stuff, you know?

552
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:45,607
The classics.

553
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:53,280
But music now, it's just shit.

554
00:51:57,051 --> 00:51:59,186
I mean the older stuff is
like...

555
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:05,425
...like a tiger in the wild.

556
00:52:08,029 --> 00:52:11,331
It's dangerous,
and it's exciting,

557
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:14,301
and it's everything
you could ever hope to be.

558
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,107
But then you see the tiger
in the zoo

559
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:22,442
with the fake landscape,
and it's not the same.

560
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,848
The stripes
and the teeth are there,

561
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:30,217
but it's just not the same.

562
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:40,828
Sometimes
I feel like we're the zoo tiger.

563
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,234
I don't know.

564
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:53,107
It's better to die
from delusions of grandeur

565
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,743
than from reality and boredom
I guess.

566
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,293
<i>Hey, this is Yaz.</i>

567
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,163
<i>Don't leave me a message.</i>
<i>I don't check 'em.</i>

568
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:25,573
Beyond the black
velvet futility,

569
00:53:25,673 --> 00:53:28,475
like glimmering watchtowers
in the distant cosmos,

570
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,980
the signal fires
from your eyes

571
00:53:33,081 --> 00:53:35,149
arrive burning
like a dozen stars

572
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:37,952
after the journey
of light years

573
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,188
to ignite the heart's lantern.

574
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:44,559
The flame of the muse,
dancing, eternal.

575
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,627
Ramy.

576
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,359
Ramy?

577
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:20,928
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

578
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,232
Do you happen to have some time?

579
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:26,601
Yeah, sure. Come in.

580
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,239
Well, so typical of her.

581
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:33,875
But I don't understand.

582
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:38,112
I mean she was so...

583
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:39,379
So what?

584
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,584
I thought she was open for--
you know?

585
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,853
Open for business?

586
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,156
But even you and her...

587
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:50,158
Don't worry about me and her.

588
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:52,160
Besides what of it?

589
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,697
You know, you have the audacity

590
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:58,365
to come here
and inquire about Yaz

591
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,367
when you didn't even
return my phone call?

592
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:04,639
What phone call?

593
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:13,380
Crap.

594
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,751
I never check my voicemail app.

595
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,452
Désirée, I'm so sorry.

596
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,657
Are you serious?

597
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:24,826
Do you think
that I am Yaz's pimp?

598
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:28,395
That I can just go around
and you know,

599
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:30,798
make an arrangement for you
to get in her pants?

600
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:37,772
I have my own life,
my own interests,

601
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:42,176
and who Yaz is
or isn't gonna sleep with

602
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:43,711
is not one of them.

603
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:51,786
Look, I have to get ready
for my chakra workshop.

604
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,806
I really have to get ready.

605
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,911
Can I--

606
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:21,849
Can I at least give you this?

607
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,993
Open it, please.

608
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,510
Give it to your muse.

609
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:23,110
<i>For you Yaz, Ramy.</i>

610
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:56,544
Sorry,
I don't understand French, sir.

611
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:01,248
This is
the Saint Lawrence River,

612
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:03,217
the Fleuve Saint-Laurent, okay?

613
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,786
It's a sacred river.

614
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:07,722
See?

615
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:10,458
It's like our vein,
you know what?

616
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:13,627
You can throw it your sorrows
if you want,

617
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,363
but not your garbage.

618
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:22,703
It wasn't rubbish.

619
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,439
It was a poem I wrote actually.

620
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:28,175
A poem? Oh!

621
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:30,578
But maybe you're right.

622
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:32,279
Maybe it's just waste after all.

623
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,483
A poem of love interest?

624
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:47,862
Don't let tears of sorrow
inundate your thoughts,

625
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,730
young man.

626
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,601
They are like the--
the river current.

627
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:57,605
The more you resist
the stream of life,

628
00:58:57,705 --> 00:58:59,407
the more it makes you drown.

629
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:10,878
When I moved to Canada,
I apprehended the new world.

630
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:14,982
Your mom was a foreign student
at McGill.

631
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:19,720
She wrote this poem
as a welcome gift

632
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,322
and to soothe my fears.

633
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:26,927
As water ventures forth
down a mountain,

634
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:30,599
it dreams not of its origins
as a fountain,

635
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:34,902
nor fears its destination
across the plain,

636
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:38,339
but breaks free
from all self-imposed restraint.

637
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,809
Simple, and effective.

638
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:44,078
Your mother excelled
in English.

639
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:46,213
She was
a terrific language teacher.

640
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:50,417
Keep it. It's now yours.

641
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,852
A secret treasure.

642
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:58,826
As water ventures forth
down a mountain,

643
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:02,696
it dreams not of its origins
as a fountain,

644
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:06,767
nor fears its destination
across the plain,

645
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:11,071
but breaks free
from all self-imposed restraint.

646
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:12,973
Will there'll be
sleepless nights?

647
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:13,741
Absolutely.

648
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:14,808
Will there be hard days?

649
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:15,743
Will there be days
where you think

650
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:17,244
you're gonna have to give up?

651
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,779
100 %.

652
01:01:18,879 --> 01:01:20,915
But that is when you depend
on yourself.

653
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:23,751
But-- it's a big but.

654
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:27,755
You must remember
that you have to maintain

655
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:31,859
a cumulative grade point average
of at least 3.5.

656
01:02:37,692 --> 01:02:38,926
Dear Baba,

657
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:41,529
this is perhaps
the most difficult letter

658
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,197
that I will ever have to write,

659
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:45,065
but there is something
I must confess.

660
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:53,742
I couldn't find the courage
to call you.

661
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:56,110
I was afraid
of your immediate reaction.

662
01:02:57,845 --> 01:03:00,214
I trust that you will
respect my decision.

663
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,250
Your son, Ramy.

664
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:09,584
-Hi.
-Hey. That was fantastic.

665
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:13,387
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to see you here.

666
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,955
Hey!

667
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:19,527
Oh, the little pigeon
has returned.

668
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:24,098
Ramy.

669
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:26,266
Sophia.

670
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,470
Sophia is the editor of Poetzia,

671
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:31,038
the reference site for poetry.

672
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:33,374
She has immaculate taste...

673
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,944
...in everything.

674
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:40,582
Enjoy your night.

675
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,707
Yaz, I haven't heard from you.

676
01:05:06,808 --> 01:05:07,975
Everything alright?

677
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:25,225
Uh, your father called.

678
01:05:25,325 --> 01:05:26,994
Really? What did he say?

679
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:28,730
He was really angry.

680
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,064
Are you sure
about this decision?

681
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:34,001
I mean you've worked very hard
to get here.

682
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,544
Have you even thought
about your future?

683
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:45,145
Yeah, aren't you gonna
lose your chance

684
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:47,281
to residency status here
and shit?

685
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:52,052
I'd rather lose my status
than my mind.

686
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:56,223
Hmm, makes sense.

687
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,528
Okay, Dave's here. I gotta run.

688
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:01,529
Thanks for dinner, dad.

689
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:02,630
I'll be back Wednesday.

690
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,767
Hey, Tamer, tonight's your show
at L'Esco, right?

691
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:07,535
Yeah.

692
01:06:09,871 --> 01:06:11,138
Will Yaz be there?

693
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:12,674
Are you mentally exhausted?

694
01:06:15,242 --> 01:06:16,611
Okay, listen, man, I'm gonna
tell you something straight up

695
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:18,580
and you're not gonna be
happy with it, alright?

696
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:21,583
I nailed Yaz
more than a few times, okay?

697
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:22,851
We were drunk,
and it was something to do.

698
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:23,751
And I'll tell you right now,

699
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:24,953
she's the biggest
pain in the ass

700
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:26,253
you'll ever meet, okay?

701
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:27,555
You get hooked on that chick,

702
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,122
she's gonna make you wanna walk
into the Saint-Laurent

703
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:31,058
with concrete boots on.

704
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:32,927
It's a catch. Want to go?

705
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,194
Stay here.

706
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,640
Is everybody having a good time?

707
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:48,743
Ladies?

708
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,745
Ladies, come on!

709
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:53,313
Ooh!

710
01:06:57,484 --> 01:07:01,656
Give it up for Dave on drums,
Arno on bass!

711
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,659
Do not feel like a Dirt bag!

712
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,160
Come on!

713
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:10,598
Wooh!

714
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,209
Yeah, yeah.

715
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:24,444
And more to you after party.

716
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:25,914
Ramy.

717
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:27,114
I wanna talk to you.

718
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:28,382
I'm busy.

719
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:31,118
Ramy.

720
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:33,888
Ramy. Hey! Oh, but-- dude!

721
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:47,467
Why do you keep giving me
the silent treatment, Yaz?

722
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:51,739
Is that what you're here
to discuss?

723
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,944
Are you gonna be boring?

724
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:57,645
Did you read what I sent you?

725
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:01,049
The poem? Yeah.

726
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:02,249
And?

727
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:06,153
I thought it was nice.

728
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:07,956
Clever.

729
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:09,857
What are you hiding from then?

730
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,693
Fuck you, Ramy.

731
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,327
I don't need your inquisition.

732
01:08:14,662 --> 01:08:16,898
I'm not
one of your research projects.

733
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:18,498
I felt something with you.

734
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:22,770
Something new I've never felt.

735
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,474
Sorry if that makes you feel
like an experiment.

736
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:30,444
So you want me
to be exclusive to you?

737
01:08:30,545 --> 01:08:31,546
Is that it?

738
01:08:33,014 --> 01:08:35,182
Why should you
get special treatment?

739
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:38,352
Because we're
from the same culture?

740
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:40,855
The same background?

741
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:44,859
I've been running away from that
my whole life.

742
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,360
I'm someone else here.

743
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,998
Mysterious, exotic Yaz.

744
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:51,866
What will she say?
What will she do?

745
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:53,467
Everyone wants to know.

746
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:57,105
It's a full time job playing me.

747
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:58,338
You ought to know.

748
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:00,340
You're playing a role, too.

749
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:03,978
But at least I'm the one
who is in control.

750
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:06,748
Nobody owns me or tells me
what to do.

751
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:16,323
Don't be so naïve, habibi.

752
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:27,935
Here.

753
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:31,673
I wanna make you feel better.

754
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:35,743
Let's take a trip together.

755
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:41,314
I've already taken two of these.

756
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,885
Kiss me, Ramy,
or I'll swallow this one, too.

757
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:08,341
What the fuck are you doing?

758
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:12,146
Can't you tell
she's playing you,

759
01:10:12,245 --> 01:10:14,214
like she does
with everyone else?

760
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:16,184
Daring you
with these dramatic games

761
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:19,020
to gain the attention
she so desperately craves.

762
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,254
Mind your own fucking business,
Désirée.

763
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:24,291
All you care about
is getting your own way.

764
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:25,893
All you want are free headshots
and...

765
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:27,829
...friends, like Rami and I.

766
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:30,631
This is not a contest
between one or the other.

767
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,137
And you, Ramy,

768
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,972
I thought you had
a bit more consciousness.

769
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:40,942
Depth maybe.

770
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:45,012
Sense enough not to be lured in

771
01:10:45,113 --> 01:10:46,781
by an illusion
of your own imagination.

772
01:10:49,316 --> 01:10:52,754
Désirée. Désirée!

773
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:54,354
It's not what you think!

774
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:11,539
Hey, Dési.

775
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:15,176
- Stay away from me.
- Wait. Wait!

776
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:16,043
Leave me alone.

777
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:46,774
Rami, is that you?

778
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:53,781
What's goin' on with you?

779
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:56,751
Where were you all night?

780
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:01,088
If you knew where I was...

781
01:12:04,025 --> 01:12:04,792
All good.

782
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,627
Just met some people.

783
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:07,728
Hmm.

784
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:28,709
Doctors failed
to save my mother.

785
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:31,913
At least if I fail at poetry,
nobody is goin' to die.

786
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:34,682
Why you're speaking to me
in English now?

787
01:13:34,782 --> 01:13:38,386
You're coming back home with me.

788
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:39,854
No. I'm not.

789
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:42,623
What did you dare say to me?

790
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:45,159
I'll be staying here
to study literature.

791
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:46,127
Literature.

792
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:49,730
This is your life ambition now?

793
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:52,066
To be a vagabond?

794
01:13:56,203 --> 01:14:00,207
I'd rather be a vagabond
than a coward like you.

795
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,183
Being a doctor was your dream,

796
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:13,621
except you were too afraid
of failure to pursue it.

797
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,957
And so,
you chose safety instead.

798
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:22,863
And when mom was dying,

799
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:25,199
it was left to me
to comfort her,

800
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:27,802
because you were too afraid
of your own emotions.

801
01:16:04,865 --> 01:16:07,902
Woo-hoo!

802
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:25,786
Yo, cuz. Presentable?

803
01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:28,656
You've got mail.

804
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:34,929
Getting high
after havin' been low.

805
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:38,065
Never too early to start,
you sly dog.

806
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:42,837
Thanks for letting me stay
in your room all that time.

807
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,040
Yeah, well you owe me big time.

808
01:16:49,043 --> 01:16:52,780
Listen, I um, need your help

809
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:56,684
with some lyrics.

810
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:00,454
Yeah, since you've been in
your whole nuclear anarchy mode,

811
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:01,822
you know what,

812
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:02,990
I'd like for you
to write me some

813
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,860
before you get
into any further trouble.

814
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,595
Really?

815
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:07,728
Yeah, really.

816
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:13,701
And uh, you can stay here
as long as you want.

817
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:16,770
Dad could use the company.

818
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,748
Dear son,

819
01:18:02,551 --> 01:18:05,085
in the journey of life,

820
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:08,557
find eternity in an instant.

821
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:23,170
Live in wonderment as an infant.

822
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:29,176
Allow your voice
to become your freedom

823
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:33,280
and your intuition your path
to wisdom.

824
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:40,788
In the presence of time,
surrender to nature.

825
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,824
Death and birth

826
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:46,427
cohabit in a cycle.

827
01:18:46,528 --> 01:18:49,797
This is not my goodbye,

828
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:52,132
just a farewell.

829
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:53,702
And even though

830
01:18:53,801 --> 01:18:57,706
one day we will be apart,

831
01:18:57,805 --> 01:19:02,109
always remember
to follow your heart.

832
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:06,981
I will forever love you.

833
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:54,295
Phoenix?

834
01:19:56,997 --> 01:19:58,465
Hey, you again.

835
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:02,202
My real name is Félix
by the way.

836
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:04,438
What happened to you?

837
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:06,440
What?

838
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:14,048
Uh. Yves St. Laurent. So what?

839
01:20:14,148 --> 01:20:16,785
Call me "petit-bourgeois"
and I'll kick your ass.

840
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:18,986
What do you want?
I'm late for work.

841
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,293
I'm having a reading tonight
at Quai des Brumes.

842
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,596
You comin'?

843
01:20:28,697 --> 01:20:31,231
Wow! Bohemian life.

844
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:36,403
Poverty, deviance, uncertainty.

845
01:20:36,504 --> 01:20:38,005
Freedom.

846
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:40,341
How extraordinary.

847
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:45,913
I gotta go to work.
Uh, break a leg.

848
01:21:49,844 --> 01:21:50,879
Ramy?

849
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:59,486
- You're early.
- We open in 20 minutes.

850
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:01,723
This is fine work.

851
01:22:01,823 --> 01:22:03,023
Thank you.

852
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:05,660
I was hoping you'd come.

853
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:09,631
Even without an invitation?

854
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:12,132
I'm sorry. I was mad.

855
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:15,002
Désirée,
I think I found the secret.

856
01:22:15,102 --> 01:22:16,704
What do you mean?

857
01:22:16,805 --> 01:22:18,205
I've discovered
that I'm not meant

858
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:20,307
to cure bodies with medicine,

859
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:24,111
but hopefully to heal souls
with my words.

860
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:29,383
Désirée,
I came here to thank you.

861
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:50,705
I'm so glad you came.

862
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,042
I would not miss this
for anything.

863
01:22:58,445 --> 01:23:02,149
After trying
to cling desperately

864
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:04,184
to some artificial sanity

865
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:06,487
imposed by
your own sense of dread,

866
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:10,424
you realize

867
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:13,193
that the only way
to stay sane and survive

868
01:23:14,896 --> 01:23:17,197
is to let go of that construct.

869
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,302
To fire the architect of fear,

870
01:23:23,972 --> 01:23:26,073
to stop building walls

871
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,141
that prevent you
from living life,

872
01:23:29,076 --> 01:23:30,310
however mad.

873
01:23:33,146 --> 01:23:36,116
To not fear angels or demons.

874
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,219
But instead,

875
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:41,388
to invite them both in for tea.

876
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:49,329
You might learn that the angel
is really a demon,

877
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:52,099
or that the demon
is really an angel.

878
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:57,572
Or maybe
that it doesn't really matter.

879
01:23:59,908 --> 01:24:01,609
'Cause it's the chaos,

880
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,379
the anarchy,

881
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:07,114
the disorder
that sometimes makes you feel

882
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,583
like you've lived,

883
01:24:10,618 --> 01:24:11,753
and that perhaps

884
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,659
you've loved.

885
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:24,464
I would like to dedicate this
to my muses.

886
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:31,706
Wooh!

887
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:35,577
It's my cousin.

888
01:24:35,677 --> 01:24:36,711
It's my-- it's my cousin.

889
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:37,946
It's my fucking cousin!

890
01:24:38,046 --> 01:24:39,781
It's my fucking cousin!

891
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:42,850
I'm so proud of you.

892
01:24:42,951 --> 01:24:44,484
Look at you! Look at you!

893
01:24:46,186 --> 01:24:47,321
Check it.

894
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:55,697
Hmm.
You know what else is awesome?

895
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:59,166
- Me.
From Doctor Feelgood,
with love.

896
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:01,769
Of course you're awesome.

897
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:03,705
Proud of you.

898
01:25:03,805 --> 01:25:05,372
You're fucking legend.

899
01:25:06,741 --> 01:25:07,675
Taught you well.

900
01:25:10,011 --> 01:25:10,945
Thank you.

901
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:19,186
From Doctor Feelgood, with love.

902
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:24,424
<i>You might learn that the angel</i>

01:25:40,775 --> 01:25:42,309
<i>and that perhaps</i>

911
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,112
<i>you've loved.</i>

912
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:53,220
Well,
it looks like you've got a fan.

913
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,592
You ready?

914
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,935
Your immaculate verses

915
01:26:08,036 --> 01:26:09,904
are as brave
as your poet's heart.

916
01:26:12,774 --> 01:26:13,708
Who?

917
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:18,012
Her. Her. This chick.

918
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,246
What you doing? Get up!

919
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:20,148
Go, go!

920
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,066
Excuse me.

921
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:40,768
Hey! Excuse me!

922
01:26:50,078 --> 01:26:51,278
Excuse me.

923
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,617
Sophia?

924
01:26:59,787 --> 01:27:01,055
Did you write this?

925
01:27:01,155 --> 01:27:04,391
Yes.
And I meant every word of it.

926
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:02,950
Along the dark span of time,

927
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,552
souls come and go,

928
01:28:04,652 --> 01:28:06,087
appearing from nothing,

929
01:28:06,187 --> 01:28:09,456
sharing tears, sharing laughter,

930
01:28:09,557 --> 01:28:12,126
then vanish again into nothing.

931
01:28:12,226 --> 01:28:14,862
But a thread of light
holds us together,

932
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:18,365
Binds our souls across
the delicate void of cosmos,

933
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:21,368
constructing a memory
that shall never die,

934
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:24,605
but will always live
in our heart forever.

935
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:36,449
You've given me life,

936
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:37,685
and have freed my being.

937
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:46,828
For all eternity,
I'm forever grateful.

938
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,570
Here I am,
standing humbly before you

939
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:32,073
with bursting love,

940
01:29:34,008 --> 01:29:34,976
a new being.
