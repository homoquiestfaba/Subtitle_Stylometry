1
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:03,674
I think what's special about this show

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:05,609
is that it's not about the occupation.

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:06,543
You run.

4
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:07,645
It's about the revolution.

5
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:10,347
The escape from slavery.

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,390
The journey to freedom.

7
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:16,587
It's so riveting just because

8
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:18,647
this is real, this really happened.

9
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,224
And none of us today can imagine this.

10
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:24,527
The struggle over
anti-slavery became by the 1830s

11
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,930
a war for the soul of America.

12
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:29,032
Hundreds of thousands of people said,

13
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:32,369
"It's worth putting my life on the line."

14
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:36,739
"Than to get up another day"

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,222
"and be treated like this."

16
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,927
People did challenge a system

17
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,295
even when it seemed like the system

18
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:46,932
could never be abolished.

19
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,466
But I know that there's this freedom.

20
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,968
The Underground Railroad

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,604
was the greatest movement
of civil disobedience

22
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:54,138
in the United States.

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,241
Just seeing our ancestors
rising up, fighting back.

24
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,210
Welcome to the underground.

25
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,711
What a drama.

26
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:01,612
What a story to tell.

27
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:03,725
Run!

28
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,550
The Underground Railroad has a lasting

29
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:22,021
and continuing importance for Americans.

30
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,857
Not just because it's a
piece of American History

31
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,691
that was largely forgotten,

32
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:30,662
but it was also the first
interracial political movement

33
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,697
in American history, the first.

34
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:35,867
Thousands and thousands
of Americans broke the law

35
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,337
to assist fugitive
slaves toward freedom.

36
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:40,972
You go in a slave, but you come out

37
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:43,041
the other side a free man.

38
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:45,443
I was so compelled by the idea.

39
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:49,080
It's such a story that is inspiring,

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,950
is exciting, full of
intrigue, full of danger.

41
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:58,623
What surprised me most
is how we've been able

42
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,924
to keep this period of history

43
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,494
trapped in a few pages
of our history books.

44
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,763
As we started doing
research it was amazing

45
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,532
how much we learned, how
much there was to it,

46
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,067
how much bravery there
was to the act of running,

47
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,402
how much bravery there was to the act

48
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:13,003
of helping people run.

49
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:19,538
The Underground Railroad
was a series of networks

50
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:23,681
of people committed to
the abolition of slavery

51
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:26,650
and to freeing people who were enslaved.

52
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:31,188
It was then in Philadelphia
in the very late 1790s

53
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,724
that we first see an
organized group of people

54
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:37,860
working with free African Americans

55
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:42,083
to help move enslaved
people out of slavery.

56
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,935
I'm sure you heard rumors of
quilts, codes, organized runs.

57
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:50,539
There's no one way that
all slaves got north.

58
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,709
Some people started in Maryland

59
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,284
and would end up in New York.

60
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:56,245
Some people would start in Georgia

61
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:59,115
and you might have gone
south to Spanish Florida

62
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,950
or west to French Louisiana.

63
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,885
Think of the Underground
Railroad as something

64
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,286
like today's Internet.

65
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:07,256
It moves in all kinds of
directions simultaneous.

66
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,325
The reason I'm helping
is because she knows what her station is

67
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:10,559
on the other side of that river.

68
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:13,329
It grew out of social necessity.

69
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:19,134
A commitment that slavery is
as unjust a human practice

70
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:22,670
as the human mind can possibly imagine.

71
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,339
That's as much as we been doing,

72
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,841
we're a man down.

73
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,843
Many people know about
the Underground Railroad,

74
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,411
but what we don't understand
is the actual people

75
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,881
who were involved on all sides,

76
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,985
including African Americans
and white Americans.

77
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:37,752
But we have a pressing need for the help

78
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:39,120
you all involved with.

79
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,256
You can see in the Underground Railroad

80
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:46,093
bravery, boldness and maybe
more importantly collaboration

81
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:49,096
between black and white Americans

82
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:53,701
working to bring the
promise of America to those

83
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:57,838
who were most harshily, even
most savagely denied it.

84
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,941
And I think I've seen
plenty of kind of narratives

85
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:03,978
where enslaved individuals
are the victims.

86
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,513
And I think everyone was
hungry to see the heroes

87
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,415
in these people who did what I think,

88
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,484
might be arguably the
bravest thing someone can do.

89
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,019
What you waiting on, get in?!

90
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,656
You know because the show focuses on

91
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:19,025
the Underground Railroad,
truth is stranger than fiction.

92
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:24,126
And inherently danger
was at every corner.

93
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,768
And I think it's inspiring
to see men and women

94
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,172
triumph over such tragic situations.

95
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:35,341
And while it's historically important

96
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,144
it also makes for
really good television.

97
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,013
We've seen sort of the slave narrative

98
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:43,349
on television before, but
never the rebellion against it.

99
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,484
And never in a sense of sort of like

100
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,985
what it looked like to try to escape

101
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,555
and how those people
felt and how that looked.

102
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,424
Anthony Hemingway, who's a dear friend

103
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:53,793
and a wonderful, wonderful director

104
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,128
made these bold choices, camera choices

105
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,165
to just run through the halls
in the house with Rosalee.

106
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,434
The pace and the
energy it just feels like

107
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,837
everything is constantly on the move.

108
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,906
Everybody's running and
it's so high energy.

109
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,109
It's bold, it's aggressive,
it's in your face.

110
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,447
And I've never seen this
time period told like this.

111
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,651
It was fun to really
kind of give this period,

112
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,754
or these stories that
we've heard many times,

113
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,955
a new entry point.

114
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,323
And I think, you know,
in the way we wanted

115
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,726
to tell the story we wanted to do it

116
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,227
kind of in a modern day feel.

117
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,797
We both come from genre,
we both love comic books.

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,233
So we saw these people as superheroes,

119
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,834
the first American superheroes.

120
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,435
We make it so once we getting off,

121
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,671
ain't nobody have no
cause to bring us back.

122
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,106
It's really such a dangerous time,

123
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,676
an adventurous time and
you have real heroes.

124
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,945
You know you have the stuff of champions

125
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,180
in these people who are risking it all,

126
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,915
literally risking it all.

127
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,769
I want to be counted.

128
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,687
It's our hands that built this country.

129
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,322
It's our blood that's running
through the heart of it.

130
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,502
Now who got the key to the cell?

131
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:22,135
Here in America slavery begins when

132
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:27,163
tobacco becomes a cash crop
in the colony of Virginia

133
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:31,245
and there is this need for cheap labor.

134
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,981
There is a case in which, in Virginia,

135
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,670
three indentured servants
escape into Maryland,

136
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,586
two white, one black.

137
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:41,155
When they're arrested and
brought back to Virginia,

138
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:45,025
the two whites have their
indentured servitude extended.

139
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,895
The black indentured
servant has his servitude

140
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:51,165
extended for the rest
of his natural life.

141
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,633
This is where we begin to see

142
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:55,569
racial slavery take hold.

143
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:59,138
And the popularity of enslaving Africans

144
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,542
becomes a very, very big business.

145
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:03,476
And James?

146
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,812
James, Stein, all the slaves.

147
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,814
They're gonna be your
property, just like this horse.

148
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,883
The institution
spreads into the Deep South

149
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:14,587
with other kinds of cash
crops coming onto the scene

150
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,022
such as cotton.

151
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:19,391
When cotton is introduced
cotton becomes a major

152
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:21,694
economic engine for the south.

153
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:24,630
But not just for the south
who has to process the cotton?

154
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,398
Well the cotton gets
processed in the north.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,802
New York benefits from
this, banks are benefiting,

156
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:32,238
insurance companies are benefiting.

157
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,139
Our economics are strongly rooted

158
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,408
to this industrial complex.

159
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,511
There's a lot of times
you'll read something

160
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:40,679
or someone says, "You know what slavery"

161
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,382
"wasn't that bad, people
had certain things"

162
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,650
"and certain comforts."

163
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:46,418
That's kind of a bunch of bologna.

164
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,886
So we wanted to make
sure we were telling

165
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,988
the brutality and the horrible world

166
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
that people were running away from.

167
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:55,927
Imagine being out in
a hot field with a hoe

168
00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:00,132
working a row that
seemed to have no end.

169
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:04,669
Imagine having somebody
standing near you with a whip

170
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:08,172
and yelling at you all day long.

171
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:09,974
Come down here, tell
me how it's gonna be!

172
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,208
No sir!

173
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,978
Imagine being on an auction block having

174
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,458
no power over your person.

175
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,735
You own nothing about yourself.

176
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:22,787
You do not own your thoughts.

177
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:25,455
You don't even own your tears.

178
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:29,860
Any dreams that you have
belong now to somebody else.

179
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,595
You own nothing.

180
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:38,234
And you have to think
of slavery as a panorama

181
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:41,951
of unending and pretty
much hopeless exploitation.

182
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:47,010
If there's any episode
of Underground that I feel

183
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:50,113
really, really
encapsulated the tenderness

184
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,416
and the uniqueness that the
show brought to its perspective

185
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,784
was the episode in which
they took a look at slavery

186
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,752
from the perspective of children.

187
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,488
They don't actually already
comprehend this as being

188
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,858
a necessary part of the way life is

189
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,294
or just the way things are going to be.

190
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:07,430
And so in that you see the
power of hope and love.

191
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:08,998
Hey, James.

192
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:10,845
Hey.

193
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,569
It's hard to even talk about now.

194
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:15,371
And yet we do have to talk about it

195
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,406
in order to move beyond it.

196
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,474
Okay, okay, we got the plan.

197
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,809
No, we got to run, now.

198
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,449
When you choose to self-emancipate

199
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,452
you're taking a tremendous risk.

200
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,055
Nobody knew
what was in store for him.

201
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,489
You don't know what's out there.

202
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,560
What am I going to eat?

203
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,028
How am I going to eat?

204
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,264
What can I find on my journey?

205
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,065
What can I dig up from the ground?

206
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,867
Fugitives had no maps.

207
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:48,069
There were practically no road signs.

208
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,704
You're following little country lanes

209
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:52,707
that are maybe a labyrinth,
it's quite difficult.

210
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,243
Now hiding, how do I hide?

211
00:09:55,245 --> 00:10:00,081
How do I hide myself so as
always to be out of reach

212
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,384
of the slave catchers and the dogs.

213
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,998
And every
town you have to remember

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,768
had a force of patrollers whose sole job

215
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,670
was to capture fugitive slaves,

216
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:27,171
throw them in jail, restore
them to their masters.

217
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,209
Those are the dangers.

218
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,608
And even if you find someone

219
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,114
who seems nice, how can
you truly trust them

220
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,977
because they are a stranger?

221
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:39,452
They don't look like you
and you are scared to death.

222
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:43,356
A friend of Rosalee's.

223
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,491
You're leaving behind perhaps

224
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:49,094
a mother, a father, a
brother, a sister, a wife.

225
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:52,231
Or if you're a woman a
husband or your own children.

226
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:55,301
And all of these are
real world examples.

227
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:58,571
By and large you're never
gonna see them again.

228
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:02,971
This thing is so full
of anxiety and even fear

229
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:08,147
that it only can be
explained in terms of people

230
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,558
with so much intestinal
fortitude and daring and courage

231
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:17,056
as to almost boggle the mind.

232
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:19,615
I ain't getting no
strikes on my back for this.

233
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,481
We can look with our
modern lens and go, "Run."

234
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,830
"Why didn't everyone run?"

235
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,998
"Why didn't they just get on
the Underground Railroad?"

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,868
It was a very difficult
thing to do and I think

237
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,537
that to me was something
we wanted to definitely

238
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,006
show too was how brave
and how hard it was

239
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,343
to break from a system that
we've all been a part of.

240
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,749
You've gotta keep fighting.

241
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,551
You got to get the others to freedom!

242
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,887
It is high risk to escape.

243
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,991
It is an even higher risk to return.

244
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:56,159
The risks were colossal, were colossal.

245
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:59,396
You had no defense, no protection.

246
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:02,065
The Underground Railroad
could assist you back

247
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:06,036
into the south sometimes in some places.

248
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:08,171
But it couldn't guarantee your safety.

249
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:11,023
Danger was at every corner.

250
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,676
When we look at the end of season one

251
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:17,247
and we see Rosalee now
training to go back.

252
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,816
She's motivated.

253
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:21,218
I'm going back.

254
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,254
There was some people she left.

255
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,123
Harriet Tubman famously did that

256
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,224
by bringing out dozens of people.

257
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,627
I thought it was incredibly unique that

258
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,662
they would have an entire season

259
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:35,832
of the Underground Railroad
with little to no mention

260
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,668
until the last episode
of Harriet Tubman.

261
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:44,302
They said he
was looking to steal slaves?

262
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:46,875
Can't steal something
that ain't property

263
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:48,444
in the first place.

264
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,741
Well I aim to teach you how.

265
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:54,950
Name's Harriet.

266
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:01,908
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

267
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,171
The Lord sent you to me

268
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,007
to get your family back.

269
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,408
You ain't gonna be able to do that you,

270
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,910
you dead or in chains.

271
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:12,846
Harriet Tubman captures
people's imaginations

272
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,749
because she's not who you would think

273
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:19,620
would be the person to
lead people to freedom.

274
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:22,390
How's a petite five foot, two woman

275
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:25,026
navigate the swamps of Eastern Maryland

276
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,594
to Canada over ten times?

277
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,596
And yes she is our superhero,

278
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,798
but she is born of the same

279
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,234
stock that we all are,
she's flesh and blood.

280
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:37,070
Which was a beautiful
thing about Harriet Tubman's

281
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:40,745
decision to go back knowing that

282
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:44,244
the problem doesn't stop
just because she's free.

283
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,161
She's a great champion.

284
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,182
She helped to free people to see

285
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:52,721
a broader view of themselves.

286
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:55,988
Focus on what you got to do now.

287
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,757
In the way in which people

288
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,626
can live in the world beyond race.

289
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:01,861
Where you hiding them?

290
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,429
I know a runaway was brought here.

291
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:06,632
There were so many other
players in the movement.

292
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,134
Even before Harriet you
know the William Stills

293
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:12,237
who Harriet depended
on for a lot of help.

294
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,072
Mr.?

295
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:14,974
Still, William Still.

296
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,610
I've heard of you,

297
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:19,911
about what you do.

298
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:23,048
William Still, we call him the father

299
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,016
of the Underground Railroad and

300
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:26,251
many other things.

301
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:29,654
William Still had the
foresight to realize

302
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:33,892
that these stories of the
people who are leaving slavery

303
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:37,428
are important and it's
important to record them.

304
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,430
Why?

305
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,736
Because if we don't remember
our own stories, who will?

306
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:47,606
In modern day we would call
him an oral historian.

307
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,608
Because he scribed these stories
and he kept these stories

308
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,609
and he didn't just hide them.

309
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,478
He would then go on to publish them.

310
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,346
So that the world would know.

311
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:57,915
And that it's part of
the public discourse,

312
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,917
so we can't deny the
existence of slavery,

313
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,355
we can't deny the existence
of this subversive movement

314
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:06,757
because the records are there.

315
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,593
Freedom is about so
much more than getting out

316
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:13,330
of a so called slave state
into a so called free state.

317
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:17,640
It's about finding that
state of grace in life

318
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:21,105
where you can be self determining.

319
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:24,674
There is a quality to the
experience of freedom.

320
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:28,645
And if you think that
you can enjoy freedom

321
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,713
in some solitary,

322
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:32,352
isolated,

323
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:35,452
individualistic way you can't.

324
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:37,621
This is not a job for everyone.

325
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:40,257
Something we press on in this series,

326
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:41,991
no one's free until everybody's free.

327
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:44,894
You have to abolish the entire system

328
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,429
that keeps anybody from freedom.

329
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:49,713
I think it takes so much to

330
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:52,434
hand over your life
to a cause like that.

331
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:54,637
Harriet Tubman is just one aspect.

332
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,407
But you have so many
amazing human beings

333
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,709
that were moving, as well.

334
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,514
Every single aspect of running
away is an act of bravery.

335
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,950
And the more we kind of learned
who these individuals were

336
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:11,420
who were running, the kind of more

337
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:13,021
it opened up a different story for us.

338
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,791
I won't leave him behind.

339
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:18,293
This story that Misha
and Joe have created

340
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:20,696
has a remarkable way of
telling you the stories

341
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,331
of the people in that terrible system.

342
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,833
And it tells you their stories in a way

343
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:28,136
that you become inspired and
amazed with their courage.

344
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:30,005
And that's very, very exciting.

345
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,607
Because it takes it out of the museum

346
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,108
and it brings it at home.

347
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,578
I think it's about time
you teach me that song.

348
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,646
Noah himself is a natural born leader

349
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:39,880
and a natural born rebel.

350
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,749
So in the first season we see where

351
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,751
that ambition sort of culminates

352
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,987
recruiting this team for
their specific skills.

353
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,488
Everybody making this journey.

354
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,257
I ain't been more
than two steps out this

355
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,093
plantation in my life.

356
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,596
Can't even imagine what
being free would be like.

357
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,064
And I feel like

358
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:01,014
Rosalee introduced romance to him.

359
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,239
He may have liked girls
before but this is, I think,

360
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:08,208
the first time he's really
found a kindred spirit.

361
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,909
That's why he asks her to run with him.

362
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,978
"So now he's like,"

363
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,581
"I love this girl, you
know she can hang."

364
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,816
We were all
tremendously excited when they

365
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,885
finally got together.

366
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,366
They end up uniting
which is a beautiful thing.

367
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:37,637
I think which is one of
the necessary resolutions

368
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,757
for this huge problem.

369
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,409
Freedom, it got to mean more than that,

370
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,416
it got to be more than that.

371
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:49,214
Ain't none of us free 'til we all free.

372
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,317
Rosalee's on this journey

373
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,619
where she's realizing
her inner strength.

374
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,900
Does Noah stay along for the ride?

375
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:03,796
Does she become more independent?

376
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,799
There's something churning
inside of her that tells her

377
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,034
this is no kind of life.

378
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,311
And Noah.

379
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,537
I've paid a
heavy price for this freedom

380
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,206
and that burden is weighing heavy on me,

381
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,008
that guilt is weighing heavy on me.

382
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,744
Noah the one that
brought us to freedom's song,

383
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:20,978
brought us all together.

384
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,549
Knowing that my family, people I love

385
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,717
are still in bondage.

386
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,919
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, all right.

387
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,854
The relationship between Ernestine

388
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,889
and the man who purports to own her

389
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,657
is utterly fascinating.

390
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,226
We can be free.

391
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,728
Now who owns who in any moment

392
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,397
of their personal encounter?

393
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,800
Who's putting on the mask at any moment

394
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:47,571
in order to fulfill some
socially expected role?

395
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,641
Miss Ernestine is
unapologetically strong.

396
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,736
And she stands in her truth.

397
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,579
There's a poise that she has

398
00:18:55,581 --> 00:19:00,528
in the midst of this horrific situation.

399
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,987
One of the characters
that I'm excited about

400
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,057
and want to see more about is Cato.

401
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,692
He makes us question, what would we do

402
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:13,196
in a situation when everything
was taken away from us?

403
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:14,965
When he burned half his face off

404
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,632
to get rid of them marks.

405
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,000
What would you do?

406
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:20,570
That darkness makes us uncomfortable.

407
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:24,006
But I think he's a perfect
representation of humanity.

408
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,542
No one is all good or evil.

409
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,344
You know everyone has flaws.

410
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:32,114
Everyone has deep seated
thoughts that they're not,

411
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,382
some of them are acting on them,

412
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,649
some of them are not.

413
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,252
There's somebody out
there you care about.

414
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:37,286
Just holding onto to the hope you gonna

415
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:39,021
see them again soon.

416
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:41,857
You see the world in the characters

417
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,995
that Misha and Joe
created and you kind of

418
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,930
invest in them in such a personal way.

419
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,165
Rosalee, run!

420
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,502
The beauty of Underground
is that it makes

421
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,470
this period compelling.

422
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,840
It's historical fiction and
it has to be fantastical,

423
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:00,045
it has to be

424
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,210
outrageous at times.

425
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,745
Because that's what keeps us involved.

426
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:05,380
But the beauty of it is that it's rooted

427
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:09,183
in so many different facts
that it makes the viewer

428
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,152
want to learn more.

429
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:12,853
And realize, "Wow, I didn't know that."

430
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,390
"I didn't know that people
imitated Henry Ross Brown."

431
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,292
"So what more don't I
know about slavery?"

432
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,593
I think that a show like Underground

433
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,062
allows us a perspective to see

434
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:24,131
that the America that we are

435
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,599
came from somewhere.

436
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,668
These men and women, they lived.

437
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,603
They lived extraordinary lives.

438
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:33,131
If they could do it in 1857,

439
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,709
well we have absolutely no excuse.

440
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,611
I really hope that audiences
take away from season two

441
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,405
a sense of strength,

442
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,684
continue to dive into themselves

443
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:45,953
and see their own self worth.

444
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,620
I ain't running no more.

445
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,123
I would urge viewers to watch

446
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,625
and take away the desire to dialog,

447
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,627
the desire to read about this history,

448
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,029
the desire to write even more about it.

449
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:58,631
I think one thing that you need

450
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,333
to know about Underground is

451
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,401
this is a part of your life.

452
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:04,203
If you want to know the
world that you live in

453
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:07,841
if you want to understand
the America of 2016, of 2017,

454
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:11,243
Underground looking at
the life of seven people

455
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:14,580
and those around them in
this great historical epic

456
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,082
of the Underground Railroad,

457
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,318
allows us a sense of what
happened to our America,

458
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,087
where our America came from.

459
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:23,518
And maybe some indications
of where it might go.

460
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,860
Just 'cause you got to play dumb

461
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,028
don't you ever

462
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,999
ever let them make you
think you really is.

463
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,101
We had an amazing
reaction to season one.

464
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,469
I think people were rightfully intrigued

465
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,338
by the idea of the show.

466
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,741
It was almost as if they needed it.

467
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,876
As if it was missing in their life.

468
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,544
And I've been getting so many tweets

469
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,880
and comments from people
all around the world saying,

470
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,249
"We can't wait for season two."

471
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,518
People are actually engaged in a way.

472
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,486
And it's inspiring.

473
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,922
It tells all the artists that are here,

474
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,624
it tells us that we're
doing something important.

475
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,925
That side of our revolution.

476
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,106
I'm excited for season two about

477
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,930
everything.

478
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,901
Misha Green and Joe Pokaski

479
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,139
have really come together and
put on such a creative season.

480
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,241
They took us to a
completely different place.

481
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:26,776
And I think the audience is gonna be

482
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,051
really blown away by

483
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,714
the possibilities.

484
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,948
You think you know
someone, you think you know

485
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,917
a character and then they surprise you

486
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,053
for better or for worse.

487
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,857
Last season everybody thought that was

488
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,391
you know,

489
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:44,393
as big as we can get.

490
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:46,884
Granted it was a fantastic season.

491
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,566
But if that shocked you

492
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,235
then you ain't ready
for the second season.

493
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,870
I'm telling you.

494
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,404
You ain't ready.

495
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,207
The stakes are just
so much higher in season two.

496
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,875
I don't know I think we
just turned it up to 11

497
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,711
and I think you're gonna be surprised at

498
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,380
who shows up and what they do.

499
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:09,618
The Lord sent you to me

500
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,387
to get your family back.

501
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,155
To be the most notorious slave catcher,

502
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,323
one would think you have caught

503
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,826
the most notorious
runaway, Harriet Tubman.

504
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,428
Ain't nobody scared of you.

505
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,668
We just need to be ready
when my friends arrive.

506
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:29,637
The plan has changed.
