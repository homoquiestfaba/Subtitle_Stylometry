1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
<i>It's all about fire.</i>

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>In my eleven years
as an arson investigator...</i>

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
<i>I've come to understand this.</i>

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
The young and old,
we all love to watch things burn.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,560
It's mesmerizing. It's hypnotic.
It's even magical.

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,960
But, for the arsonist,
the magic becomes an obsession.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Grandma?

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Grandma?

9
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>Grandma? Where are you?</i>

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
Kenny, where are you?
Kenny, don't move.

11
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,120
- Grandma?
<i>- Kenny, stay where you are.</i>

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,960
<i>I'll find you.</i>

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
- Grandma?
- Kenny?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,880
- Kenny?
- Grandma?

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,680
Grandma?

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Grandma?

17
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Going to be here awhile, Junior.

18
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
Who was the first company here?

19
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,640
Truck fifty-two made entry.

20
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,320
They did the search and rescue?

21
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah, their inside man
was the first one in.

22
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Alright, let me think this through.

23
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,160
How many rescues were there affected?

24
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,280
<i>Over twenty people.
All out of the west side.</i>

25
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
East entry would have been pointless.

26
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
<i>Yeah, but I don't get it.
The fire exit is on that side.</i>

27
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,520
<i>Why didn't they make it?</i>

28
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Inhaling the smoke
short-circuits the brain.

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Made them go around in circles.

30
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
<i>Just a couple more feet, they
would've been right out the door.</i>

31
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,200
- How many fatalities?
<i>- We got four confirmed dead.</i>

32
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
<i>The incident commander said
an employee, a shopper...</i>

33
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>an older woman, and...</i>

34
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,560
- A child.
<i>- Yeah, we got a little kid.</i>

35
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,320
Professor?

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,360
Professor? Let me ask you something.

37
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,680
Turn on your video camera, Junior.

38
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,720
I want a record of this guy's work.

39
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,560
Yeah, but you know, the chief thinks
it started in the electrical system.

40
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,400
- It was arson.
- What? You think the chief's wrong?

41
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,280
- Absolutely.
- Okay, if you say so.

42
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
<i>No, not me. Just the bodies.
Come here.</i>

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
You see, it was so hot
he couldn't open his eyes.

44
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,680
- My God.
- Pry the mouth open.

45
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,960
- What?
- Open his mouth.

46
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,000
- Pull the tongue forward, come on.
- No, man. Are you serious?

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,560
You want to learn this?
Come on, it's okay.

48
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,320
There's always a first time.
Come on.

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
Going to be okay.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Open his mouth.

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,560
- Pull the tongue out.
- Jesus.

52
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,080
Note the erythema
at the back of the throat.

53
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,480
The throat is swollen
shut by the heat.

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
They suffocated as they were burning.

55
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,880
- God, man.
- You all right? You okay?

56
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
- Do you ever get used to this?
- No.

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Not when it's a kid.

59
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,480
- It's horrible.
- Hey, Lieutenant Hines.

60
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Geez, here we go.

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay, gentlemen,
we'll take it from here.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,560
We're not done yet.

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
There are dead bodies, which means
now this is our circumstance.

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,680
- John, please, don't argue with me.
- I'm not arguing with you.

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
But you can't destroy
the crime scene.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,720
Crime scene? What crime scene?

67
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
My investigators told me
this was an electrical fire.

68
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,960
Your investigators are wrong.

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,360
This is arson, and I have
to establish the point of origin.

70
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,920
I don't care what you have,
or haven't established.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,080
I have to recover bodies.

72
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,440
I would listen to the man,
if I were you, Lieutenant.

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,480
I wasn't talking to you, Kid.
And turn that damn camera off.

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Knock it off, Tom.

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
What the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,920
This fire isn't even
in your jurisdiction.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,880
- Now get out of my way.
- Hey...

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,480
Stop, now let's all calm down.
John is right.

79
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,280
Now, if you guys come romping
through here...

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
how's he going to gather
any evidence?

81
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
What evidence?
This was an electrical fire.

82
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,320
- You said so yourself.
- This was arson.

83
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm not the expert. John is.

84
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
And if he says it's arson,
then it's arson.

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,600
<i>Some wildfires still are burning
in Southern California tonight...</i>

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>after destroying
more than five hundred homes.</i>

87
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>Three fires spread today
through Carbon Canyon...</i>

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
<i>Glendale and Santa Barbara.</i>

89
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>They were probably set by arson.</i>

90
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,480
<i>All together,
thirty-five hundred acres.</i>

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
<i>Nearly four hundred houses
and businesses were incinerated.</i>

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,040
<i>After touring the site,
the governor declared...</i>

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
<i>a state of emergency.</i>

94
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
<i>And a 250.000 dollar reward
for information...</i>

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,360
<i>leading to the arrest
of the alleged arsonist.</i>

96
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
<i>The fire quickly spread
through the brush...</i>

97
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,960
<i>as helicopters dropped
flame-retardant chemicals.</i>

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,440
<i>This is the third devastating fire
in this area in the past two years.</i>

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
<i>Arson is suspected in two more fires
in California.</i>

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,520
<i>One in Orange County,
and this one in Glendale...</i>

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
<i>that destroyed over forty homes.</i>

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Canvas the ridge. Over there.

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,920
- Hey, Professor, I got it.
- Witnesses up here.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
I'll set up the perimeter.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm sorry. Now look,
this is a total disaster.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,520
Everything about the location.
It's just one big mess.

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,840
- It's a goddamned nightmare.
- I'd walk away from it right now.

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
- What?
- Think about it.

109
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Malibu mansion.
Sounds good, right?

110
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
- What the hell you talking about?
- Fires.

111
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,240
Your wife is going love you
for a very long time.

112
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,360
- Think, ocean view...
- Jesus, man.

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Sell real estate on your own time,
Hollywood Mike.

114
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,960
Darcy? I can't,
you're breaking up.

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,760
God damned cell phones.

116
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,880
Yeah, well, divorce ain't cheap.
You don't need a place, do you?

117
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,360
No, I need a woman.

118
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,840
- So what's going on?
- We've established...

119
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
the point of origin.
Professor found a device.

120
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
Already? You're shitting me.

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,480
<i>Hey, big John.
What did you find?</i>

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
<i>Look at this.</i>

123
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,480
It's been rigged
to keep the flame burning.

124
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,520
Plungers jammed down here with wire.

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,840
Yep, found one exactly like that
a month ago.

126
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
Brush fire Griffith Park.

127
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,160
Yeah, well, he's graduated
to torching neighborhoods now.

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,400
- Good work, John.
- Got it, Chief.

129
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,840
Hey, John, I found a witness.

130
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,320
Come on, Junior!

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah, something like that.

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,400
In fact, it's really very good.
You're quite the artist.

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
And you say you never saw him before
in the neighborhood?

134
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
No and I know everybody
on the block.

135
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Right.

136
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,560
I saw him sniffing around
the Pierson's place.

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,960
Gave these big parties,
it was just...

138
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,720
Excuse me, Mrs. Fin. Let's get back
to when you first saw him.

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,000
- Okay?
- Okay...

140
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,320
I had just made myself a lemonade.

141
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,640
Let me think...

142
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
That's it.
Just picture it in your mind.

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah, it was a nice day,
and I saw this strange car...

144
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,360
out in front of the Pierson's.

145
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,160
It was an old, beat-up station wagon.

146
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,720
And I watched it for a minute,
and then this guy got out.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Now tell me again.
What did he look like?

148
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,800
He was tall. Had floppy red hair.

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,120
Good-looking kind of guy, you know.

150
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Now think real hard
for a minute here, okay?

151
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,040
Maybe his hair
could've been reddish brown?

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,960
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah, maybe.

153
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
It wasn't that long either.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,520
Mrs. Fin, the guy
that we're looking for...

155
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,480
From what we've gathered
from other witnesses...

156
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,360
his hair was darker.
Almost black.

157
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,160
Darker? Yeah...

158
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
- Yeah.
- It could have been darker.

159
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Do you remember
what he was wearing?

160
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,760
Did he have a chain around his wrist?

161
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Maybe a blazer? A tie?
Blue tie maybe?

162
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,960
Yeah, you know now that I think
about it, you're absolutely right.

163
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,560
You are absolutely right.

164
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,040
He did have darker hair,
and he was wearing a suit.

165
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
A jacket. And a tie too.

166
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
And I remember a gold bracelet
around his wrist.

167
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,840
- You sure he was tall?
- No.

168
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,120
No, he was a thin, little, wiry kind
of a guy with curly, dark hair.

169
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,280
And he had dark, little, beady eyes.

170
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,400
Mrs. Fin?

171
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,200
You're an asset to your community.

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,800
- That was very interesting.
- Yeah, I'll say.

173
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
You want me to carry that, Lynette?

174
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
I can't believe
you were describing me.

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Actually, I was describing someone
far better looking.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,680
Yeah, well, I'm sitting
right in front of her, you know.

177
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,960
She was telling us
what we wanted to hear.

178
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,400
- Remember what I taught you.
- Always test the witness.

179
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
- I got it.
- Here. Come on.

180
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,440
Let me get the door for you.
Here you go.

181
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Professor, what are you going
to give the press, huh?

182
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,760
I'll give them what they want.
The truth.

183
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,600
<i>At a press conference in Glendale,
Captain John Orr announced...</i>

184
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,640
<i>he will lead an investigation
into the College Hills fire.</i>

185
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,320
<i>Forty-six homes have been lost.</i>

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,520
<i>Another twenty are severely damaged.</i>

187
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,280
<i>The scale of this destruction
is truly massive.</i>

188
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,760
<i>Are you thinking arson, Captain?</i>

189
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,520
<i>Yes, that's definitely something
that we have to consider.</i>

190
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
That's my John. Always the star.

191
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
Daddy, you're on the news!

192
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,800
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Hey, Hon.

193
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,400
- Look at that.
- Look at you.

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
- So, movie star, are you hungry?
- Yeah. I'm starving.

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,680
Hi, Carrie.

196
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,680
Carrie's not talking to me, huh?

197
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,320
You won't let her go to the movies
with Marty on Friday night.

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,360
All my other friends can date
when they're fifteen.

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
Why do I have to wait
until I'm sixteen?

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,080
- My mom said it was okay.
- I don't care what your mother says.

201
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,560
Okay, we've been through this
how many times?

202
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,320
The rules are the rules.
All right, you got two months to go.

203
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
I think you can wait two months,
can't you?

204
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,920
Come on, please. Be nice to me.
I had a tough day.

205
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,600
Tell Marty you're going
to call him back.

206
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
How do you know it's Marty?

207
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Because he always calls at this time.

208
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
Please, just tell him, you're going
to call him back, and sit down.

209
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,880
I want to have some family time.
Please.

210
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,360
Hello! Hey, Marty.

211
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Come here, you. How are you?

212
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,240
- Okay.
- So what did you think?

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,200
- Did I make sense?
- Yeah. You sounded really cool.

214
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,480
I did? Thanks.

215
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,000
What's a serial arsonist?

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,240
Someone who likes
their cereal very hot.

217
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,200
But you know what?
It's time for bed.

218
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,360
Come here. I love you.

219
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Did you do your homework?

220
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,440
- Yes, Daddy.
- You did? All right.

221
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,640
I'll be in to tuck you in, okay?

222
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,640
- Okay.
- I'll be up.

223
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,120
Good night.

224
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
You know, these fires
feel like they're getting closer.

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,960
College Hills is right
around the corner.

226
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Two families from the girl's school
are actually moving out.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,400
Really?

228
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,760
The DA started a task force.
He's even bringing in a Fed.

229
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
- That's good.
- No, it's not.

230
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
I don't need any help from the ATF.

231
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
So you're not going to be
on the task force?

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,760
No. The ATF is a bunch of bureaucrats
disguised as bomb experts.

233
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,880
- I'm better alone.
- Okay.

234
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,440
And besides,
I'll be swamped with College Hills.

235
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,440
Marty said he saw you on the news.

236
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,160
He called to make sure
we were watching it.

237
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Really?

238
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
- Aren't you glad you took the call?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,840
He said you should
get a make-up artist.

240
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
What?

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
Who will make you look like
less of a creep.

242
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Very nice.

243
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Like mother, like daughter.

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,320
Hey, you.

245
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,760
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

246
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,520
Wait. Just wait. One, two.

247
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
What's up?

248
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,040
You know, sooner or later,
Carrie will go out with boys.

249
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,920
- You'll have to get used to it.
- I know...

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,480
I would just rather it be later
than sooner, that's all.

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
Don't stay up too late, okay?

252
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
Yeah, I just have to finish up
these reports.

253
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
- You promise?
- Yeah.

254
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,520
You could have that
instead of doing paperwork.

255
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
I know.

256
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,720
Hey, how's it going?

257
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
- Hey, Keith.
- Yeah?

258
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,520
Whatever happened to,
what's her name?

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
What's her name?

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
- Who you talking about?
- Abbey...

261
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,400
- You're talking about Ambria.
- Ambria, yeah.

262
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,040
Ambria, yeah, nothing.
Forget it. It went bad.

263
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,600
Why? What happened?
She was so nice.

264
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah, she was real nice.
Real nice until she blew me off.

265
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
- She blew you off?
- Hell, yeah.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,040
- What happened? What did you do?
- I don't know.

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,840
She says to me
that things got weird...

268
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,320
because we saw each other
at work everyday.

269
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
And then they put her
on the task force, and forget it...

270
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,440
then it was that was over.
That killed it.

271
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,000
Why? I mean, so what?
What's the big deal?

272
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,960
What's the big deal?
What? You don't know?

273
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,160
Know what?

274
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,520
- Wait.
- Watch it...

275
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
- So, you really don't really know?
- Know what?

276
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,200
All right, well, you're not going
to believe this, but...

277
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Mike Matassa, ATF, asked me
to be on the task force...

278
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
and Chief Gray just approved it.

279
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
- You're kidding me?
- Believe me, I thought he was too.

280
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,400
But he said I was highly recommended.

281
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,400
Look at you, moving up.
Congratulations, that's great.

282
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm moving up. Why am I moving up?
That's what I want to know.

283
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,760
- Why pick me? Why?
- Why? Because you're good.

284
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
- Plus, you had a good teacher.
- No, I had a great teacher.

285
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,120
That's true, but Camello's already
on the task force, right?

286
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
So, I know he's not going
to put me up for it.

287
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,040
Because Mike only thinks of Mike.

288
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,000
So it's got to be somebody else
in my department...

289
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,480
who's been putting...

290
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Congratulations.

291
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,720
See, I knew it was you, man.
I knew it. Thanks a lot.

292
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,280
- I got you, didn't I?
- No, you didn't, but thanks a lot.

293
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,520
- This is an incredible opportunity.
- You make the most of it.

294
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Believe me,
I'm going to make you proud.

295
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,880
- Don't worry about that.
- All right. I know you will.

296
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Hell, yeah. Hey, I know you're up
to your ass in work around here...

297
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,520
but I would still love
to bounce ideas off you.

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760
All right.

299
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,080
You know what fire
they're starting me on?

300
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
What?

301
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,040
They're starting me out
on the McWallis fire.

302
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
- Really?
- Yeah. So any pointers...

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
you can give me.
Any tips, man.

304
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,120
- Anything you can do.
- Don't worry about it.

305
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
- You're going to do just fine.
- Yeah.

306
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,800
But I'd still like to get
some pointers.

307
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
Because you're the guy.

308
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,920
<i>The arson epidemic sweeping the
Los Angeles area rages on unchecked.</i>

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,920
<i>As the interagency task force
sifts through the evidence...</i>

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
<i>firefighters have been overwhelmed
by a series of retail fires.</i>

311
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,400
<i>The latest to fall victim
was Glendale's McWallis gift shop.</i>

312
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
<i>I did what you asked
and called McWallis...</i>

313
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,560
<i>for over an hour this morning.</i>

314
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>You were right on the money
about the stuffed animals.</i>

315
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,640
<i>But the place was really soaked,
Junior.</i>

316
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
So that's why it wasn't anywhere
near the point of origin.

317
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
The freaking thing got washed away.

318
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
Once you're settled in
at the task force...

319
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,000
you should see if anybody
found anymore of these.

320
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,560
- Go through all your old cases.
- Yeah, well, I already did.

321
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,320
I went through everything.
I couldn't find any devices.

322
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
You know what, it turns out...

323
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,000
that there was an eyewitness
at the McWallis fire.

324
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
- You're kidding?
- He didn't see much.

325
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
But we got a police sketch
out of him, anyway.

326
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
- And?
- Look at this.

327
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,680
This is old lady Fin's
first sketch, right?

328
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,920
And that's the McWallis guys.

329
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's see.

330
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,120
Stick a goatee on
Mrs. Fin's sketch, and look.

331
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,960
It might as well be the same guy.

332
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,120
- The old lady wasn't so nuts, huh?
- No. I stand corrected.

333
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,840
Good job.

334
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Excuse me.
No smoking in the store.

335
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,080
<i>Concentrate on the wife.
She's going to close the deal.</i>

336
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,720
And don't show him
anything unfurnished.

337
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,880
- He's got no imagination.
- Hey, Hollywood Mike.

338
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,880
You going to be up
for an Academy Award?

339
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,800
Mike was a tech advisor
on a TV movie.

340
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,320
The director threw him a line.

341
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,920
Actually, he just recognized
my natural talent.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
- Yeah, right.
- Thank you.

343
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,120
- I got to go.
- My name is Mike Matassa.

344
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm going to be leading
this task force for the ATF.

345
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,920
With me from the Los Angeles
fire department...

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
are Glen Lucero and Mike Camello.
Both of whom I believe you know.

347
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,200
Ambria, will you pass out
those sketches, please?

348
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,400
- Here you go.
- Also...

349
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,280
I've asked your premiere arson
instructor...

350
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,680
John Orr, to drop down
and give us a profile.

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,240
But, seeing as it's ten after.
Let's just begin.

352
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,720
- Big John.
- Hey, how you doing?

353
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,080
John, how you doing?

354
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,520
Hey, guys. Hey, how are you?
Haven't seen you in a while.

355
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,720
- All right, let's get started.
- We already have, John.

356
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Well, great, thanks, Mike.

357
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,920
So I can see that the sketches that
you have in front of you are from...

358
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
two eyewitnesses who ID'd the torch
as a white male in his mid-thirties.

359
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,480
Now, typically,
these guys are loners.

360
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,400
They have trouble with relationships,
they have trouble with their jobs.

361
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
Generally, they've been setting fires
their whole lives.

362
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,200
Usually because of childhood trauma.

363
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,360
Now, this is not your typical case.

364
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
What makes this case special
is that he's setting these fires...

365
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,400
in residential neighborhoods,
crowded retail stores.

366
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
He's setting them in broad daylight.

367
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,280
And he's setting them in stores
that are mostly patronized by women.

368
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,080
- Why women?
- Well...

369
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,880
He likes to see them panic.
He likes to see them run.

370
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,120
He gets off on it. And what
we're dealing with here is...

371
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,120
a very high level
of self-confidence.

372
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Now, he's using a time-delay device.

373
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
So, he's gone by the time
the fire is started.

374
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,080
Now it's my guess that he's returning
to the scene of the crime...

375
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
to watch the fire.

376
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
He's volunteering information.

377
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,520
So it's crucial when you arrive
on the scene...

378
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,920
you check out the crowd.
See if anybody looks out of place.

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,760
I also believe he loves
the thrill of the chase.

380
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,240
That's a motivating factor.

381
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,120
Thanks, John.
Appreciate the profile.

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,760
- I'm not done, Mike.
- Yeah...

383
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,040
What I'd like to do now
is move on to...

384
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,600
Unless you're in some kind of hurry.
I mean, you asked me...

385
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,280
to come down here
and I'm just giving your profile.

386
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,360
- No hurry. Carry on.
- You sure?

387
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
Okay.

388
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,360
Where was I?

389
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,120
You were talking
about check the surroundings.

390
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
- And check everyone at the sight.
- Right.

391
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,200
If you want to catch this guy...

392
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,000
you must recognize that this is
about ego, okay, not fire.

393
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
I mean, it's interesting
what you're saying...

395
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,240
the whole childhood trauma thing
and getting off on the panic.

396
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,560
But then, how does ego
work into this...

397
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,080
Think about it, Junior,
I mean, he feels superior to us.

398
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,320
He's setting these fires
in broad daylight.

399
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,920
He's setting these fires
in the same area.

400
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,680
- I mean, he thinks we're fools.
- Well, we're not.

401
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,200
And we're going to catch him.
That I promise you.

402
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Okay, well, start looking
for some more of these.

403
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,240
That place is so cluttered.
It's always been a firetrap.

404
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,000
No. This is no accident.

405
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,440
- I bet this was another arson.
- Arson?

406
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Everyday there seems to be
another fire around here.

407
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Luckily there's a fire station
right around the corner.

408
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
Here comes the ladder truck.
The whole engine company's here.

409
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,440
<i>Those people inside
are search and rescue.</i>

410
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,360
<i>They're supposed to be
the first ones, look, there they are.</i>

411
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,360
<i>See the guys in the orange hats?</i>

412
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,080
<i>Okay, watch,
they're going to vent the roof.</i>

413
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,560
<i>Going to what?</i>

414
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,920
They're going to cut a hole in it,
so the fire has a place to go.

415
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,520
Let's all the smoke out.

416
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
How come you know so much about fire?

417
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm a fireman.

418
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,000
Look...

419
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,920
The fire's hungry for air now.

420
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
See, it needs air to breathe.
To live, just like us.

421
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,160
<i>The fire's gasping for breathe.</i>

422
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,880
Here she comes. Come on.

423
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,480
Come on.

424
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Yesterday, a lead arson investigator
up in Kern County, Clarence Hyde...

425
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
saw our bulletin and contacted me...

426
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,000
with some very interesting
information.

427
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,000
Why don't you walk us through it,
Clarence?

428
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,560
We had a series of retail fires
a few years back.

429
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,800
At one of them, a Craft Mart,
we found an incendiary device...

430
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
similar to that which was described
in your memo.

431
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,880
It was stuffed inside
a foam-rubber display.

432
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,400
The device failed
and didn't cause much damage.

433
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,280
But it gave us a fingerprint.

434
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,080
That's great. I mean,
tell us you got a match, right?

435
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,480
No. I ran it through the system.

436
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,360
I even checked with Cal ID
in Sacramento, but we came up empty.

437
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
But if Cal ID can't trace it, I mean,
it's no good to us, it's a dead end.

438
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
No, it's not necessarily a dead end.

439
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,880
When we put the fires on a map...

440
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,640
They made a nice little line
right down Highway 99.

441
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,640
Pointing right down here to LA.

442
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,160
Now that's a busy road,
and you got to understand...

443
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,040
that these fires all happened
over one weekend. Which is unusual.

444
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,480
Scary part was,
that I knew a lot of the men...

445
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,480
that we're traveling between Fresno
and LA that weekend.

446
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Because they were firemen.

447
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,120
LA firemen heading up to Fresno
for the arson conference.

448
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,880
Hey, hang on there, Buddy. You got to
be careful what you're saying here.

449
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,560
Why? You mean, there are bad cops,
but not bad firemen?

450
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,160
No, it just seems really
unlikely to me, all right?

451
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
Anyway, I put together a list
from the conference.

452
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
But, that's where it ended.

453
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,520
I couldn't zero in on one suspect
because I had two hundred names.

454
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Look, guys, I'm sorry,
but if you sat me down...

455
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,600
and started making accusations,
that would really piss me off.

456
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,480
You worried, Mike?

457
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,200
- What?
- Are you worried?

458
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,760
Yeah, right, cuff me now
because I'm your guy.

459
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,560
It could be.
Everyone in this room knows...

460
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
how to make a time-delay device.

461
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,880
If you don't, I got a class
starting in twenty minutes.

462
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,720
It's an ugly thought, Mike,
but it's possible.

463
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,960
He's right.

464
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
Okay. So, what do we have?

465
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Seven fires the weekend of
an arson conference.

466
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,200
Clarence, you'll get us that list
of names as soon as possible.

467
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,960
All who attended are suspects.

468
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Every investigator.
Every fireman. Everyone.

469
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,640
John?

470
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,960
Hey.

471
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
Yeah.

472
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
You told Lori you were going
to come upstairs...

473
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,280
and read her a bedtime story.

474
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,560
She won't go to sleep.

475
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
Well, I'm coming,
I just need to finish this report.

476
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,160
Are you going to stay up
all night again?

477
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,480
Maybe. We're narrowing down
a list of suspects.

478
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,360
I got a lot of work to do, Honey.

479
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,200
- John.
- What?

480
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,920
John.

481
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
All right. Okay.

482
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,200
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

483
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,360
But you've got to spend some time
with your girls.

484
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm not even their real mother.

485
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,920
But I'm closer to the kids
than you are.

486
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,520
Every night you come down here...

487
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,320
and we don't see you
until the morning.

488
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,200
As soon as this case is done,
I'm all yours, I promise.

489
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Are you getting obsessed
with this guy? Are you?

490
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,000
No. Come here.

491
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,840
Come here.

492
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,400
God, you're beautiful.

493
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,600
You're changing the subject.

494
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,520
Do you know how much I love you?

495
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,760
Well, maybe you need to remind me
every now and then.

496
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,400
I love you.

497
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,800
Come on.

498
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,240
Laura, if you want two six-packs,
I need five more dollars.

499
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,000
Hey, Beautiful.

500
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,520
You need somebody to buy you a beer?

501
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,880
- No, thanks, Officer.
- Officer?

502
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,480
- I look like a cop?
- Yeah.

503
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,920
Well, I'm not a cop. I'm Aaron.

504
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,520
Stop the press.

505
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,160
What about you?

506
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,960
- What about me?
- That's a really nice shirt.

507
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Fuck off!

508
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
- Let me shoot this thing.
- Here, guys.

509
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,920
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Ambria.

510
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,360
- Hey, Fellas, you got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

511
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,080
Hey, Ambria,
can you give me a cup too?

512
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,440
- Kind of busy right now, Keith.
- That's all right.

513
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm just trying to cut back anyway.

514
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,400
So, you remember the fabric
store fire we had a week ago?

515
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,800
- Yeah.
- A couple years back...

516
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,400
there was another fabric store fire,
up in Atascadero.

517
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,200
- Sure, so?
- So I looked in the file.

518
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,600
It turns out that there was a whole
rash of arsons the same weekend.

519
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Just like Hyde had in Kern County.
Identical MO.

520
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,560
- And guess what?
- Fires all took place...

521
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
the weekend of Symposium Four?

522
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,520
Right. How the hell
did you know that?

523
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,840
It was an arson conference.
I was there.

524
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Right.

525
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,240
Okay, I want everybody
at that symposium cross-checked...

526
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,920
against the list
from the Fresno conference.

527
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
Any names that come up
on both of these...

528
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,720
I'll check with the print
from Craft Mart.

529
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,040
Let's check with Atascadero.
See if they recovered any devices.

530
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,920
- You got it. So, Keith?
- Yeah?

531
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
- You and Ambria, huh?
- Yeah, me and Ambria.

532
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,520
It was just, for a while,
then she met somebody else.

533
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Smart girl.

534
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,880
<i>Fortunately, there weren't
any fatalities at College Hills.</i>

535
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,880
<i>But forty-six homes have been lost.</i>

536
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,120
<i>Another twenty are severely damaged.</i>

537
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,960
<i>The scale of this destruction
is truly massive.</i>

538
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,760
<i>- Are you thinking arson, Captain?
- Yeah, yes.</i>

539
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,720
<i>That's definitely something
that we have to consider.</i>

540
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,600
<i>We've had over a dozen calls so far,
but no real leads.</i>

541
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,920
<i>Nothing that we would consider hot.</i>

542
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,440
<i>Could we be talking serial arson?</i>

543
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,080
<i>Yes, we could, that's a theory
that I'm mulling over.</i>

544
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,120
<i>I definitely think
this could be a serial arsonist.</i>

545
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,600
<i>Again, there's no...</i>

546
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,280
John Orr.

547
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,400
The man who would be king.

548
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,000
Bye-bye.

549
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,320
- Hey, Fellas, what's up?
- Keith.

550
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,320
- Yeah, what do you got?
- Close the door, will, you?

551
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,920
Yeah, sure.

552
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,080
What's up with the cloak
and dagger meeting, huh?

553
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,680
This...

554
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,000
This can't go beyond us.

555
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,760
So what? You ID'd the print?

556
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,920
We narrowed the list of suspects
down to ten names.

557
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,480
You know, investigators
that were at both conferences.

558
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,640
- Yeah, and?
- Well...

559
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,160
- The print belongs to one of them.
- All right, already, so who is it?

560
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,040
It's John Orr.

561
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, right, of course it is.

562
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,960
Of course it's John Orr, man.
Shit, why didn't I think of that?

563
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,160
Why didn't I come up
with that answer, huh?

564
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Come on, stop fucking with me.
Who is it?

565
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,760
- We're not kidding.
- No...

566
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,920
- Come on. I can't believe that.
- I can't believe it either.

567
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,320
- But the print's a match.
- I don't care that the prints match.

568
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,280
That's ridiculous, man.
Somebody made a mistake.

569
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,000
It only takes six points
of comparison for a positive match.

570
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,240
Right, and how many did you find?

571
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,720
Thirteen.

572
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,080
- Thirteen?
- Thirteen.

573
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
Not much room for error there.

574
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,440
Hey, wait.
I bet John handled the evidence.

575
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,760
Man, you know how he always
shows up to everybody's fires.

576
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,040
He's a workaholic for Christ sake,
Matassa.

577
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,480
No, that's exactly what I thought,
so I talked with Hyde.

578
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
- Right.
- Asked him if any outside...

579
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
investigators came by
to offer help that day.

580
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
His answer was a very emphatic, no.

581
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
Keith, all these fires
have the same MO.

582
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,560
We even went back and examined
the hardware store fire.

583
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,520
- Where the little kid died?
- Remember?

584
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,240
Orr was arguing with Hines that day
trying to tell him it was arson.

585
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,720
Well, guess what?
John was right.

586
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,200
So now you're calling him a murderer?

587
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,800
Did you ever wonder
why John was so good...

588
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,200
at finding these time-delay devices?

589
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,440
So, what?
Because you're good at your job...

590
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,240
that makes you a suspect, man?
John was my partner, all right.

591
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,920
There's no way.
I know him better than you, man.

592
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,320
There's no way that he was the torch.

593
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
Keith, I've known the guy
for years too.

594
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,600
But we can't ignore the facts.

595
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,920
Ignore the facts. Mike...

596
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,720
They have two sketches of
the same perp.

597
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,080
None of the pictures look like John.

598
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,600
What about that fact, huh?
I don't care what you guys say.

599
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,240
There's a big fuck-up,
and I'm going to find it.

600
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,240
It is essential that you don't
say anything to him.

601
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,560
- I'm not going to say anything.
- Do you hear me?

602
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,360
- Hey, don't threaten me, Matassa.
- All right, guys. Let's calm down.

603
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,840
- Hey, you taking this awfully easy.
- No, I'm not.

604
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,320
There's still a lot of gray here,
okay. But Mike's right.

605
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,760
Mike's right.
Stop sucking up to the fucking ATF.

606
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,280
- You're a fireman, for Christ sake.
- You can't tell John about this.

607
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,880
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to John's.

608
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,800
- I'm going to snitch on you.
- This is no joke.

609
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm going home, if that's all right
with you, big guy.

610
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,680
- Don't go near him.
- Fuck you, Matassa.

611
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,960
<i>John, what are you doing?</i>

612
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,720
What are you up to, Baby?
You don't smoke.

613
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Come on.

614
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>What are we doing now?</i>

615
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,720
Shit.

616
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
Get on top of me.

617
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,840
Talk to me.

618
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,560
So, where does she think
you are right now?

619
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,960
I'm just curious what Wanda thinks
you're doing while you're fucking me?

620
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
She probably thinks
I'm putting out a fire.

621
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,640
You are putting out a fire.

622
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,840
Just not the kind she thinks.

623
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,160
Come on.

624
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,080
Fuck.

625
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,040
We're not done here yet.

626
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,600
Sorry, my mind's somewhere else.

627
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,360
It's not your mind I'm after.

628
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,920
I know. But my ass has got to be
someplace else, too.

629
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,880
What's the matter with you today?
You're no fun.

630
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,680
- I feel like I'm being played.
- What are you talking about?

631
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
I feel like whoever's setting
these fires...

632
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,160
is doing it to push my buttons.

633
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
I feel like this guy's...

634
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,720
He's messing with me.

635
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,600
You really think he's a fireman?

636
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah.

637
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,680
And I've got this weird feeling
that it's someone that I know.

638
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,320
- Police. Did you call?
- What?

639
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,840
- The police. Did you call, Ma'am?
- No.

640
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,520
We got a call about a noise
in the hallway.

641
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,640
- Would you please come to the door?
- I didn't call the police. What?

642
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,240
Let go!

643
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
Come here, you bitch!
Get over here.

644
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,880
Let go! You fucking asshole.
What are you doing?

645
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,240
- Let go!
- Move it!

646
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,400
Before I blow your fucking head off!

647
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,120
No! Please, stop!

648
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,600
Stop! Let go!

649
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,840
- Let go of me! Bastard!
- Stop!

650
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,640
- Look what you made me do!
- No!

651
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,560
- Damn you!
- Let go!

652
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,600
Shut up!

653
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
- What are you doing?
- Teaching you some goddamn manners.

654
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,720
Stop!

655
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,160
No! Somebody please help me!

656
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,880
No!

657
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,400
Please.

658
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,760
I don't want to die. Help!

659
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,760
Help!

660
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,040
Copy. Just waiting on the coroner
before we move the body.

661
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,760
Mattasa!

662
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,760
Matassa, what happened?

663
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,480
We got a two-roomer started
in the living room.

664
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,480
One fatality.
What are you doing here?

665
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,080
- I got paged.
- Where were you?

666
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,000
What do you mean, where was I?

667
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,200
I was in the area, why?

668
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,160
- Lucky you got here so quick.
- Hey, Professor.

669
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
- How you doing?
- Hey, Junior.

670
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,520
They're on their way down
to St. Anne's.

671
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,760
- All right.
- Who is?

672
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,280
This kid was acting like a hero,
and he got burned up pretty bad.

673
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,640
Did you get to show him the sketches?

674
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,440
No, the kid was in shock,
didn't get a chance to.

675
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,000
He can barely breathe. I don't think
he's in any mood for interviews.

676
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,360
Well, you should see what?

677
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,600
- Hey, Matassa?
- Yeah?

678
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,720
Mattasa, you guys closing in
on anybody yet?

679
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,040
We're working on it. We've got it
under control, all right?

680
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,240
You got it under control? It doesn't
look like you got it under control.

681
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,280
You got another victim here.
It's totally out of control.

682
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,440
Why don't you guys stop
fucking around...

683
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,200
and find this guy before he kills
somebody in my family.

684
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,080
- Somebody in your family?
- Yeah, somebody in my family.

685
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,240
Professor, come on.

686
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,080
Believe me, we want to catch this guy
every bit as much as you do.

687
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,960
Then fucking do it!

688
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,760
- Got enough fucking guys.
- What's he doing here anyway?

689
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,240
He's doing his job.
Just like everybody else.

690
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,440
We were there like ten minutes.

691
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,560
Suddenly he shows up telling me
he's been 911ed.

692
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,680
- What's that about?
- No. You don't know...

693
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,840
what you're talking about.

694
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,320
All right. Well then you tell me.

695
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Why was he there?
He burned that building.

696
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,440
It wasn't him. You're wrong.
I know where he was.

697
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,600
- Yeah? Where?
- I followed John this afternoon.

698
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,560
I tailed him to a motel.
He's having an affair.

699
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,320
- You happy now, huh?
- No.

700
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,520
No, what? Just because the guy's
getting some on the side...

701
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,840
makes him a pyro? Please, God.

702
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,960
We've got a finger print.
What don't you understand about that?

703
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,120
Run that print again because
it's possible that he handled...

704
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,840
the evidence after it was logged in.
John shows up at fires.

705
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
That's who he is.
That's what he's about.

706
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,640
- He's obsessed with arson.
- Exactly.

707
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,840
Bullshit!

708
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,120
You're using a seven-year-old
fingerprint to build evidence...

709
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,800
against a guy who practically
founded my department?

710
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
I don't care what he founded.

711
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,920
I'm getting authority to put him
under surveillance.

712
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,400
It's as simple as that.

713
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,000
God damnit, I hate that prick.

714
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,600
He's just trying to nail somebody.
Anybody.

715
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,800
Look I would love nothing more...

716
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,480
than to see you prove
John's innocence, okay?

717
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,160
But, until then, Matassa,
he's just a stiff, you know...

718
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,160
Look, it's just all about following
ATF procedures. That's all.

719
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,680
Mike, I hope you're not siding
with ATF against one of your own.

720
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,800
Hey, don't give me that shit.

721
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,920
Besides, if he is the torch,
he's not one of us.

722
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,480
Al?

723
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm John Orr from
the Glendale fire department.

724
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,480
How are you feeling?

725
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,480
I've been better.

726
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,000
Sorry about what happened. That was
a very brave thing that you did.

727
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,680
- A very stupid thing.
- No.

728
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,120
So, I understand you were at a party
across the hall?

729
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,720
How are your eyes?
Can you see okay?

730
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,280
They hurt like hell.

731
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,520
But you can see?

732
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,360
- No, I'm not blind.
- No, of course not.

733
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,360
I'm going to show you something.

734
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,920
Have you seen this man before?

735
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,200
- Is that the guy who did it?
- Why don't you tell me?

736
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,920
- No.
- No?

737
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,960
No, I've never seen that guy before.

738
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,360
Why would somebody
do something like that?

739
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,120
That's a real good question, Al.

740
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,320
<i>You tell yourself that arson
is a problem for firefighters.</i>

741
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,560
But the reality is, it affects
each and every one of us.

742
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,040
As long as there are people
who get their thrills...

743
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,320
from the relentless
destruction of fire.

744
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,920
Support for the heroes of
the Glendale arson unit is vital.

745
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,720
Every dollar counts.

746
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
When we apprehend an arsonist,
and we get him off the street...

747
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,480
we're saving lives.

748
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,040
Now make no mistake,
your contribution...

749
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,360
is helping us defend
your neighbor's businesses.

750
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,840
And even your families homes.

751
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,000
Now at this very moment.

752
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,760
We are closing in
on the serial arsonist...

753
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,640
who has been terrorizing Los Angeles.

754
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,960
On behalf of the
Glendale arson unit...

755
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,560
I want to thank each and every one
of you for your support.

756
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,280
Every dollar counts.
So please give.

757
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,320
Thank you.

758
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,680
Thank you.

759
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,840
Thank you.

760
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,600
I got to hand it to you, John.

761
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,760
You are a hell of a fundraiser.

762
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,320
Thanks, Chief.

763
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,080
- Keep up the good work.
- I will...

764
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,320
- Thanks. We'll get their money.
- We need it.

765
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,040
- Your wife is here, John.
- Hey, you made it.

766
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,160
I'm so glad you're here.
What did you think of the speech?

767
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,760
You said she was going out of town.

768
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,320
She was, she heard
I was giving the speech...

769
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,440
and she wanted to be here.
You know how proud she can get.

770
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,360
Yeah, I don't know
how proud she can get, John.

771
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,160
Look at you. You look beautiful.

772
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,400
- Thanks.
- I like this dress.

773
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,960
- Hey, Baby.
- Hi.

774
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,880
How are you?

775
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Kate, this is my wife, Wanda.
Wanda, this is Kate.

776
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,080
Wanda, your wife.
I've heard so much about you.

777
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,280
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.

778
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,800
We work, she's with the LAPD.

779
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,560
We work together on fires.

780
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,840
- That must be very exciting?
- Well, it can be very exciting.

781
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,480
- Yeah.
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

782
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,960
It's a pleasure to meet you.

783
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,840
- That's a very beautiful dress.
- Thank you.

784
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,280
It is a nice dress.
Usually I only see her in uniform.

785
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,440
It's nice to see her dressed up.

786
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,800
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Keith.

787
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,960
Hey, how you doing, Wanda?

788
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,360
- How's my favorite bachelor?
- Striking out. I don't know.

789
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,240
It must be my cologne or something.

790
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,400
Can you take a picture of us?

791
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,760
- Yeah, sure.
- Please. Thanks.

792
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,240
- Why don't I just scootch...
- No, come on...

793
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,360
Scootch in, Kate.

794
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,840
All right. Here we go.

795
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,320
- Get what you wanted?
- Yeah, I think so.

796
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,280
Take one more.
I think my eyes were closed.

797
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,160
All right.

798
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,200
Wait.

799
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,840
Can't wait until we get to do this
in our own bed.

800
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,800
Me, too.

801
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,000
Careful with that.

802
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,360
It's part of the costume
for the boys play.

803
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,920
Really?

804
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
My God. That's next week, isn't it?

805
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,640
You're really going all out
this time, aren't you?

806
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,800
You have no idea.
It's going to be great.

807
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,960
Can you hand me my smokes? Please.

808
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,320
This really is a nasty habit.

809
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,280
No.

810
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,640
You're my nasty habit.

811
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,720
Maybe not so nasty today?

812
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,400
I'm sorry. I've just got
some things on my mind.

813
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,960
Hey, John, how's it going?

814
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,520
Hey.

815
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,160
What the hell are you doing here?
You slumming?

816
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,680
No, Wanda told me you were
going to be down here.

817
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,000
So I thought I'd come over.

818
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,080
You're always working so hard, man.

819
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,880
Amazing.

820
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,920
I dropped by to tell you...

821
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,480
that they're running
that print again.

822
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,360
- In case you want to know.
- Really?

823
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,720
- Yeah.
- Why? Was there a match?

824
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,000
No match yet.
We're still waiting on the lab.

825
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,480
My old desk.

826
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,000
That was a great speech you gave.

827
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,080
You had those fundraisers
right in the palm of your hands, man.

828
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,640
- Thanks.
- No problem.

829
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,840
John, did you ever meet Hyde...

830
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,880
before he came down
to the task force?

831
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,680
Like maybe around the time
of the Bakersfield fires.

832
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,760
- Around that time?
- I don't think so. Why?

833
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,640
Too bad. I was hoping
to get a little info.

834
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,520
You know, something to grab on to.

835
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,400
Is there something you want
to tell me, Keith?

836
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,960
No, John, I'm just like you.

837
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,840
I'm just looking for a needle
in a haystack. That's all.

838
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,960
Now I'm John,
no longer the Professor, huh?

839
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,240
- You got a suspect?
- No. No suspect yet.

840
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,200
But you know what,
I keep remembering what you said.

841
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,680
About what?

842
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
That the only way
you're going to catch this guy...

843
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,040
is that you recognize
that it's about ego, and not fire.

844
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,760
There's the guy with the ego, Keith.

845
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,360
Looks like the only way
we're going to catch him...

846
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,040
is if I do it myself.

847
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,240
Marty?

848
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,720
- Can I speak to you, please?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Orr.

849
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,040
- What is it, Dad?
- It's okay, Honey.

850
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,520
- You mean privately?
- Yeah.

851
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,880
<i>- No, not at all.
- Dad?</i>

852
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
<i>- It'll just be a minute.
- Dad?</i>

853
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,000
<i>It'll be just a minute, okay?
Let me ask you a question.</i>

854
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,080
- What are your intentions?
- My intentions?

855
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,520
Towards my daughter.
Planning to get married?

856
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,280
Marriage? I'm only seventeen.

857
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,960
So, then you're not planning
to get married in the near future?

858
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,840
- Heck, no.
- All right, good.

859
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,080
<i>Good. I have no further questions.</i>

860
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,560
<i>Don't need to have
any further conversation.</i>

861
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,040
<i>You answered my question.</i>

862
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,320
Stop fidgeting, man.

863
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,360
Matassa, this is Keith.
<i>What's going on?</i>

864
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,680
Nothing. Just sit tight.

865
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,640
<i>Been sitting tight all fucking day,
what are you talking about?</i>

866
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,560
<i>- So, that's it, Mr. Orr?
- That's it.</i>

867
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,520
<i>Buckle up, Honey.</i>

868
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,960
<i>- Is there a problem, Sir?</i>
- I'm sorry?

869
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,480
- Is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

870
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,760
We don't have a problem at all.

871
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,120
There's going to be no problem
so long as my daughter's a virgin...

872
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,720
on her wedding day, Marty.

873
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
- You understand?
- Yeah.

874
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,200
Okay. Good.

875
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,320
- You have a good date.
- Yeah.

876
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,800
- Okay?
- Thank you, Sir.

877
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,320
<i>- Drive safe.
- Yes, Sir.</i>

878
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,560
- This is it. He's on the move.
- Copy that.

879
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,000
<i>Damnit. Shit. The antenna's broken.
He can see it.</i>

880
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,960
Hold your position.

881
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,320
- What has just happened?
<i>- He found it.</i>

882
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,800
<i>He spotted the tracking device.</i>

883
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,840
<i>Camello, let him go.</i>
Don't try and follow him.

884
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,040
Fuck.

885
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,920
- Hello.
- Hello. Who's this?

886
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,880
- Who's this?
- Put Kate on the phone, please?

887
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,320
- Who is it, Sweetie?
- It's for you.

888
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,080
Okay. Hold on a second.
Stay right there.

889
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,560
Work on your bow.

890
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,520
- Hello.
<i>- Kate.</i>

891
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,720
John.

892
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,760
<i>My boys have their whole class here.
It's crazy.</i>

893
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,120
Kate, listen to me.
You're not going to believe this.

894
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,080
Someone's following me.
I'm being tailed.

895
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
I found a tracking device
under my car.

896
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
<i>It's Wanda. It's got to be Wanda.</i>

897
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,840
I mean, she's obviously hired
a private detective or something.

898
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,640
- You got to tell her about us, John.
- You're right.

899
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,840
You're probably right...

900
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,720
<i>Wait, hold on. Wait a minute.</i>

901
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,400
<i>John? John, what's the matter?
Are you okay?</i>

902
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,960
Holy shit. <i>No, I'm okay.</i>

903
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,640
<i>I'm fine. You're right.</i> Bye.

904
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,720
It's not Wanda.

905
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,440
This is not something
Wanda would do.

906
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,120
Well, it didn't just show up there
by magic, John.

907
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,600
Listen to me.
Remember I told you...

908
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,960
that I thought these fires
were being set by a fireman?

909
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,320
- Yeah.
- They think it's me.

910
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,320
John, I'm telling you...

911
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,600
This tracking thing, it was put there
by a private investigator...

912
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,120
that your wife hired.

913
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,680
I see this kind of thing
all the time...

914
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,440
Kate, it's not Wanda.
I'm telling you.

915
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,320
These bastards think it's me.

916
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,680
Carrie really had a good time
with Marty.

917
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,760
Yeah, you think so?

918
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,240
- Yeah.
- That's good.

919
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,240
It was very nice of you
to let her go.

920
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,320
You're such a softie.

921
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,040
Sweet dreams.

922
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,160
Drop the fucking gun.

923
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,640
- You?
- Yeah. It's me.

924
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,760
- Thought I wouldn't figure you out?
- It took you long enough, Professor.

925
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
You can kiss my ass.

926
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,480
You're nothing!
Nothing but a loser!

927
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,160
<i>Grandma?</i>

928
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,480
<i>Mommy?</i>

929
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,120
Mommy?

930
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,600
Grandma?

931
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,120
Wanda! What the hell are you doing?
Put it down!

932
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,480
John, I can't believe this.

933
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,480
You stay down here
almost every night...

934
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,720
and you've been writing a book?

935
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,280
You said you were doing your reports,
trying to stop these fires.

936
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,280
I was. I am.

937
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,800
I started writing to get inside
the mind of the arsonist...

938
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,560
and this book just evolved.

939
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,360
Why did you lie to me?

940
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,800
Why?

941
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,360
I wanted to surprise you.

942
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,320
Sorry.

943
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,680
- Did you like it?
- What?

944
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,880
What did you think of the book?

945
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,640
Tell you what I thought
about the book?

946
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,560
Yeah. What'd you think?

947
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,120
Wanda.

948
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,560
I think your hero is a lot like you.

949
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,400
And I also think
he's having an affair.

950
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,320
- Wanda, this is fiction.
- Are you having an affair?

951
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,120
I wrote that to spice up
the character.

952
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,400
To make him more interesting.
Wanda, this is just a novel.

953
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,600
Answer my question.

954
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,360
I can't believe
you're asking me this.

955
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,880
I wrote this book
for you and the girls.

956
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,760
Come on, tell me what you thought.

957
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,920
I think it's a bit too close to home.

958
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,800
Actually, I think...

959
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,680
I think it's creepy.

960
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,120
- It's creepy.
- Creepy?

961
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,800
What's creepy?

962
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,000
The rape.

963
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,680
Yeah.

964
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,600
I didn't know pyromaniacs
are also rapists.

965
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,040
Well, some are.
For some, fire's like sex.

966
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,320
What? Why are you looking
at me like this?

967
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,840
Why did you write this kind of book?

968
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,400
- Are you unhappy?
- What? No.

969
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,600
I love you, Wanda.

970
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,080
I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

971
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,480
It took me four marriages
to find you. Four.

972
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,800
You're my soul mate.

973
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,240
You're the woman I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

974
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,360
You're the woman
I want to make proud.

975
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,520
Do you have any idea
what this family means to me?

976
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,800
What you and the girls mean to me?

977
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,920
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

978
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,640
- What do you mean, you want off?
- Just think of it...

979
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,480
as a conflict of interest,
that's all.

980
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:42,120
Have a seat. Don't give me that old
Feds versus the locals cliche.

981
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,280
No, it's nothing like that.

982
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,760
There must be a good reason
to want to get off the task force.

983
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,120
All right, look, if I tell you,
you got to keep it confidential.

984
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,680
Okay, shoot.

985
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,120
Matassa's building a case
against John Orr.

986
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,600
John Orr?

987
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,760
You got to be joking.

988
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,320
He's the best arson investigator
we've ever had.

989
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,960
He trained half the guys
on the force.

990
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,760
- He taught you, for God's sake.
- Chief, we got a print.

991
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,880
And the print's a perfect match.

992
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,480
Okay, what am I supposed
to do with that?

993
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,120
What about the police sketches?

994
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,240
You know, we interviewed
the College Hills lady.

995
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,960
And John was right. John is right.
This lady is totally unreliable.

996
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,320
We got two sketches
that are just a coincidence.

997
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,720
This makes his book
a whole lot stranger.

998
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,200
Book? What book?

999
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,640
Can you believe it?
John actually wrote a novel...

1000
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,880
and then he had the balls
to show it to Chief Gray.

1001
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,680
So, what's it about?

1002
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,960
Well, it's about an arsonist.

1003
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,360
A serial arsonist
who turns out to be a fireman.

1004
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,760
And Gray never said
anything about it?

1005
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,240
Yeah, well,
he read the first few pages...

1006
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,360
and then the profanity made him stop.

1007
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,760
But, you know, he said
that if he thought about it.

1008
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,240
That Orr's fictional arsonist...

1009
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,120
probably was based
on the police sketches.

1010
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,760
All right.

1011
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,240
We got to get this book.
Let's concentrate on that.

1012
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,640
How we going to do it?
We can't just ask for it.

1013
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,000
- He trusts you, Keith.
- No, not anymore.

1014
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,560
I saw him the other day,
and he knows we're on to him.

1015
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,800
But just remember,
remember what he said.

1016
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,680
He said it's about ego, not fire.

1017
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,880
Hey, Camello. It's simple.

1018
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,960
These movies you work on,
there's a fire marshal, right?

1019
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,680
<i>You get one to tell John
he'll give the book to a producer.</i>

1020
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,200
<i>- Feed the ego.</i>
- Thanks a lot. It's my baby.

1021
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,280
Take care of it.
You let me know, okay?

1022
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,760
As soon as you hear something.

1023
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,520
You're not going to believe this.
He bought it.

1024
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,760
I'll get it to you soon as I can.

1025
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,080
Yeah.

1026
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,040
Please.

1027
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,720
Please, don't hurt me!

1028
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,720
He couldn't have known all this.

1029
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,440
I can't believe
he wrote all this down.

1030
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,040
Every day it seems like
there's another fire around here.

1031
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,160
Look at that.
They're going to vent the roof.

1032
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,920
- Do what?
- They're going to put a hole in it.

1033
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,960
So the fire has a place to go.
It let's the smoke clear.

1034
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,880
- Can you feel the heat from here?
- Yeah.

1035
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,720
It's exciting, isn't it?

1036
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
How come you know so much about fire?

1037
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,160
I'm a fireman.

1038
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,880
I'm John. John Orr.

1039
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,480
Man, we investigated
a lot of the fires in this book.

1040
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,280
He had you investigating
his own fires.

1041
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,840
Yeah. He investigated his own fires.

1042
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,280
That's why he found all the devices.

1043
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,760
They were his.

1044
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,600
You know, if John really did
the things in this book...

1045
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,480
what about the rape of that girl?

1046
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,240
What? I don't understand.

1047
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,120
What do you mean
it doesn't ring true?

1048
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,720
The villain's too over the top.

1049
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,680
Okay.

1050
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,120
Just for your information,
I'm investigating a case right now...

1051
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,000
where the arsonist
is the arson investigator.

1052
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,600
So, it's just like...

1053
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,640
Okay. No, I appreciate
your reading it.

1054
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,600
Thank you.

1055
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,760
That's the third rejection.

1056
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,360
I got it out to two other people.
To two other agencies...

1057
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
and they're not even returning
my calls, so...

1058
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,120
Don't give up on it, okay, Dad.

1059
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,600
I mean, there's a lot of
other agents out there.

1060
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,080
Thank you, Carrie.

1061
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,600
- Goodbye. I love you.
- Love you too, Daddy.

1062
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,880
I appreciate that. Thank you,
that's very nice coming from you.

1063
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,080
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1064
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,160
You two have a good day, okay.

1065
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,640
I love you.

1066
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,240
Bye.

1067
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,440
Don't move, John.
Stay where you are.

1068
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,000
Put your hands away
from your gun, John.

1069
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,120
- What's going on?
- In the air. Nice and easy.

1070
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,320
Get your hands up, John.
I will shoot you, John.

1071
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,320
John, what's going on?
What happened?

1072
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,760
- John!
- Daddy!

1073
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,000
Stay where you are!

1074
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,760
Get your hand away
from your gun, John.

1075
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,240
- Nice and easy.
- You're under arrest for arson.

1076
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,760
We're going to take you down
to the station, John.

1077
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,560
We'll explain everything, but first
we're going to read you your rights.

1078
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,200
What?

1079
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,360
This is nuts.
You don't have anything on me.

1080
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,800
- This is crazy.
- How about a print?

1081
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
- How many prints?
- How many?

1082
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,120
- That's all you have to say?
- We've got your book, John.

1083
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,600
My book? My book is fucking fiction.

1084
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,840
You have got the right
to remain silent.

1085
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,960
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1086
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,120
- You have a right to an attorney.
- Junior?

1087
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,400
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1088
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,560
- Keith, those are for my classes.
- Do you understand...

1089
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,040
these rights, John?

1090
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,960
Don't look at me, John.

1091
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,080
Keith. Look at this.

1092
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,920
- Look how many guns this guy has.
- Hey, Ron, get a picture of this.

1093
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,040
All these videos.
It's a library of all his fires.

1094
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,960
Jesus.

1095
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,800
Look at this.

1096
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,240
Jesus. It's Ambria.

1097
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,280
<i>When I look in front of me...</i>

1098
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,280
<i>I see only clouds.</i>

1099
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,760
<i>What am I supposed to believe?</i>

1100
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,760
I need you to look me in the eyes
and tell me the truth.

1101
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,240
Wanda, Honey, it's nothing.

1102
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,400
I've seen these kinds of screw-ups
at work all the time.

1103
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,400
I'm going to have this cleared up
in a heartbeat.

1104
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,680
But I need you now.

1105
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,840
You didn't seem to need me...

1106
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,640
while you were screwing around
with your policewoman.

1107
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,800
That's over. That was nothing.

1108
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,880
You know I can't live without you.

1109
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,840
Okay.

1110
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,080
I'm your wife, of course.

1111
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,160
I will stick by you during the trial.

1112
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,480
But then, I want a divorce.

1113
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,640
Wanda. Listen to me,
you're just...

1114
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,480
You're just scared now.

1115
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,480
But don't worry, soon everything
is going to be like the way it was.

1116
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,920
We have to stand together on this.

1117
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,440
Together?

1118
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,200
How am I supposed to do that?

1119
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,120
How am I supposed to defend you?

1120
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,360
You don't have to say anything.

1121
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,360
They have no case.

1122
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,720
You know I love you.

1123
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,200
Don't you?

1124
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,480
Don't you?

1125
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,440
When this is over...

1126
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,400
I'm going to get my divorce.

1127
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,360
It's going to be you
and me and the kids.

1128
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,040
It's going to be just like
we talked about.

1129
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,840
I need to know you're by my side.

1130
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,480
Yeah.

1131
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
You take care of your little sister.

1132
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,800
I'll be home in a blink of an eye.

1133
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,960
I love you.

1134
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,600
Mr. McCann, three counts of arson,
ten years each.

1135
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,200
- Do you have any comments?
- We will appeal.

1136
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,600
This entire trial was built...

1137
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,000
on a fictional manuscript
and we will appeal.

1138
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,280
What about the possibility
of a homicide conviction?

1139
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,880
You have my statement.

1140
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,520
I'm confident that after all
the facts are in...

1141
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,480
my client will be exonerated.

1142
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,520
The truly great investigators
step inside the mind of the arsonist.

1143
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,240
They get right in his skull
and look out his eyes.

1144
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,240
This is what the task force
was never able to do.

1145
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,520
But they had to nails somebody.

1146
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,360
So with a four-year-old fingerprint
and work of fiction...

1147
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,520
they built a case against me.

1148
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,080
The truth of the matter
is that an arsonist managed...

1149
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,360
to set thousands of fires
without ever leaving a trace.

1150
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,840
He taunted them
and they never got close.

1151
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,040
You can't help but admire that.

1152
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,560
<i>Eventually,
the arsonist was identified.</i>

1153
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,160
<i>After examining all the evidence...</i>

1154
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,920
<i>the jury found John Orr
guilty as charged.</i>

1155
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,320
<i>He is now serving four life sentences
for the deaths...</i>

1156
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,000
<i>in the hardware store fire.</i>

1157
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,520
<i>The year after Orr's conviction...</i>

1158
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,240
<i>arson fires in the Los Angeles area
dropped seventy-five percent.</i>

1159
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,680
- Get your lazy-ass back to work.
<i>- His arrest sent shockwaves...</i>

1160
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,960
<i>through the Los Angeles area
fire departments.</i>

1161
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,600
<i>It is believed to be
the worst case...</i>

1162
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,600
<i>of serial arson
in Southern California history.</i>

1163
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,080
<i>If you want to catch this guy...</i>

1164
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,880
<i>you must recognize
that this is about ego.</i>

1165
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,200
<i>Ego.</i>
