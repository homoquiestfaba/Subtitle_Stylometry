1
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,289
Oh, shit.

2
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,325
-Great to see you, too.

3
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,161
-Sorry.
It's just early.

4
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,096
It's 10:30.

5
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,731
-Jesus, it's<i> that</i> early?

6
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,934
-I tried calling.

7
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,604
-Shit.

8
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,905
Where's Harry?

9
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,074
-Doug and I are moving --
to Phoenix.

10
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,476
-Phoenix? What, are you
taking Harry with you?

11
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,278
-Of course I'm taking Harry
with me. He's my son.

12
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,779
-Sarah,
how can you do this to me?

13
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,515
-It takes money
to raise a child,

14
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,016
and I don't have enough.

15
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,285
-Me and Zack are working
on a lot of businesses.

16
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,820
Some opportunities
are coming our way.

17
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,689
We got some big ideas,
and pretty soon...

18
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,125
This is Fred and mordechai.

19
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,493
My roommates.

20
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,828
Which is temporary.

21
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,097
That is a situation
i am resolving.

22
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,299
-Whatever.
I have bills to pay.

23
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,001
-Okay, I can change.

24
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,769
You let me to move back in...
-Move in?

25
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,037
With me and Doug?
-Sure!

26
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,973
I can crash on the couch
or whatever.

27
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,675
Wait, so that's it?

28
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,478
Well, what about tomorrow?
Am I still picking up Harry?

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,946
Sarah, he has all his stuff
over here.

30
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,682
Like, all his toys
and his favorite things.

31
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,018
Look, he loves this penguin guy.

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,221
Sarah, come on.

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,133
I'm gonna come.

34
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,301
I'm gonna come.

35
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,170
-Use a sock.

36
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,972
-Okay.

37
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,216
Oh!

38
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,251
Oh!

39
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,896
-I have five rooms and laundry.

40
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,699
-Oh, okay.

41
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,167
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,375
-That's it?

43
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,743
-I can get more.

44
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,015
Car keys.

45
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,150
So you don't have
to take the bus.

46
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,474
-You know, Carl sagan
was actually

47
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,976
a pretty
strong amateur player himself.

48
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,479
When he wasn't stargazing,
he was serving.

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,825
He's got to be paying her.

50
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,960
-Check it out.

51
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,128
-What is that -- a motor home?

52
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,763
-No, it's a gold mine.

53
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,931
It's a traveling motel.

54
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,833
The motel with wheels.

55
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,436
-I don't get it.
-It's -- well, you know,

56
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,938
most of the time,
people go<i> to</i> a motel.

57
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,674
The traveling motel
comes to you.

58
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,076
-Why would I want a motel
to come to me?

59
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,678
Unless I'm like
a homeless person?

60
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,647
Is this a shelter?
-It's for the discerning guest.

61
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,117
For people who want to travel
under the radar, incognito.

62
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,952
-This is worse
than your last idea.

63
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,487
Come on, man.
I got to make some money.

64
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,289
-It's all in the way
you market it.

65
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,792
And for the record, a portable
battery charger is a great idea.

66
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,628
-It was a battery charger
powered by batteries.

67
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,962
It makes no sense.

68
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,297
-Whatever.

69
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,132
You see the ad?

70
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,068
-What could she possibly see
in him?

71
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,473
-He's a landowner.

72
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,375
Where she's from,
that's a big deal.

73
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,811
-Where is she from?

74
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,846
-Not here.

75
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,348
-Yeah, well, his aunt
owns this place.

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,817
He's just the manager.

77
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,485
-You ever manage anything?

78
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,621
-You have a shitty little
personality. You know that?

79
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,958
-This type of advertising
pays off big-time.

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,326
It's the same type of stuff
I'm gonna be doing

81
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,661
with traveling motel.

82
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,995
And if you get in now,

83
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,731
I'll make you a silent partner.

84
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,232
-Well, someone needs to be.

85
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,001
-Read it.

86
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,871
The gateway to happiness."

87
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,406
Why is the name in French?

88
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,675
-Uh, it's more sophisticated.

89
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:20,078
-"Featuring breathtaking
scenery, outdoor activities,

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,346
and free Wi-Fi."

91
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,415
Wait, there's Internet here?
-No.

92
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,851
-Then why are you advertising
that you have it?

93
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,388
-You guys buy lottery tickets?

94
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,056
It's up to like $40 million.

95
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,858
-You know
you're like a hundred times

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,394
more likely to get struck by
lightning than win that thing?

97
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,896
-Although it kind of seems like
you already won the lottery --

98
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,331
with the maid.

99
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,234
-She's not the maid.
-She cleans my room.

100
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,669
-Yeah, well, I know
she's the maid, but she also --

101
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,706
-give you hand jobs.
-She has a name.

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,441
It's lupita.
-Oh.

103
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,410
-What you should be doing
with your money is investing it

104
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,045
into something solid,
like the traveling motel.

105
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,881
-It's gonna be
a pretty big deal.

106
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:59,117
-Yeah.

107
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,719
-Why didn't Fred
take out the trash?

108
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,454
-You fired Fred.

109
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,890
-Well, he still lives here.
Might as well keep working.

110
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,625
-I don't think
he knows he's fired.

111
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,727
-Delores says
we can't afford him.

112
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,530
Oh, hey, check this out.

113
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,533
Someone left this in room five.

114
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,402
Looks real, huh?

115
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,404
-Uh, speaking of your aunt,
she called twice.

116
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,408
-What did she say?
-Call her back.

117
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,110
Oh, and the phone company
called.

118
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,379
They said they're gonna turn
off the phones.

119
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,882
You pay the bill?

120
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,418
You need to get that chair
off the roof.

121
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,153
It's not professional.

122
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,093
- Come on, Fred.

123
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,261
You at least got to swing at it,
buddy.

124
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,063
You got to try, okay?

125
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,823
So...

126
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,825
You and Chad, huh?

127
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,661
Doing it.

128
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,129
I, uh...

129
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,867
I think I should let you know --
Chad's a liar.

130
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,301
-Liar?

131
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,438
-Yeah. Pathological,
among other things.

132
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,039
You know he doesn't even
own this motel, right?

133
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,274
It's his aunt's.

134
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,675
She doesn't even like him.

135
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,178
-My father was a liar.
-Well, yeah, okay.

136
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,479
So you get what I'm
talking about. You know.

137
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,314
-He used to wear
my mother's dresses.

138
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,049
-I don't know if Chad
gets into all that, but...

139
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,952
-When I was a kid,
i caught him putting on makeup.

140
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,489
He told me he was going
to a Halloween party.

141
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,725
It was in June.

142
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:50,495
-So he wasn't really
going to the party.

143
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,832
-I hate liars.

144
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,468
-Yeah, I can see why you would.

145
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,737
Okay, we'll see you later, then.

146
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,342
Hey.

147
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,810
Freddy.

148
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,865
- Damn, man.

149
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,833
I got blood everywhere.

150
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,202
-You sure this is it?

151
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,904
-This is the address.

152
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,373
-It don't look three-star to me.

153
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,175
-Yeah, well, we wouldn't even
be here if you hadn't gotten us

154
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,710
in this mess, anyway.

155
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,846
-I told you he was dead
when I showed up, man.

156
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,715
And even if that was true,

157
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,216
it don't explain
why we got to be out here

158
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,285
in the middle of nowhere.

159
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,055
-Too much heat on us back there.

160
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,291
This is better.

161
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,594
-Maybe we can go golfing
while we out here.

162
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,090
-Damn.

163
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,225
You're like traveling
with a girl.

164
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,614
-Yo, what up, my brothers?

165
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,915
-We need a room.

166
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,251
-Dope.

167
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,621
There you go.
Did you see our ad?

168
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,424
-Said this place was French
and it had three stars.

169
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,859
-Certainly did.

170
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,395
Our guests
rave about our pool and cabana.

171
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,832
And we have
a complimentary breakfast,

172
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,734
which I'm sure
you two read about.

173
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,972
And for just a small fee,

174
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,874
I can upgrade you two
to our deluxe suite,

175
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,342
which, you --

176
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,215
you know what? Actually, I'm
just gonna waive the fee on that

177
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,218
and hook a brother up, right?

178
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,520
Great.

179
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,388
How long will you
be staying with us?

180
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,024
-We don't know yet.
-Not a problem.

181
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,959
-Hey, they got a golf course
around here?

182
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,896
-If there is one,
it will be in here.

183
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,032
All right.

184
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,068
So, let's see.

185
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,071
"Garage, go-kart.

186
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,305
Golf course."

187
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,043
Sure, yeah. You -- you
go ahead and keep that.

188
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,912
-You got clubs?

189
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,413
-I think the manager might.

190
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,416
And, you know, for $10,
i can rent those to you.

191
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,351
You know what? I'm just gonna
waive the fee on that, too.

192
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,688
Keep it real.

193
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,056
-The key.

194
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:05,557
-Right.

195
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,564
Hope you gentlemen enjoy
your stay at pe-tit paradis.

196
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,366
If you need anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

197
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,203
Stay black.

198
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,871
-Those guys your cousins
or something?

199
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,339
-They just checked in.

200
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,907
I think the ad is working.

201
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,576
-They don't look right.

202
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,111
Keep an eye on them.

203
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,213
-Did you just put that thing
in the freezer?

204
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,914
-Why? She call again?
-No.

205
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,683
Uh, it's just
not good for business.

206
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:32,851
-You said the ad was working.

207
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,587
-Yeah, it is.

208
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,056
One more thing --
do you have any golf clubs?

209
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,091
They asked for them.

210
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,559
-Shed.

211
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,763
20 bucks.

212
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,231
-Oh, and I think, uh,

213
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,899
they were pretty interested
in the pool area,

214
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,335
so we might want
to clean that up for them.

215
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,515
-Where's the other bed?

216
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,128
So, I'm gonna call 'em,
figure out what time

217
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,897
tomorrow we should meet up.
-Whoa, whoa.

218
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,933
You ain't ever really been
all that good with the phone.

219
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,067
I should probably handle this.

220
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,171
Yeah.

221
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,106
Now, they ain't gonna like
a three-star motel.

222
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,774
These people got money.

223
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,810
Probably classy.

224
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,917
It's ringing.

225
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,018
Hello?!

226
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,587
Yes, hi.
Is this, um...

227
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:43,655
Are you Asian?

228
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,989
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's great.

229
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,658
Listen, my name is prince,

230
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,594
and I work with an associate
of yours named Armando.

231
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,262
I'm pretty sure he talked to you
about some stuff

232
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,965
we were looking to unload.
-Yeah.

233
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,100
-Okay, yeah, well,
he came down with something,

234
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,037
and he asked us to take care
of this for him.

235
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,106
Okay, so we are -- we're
holed up just outside of town

236
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,943
at a hotel called...

237
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,111
Le petit paradis.
-Hotel?

238
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,546
-Mm-hmm.
That's right.

239
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,982
They have a --
oh, they got a pool

240
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,383
and, uh, like a breakfast,

241
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,685
I think.

242
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,053
-Tomorrow.
-Oh.

243
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,556
Oh, okay.

244
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,058
Yeah, he seemed chill.

245
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,027
Wants us to call back tomorrow.

246
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,197
-What's up with that voice?
-What voice?

247
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,518
-What's going on?

248
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
-What?

249
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,788
-Where's Zack?

250
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,872
Hey, man.

251
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,073
You want a beer?

252
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,776
-No, I'm good.

253
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:16,547
-You ever been to Phoenix?
-I don't know. Where is it?

254
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,450
-It's kind of far, I think.

255
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,886
You know, that lottery
is up past $40 million.

256
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,621
Might be worth a shot.

257
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,457
Probably buy a lot of motor
homes for that kind of cash.

258
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,894
-Uh-huh.

259
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,731
-Well, I'm off
to find a legitimate job.

260
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,600
-Good luck.

261
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,443
<i> -The powerball lotto is up</i>
<i> to a whopping $44 million,</i>

262
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,911
<i> if you can believe it.</i>

263
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,479
<i>I've even bought a few tickets,</i>

264
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,381
<i> and I'm thinking</i>
<i> of going back for more.</i>

265
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,849
<i> What about you?</i>

266
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,656
<i> -You bet.</i>

267
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:03,061
<i> -So, you bought some,</i>
<i> or are you saying "you bet,"</i>

268
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,829
<i> like I'm a gambler?</i>

269
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,798
<i> Or are you saying you</i>
<i> don't believe I bought mine?</i>

270
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,601
<i> You're not being</i>
<i> entirely clear here.</i>

271
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,437
<i> What does that mean exactly,</i>

272
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,339
<i> "you bet"?</i>

273
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,809
- Zack!

274
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,445
<i> -I think you just</i>
<i> don't understand.</i>

275
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,447
<i> You see, I asked a question,</i>
<i> and you replied...</i>

276
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,865
-Room, please.

277
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,034
-$27.50.

278
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,769
Sign here and here.

279
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,281
In advance.

280
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,558
-There's $30.

281
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,682
Who's that?

282
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,887
-Oh, that's lupita.
She works here.

283
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,222
-Lupita.

284
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,393
L-u-p-i-t-a.

285
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,562
-I'm Zack -- z-a-c --

286
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,397
-room 23.

287
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,533
Down the hall, to your right.

288
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,402
-Be staying long?
-Maybe.

289
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,604
Tell me, did a couple
of African-American fellows

290
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,872
like yourself check in recently?

291
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,274
-Oh, yeah.
There are these two --

292
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,876
-we can't give out
that kind of information.

293
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,778
-Great.

294
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,382
Room 23, down the hall?

295
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,117
-Hope you enjoy your stay
at pe-tit paradis.

296
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,487
Oh.

297
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,126
-I don't trust that one either.

298
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,528
-That ad is really working,
though, right?

299
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,234
-20 bucks for those clubs.

300
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,369
-That's what I told them.

301
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,109
-Here's the trash.

302
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,644
-The trash is supposed
to go out by the fence.

303
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,556
-Hey, beautiful.

304
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,493
Can I come in?

305
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,727
-You're a liar.

306
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,162
-A liar?
About what?

307
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,131
-You don't own this hotel.

308
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,600
-Well, I mean,
technically, it's my aunt's,

309
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,834
but I never said --

310
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,103
I mean, if she dies or anything,

311
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,305
I'm the next of kin, so...

312
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,440
I'd inherit it.

313
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,008
-How much is it worth?

314
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,443
-Not much.

315
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,578
-You're pathologic,
just like my father.

316
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,180
And I know
you're stealing money.

317
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,281
-I'm not stealing.

318
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:14,152
I'm -- I'm borrowing -- for us.

319
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,820
<i> -You ever do one</i>
<i> of those office pools</i>

320
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,355
<i> where everyone in the company</i>
<i> buys a ticket</i>

321
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,223
<i> and then splits the winnings?</i>

322
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,827
<i> -Nope.</i>

323
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,097
<i> -Well, they're a real hoot.</i>

324
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,699
<i> I'll tell you, you know,</i>
<i> we did one back in '95...</i>

325
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,737
<i> ...when I was on wknrw.</i>

326
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,706
- Hello?

327
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,675
Yeah, they're here.

328
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,343
Oh, sure, easy.

329
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,546
I figure I could take them out,
be back before dark.

330
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,683
Huh?

331
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,120
I thought
this was the last of them.

332
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,821
Well, I can, but I think
it's a waste of time.

333
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,690
-What about<i> my</i> time?
-No, no, no, no, no.

334
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,691
Your time is very valuable.

335
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,426
I just thought --

336
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,264
you're the boss.

337
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,742
-Oh. Ahem.

338
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,478
Fred left the trash by the door.

339
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,083
Oh.

340
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,560
<i> -...really don't care</i>
<i> about a pregnant panda.</i>

341
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,096
<i> You want to know why?</i>
<i> I'll tell you anyway.</i>

342
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,098
<i> Because...</i>
<i> With the amount of money</i>

343
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,434
<i> I can win in this lottery</i>
<i> a few days from now,</i>

344
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:40,004
<i> I can buy a whole pack</i>

345
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:43,908
<i> or whatever you call</i>
<i> a bunch of pandas.</i>

346
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,658
-Pathologic.

347
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,561
This whole damn thing's mine.

348
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,572
Son of a bitch.

350
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,621
Motherfucker!

351
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:04,989
What the hell, man?!

352
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,458
-Don't throw rocks
in my pool, asshole!

353
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,327
-Geez! Fine!

354
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,929
Your aunt's pool anyway,
you fat prick.

355
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,674
-Hey.

356
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,042
Hey!

357
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,197
Hey, what's happening, my man?

358
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,798
-What's up with that room
you got us in?

359
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,700
-Oh, the honeymoon suite.

360
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,168
It's the bomb, right?

361
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,538
-It's only got one bed.
-Right.

362
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,907
That makes sense,
'cause it's for a honeymoon.

363
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,143
-I look like
I'm on my honeymoon?

364
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,678
-We'll get you another bed.

365
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,979
-Them the clubs
you want me to use?

366
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,848
-Oh, yeah.
They're a little dusty.

367
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,550
But I'm gonna get 'em cleaned
up, and they'll be good as new.

368
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:10,321
-And the phone ain't working.

369
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,556
Shit ain't three stars.

370
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,131
-The phones
might be back on tomorrow.

371
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,390
-What?

372
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,158
-Hey,
you know those two black guys?

373
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,827
-No, I don't know
any black people.

374
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,062
-Oh, well, I put them
in the honeymoon suite.

375
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,165
-So? What?

376
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,434
-Chad has a strange feeling
about them.

377
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,937
-Yeah?
Well, I wouldn't trust Chad.

378
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:36,240
Saw him stealing money
out of the register last night.

379
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,675
-Well, he wants me
to keep an eye on them.

380
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,076
Thinks they might be
drug dealers.

381
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,478
-Yeah, maybe.

382
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,279
-They like golf.

383
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,181
Drug dealers golf?

384
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,287
What's "Sarah's mix"?

385
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,491
-Get out of my shit!

386
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,326
-So, you gonna come?
-Yeah, whatever.

387
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,661
I got to pick up my kid, though.

388
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,363
-All right.

389
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,432
-Yo, get up, man.

390
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,133
We got to call him.

391
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,602
-So call him.

392
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,537
-You the one he knows.

393
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,674
-Phones working,
they ain't working.

394
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,976
Man, this place is janky.

395
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,611
-Just agree to whatever he says,

396
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,679
and don't talk
in that little-kid voice.

397
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,847
Tell him 2:00.

398
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,516
-Stand over there, man.

399
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,417
You stress me out.

400
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,700
Hello?
This is prince.

401
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:41,171
Yes, hi. We wanted to set up
a time for tomorrow.

402
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,507
We were thinking...

403
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,677
2:00 in the lobby.

404
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,179
Oh.
He Asian, too, right?

405
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,649
-Hey. Money, money.

406
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,552
So, did you and Armando
talk about the money?

407
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,719
-Yes. $2,500.

408
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,056
-$2,500?

409
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,926
Actually,
we were thinking $3,000.

410
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,427
You know, stuff came up.

411
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,862
-Fine.
-Okay.

412
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,263
All good.

413
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,100
-I said agree with him.

414
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,168
- I did.

415
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,736
He was cool with $3,000.

416
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,605
He's sending his nephew
tomorrow.

417
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,341
-His nephew?
He say why?

418
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,876
-Probably got better things
to do

419
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,278
than hang out
in this nasty-ass desert motel.

420
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,450
But it looks like we can hit up
that golf course after all.

421
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,252
-What's wrong with you, man?

422
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:46,403
-Shit.

423
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,038
-Hello?
-Chad!

424
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,139
-Hi, aunt Laura.

425
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,808
-What's wrong with the phones?

426
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,911
-No, what do you mean?

427
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, that's weird.

428
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,448
Yeah.

429
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,917
I'll get right on that.

430
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,819
Accounting books?
What for?

431
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,120
No, totally.

432
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,556
Yeah,
we keep really good records.

433
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,427
Absolutely.
It's none of my business.

434
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,430
Yeah, I'll get those to you
as soon as I can.

435
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,265
Yeah, fresh one last night.

436
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,667
He's in the freezer.

437
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,435
He's a really big one.

438
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,847
How long has this been out?

439
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,682
-I told you they called.

440
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:32,783
You pay the bill?

441
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,852
-It was just on.

442
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,520
We have accounting books?

443
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,022
-On the shelf behind me.

444
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,296
-Aren't these supposed to be in
a computer program or something?

445
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:50,000
-You're the manager.

446
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,704
-Why is he still here?
-He has no place to go.

447
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,939
-I got a Hawaiian greaser
trying to steal my girlfriend,

448
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:58,976
and he's feeding my cereal
to his Guinea pig.

449
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,678
-That's a hamster.

450
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,881
And if you think about it,
he's basically working for food.

451
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,316
-Hamster ain't working.

452
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,485
I bet those black guys
have money.

453
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,853
-Why would you say that?

454
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,321
-Come on.

455
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,525
You ever heard
of black dudes playing golf?

456
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,460
-Well, Tiger Woods plays golf.

457
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,629
He's black, right?

458
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,998
And then my uncle Leon.

459
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,533
He played golf once. He's black.

460
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,037
-Good morning.

461
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,473
How was your sleep?
-Yeah, fine.

462
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,475
So, what's the deal
with breakfast?

463
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,743
-It's on the house.

464
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,213
Come on, let's get you some.

465
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,915
Here you go.

466
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:41,752
One complimentary breakfast.

467
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,387
One bowl per guest.

468
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,924
You need anything else,
just let us know.

469
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,759
-What's the story with lupita?

470
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,934
-Keep an eye
on that son of a bitch.

471
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,704
-I thought I was supposed
to watch those black guys golf.

472
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,406
-Watch everything.

473
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:06,376
-Fred, too?

474
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,811
Paranoid fucker.

475
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,426
-Hey, beautiful.

476
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,396
Harmonica.

477
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,900
It's kind of my trademark.

478
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,869
Oh.

479
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,205
Lottery ticket, huh?

480
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,807
You know you're more likely
to get hit by lightning

481
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,410
than win that thing?

482
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,279
-Yes.

483
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,684
-Adiós.

484
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,439
-Good idea.

485
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,009
What brothers
you know play golf?

486
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,510
-Tiger Woods.
-Tiger Woods.

487
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,312
That's one person.
Name another person.

488
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,448
Name one other black golfer.
-Michael Jordan, man.

489
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,951
-Michael Jordan lost a billion
dollars playing golf, man.

490
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,187
Michael Jordan.

491
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,030
- Nasty.

492
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,401
-Excuse me, fellas.

493
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,988
You guys are golfers, huh?

494
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,857
-Yo, what up, bros?!

495
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,827
-You get that mattress?

496
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,396
-Things got crazy busy
last night, yo -- straight up.

497
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,965
-Man, what's up
with these clubs, man?

498
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,499
Said they'd be better
after you cleaned them.

499
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,069
-Yeah, a lot
of that wouldn't come off.

500
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,504
But, you know,
we're currently in the process

501
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,039
of changing management,
so a lot of --

502
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,709
-best be in the process
of getting me a mattress.

503
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,011
-Yeah, and you might want
to check on gramps over there.

504
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,247
He don't look too good.

505
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,182
-The pool's gonna be ready soon.

506
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,718
It's gonna be off the hook.
Mad bitches.

507
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,654
And, you know, we're opening
a mobile branch of our motel,

508
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,489
so get on our mailing list,

509
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,659
and, you know, we'll keep you
apprised of things like that.

510
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,494
Okay, peace out.

511
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,165
-Changing management?

512
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,867
Little dude got problems.

513
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,969
-Yeah, he's not the only one.

514
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,741
-Hey, did you say
we have an extra mattress?

515
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,076
-Why?
You want to buy one?

516
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,512
-No, they need one
in the honeymoon suite.

517
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,147
-What are those guys up to?

518
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,457
-Just in time for Christmas.

519
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,159
-What the hell
does that even mean?

520
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,045
-Hey, man.

521
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,613
- Hey, brother.

522
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,816
Come on.
-Okay.

523
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,217
Yeah, hug it out.
-Love.

524
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,254
-I know.
I feel it.

525
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,422
I'm here to pick up Harry.

526
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:39,823
-Yes.

527
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,959
I love that little kid.
-I know you do.

528
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,260
-He's so special, isn't he?

529
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,929
-He's my child, so I'm aware.

530
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,431
-Okay, I'm gonna pick him up
tomorrow afternoon.

531
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,333
-Yep, cool.
-That's his safety seat.

532
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,234
There's a change of clothes
in the backpack.

533
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,502
Make sure he's in bed by 8:00.

534
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,438
-Babe...
-What else? What else?

535
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,906
-Tranquil.
-Yep, it's cool.

536
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,574
We're just gonna get
some ice cream, hang out.

537
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,476
-Hey, little man.

538
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,677
Give us a handshake.

539
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,746
One, two, three.
One, two.

540
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,481
-Okay, that's enough of that.

541
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,250
Let's go and have a conversation
about appropriate touching,

542
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,686
'cause what he is doing
is not what should be.

543
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,488
-I like your pants.

544
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,979
-Good morning.

545
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,281
Please see your receipts?

546
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,995
All right.
You're all good.

547
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,364
Did you get a copy
of the course rules?

548
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,233
-No, man.
Didn't see that.

549
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,101
-Please take one.

550
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,840
It's everyone's responsibility
to know the rules.

551
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,243
Okay?

552
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,111
Have a good day, gentlemen.

553
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,099
-Just think of this
as a 4-foot manhole.

554
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,767
Try to get it close.

555
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,403
Just back and through.

556
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,271
Real smooth.

557
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,984
You ever see a manhole before?

558
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,655
- Oh.

559
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,724
What are you up to?

560
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,526
-Let me see those.

561
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,499
They're just golfing.

562
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,367
-Just stay down.

563
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,305
-I still don't see
why we need to sell right away.

564
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,275
I could have got them Asian
dudes up to $5,000 -- at least.

565
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,945
-They were expecting to buy it
off of Armando for $2,500.

566
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,315
You think they gonna just
double it, simple as that?

567
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,918
Why do you want
to sell drugs, anyway?

568
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,854
Why don't you go back to school,
be a doctor or something,

569
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,757
instead of being out here
upholding the stereotypes?

570
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,793
Except that outfit -- that's
definitely not a stereotype.

571
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,562
I don't --
i don't know what that is.

572
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,947
-Oh, shit!

573
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,982
Something's happening.

574
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,452
-Afternoon, gentlemen.

575
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,188
Gonna need
to check your receipts.

576
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,489
-Didn't you just check us?

577
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,324
-At the first tee?

578
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,626
-Look, kanye, I'm not here
to argue with you.

579
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,495
I'm here to do a job.
-Kanye?

580
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,063
-Looks like you got
one set of clubs there.

581
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,734
Gonna have to write you
a warning for sharing clubs.

582
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,303
-What's wrong with sharing?

583
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,306
-Every golfer has to have
their own set of clubs.

584
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,907
It's course policy.
It's in the rules.

585
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,409
I gave you the rules.

586
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,311
-This power done gone
to your head, little man.

587
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,413
-Wait, wait.
How much that cost?

588
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,650
-Nothing.

589
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,852
They don't let me
write citations.

590
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,690
-Would it just be easier for you
to just warn us, like, verbally?

591
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,925
-Look, q-tip,
this isn't the hood, okay?

592
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,860
Not gonna get off that easy.

593
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,897
Not today.
Not on my turf.

594
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,099
-He's writing something.

595
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,569
Maybe it's a check
or a prescription.

596
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,972
-Hey, is that the guy
from the motel?

597
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,445
-Oh, shit!
Get down!

598
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,313
-Where's Harry?

599
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,219
-What the...

600
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,622
-Name.
-John Wayne.

601
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,890
-John...Wayne.

602
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,792
W-a-y...
-Get back here.

603
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,527
Come on! Harry!

604
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,599
-Lesson learned.

605
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,468
Have a good day, Mr. Wayne.

606
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,871
-Hey, did you see that kid

607
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:59,109
standing over there
a second ago?

608
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,910
-What are you talking about?

609
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,345
Here.

610
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,420
-John Wayne.

611
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,589
More like Lil Wayne.

612
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:15,125
-Why's the guy from 23 here?

613
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,128
Maybe Chad was right.
-I don't know.

614
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,097
There's got to be some way
for us to cash in on this.

615
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,632
-Cash in on what?

616
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,900
From him?

617
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,737
-You were right --
this thing is much bigger

618
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,738
than the two africans.

619
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,273
-Of course it is.
-Yeah.

620
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,508
No, I know, I know, I know.

621
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,842
I'm saying that you're right.

622
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,411
You<i> were</i> right.

623
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,414
Yeah, all right, well...

624
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,249
Prick.

625
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,693
-Do you think that creepy guy
in the golf cart was a mule?

626
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,894
Whoa!
You brought a gun?!

627
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:25,995
-Of course I brought a gun.

628
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,997
I'm babysitting.
Hey, buddy.

629
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,400
We don't tell your mom
about this kind of stuff, okay?

630
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,098
-Why are you in my room?

631
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,303
-Come.

632
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,041
This is your room.

633
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:16,513
<i>-All these come with a four-day</i>
<i> limited money-back guarantee.</i>

634
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,048
-You want to watch TV with us?

635

<i> the toll-free number</i>

-You like it here?

638
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,266
-I miss my brother.

639
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,802
I send him money.

640
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,004
-I guess he appreciates it.

641
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,650
-I think you're supposed
to use chlorine. That's bleach.

642
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,922
-Is that bleach?

643
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,790
-Do it yourself, then.

644
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,595
-He's got to be in on it.
-On what?

645
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,397
-Come on, let's go.

646
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,336
How's it going?

647
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,671
-Good.

648
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:15,805
Real good.

649
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,574
How you fellas?

650
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,213
-You in a jug band or something?

651
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,254
Security cameras.
-For what?

652
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,089
-Find out
what's going on around here.

653
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,192
This could be our ticket out.
Come on.

654
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,327
-Wait, what?

655
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,628
What ticket? Where?

656
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,365
Oh, shit.

657
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,834
-You get that bed?
-Almost ready.

658
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,437
-What, are you having them
custom-made or something?

659
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,472
-How did the clubs
work out for you?

660
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,974
-Things are dangerous.

661
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,876
The head flew off of this one.

662
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,744
-Oh, great.

663
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,349
-What are you doing?
-Jesus.

664
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,483
Nothing.

665
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,153
Nothing.
Just fixing the books.

666
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,388
What?

667
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,156
-Did you get the mattress?

668
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,491
-What mattress?

669
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,993
-The one
for the honeymoon suite.

670
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,461
-Oh!

671
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:13,763
Jesus, I got to do everything
around here.

672
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,672
-You think that little dude
at the desk is retarded?

673
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:26,643
-Maybe he got asperger.
-What's that?

674
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,746
-It's when you act
all messed up.

675
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,147
-He definitely got it, then.

676
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,320
-Me...Llamo.

677
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,189
Me...Llamo...

678
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,558
Ken.

<i> -Maybe stay inside</i>
<i> with the missus.</i>

680

this crazy penguin guy?

684
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,873
You used to love him.

685
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,242
Huh? All right.

686
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,877
How about Teddy bear?
What does he do?

687
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,712
Is he fun?

688
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,014
Nothing?

689
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,029
That's amazing.

690
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,698
Hey.

691
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,800
Nothing.
Just hanging out with my kid.

692
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,202
Did you find it?

693
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,637
All right.
Well, keep looking.

694
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,772
There's got to be someplace
that sells them.

695
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,975
-Ugh!

696
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,776
I have to do everything
around here.

697
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,783
-Bubble wrap, huh?

698
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,921
What do you think about Phoenix?

699
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:48,424
Yeah. Me too.

700
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,374
Phew.

701
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,687
-Yes?
-Hola.

702
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,796
Um...

703
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,364
Uh...

704
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,066
-In the secret business,
are you the boss?

705
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,168
-Yeah.
Yeah, pretty much.

706
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,771
I mean, I'd say I'm my own boss.

707
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,306
-We'll talk tomorrow.

708
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,850
Hey, pal.
How's it going?

709
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,242
Ah.

710
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,943
How you doing, old-timer?

711
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,149
Nice rat.

712
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,752
Oh, boy.

713
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:33,656
One of those days, huh?
I hear you.

714
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:37,794
You know, sometimes, I just
want to say to hell with it.

715
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,095
Am I right?

716
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:43,766
You know, a man
reaches a point in his life

717
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:47,436
when he realizes
there's more to it than work.

718
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,238
You know, maybe...

719
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,840
Maybe a family.

720
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,244
-Everything's okay.

721
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,979
Just go to your happy place.

722
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,698
-You really love that old rat,
don't you?

723
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,668
-How's that?

724
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,672
-That's what it's all about,
isn't it?

725
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,740
Love.

726
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,479
You know what?

727
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,815
You're all right, old-timer.

728
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:36,586
You need anything at all,
don't hesitate, okay?

729
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,344
-Yes?

730
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,646
Is there something
i can help you with?

731
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,047
-I brought this for...

732
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,196
Hello?

733
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,365
Hi, aunt Laura.
Yeah, no.

734
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:25,268
No, I wasn't asleep. I was
just painting and fixing stuff.

735
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,404
-You have my damn books?
-The accounting books, yeah.

736
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,039
Yeah, those are good to go.

737
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,441
I'll just -- I'll bring
those by later on tonight.

738
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,077
-Now.
-Or now is good, too.

739
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,545
-You get that mouse for me?

740
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:37,947
-Yeah, I got your mouse.

741
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,082
-You better.
If you don't, it's your ass.

742
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,118
-I got to go.

743
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:48,691
Hey!

744
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:51,460
This is private property!

745
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,196
Wait.

746
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:56,432
Wait up for me.

747
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,967
Come on.

748
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,133
Where's my mouse?

749
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,768
-I threw it away.

750
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,570
-Fuck!

751
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,329
-Well, cereal
falls into the grain category

752
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:34,964
in the food pyramid.

753
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:37,666
And for the longest time,
cheese was different than dairy.

754
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,069
They changed that, though.

755
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:44,974
-Okay. So, this guy
is supposed to be the best.

756
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,876
-All right.

757
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,377
I feel weird about bringing him.

758
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,246
Is it gonna be safe?

759
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,718
You okay, buddy?

760
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,427
-Bed's here.

761
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,295
Smell like cat piss.

762
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:18,407
-He dead?

763
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,876
-I think he's sleeping.

764
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,244
-Damn.

765
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,615
Poor motherfucker
got a sock for a pet.

766
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,551
-Yo, gramps...

767
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,886
You all right?

768
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,322
-Y-yes, sir.
Yes, sir, right away.

769
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,766
-I'm gonna catch some sun.

770
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,559
What the...

771
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,804
- Baby.

772
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,405
-Aunt Laura.

773
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,107
Hey, who<i> is</i> this guy?

774
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,610
-That's Jean-Paul.

775
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:29,445
You bring my mouse, fat boy?

776
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,814
-Uh, I got you
something different.

777
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,588
-What the hell is that?
-A hamster.

778
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,091
-I know it's a hamster,
you dumb son of a bitch.

779
00:52:42,093 --> 00:52:43,692
Why did you bring it
into my house?

780
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:46,428
-I just thought the snake
might want a little variety.

781
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,763
And he's alive.

782
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,932
-What you think, j.P.?
You like variety?

783
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,801
-Dirty son of a bitch.

784
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,806
Okay, doughboy, give it here.
-Hey.

785
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,308
Hey, you never told me
who this guy is.

786
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,610
He's been creeping
around the motel,

787
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,979
messing with the phones.
-Jean-Paul!

788
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,681
-Yeah, I know.
She said that already, okay?

789
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,483
Just let the adults talk
for a second.

790
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:11,453
-He's a private investigator,
specializes in real estate.

791
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,822
-Why would you hire
an investigator?

792
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:16,692
-I didn't<i> hire</i> him.
I'm<i> fucking</i> him.

793
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,829
-Did you bring the money books?

794
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,200
-Yeah. I'm still working on most
of them, but that one's done.

795
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,171
-You stealing from me,
butterball?

796
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:30,506
-Stealing?
No. Why?

797
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:32,474
-'Cause if I find out you are,

798
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,376
j.P. Will eat your nuts
for lunch.

799
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,012
-He also tells me the numbers

800
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,581
should be inside a computer.

801
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,182
Shouldn't take you
more than five minutes

802
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,418
to add them up.
-Yeah -- well, yeah.

803
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,820
I told Zack
to get on that, you know,

804
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,989
but you know how he is.

805
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:48,090
-No.

806
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:52,194
How is he?
-Absent-minded?

807
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:55,898
-Just because your daddy was in
the habit of putting his pecker

808
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,201
into nasty old holes,
and one of them was my sister's,

809
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:00,736
don't make us family.

810
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,404
I find out
you're up to something,

811
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,007
I will throw your fat ass
out on the street

812
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,410
fast as you can say
the word "doughnut."

813
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,079
You got it?
-Yeah, got it.

814
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,947
-Then go get
the books I asked for

815
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,682
and quit acting like a pussy!

816
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,722
And don't bring me
no more fucking hamsters

817
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,690
when I ask for mice!

818
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,763
Retarded son of a bitch.

819
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,199
-"Pecker in a nasty hole."

820
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,834
Don't need this shit.

821
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,326
-Yo, I wouldn't touch
that water, man.

822
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:58,994
Mess around
and get herpes or something.

823
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,797
-Uh-huh.
I'll see you out there.

824
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,071
Cup, cup, cup.

825
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,906
Ugh.

826
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,008
Uh-huh.

827
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,410
Hmm?

828
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,797
-Change your mind?
-I forgot something.

829
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,134
-Is this it?

830
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,806
-It's the right address.

831
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,249
Hello?

832
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,385
-Maybe he went out to lunch.
-Yeah.

833
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,787
And maybe he's drowning
in meth fumes.

834
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,327
-Hello?!

835
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,362
- Can I help you?

836
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:41,864
-Jesus.

837
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:44,533
Scared us.
Didn't see you there.

838
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,001
-Precisely.

839
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:49,872
You saw nothing, while I,
in turn, saw everything.

840
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:52,875
Now the information
is collected.

841
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,777
-What information?

842
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,550
-Oh. Does the little fighter
want a lolly?

843
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:02,918
Oh.

844
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,953
-Okay, I will hold on to that.

845
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,423
-So, what can Klaus do for you?

846
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,957
-Looking for a hidden camera.

847
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:12,561
- Aha.
Someone wants to do some spying?

848
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,298
I used to do
a bit of spying myself.

849
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:21,069
But then there was
some commotion.

850
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,539
I can no longer
go near the playground.

851
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,374
-Okay, stay real close to me.

852
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,380
-Excuse me, no.
This is Klaus' house, so...

853
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,787
- Is he bavarian?

854
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,723
-I don't know.
Is that in Phoenix?

855
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,993
- It's in Europe!

856
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,601
-This, I think, will be best.

857
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:55,437
Look, he has a camera,
keeping eyes on you.

858
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,605
-Okay, we'll take it.

859
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,907
- Donation, please.

860
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,343
You have any cash?
-No.

861
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:05,481
-You never have any cash --
i pay for everything!

862
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,949
Here.

863
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:08,116
-You don't have any Euros?

864
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,085
-I have $20 American.

865
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,956
Thank you.

866
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,357
-Enjoy your lolly,
little fighter.

867
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,959
-Don't talk to him.

868
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,862
-Bye-bye.

869
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,367

00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,261
<i> Give it to me straight.</i>
<i> What about baseball?</i>

886
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,996
-Damn it.
<i> -Are we winning?</i>

887
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,871
-Let's go, you sicko.

888
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:39,741
-Time to meet your maker, fella.

889
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,276
-Hold it!
-Whoa!

890
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,545
-Drop the hamster!
-That's what I was gonna do.

891
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,047
-No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Hold it.

892
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,883
-Which is it --
hold it or drop it?

893
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,217
-Uh...

894
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,720
Just...

895
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,355
Give him here, okay?

896
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,426
All right, all right.

897
00:59:57,428 --> 01:00:01,730
Now, who's gonna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

898
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:03,398
-Well, right now,

899
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,401
you're pointing a gun at me
and holding my hamster,

900
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,704
and I am about to get upset.

901
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:11,940
-Why's the dirty guy from the
motel stealing hamsters for you?

902
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,875
-I knew something like this
would happen.

903
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,477
Dumb bastard.

904
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,145
-So, what is it?

905
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,947
Selling 'em, huh?

906
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,248
Eating 'em? What?

907
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,417
-J.P. And I are vegetarians.

908
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,554
-You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

909
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,155
He's helpless.

910
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,626
Ain't right.

911
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,761
-Some help you are.

912
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,563
-He jumped me.

913
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:36,865
- The world's gone to hell.

914
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,973
-How long he been in there?

915
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,408
-A few minutes.

916
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,843
-He say anything?

917
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,578
-What's he supposed to say?

918
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,680
-You know, I don't think
he should be in there.

919
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:54,716
That motherfucker's
on borrowed time anyway.

920
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,962
-Hey, how are we gonna hide

921
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,497
a Teddy bear
in the honeymoon suite?

922
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,199
-Make sure your mom
gets these, okay?

923
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,969
Super-important.

924
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,839
And these slurpees
never happened, all right?

925
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,242
Come on. Let's teach you
how to shoot a gun.

926
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,952
Arm straight.

927
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,622
Slightly bend the knees.

928
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:35,957
Relax the neck.

929
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:38,226
Find your target.

930
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,661
Aim.

931
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:43,331
Pull the trigger.

932
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,433
-Did I hit it?

933
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,516
<i> -That's sports for now.</i>

934
01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:04,586
<i> What about that panda?</i>
<i> Any news there?</i>

935
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:05,754
<i> -Yep.</i>

936
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,495
-What up, bros?

937
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:15,197
Pretty sweet pool, huh?

938
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,866
-My aunt had a blow-up pool
better than this.

939
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,168
And she was a crackhead.
-Mm.

940
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,370
-Yeah, you might want
to check on the old man.

941
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,172
Dude hasn't moved in a while.

942
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,908
-And that mattress
smell like cat piss.

943
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,577
-Okay.
Can I speak to you for a minute?

944
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,479
Stay here.

945
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,686
Okay, I'm gonna
go to their room,

946
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:39,087
find a place
to put the Teddy-cam.

947
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,255
You keep an eye on him, okay?

948
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,590
-What do I tell them?

949
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,492
-Charm them.

950
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,564
-That kid play golf?

951
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:51,967
-No.

952
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,902
It's a pretty nice day,
though, huh?

953
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,237
-He got asperger?

954
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,606
-No, he doesn't have ass-- what?

955
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,908
-A lot of them wear funny
helmets and shit like that.

956
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,043
-This is a world war ii helmet.

957
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:05,113
It's a collector's item.
-If you say so.

958
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,848
Look like asperger to me.

959
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:14,422
Hey.

960
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,892
What's going on?
-I was cleaning.

961
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,794
-Up there?

962
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,562
-It was dirty.
-That's cool.

963
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:23,632
Uh, Chad asked me
to make the bed, 'cause...

964
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:25,467
He didn't do it.

965
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,485
-Where's Chris?

966
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,353
-I don't know.

967
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,526
-It's like a motor home with
all the amenities of a motel,

968
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:54,663
but instead of you going to it,
it comes to you.

969
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,364
-We look homeless?
-No, no, no, no, no.

970
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:58,633
It's for, like, if you want
to travel under the radar.

971
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,936
You know -- incognito.
-Incog-what?

972
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:03,138
-Well, you know, it's
all in the way you market it.

973
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,540
-Hey, sweetie.

974
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:06,541
What are you wearing?

975
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:07,843
Why is he in a helmet?

976
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,444
-That's actually
a world war ii helmet.

977
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,214
-Where's Chris?
-He had something he had to do.

978
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,815
-He got asperger?

979
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:15,517
-Dude, I already told you,
he does not have asp--

980
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,553
-okay, come on, sweetie.

981
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:19,955
-Sarah,
he's actually coming back,

982
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:21,389
so if you just want
to wait for him...

983
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,425
-I think it's gonna rain.

984
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,362
-Man, these people are crazy.

985
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:34,669
-Sarah, Sarah! Wait!

986
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,571
Wa--

987
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:40,308
shit!

988
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,110
-What's that?

989
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,183
<i> -I am attracted</i>
<i> to these little things.</i>

990
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:55,891
<i> I'll give it a Chinese name</i>
<i> like sabi or kung pao.</i>

991
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,035
-How we gonna know
what they look like?

992
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,370
-They Asian.

993
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:11,539
-They southeast Asian?
Korean? Japanese?

994
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,941
India's Asian.
They could be Indians.

995
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:15,710
-They're not Indian, man.
They just regular.

996
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:17,045
-Regular what?

997
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,680
-Just regular.
Come on.

998
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,448
Let's go.

999
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,352
-All right, all right.

1000
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:25,754
Oh.

1001
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,759
- Oh! Holy shit.

1002
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,027
Oh!

1003
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:33,395
How much
do you think it's worth?

1004
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,729
-A few thousand.
Maybe more.

1005
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,064
Enough to get Sarah back.

1006
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,132
-Buy the motor home!

1007
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,667
-Let's get the guns.

1008
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,625
-The books.

1009
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,811
Why are
all these Chinese people here?

1010
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:25,146
What's on your face?
-Uh...

1011
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,754
-You the asians?

1012
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,289
-All right, come on.

1013
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,691
No, no, no. Just one.
Y'all wait here.

1014
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,660
Grab some cereal or something.

1015
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:57,145
-Something
i can help you guys with?

1016
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,380
-Why?
Are you the waiter?

1017
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,817
-Breakfast is complimentary
for guests of the hotel only.

1018
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:05,153
-Oh, this is a hotel?

1019
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:06,821
Have you ever been to a hotel?

1020
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,523
-You got some eggs or something?

1021
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,959
-No, we need bacon.

1022
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,293
-Yeah, get some bacon, yo.

1023
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,634
What the hell?

1024
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:23,671
-Breakfast is complimentary
for guests of the hotel.

1025
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,340
- That's a bb gun.

1026
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:26,574
Aah!

1027
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:28,143
Dude!
-Don't shoot!

1028
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,978
-Outside.

1029
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,384
This is a professional place
of business.

1030
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,209
Milk costs money.

1031
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,578
I pay for all that.
-Drop it!

1032
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,281
-Whoa.
M-man, it's just a bb gun.

1033
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:07,549
-Who are you working for?

1034
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,616
-What?

1035
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,485
-Shoot him!

1036
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,389
-Awesome.

1037
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:15,690
-Why did you steal him?

1038
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,459
- How did you get that?

1039
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:18,927
Oh, I'm shot!

1040
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,261
It burns!

1041
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,531
Oh!
Oh, thank god.

1042
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:24,866
-Let's go.

1043
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,737
<i> -Winning ticket</i>
<i> has, indeed, been sold,</i>

1044
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:34,142
<i> and someone out there</i>
<i> is a very rich person.</i>

1045
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:35,910
-Did they see you take it?
-I don't think so.

1046
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,378
-Well, then
how would they know we have it?

1047
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,982
-They don't,
but they saw my kid and my wife.

1048
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:45,120
-Look, we just need to chill
for a minute, gather ourselves.

1049
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:47,822
- I can't take any chances.

1050
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:49,424
Remember how to use this?

1051
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:50,925
Okay, it's loaded,
so you just pull the trigger.

1052
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:54,095
Give me your keys.

1053
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,897
Okay, I'm gonna pull the car
around back.

1054
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:58,233
I'm gonna honk the horn and
come out through Fred's room.

1055
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,735
You got it?
Okay, what did I just say?

1056
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,470
-Wait for the honk,
through Fred's room.

1057
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,806
-Okay.
Wipe your nose.

1058
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,783
<i> -$7.8 million.</i>

1059
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,585
<i> That money could be yours,</i>

1060
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,921
<i> so let's get out our tickets,</i>
<i> cross your fingers,</i>

1061
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,623
<i> and get ready to play.</i>

1062
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,458
<i> The first white-ball numbers</i>
<i> for tonight</i>

1063
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,694
<i> are the numbers 11, 22,</i>

1064
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:30,331
<i> and rounding out the openers</i>
<i> is number 19.</i>

1065
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,267
<i> Now for the finals</i>
<i> and the powerball.</i>

1066
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,670
<i> First up is the number five,</i>
<i> one,</i>

1067
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,339
<i> and here we go</i>
<i> with tonight's powerball.</i>

1068
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,275
<i> Number 74.</i>

1069
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,610
<i> Once again, your powerball</i>
<i> numbers for this evening</i>

1070
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:47,649
<i> are the numbers 11,</i>
<i> 22, 19, 5, 1...</i>

1071
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:50,485
<i>...and the lucky powerball 74.</i>

1072
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:51,719
<i> Thanks for...</i>

1073
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,853
-What's up?

1074
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,156
What's up, nigga?

1075
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:29,490
Got a problem?

1076
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:33,394
<i> It is just now 2:00 P.M.,</i>

1077
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:39,100
<i> and we are here, moments away</i>
<i> from a literal pot of gold.</i>

1078
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:41,202
-Nice place, guys.

1079
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,870
-They gave us
the honeymoon suite.

1080
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,872
-Oh, that's nice, man.
Congratulations.

1081
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,041
- Yeah.

1082
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:49,010
-Oh, shit, no.
Leave it on.

1083
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,578
I forgot
this thing was happening.

1084
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,381
<i> -...standing by</i>
<i> with the powerball numbers.</i>

1085
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,083
<i> -Thanks.</i>
-This shit is rigged, yo!

1086
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:56,718
<i> -And here we are finally.</i>

1087
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,453
-Let's see the money.

1088
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,722
-Right here.

1089
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:03,157
Damn.
<i> -We stand at a guaranteed...</i>

1090
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,062
-I'm supposed
to check the stuff first.

1091
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,931
-It's all there.

1092
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,506
-It's good.

1093
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,879
Thank you very much, guys.

1094
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,381
Have a nice day.

1095
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:29,484
-Hey, yo.
Whose Teddy bear is that?

1096
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:32,587
-How the fuck do I know?
-It wasn't there a second ago.

1097
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,455
-It's ones.

1098
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,757
Oh!

1099
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:37,125
-Yo!

1100
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,559
Yo, get up, man!

1101
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:39,627
Yo, get up!

1102
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,562
What did you do?!

1103
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,598
Prince, come on, man!
Wake up!

1104
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,233
Come on, man.
Wake up.

1105
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,436
-Drop the gun!

1106
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:50,305
-Who the hell are you?

1107
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,262
-Holy shit.

1108
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,064
-Give me that.

1109
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,902
And the gun.

1110
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,544
What are you looking at?

1111
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:32,180
Asperger motherfucker.

1112
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,559
-You coming?

1113
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,777
-Come.

1114
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:38,413
-Whose car is this?

1115
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:42,383
<i> -I don't think</i>
<i>I've ever really had much luck.</i>

1116
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,419
<i> Come to think of it,</i>
<i> I haven't had much luck</i>

1117
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:45,853
<i> with anything, really.</i>

1118
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,122
<i> Always been</i>
<i> sort of an unlucky guy.</i>

1119
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,557
<i> There is always next time,</i>
<i> though,</i>

1120
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,225
<i> and that was pretty exciting</i>

1121
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,760
<i> while it lasted.</i>
-Hello?

1122
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,061
<i> -I probably would have blown</i>
<i> the money</i>

1123
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:55,496
<i> on pandas anyway.</i>

1124
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,443
What the fuck?

1125
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,803
What the fuck?

1126
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,365
Hey, what's going on?

1127
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,967
-I was cleaning.

1128
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,602
-Up there?

1129
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:10,972
-It was dirty.

1130
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:13,341
<i> -That low-pressure system</i>

1131
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,276
<i> A little thunder and...</i>

1132
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,649
-All right,
we got to take back roads

1133
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,618
'cause there's probably
gonna be a lot of cops.

1134
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,320
- I can't do it.
I can't go with you.

1135
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,555
If I do, I'm gonna lose my kid

1136
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:31,826
and any chance
i have with Sarah.

1137
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:33,327
You can keep the money.

1138
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,196
I got to call her.

1139
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:42,169
-Have to make it look like
that dump is making money.

1140
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,639
Otherwise, insurance
ain't gonna pay nothing.

1141
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,440
-Yeah.

1142
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,260
-Hey.

1143
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:07,662
No, it's me.

1144
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:10,264
I know, I know.

1145
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,875
- Aah! Shit!

1146
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:23,878
Get that thing off of me!

1147
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,515
Get out of my lap,
you dumb son of a bitch!

1148
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,084
Get! God!

1149
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:35,089

1151
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,602
