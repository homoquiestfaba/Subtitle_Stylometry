SPAIN - 1492

2
00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:39.971
- Be careful.
- I promise not to hurt him.

3
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:48.707
<I> Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus. </ i>

4
00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:51.310
<I> Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us ... </ i>

5
00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:59.669
Satan is always
present among us.

6
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:04.343
Certainly, every sin,
word or thought ...

7
00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:07.918
no matter how
take time forgotten ...

8
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10,764
It must be confessed
sincerely...

9
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,854
and punished.

10
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:16.043
Don Alfonso D'Alba Molina ...

eleven
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:19,956
Holy Inquisition you
found guilty of heresy.

12
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:20.862
Do not!

13
00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:25.040
And you and your descendants,
They must be purified in blood!

14
00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:55.556
Don Alfonso D'Alba Molina ...

fifteen
00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.173
the spot
impurity in your blood ...

16
00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:03.764
your fortune and
your heirs ...

17
00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:07.988
- Will be transferred to the Church.
- Thief!

18
00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:12.276
And you're sentenced
20 lashes.

19
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:37.055
What blows, master Mendoza!

20
00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:06.385
Twenty!

21
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:24.786
Do you see this broad front?
It is clearly a Jew.

22
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:28.151
The Pope will hear about this.

2. 3
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:31.389
The Pope is in Rome.

24
00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:42.985
Ashes to Ashes,
dust to dust.

25
00:04:09.902 --> 00:04:13,209
The time of man
on Earth it is brief ...

26
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:17.392
but his soul
endures in Heaven ...

27
00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:20.511
or in the pit of Hell.

28
00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:58.282
The Pit and the Pendulum

00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55.759
Adapted tale
EDGAR ALLAN POE

30
00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:42.786
Antonio!

31
00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:20.378
The bread burns.

32
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.313
Let him.

33
00:08:25.634 --> 00:08:28,572
Mary, have a lifetime
to love ...

3. 4
00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:31,744
but the bread is burning now.

35
00:08:56.434 --> 00:08:59.305
Pray that sell
all this bread.

36
00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:05.353
I pray for the souls of
those who suffer today.

37
00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:09.060
That does not mean
for you to suffer.

38
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:14,817
I see, beaten and burned ...

39
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:18.095
and I can feel your pain ...

40
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21.236
as if I were
He is tortured.

41
00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.527
- Those poor people ...
- Are heretics.

42
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29,324
Mary, the Inquisition says
that must be punished.

43
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32.197
But the Church also says
God is merciful!

44
00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:35.021
Yes, because the Church can
afford to be gracious.

4. 5
00:09:35.206 --> 00:09:36.335
We have this.

46
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.004
Mary, we sell
this bread in the Auto de Fe.

47
00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:44.082
But you said yourself
the Auto de Fe is wrong!

48
00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:53.480
Toledo all be there.

49
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.614
We need the money!

50
00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.272
Pork! Fresh Pork!

51
00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:01.820
Buy my fresh pork!
You will love my fresh pork!

52
00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:05.440
Want to buy, mademoiselle?
Look how cool it is.

53
00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:09.537
Fucking bitch!
Pork! Eat pork!

54
00:10:09.722 --> 00:10:11,472
Yes, ma'am?

55
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:13,084
Is this like?

56
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,792
Goodbye, thank you very much.

57
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:17.239
- Antonio, let's go!
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

58
00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:19.696
¿Go? Maria!
We sell all the bread.

59
00:10:19.781 --> 00:10:21.602
But this
People go to the Auto de Fe!

60
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24,300
We make money at the expense
the suffering of others.

61
00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:28.647
- Give me one, please.
- Thank you, Miss.

62
00:10:29.351 --> 00:10:30,566
Hears!

63
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32.883
Hear!

64
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.421
Excuse me!

65
00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:59.498
- Get up, Antonio!
- Bread!

66
00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:03.094
Let's go before
it's too late!

67
00:11:05.872 --> 00:11:07.215
Antonio!

68
00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:12,160
- Maria!
- Help me!

69
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:20.006
Antonio! Antonio!

70
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:21.308
Maria!

71
00:11:56.297 --> 00:11:57.493
Maria!

72
00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:01.148
Maria!

73
00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:05.989
Maria!

74
00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:07.513
Maria!

75
00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:11,690
All is well, my angel.

76
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:13,714
Let's go.

77
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,113
Representing the
Holy Inquisition in Spain ...

78
00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:22.702
presented to Don Carlos de Leon,
captain of the Civil Guard ...

79
00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:26.213
this avowed heretic
to be punished.

80
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:30.189
The Countess D'Alba Molina.

81
00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:34.725
- Where do you think they will?
- At home, sir.

82
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37,050
- Are heretics?
- Do not!

83
00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:38.715
Why do they leave?

84
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42.597
They witness the work
of the Holy Inquisition.

85
00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:45.884
Back! Back!

86
00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:47.473
Back!

87
00:12:47.658 --> 00:12:50.480
The commend you, Captain,
in the name of the Father...

88
00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:53.833
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

89
00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:57.540
- Have mercy on her.
- Amen.

90
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.560
This avowed opponent of the Church
is convicted, according to the law.

91
00:13:03.744 --> 00:13:06.818
All praise to the Inquisition!

92
00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:13,075
All praise the Grand Inquisitor,
Brother Torquemada!

93
00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:20.169
Mr. executioner ...

94
00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:22.870
Kill me quickly.

95
00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:30.849
For my merciful God,
do not let burn me alive.

96
00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:42.211
All end soon.

97
00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:58.349
How can you stand it?
You must do something!

98
00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:01.406
There's nothing we can do!

99
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18.216
Mother!

100
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,594
Mother!

101
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:26.075
Mother! Mother!

102
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.626
Mother!

103
00:15:01.678 --> 00:15:05.538
Fear God!
They fear his wrath!

104
00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:11,056
There is a faith, a cult ...

105
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,612
a church,
and everything else is sin!

106
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:18,867
- And sin will be punished!
- Stop!

107
00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:23.508
Stop!
Have mercy!

108
00:15:23.693 --> 00:15:25.469
Stay away, bitch!

109
00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:30,089
Do not!

110
00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:31.612
Do not!

111
00:15:34.112 --> 00:15:36.303
He did nothing!

112
00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:43.612
- Antonio!
- High!

113
00:15:52.724 --> 00:15:54.379
Antonio!

114
00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.117
Who you are?

115
00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.893
What is your name?

116
00:16:07.188 --> 00:16:09.032
Maria.

117
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11,519
I beg you!

118
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,895
Please, we just want to live!
I beg you, let's go!

119
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18.818
In the name of Christ,
I beg you!

120
00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:21.381
Have mercy!

121
00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:32.035
- Arréstenla.
- Arréstenla!

122
00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:39.254
On charges ...

123
00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:42.354
- Witchcraft.
- Witch Cut it!

124
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.510
Do not!

125
00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:50.561
- Wait, my husband is hurt!
- Your husband is dead, witch!

126
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:51.776
Antonio!

127
00:16:51.931 --> 00:16:54.855
Two days here will suffice
so forget it.

128
00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:57.786
Antonio!

129
00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.308
Are you alive?

130
00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:25,514
Excuse me, sir!
I thought he was dead!

131
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28.533
- What happened to my wife?
- The witch?

132
00:17:28.718 --> 00:17:30.563
She was arrested.

133
00:17:30.748 --> 00:17:32.432
Witch Will?

134
00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:37.064
Where they took?
Where is she?

135
00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:54.543
Between.

136
00:17:57.805 --> 00:18:03.735
Brother Torquemada, this
Baker insists on seeing you.

137
00:18:04.157 --> 00:18:05.807
I do not want traders.

138
00:18:05.992 --> 00:18:08.388
No, this is my wife,
Grand Inquisitor ...

139
00:18:08.574 --> 00:18:10,431
He was arrested at the Auto de Fe.

140
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:13,167
- The witch?
- Do not! It's not a witch!

141
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:16,801
I swear.
I know almost a year ago.

142
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:19.042
And who are you?

143
00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:23.379
My name is Antonio Alvarez,
I'm a baker.

144
00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:28.006
But I was cook and soldier
the army of King Ferdinand.

145
00:18:28.772 --> 00:18:35.996
And this qualifies you to judge if
someone has agreed or not with the Devil?

146
00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:38,040
No sir.

147
00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.866
But Mary is like an angel.

148
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,320
Satan was an angel.

149
00:18:44.602 --> 00:18:48.471
Go home.
Trust in the Church.

150
00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:53.510
My home is with my wife.

151
00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:56.143
Care, baker!
Do not make me angry.

152
00:18:56.328 --> 00:19:00.815
Please.
Mary loves the Church.

153
00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:03.339
She will have a trial.

154
00:19:03.523 --> 00:19:06.398
But everyone knows about
the trials of the Inquisition!

155
00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.018
You torture people!

156
00:19:08.202 --> 00:19:12.125
If it is as virtuous as
say, torture will reveal ...

157
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,627
and it will be released.

158
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,319
Do not! I swear!
She is not a witch!

159
00:19:16.504 --> 00:19:18,574
- Distance!
- Wait, please!

160
00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20,712
You should hear my evidence!

161
00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:23.380
He has bewitched you!
Your evidence speaks against them.

162
00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:24.924
Do not!

163
00:19:25.481 --> 00:19:26.918
I beg you!

164
00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:29,509
Just talk to her!
Do not hurt her!

165
00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:31.648
She has never done anything wrong!

166
00:19:31.832 --> 00:19:34.025
She is innocent!

167
00:19:36.452 --> 00:19:38.732
The Inquisition will decide.

168
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.004
Walk, witch.

169
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.972
Desvístanla.

170
00:20:57.563 --> 00:20:58.859
Do not!

171
00:20:59.888 --> 00:21:03.915
Resistance is test
of guilt.

172
00:21:29.782 --> 00:21:34.109
I swear by all the saints
I'm not a witch.

173
00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:38.226
The test begins.

174
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,358
What exactly
What we are looking for?

175
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:20,494
Hidden charms, hollow ...

176
00:22:20.779 --> 00:22:23,944
where a third nipple
Satan could suck.

177
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:27.689
Any hint, perhaps
a brand of witches.

178
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:32.362
It could be something small
and sneaky.

179
00:22:49.757 --> 00:22:51.423
Excuse me, doctor.

180
00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:55.466
You may have hidden something
evil within it.

181
00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:57.763
God would bet it is.

182
00:22:57.948 --> 00:22:59.772
Come, Grand Inquisitor!
Join the hunt!

183
00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:04.453
This is not sport, Dr. Bones.
We are defending the Church.

184
00:23:07.598 --> 00:23:09.288
Of course.

185
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:14,192
There!

186
00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16,795
- There is a mark.
- Do not!

187
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23.596
- It was not there before.
- It disappears.

188
00:23:23.781 --> 00:23:26,167
He's doing it with witchcraft.

189
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:28.911
Is there a brand or not?

190
00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:31.243
- Yes.
- If so, is the one.

191
00:23:31.428 --> 00:23:35.608
- Apart from that, it's perfect.
- It bears the mark of Satan?

192
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:40.273
See it yourself.

193
00:24:46.814 --> 00:24:48.545
Have a headache?

194
00:24:49.486 --> 00:24:52.497
We inspected looking
brands also, is not it?

195
00:24:52.683 --> 00:24:57.623
They laid their hands dirty
lustful throughout your body.

196
00:24:57.807 --> 00:25:01.001
Yes, good.
Do not be ashamed.

197
00:25:01.185 --> 00:25:03.409
I am ashamed for them.

198
00:25:03.593 --> 00:25:05.706
What kind of man
I could do that?

199
00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:08.221
You have not seen anything.

200
00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:12,262
Wait till you see what
they are really capable.

201
00:25:15.763 --> 00:25:17.815
I know one thing ...

202
00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:35.213
- What are you doing?
- The web stops bleeding.

203
00:25:35.397 --> 00:25:36.564
No thanks!

204
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40.389
That cut on the forehead is
foolish superstition.

205
00:25:40.574 --> 00:25:43.224
And not even work.

206
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47.481
Look. You can still
cast spells.

207
00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:49.766
She is a witch!

208
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52.239
And you are not?

209
00:25:53.142 --> 00:25:55.848
Oh, poor thing.

210
00:26:00.804 --> 00:26:06.283
I do not fly on a broom,
I kissed the penis or the Devil.

211
00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:08.760
I am a midwife.

212
00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:14,350
I use my knowledge to heal
the sick, the best that I can.

213
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,881
And so they want to burn!

214
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23.166
Sorry.

215
00:26:25.977 --> 00:26:30.471
My name is Esmeralda.
I did not mean to be rude to you.

216
00:26:30.656 --> 00:26:34.711
It's just that when you are
as wrinkled as I ...

217
00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:37,246
and you see that operates a
formula spider web ...

218
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:42.190
believe they have ten tits
and a vagina full of teeth.

219
00:26:51.922 --> 00:26:53.425
Between.

220
00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:02.975
- Yes, savior?
- I told you not to call me that.

221
00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:05.362
Excuse me.

222
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10,452
The Lord saved you.
I just showed you your sin.

223
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:12.983
He was not worthy, he was doomed.

224
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:17,899
Kept your penance.
I had to crucify you.

225
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22.825
And the wound is still fresh
to remind you.

226
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:25.824
To remind you ...

227
00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:28.297
The Lord saved you!

228
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31.904
And now, I need
I you save me.

229
00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.656
Anything.

230
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.250
Flagélame.

231
00:28:08.415 --> 00:28:10,272
I can not...

232
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,792
I order it to you!

233
00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:22,125
Please savior.

2. 3. 4
00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.471
Do what I say!

235
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39.631
Mary, mother of Christ ...

236
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:04.040
<I> I swear by all the saints
I'm not a witch. </ i>

237
00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:07.462
I pray you leave
my thoughts.

238
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.983
Again?

239
00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:27.430
Do not.

240
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:32.007
It is not necessary.

241
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:37,030
She is a witch!

242
00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:48.056
Hello Pedro!

243
00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:09.134
Mr!

244
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:16,704
- Can you do me a big favor.
- Than? What do you want?

245
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19.148
Take me inside the castle.

246
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20.714
¿Inside the castle?

247
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:21,952
For no reason.

248
00:30:22.137 --> 00:30:27.139
And guide me into the dungeon where they are
women accused of being witches.

249
00:30:28.856 --> 00:30:31.787
I do not know.
I could lose my job.

250
00:30:36.155 --> 00:30:39.724
Or it could
end up in jail.

251
00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:50,302
I'll take you in, but
then you're on your own.

252
00:30:51.962 --> 00:30:53.789
Thanks friend!

253
00:30:54.137 --> 00:30:56.531
Get under!
Anda! Yes Yes!

254
00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:59.350
And ... hold on ...

255
00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:01.488
friend.

256
00:31:07.154 --> 00:31:08.703
Friend!

257
00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:38,860
Thank you.

258
00:31:39.082 --> 00:31:40,927
- Gomez!
- Than?

259
00:31:41.112 --> 00:31:43.453
- You play?
- Why not?

260
00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:46.066
I get my salary.

261
00:31:47.092 --> 00:31:49.803
So is torture,
a gamble.

262
00:31:50.245 --> 00:31:53.077
Play is the sport of the devil.

263
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:56.601
- Helps relieve tension.
- And boredom.

264
00:31:56.785 --> 00:31:59.841
The Romans played
and they crucified him.

265
00:32:00.025 --> 00:32:03.801
To hell with the Romans.
The Pope's stay.

266
00:32:03.987 --> 00:32:09.323
I heard that the Pope sent a bishop
to stop using torture.

267
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:11,389
- I heard he was a cardinal.
- Than? Just a moment.

268
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:14.239
Do you stop using torture?
And how we do our jobs?

269
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:17,666
Brother Torquemada
will never allow it.

270
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:21,195
The Pope is the Pope.

271
00:32:22.427 --> 00:32:28.205
And Brother Torquemada is
the Grand Inquisitor of Spain.

272
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:31,350
Salvador of true religion.

273
00:32:32.448 --> 00:32:36.904
Of pagan Moors
Jews and barbarians.

274
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:40.366
And even he can
save this hand.

275
00:32:43.403 --> 00:32:44.838
I'll take three.

276
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50.072
<I> Oh, please ...
Give me some water! </ I>

277
00:32:50.623 --> 00:32:52.074
<I> Silence there! </ I>

278
00:33:17.084 --> 00:33:19.307
Help me!
Please help me!

279
00:33:23.194 --> 00:33:24,690
Maria?

280
00:33:38.951 --> 00:33:40.669
Thank Mrs.

281
00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:48.204
Maria!

282
00:33:49.038 --> 00:33:50.581
<I> Mary! </ I>

283
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53.167
Antonio!

284
00:34:02.288 --> 00:34:04.949
He prayed that no
They would have killed you!

285
00:34:05.134 --> 00:34:08.176
But now, probably,
you'll wish they had done ...

286
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10,175
friend!

287
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,975
Is the!

288
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,809
Thief!

289
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:16,532
- Pig!
- Get ready!

290
00:34:16.717 --> 00:34:17,778
Aim!

291
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:22,706
This is not the desire
Inquisition!

292
00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:30.333
They're trying to escape.

293
00:34:30.685 --> 00:34:34.717
Their souls are
prisoners of sin.

294
00:34:35.305 --> 00:34:38.390
Our task is to free them.

295
00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:42.963
I'll come back for you, Mary.

296
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:45.427
- Antonio!
- I'll be back!

297
00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:59,049
I tell you that he is innocent!
It's not a witch!

298
00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:02.086
It will be when I confess.

299
00:35:02.272 --> 00:35:04.706
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

300
00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:08.909
That we do here,
We hurt people.

301
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:20.344
Good morning to all!

302
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:25.395
Sorry, I was delayed.

303
00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.848
You do not need all this.

304
00:35:37.032 --> 00:35:39,995
I'm willing to say
whatever you want to hear.

305
00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:42.479
Only they are accepted
confessions under torture.

306
00:35:42.663 --> 00:35:45.639
Otherwise, he could confess
only to prevent torture ...

307
00:35:45.823 --> 00:35:48.794
and then it would not be
a true confession.

308
00:35:50.743 --> 00:35:52.539
- You may proceed.
- No no no.

309
00:35:52.723 --> 00:35:54.347
No, no, please!

310
00:35:54.532 --> 00:35:56.560
Please do not!
Please no...!

311
00:36:01.113 --> 00:36:03.672
Ms. Esmeralda ...

312
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:06.700
Are you a witch?

313
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:18,496
Mendoza ... please.

314
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:21.226
Yes.

315
00:36:22.173 --> 00:36:24.727
Yes, I am a witch!

316
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:30.253
Do you confess the act of sorcery
for which he has been charged?

317
00:36:30.527 --> 00:36:32.557
I confess, I confess.

318
00:36:33.606 --> 00:36:36.871
Name specific acts.

319
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:39.869
I can not remember.

320
00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:45.994
Please tell me...
what I did ...

321
00:36:46.558 --> 00:36:49,940
I can not think.

322
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55.220
Continue.

323
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:07.635
Be careful!
Just enough to drown.

324
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,769
Stop!
Leave her alone!

325
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31.430
Sergeant!

326
00:37:31.614 --> 00:37:33.394
No other more ...

327
00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:37,701
Cowards! She was killed!

328
00:37:37.987 --> 00:37:39.617
She was killed!

329
00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:44.672
You can see...

330
00:37:44.858 --> 00:37:47.320
and learn your fate.

331
00:37:48.282 --> 00:37:50.692
But stop your tongue!

332
00:37:52.039 --> 00:37:53.517
Mendoza!

333
00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:57.520
Mendoza!

334
00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.257
Stop!

335
00:37:59.892 --> 00:38:01.221
This...

336
00:38:01.606 --> 00:38:03.194
Doctor!

337
00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:06.434
It's just the first level!

338
00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.512
It is only here to watch!

339
00:38:09.698 --> 00:38:11,380
He has already looked at.

340
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:17.021
It will be tortured when available
the second level tomorrow.

341
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:21.147
Nearly you drowned. That good
that girl stopped you.

342
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:24,301
One good turn deserves another.

343
00:38:27.128 --> 00:38:29.082
<I> Mary ... </ i>

344
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31.983
I can make it out.

3. 4. 5
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:33,749
Oh please!

346
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37.064
You must promise to be good.

347
00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.246
<I> Mary ... </ i>

348
00:38:40.507 --> 00:38:42.125
Than?

349
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:44.020
Where are you?

350
00:38:44.204 --> 00:38:45.994
The pain is crazy.

351
00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:49.127
Talk to the Devil.
Ask questions!

352
00:38:49.312 --> 00:38:50.785
<I> Come with me ... </ i>

353
00:38:50.969 --> 00:38:54.904
- You're a witch?
- Do not!

354
00:38:56.893 --> 00:39:01.309
<I> Mary, come with me. </ I>

355
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15.123
Not a pleasant place?

356
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28.358
- How...?
- Do not look down.

357
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,749
How did I get here?

358
00:39:34.356 --> 00:39:36.639
You have the gift.

359
00:39:36.898 --> 00:39:38.767
I felt it.

360
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.609
But where are we?

361
00:39:43.769 --> 00:39:45.890
Away from the pain.

362
00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:50.649
You had to go there.
I was killing!

363
00:39:53.917 --> 00:39:56.103
This is not real.

364
00:39:57.752 --> 00:40:01.534
It is real, if you want it to be.

365
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.572
It is if you think it's real.

366
00:40:08.602 --> 00:40:11,979
Together we can be
strong enough.

367
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:16,160
There are so many things
I wanted to show you.

368
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:19,829
But Earth ...

369
00:40:20.267 --> 00:40:23.440
- I do not feel the Earth!
- Do not look down!

370
00:40:33.814 --> 00:40:35.718
Release it!

371
00:40:39.725 --> 00:40:42.342
- What do you do on the rack?
- It was Mendoza!

372
00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:45.216
She fainted and he insisted
that should be questioned.

373
00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:47.562
- I tried to warn you, Grand Inquisitor.
- He insisted!

374
00:40:47.684 --> 00:40:50.557
- As I warned ...
- I tried to explain, Gran ...

375
00:40:51.459 --> 00:40:53.855
A next prisoner
let it die...

376
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.540
the man responsible ...

377
00:40:56.826 --> 00:40:59.853
You will be judged
enemy of the Church ...

378
00:41:00.039 --> 00:41:01.949
and tortured!

379
00:41:23.776 --> 00:41:26.491
I myself take his confession.

380
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.023
Husband tortured.

381
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:16,473
Death is certain,
just when it is uncertain.

382
00:42:27.056 --> 00:42:31.154
I sleep knowing that the thread can
cut at any time.

383
00:42:32.156 --> 00:42:34.466
As the thread of life.

384
00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:40.733
And if I thought God
done wrong, you can punish me.

385
00:42:41.152 --> 00:42:44.128
You can do so at any
and at any time.

386
00:42:45.117 --> 00:42:46.576
Yes.

387
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:49.144
So we have to fear.

388
00:42:50.033 --> 00:42:54.708
But He gives us life,
because he loves us.

389
00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:58.594
That is its power.

390
00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:01.833
Love is
stronger than fear.

391
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:17.757
Then Confess
you're a witch.

392
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23.132
And I can save your life.

393
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26.168
I'm not a witch!

394
00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:29.895
By blood and pain
Christ, I'm not!

395
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:37.168
If you will not see your sin ...

396
00:43:41.246 --> 00:43:44.228
then will
which tell you the shown.

397
00:44:24.358 --> 00:44:26.414
Reveal and he dies.

398
00:44:44.163 --> 00:44:46.021
Please, let go!

399
00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:48.549
Why not saved
your sorcery?

400
00:44:48.733 --> 00:44:50.690
Please, I confess.

401
00:44:50.874 --> 00:44:52.650
Observe.

402
00:44:56.338 --> 00:45:00.083
Soon you'll be smoking
and roasted like a calf.

403
00:45:00.786 --> 00:45:01.987
Yes?

404
00:45:02.171 --> 00:45:06.244
- This does not melt the snow.
- Bring the blower.

405
00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:10,433
No, if you want to bake my ass
They need a real fire.

406
00:45:17.737 --> 00:45:19,453
- Sergeant ...
- Do not!

407
00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:23,100
I do not need a doctor, thank you.
I'm perfectly fine.

408
00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.213
Something's wrong.

409
00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:29.675
I'm perfectly fine!

410
00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:35.011
- He could be crazy.
- Or it could be the chair.

411
00:45:39.209 --> 00:45:43.131
We'll get the devil with
fire and then we'll thank.

412
00:45:43.317 --> 00:45:46.092
- Could be innocent.
- Do not!

413
00:46:00.072 --> 00:46:01.418
Run, Antonio! Run!

414
00:46:01.603 --> 00:46:02.719
Maria?

415
00:46:02.904 --> 00:46:03.904
Maria!

416
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.186
Run!

417
00:46:05.628 --> 00:46:06.967
Dammit.

418
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:16.105
The book!

419
00:46:20.379 --> 00:46:22,752
What are you doing?

420
00:46:26.277 --> 00:46:28.533
Maria!
Where are you?

421
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37.630
Guards, guards!

422
00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:39.747
Guards!

423
00:47:08.553 --> 00:47:10,168
I'm here!

424
00:47:26.479 --> 00:47:27,950
Antonio!

425
00:47:28.537 --> 00:47:29.868
Maria!

426
00:47:30.594 --> 00:47:32.139
Maria!

427
00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:42.798
Leave it!

428
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48.125
Hold it!

429
00:47:51.273 --> 00:47:53.111
Or I'll kill him.

430
00:48:07.966 --> 00:48:10,393
Kill me ...

431
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,066
Send my soul to Heaven.

432
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:18.505
Where can I sublimarme,
in glory, forever.

433
00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:22.229
And then, my guards will
they will slice you and your wife.

434
00:48:22.414 --> 00:48:24.088
Stay back!

435
00:48:24.272 --> 00:48:29.423
Or send your soul on the way
Wherever you go.

436
00:48:36.962 --> 00:48:41.520
Have mercy with
a servant of the church ...

437
00:48:41.706 --> 00:48:44.244
and the Church will
pity on you.

438
00:48:46.861 --> 00:48:48.769
No. I do not trust you.

439
00:48:52.567 --> 00:48:56.105
Stay back
or he dies!

440
00:49:00.809 --> 00:49:05.431
Humans have the
opportunity to choose their faith.

441
00:49:05.718 --> 00:49:07.886
- Trust in the Church.
- Hear, Antonio!

442
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:10,334
He's a murderer!

443
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:13,919
Make your business, baker.

444
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:19.089
Death by death,
mercy for mercy.

445
00:49:19.274 --> 00:49:21.939
He is a man of God,
You can not lie.

446
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:24.881
I swear by all the saints.

447
00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:28.247
You are not a murderer!
Please!

448
00:49:37.038 --> 00:49:39.120
Take them to the dungeons.

449
00:49:40.465 --> 00:49:42.854
He swore show mercy!

450
00:49:43.039 --> 00:49:45.724
Here,
death is mercy.

451
00:49:48.195 --> 00:49:49.677
Liar!

452
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:51.752
Blasphemous!

453
00:49:53.139 --> 00:49:56.732
Grand Inquisitor,
He has reached an emissary of Rome.

454
00:49:56.917 --> 00:49:59.253
Bring the seal of the Pope.

455
00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:04.784
The mountain came to Mohammed.

456
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:22.576
How can
conceive or bear ...

457
00:50:23,027 --> 00:50:25.538
such an atrocity?

458
00:50:26,577 --> 00:50:29.829
Some souls have
so far from God ...

459
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,235
that pain is the only
way to attract them back.

460
00:50:36.679 --> 00:50:39,500
The only word they understand.

461
00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:43.943
Yes.

462
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:52.328
Amontillado.

463
00:50:53.735 --> 00:50:56.955
- Not with me, Father?
- I do not drink.

464
00:50:57.958 --> 00:50:59.641
I am Italian.

465
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:02.656
May the grace of God
be with us.

466
00:51:08.296 --> 00:51:09.921
Another, Your Eminence?

467
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:13,818
Yes. Did not try
something in Rome.

468
00:51:15.128 --> 00:51:18.216
They say kicking as
an angry mule.

469
00:51:20.917 --> 00:51:23.285
Or a nun monastery.

470
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.825
It is owned by the Inquisition?

471
00:51:33.176 --> 00:51:35.215
It belongs to the Church.

472
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37.584
One of our many
treasures confiscated ...

473
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.418
during
our holy work.

474
00:51:43.416 --> 00:51:48.304
It is a treasure, but His Holiness
He is not happy and so ...

475
00:51:48.488 --> 00:51:50.024
He sent me.

476
00:51:50.576 --> 00:51:54.695
He wants the Auto de Fe
be discontinued immediately.

477
00:51:55.504 --> 00:51:57.404
Rome understands sure ...

478
00:51:57.588 --> 00:52:01.239
public executions
They have discouraged sin.

479
00:52:05.786 --> 00:52:08.826
The good Lord
He does not worry about that.

480
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13,075
He wants us to love
our neighbors ...

481
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,366
not that we roast.
Not that we roast.

482
00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:21.543
Your Eminence, what love
It may be larger ...

483
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:26,030
to manifest
God's justice?

484
00:52:28.554 --> 00:52:33.453
The Pope also wants to stop
use of torture in the Inquisition ...

485
00:52:34.139 --> 00:52:37.794
and declare an amnesty ...

486
00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:41.663
for all
heretics and witches.

487
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:44.877
Rome is outdated.

488
00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:48.313
His Holiness is old
and he has lost his mind.

489
00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.240
He is the Pope!

490
00:52:50.425 --> 00:52:52,872
And I'm the Inquisitor.

491
00:52:53.057 --> 00:52:58.387
His Holiness also orders
you return me to Rome ...

492
00:52:58.572 --> 00:53:02.399
- For an audience.
- I have not received such an order.

493
00:53:06.354 --> 00:53:08.324
I just give it.

494
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14.153
His Eminence never came.

495
00:53:16.078 --> 00:53:18,240
He had an accident on the road.

496
00:53:18.424 --> 00:53:20.797
Mendoza Gomez!

497
00:53:22.381 --> 00:53:24.058
Position the seal of the Pope!

498
00:53:24.243 --> 00:53:27,100
Salvador, he wears the red robe.

499
00:53:27.285 --> 00:53:31.308
Fanaticism. We must wage
the Church of fans.

5 o'clock
00:53:33.054 --> 00:53:34.484
Do not!

501
00:53:34.669 --> 00:53:37.025
No no!
No, it's saying!

502
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39.930
- I have the seal of the Pope!
- It has the seal of the Pope!

503
00:53:40.115 --> 00:53:43,250
- Do not! Help me!
- Help me!

504
00:53:43.435 --> 00:53:45.651
- Someone help me!
- Someone help me!

505
00:53:45.836 --> 00:53:46.836
- Do not!
- Enters!

506
00:53:46.965 --> 00:53:48.635
Do not!

507
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.379
I say no!

508
00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:52.628
Do not! Help me!

509
00:53:53.226 --> 00:53:56.073
Someone help me!

510
00:54:05.444 --> 00:54:07.259
- Do not!
- Yes!

511
00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.890
- Do not! What do they do?
- Yes...

512
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:12,207
Do not do this!

513
00:54:12,804 --> 00:54:13.461
Do not!

514
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:17,364
No matter how terrible torture,
people get used to it.

515
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:21.419
Over time, it loses its terror.

516
00:54:22.548 --> 00:54:27.721
I must invent new
and more terrible tortures ...

517
00:54:28.207 --> 00:54:32.888
to instill fear in
the hearts of sinners.

518
00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:37.394
To save their souls.

519
00:54:37.579 --> 00:54:39.120
No no.

520
00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:42.721
No. I'll tell the Pope
whatever you want.

521
00:54:42.907 --> 00:54:45.204
I'll tell you was away.

522
00:54:45.389 --> 00:54:47.296
He will never know.

523
00:54:48.456 --> 00:54:51.835
Please no!

524
00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.706
No he can not...

525
00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:01.956

526
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:05,772
Sí, por el amor de Dios.

527
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:21,002
Lento y constante.

528
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,902
Padre...

529
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:28,462
Confieso honesta
y completamente...

530
00:55:28,746 --> 00:55:31,854
por todos los pecados
de que he sido acusada.

531
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,142
Soy una bruja, arrojo hechizos
y embrujo a los hombres.

532
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:41,532
- ¿Me embrujaste a mí?
- Sí. Lo que diga, lo confieso.

533
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,868
Solo yo soy responsable.

534
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:47,218
¿Quieres salvar a tu esposo del
justo castigo de la Inquisición?

535
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:49,851
Y cuando vea en tus ojos,
quiero la verdad.

536
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:53,168
- Sí.
- ¿Me arrojaste un hechizo?

537
00:55:53,477 --> 00:55:55,467
Sí... ¡Sí!

538
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,660
Por favor, déjelo ir.

539
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:02,832
Te has confesado conmigo.

540
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:05,785
Ahora, debo confesarme contigo.

541
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,844
María...

542
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,221
Te amo.

543
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:17,671
Por supuesto...

544
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,730
Usted es un hombre santo...
¡Ama a todos los pecadores!

545
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,900
¡No de esa manera!
¡Solo a ti!

546
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,090
Debes ayudarme.

547
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:36,674
Yo no sé hacer
esta clase de amor.

548
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,216
Por favor...

549
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,289
¡Soy una mujer casada!

550
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:44,281
- ¡Tu esposo morirá mañana!
- ¡No!

551
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:45,539
- ¡Por la mañana!
- No...

552
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,401
- ¡Sí!
- Oh, Dios...

553
00:56:47,586 --> 00:56:50,514
¡Haré cualquier cosa!
Por favor...

554
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:52,940
¡Por favor, déjelo ir!

555
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,349
A cambio de liberarlo...

556
00:56:56,534 --> 00:57:00,175
no volverás a verlo nunca más.

557
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,069
Nunca más.

558
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:05,572
Sí... Sí.

559
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:07,814
Por favor, libérelo.

560
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:15,882
¿Me amarás... a mí?

561
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,277
Sí...

562
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:25,776
Sí.

563
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:28,673
Si lo deja vivir.

564
00:58:08,142 --> 00:58:10,131
Lo juro...

565
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:15,140
por mi amor por la
bendita santa Virgen.

566
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26,707
Recuéstate conmigo
bajo la espada.

567
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:43,411
Recuéstate o él muere.

568
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:24,663
Dios, ayúdame.

569
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:26,264
Por favor...

570
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,349
Por favor...

571
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,708
Por favor...

572
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,224
Por favor, Dios...

573
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,592
Por favor...

574
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:39,355
Por favor...

575
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,521
El amor es más fuerte
que el miedo.

576
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:05,525
¿Es eso lo que dijiste?

577
01:01:06,005 --> 01:01:07,768
¿Es eso lo que dijiste?

578
01:01:07,953 --> 01:01:10,608
- Lo dejé tener...
- ¡Cállate!

579
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:15,134
¡Lo que sea, pero
cumpla su promesa!

580
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,668
Vendiste tu cuerpo por
una promesa... ¡Ramera!

581
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,000
¡Deje ir a mi esposo!

582
01:01:21,185 --> 01:01:23,373
Has hechizado mi virilidad.

583
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,014
¡No es mi culpa que
usted no pueda amar!

584
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,131
Eres la única que sabe eso.

585
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:35,073
¿Desacreditarías la Inquisición...

586
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:38,605
y por ende,
la Santa Voluntad de Dios?

587
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:48,143
¡Dios... ayúdame!

588
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:58,125
Dios... ha hablado.

589
01:02:02,815 --> 01:02:05,074
No quiere que te mate.

590
01:02:09,957 --> 01:02:12,020
Pero no puedo dejarte ir.

591
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:44,467
Dios, perdóname
por lo que voy a hacer.

592
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:05,896
¡Oh, no!

593
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:10,271
¡Oh, María!
¡Oh, Dios mío!

594
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:13,786
¡Oh, María!
¿Qué te han hecho?

595
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,566
¡Oh, Dios, María!

596
01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:24,126
No, no lo hagas.

597
01:03:24,377 --> 01:03:26,478
¡No lo hagas!
No es necesario.

598
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:28,581
No lo intentes.

599
01:03:30,593 --> 01:03:32,248
Escúchame...

600
01:03:32,432 --> 01:03:36,920
¡Escúchame! No necesitas una
lengua para tener una voz.

601
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:41,905
Puedes hablar con
tu mente y tu corazón.

602
01:03:42,357 --> 01:03:45,153
¡Oh, Dios! ¡Pobre María!

603
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:48,523
Te llevaré a la pradera donde
nos encontramos antes.

604
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,967
No puedo... ¡No!

605
01:03:51,152 --> 01:03:55,134
Antonio aún te amará.
¡Oh, Dios mío!

606
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:59,003
Él aún te amará, pero
debes mantenerte viva.

607
01:03:59,188 --> 01:04:01,572
Si te quedas aquí, morirás.

608
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:07,899
Tu cuerpo es débil...

609
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:10,417
pero tú eres fuerte.

610
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:15,081
Irás a un lugar
donde podrás sanar...

611
01:04:15,302 --> 01:04:17,825
y aprender a usar tu don.

612
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:22,745
Para cuando regreses,
estarás saludable y sabia.

613
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:27,545
Y lista.

614
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:31,954
Ahora, vete... Vete...

615
01:04:33,404 --> 01:04:35,072
Vete...

616
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,714
Vete...

617
01:04:44,204 --> 01:04:47,268
Descansarás tan profundamente...

618
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:50,075
tan lejos...

619
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,118
que tu vida parecerá perdida.

620
01:04:53,439 --> 01:04:55,901
Pensarán que estás muerta...

621
01:04:56,086 --> 01:05:00,561
y te llevarán de este calabozo
hacia una tumba abierta.

622
01:05:01,952 --> 01:05:05,147
Estarás entre los muertos...

623
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:08,264
pero estarás viva.

624
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:12,344
Y despertarás...

625
01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:15,649
para ser libre.

626
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,541
Adiós.

627
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,390
¡Guardia!

628
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:35,072
¡Sucio guardia bastardo!

629
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:38,640
- ¡Cállate, bruja!
- Asesinaron a otra más.

630
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:46,881
¡Los hombres más correctos
de Toledo asesinaron a otra mujer!

631
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:52,764
¡Maldición!

632
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:56,665
¡Idiotas! ¿Por qué
le cortaron la lengua?

633
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:59,138
¡No lo hicimos!
¡No cortamos lenguas!

634
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:00,612
Claro que no.

635
01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:04,076
¿Cómo podrían confesar
si no tienen lenguas?

636
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:10,627
Él debe haberlo hecho.

637
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:14,489
¡Maravilloso!

638
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,452
¿De qué está hablando?

639
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:21,309
¡Ella está muerta y
nosotros no lo hicimos!

640
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:25,777
"A la próxima prisionera que muera,
el hombre responsable...

641
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:29,430
será un enemigo de
la Iglesia y torturado".

642
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:32,923
¡Sí! ¡Yo tampoco la maté!

643
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,124
¿Y quién va a decírselo?

644
01:06:40,007 --> 01:06:43,563
¡Llévense de aquí este cadáver!
¡Atraerá a las ratas!

645
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:45,575
¡Ya comienza a apestar!

646
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,160
- ¡Sáquenla del castillo!
- ¡Silencio!

647
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:52,091
Gómez...

648
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:54,509
Oh, no... no.

649
01:06:54,694 --> 01:06:57,416
Deshazte del cadáver.

650
01:07:02,153 --> 01:07:04,022
Yo se lo diré.

651
01:07:22,766 --> 01:07:24,303
¿María?

652
01:07:28,907 --> 01:07:30,803
María...

653
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:37,132
¡María!

654
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:59,164
¡Alto!

655
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:21,016
¿Quién la mató?

656
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:27,955
Fran... Francisco dijo que...

657
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,596
- Yo no fui.
- Sí, tú...

658
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,196
- ¡Mendoza!
- Mendoza...

659
01:08:31,382 --> 01:08:32,817
Él dijo que...

660
01:08:33,002 --> 01:08:35,168
Bueno, él me contó que...

661
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,977
- Que usted...
- ¡Tontos!

662
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:44,442
¿Por qué la mataría?

663
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,966
Ella era...

664
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,838
¡Inocente!

665
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,995
¿Inocente?

666
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:58,360
Yo tomé su confesión.

667
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,170
Ella no era una bruja.

668
01:09:05,164 --> 01:09:06,381
Nosotros no fuimos.

669
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:10,241
Fue la vieja.
Nos embrujó a todos...

670
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:13,299
y se quemará en
la estaca esta noche.

671
01:09:13,585 --> 01:09:15,937
En nombre del Padre...

672
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,878
del Hijo...

673
01:09:19,718 --> 01:09:24,634
y del Espíritu Santo.

674
01:09:24,955 --> 01:09:26,632
- Amén.
- Amén.

675
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:45,948
Este será un templo
para ti, María.

676
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:16,287
¡Pólvora!

677
01:10:16,471 --> 01:10:20,239
¡Cristianos de la santa
ciudad de Toledo!

678
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:25,062
Esta noche, liberaremos
a nuestro país...

679
01:10:25,247 --> 01:10:28,966
de una de las más
peligrosas y malvadas mujeres:

680
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,596
¡La Sra. Esmeralda!

681
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:39,378
Ella ha traído a muchos
hijos de Satán a este mundo...

682
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:43,424
y los ha cambiado
por bebés cristianos!

683
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:45,622
¡Capitán de la guardia!

684
01:10:46,104 --> 01:10:51,718
¡La Inquisición de España
encomienda a la bruja, Esmeralda...

685
01:10:51,902 --> 01:10:55,286
a las autoridades civiles
para ser castigada!

686
01:10:57,443 --> 01:11:00,471
- Sea misericordioso con ella.
- Amén.

687
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,443
Que esta rival confesa
de la Iglesia...

688
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:05,788
sea condenada,
de acuerdo a la ley...

689
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,843
y ejecutada públicamente.

690
01:11:09,028 --> 01:11:11,727
¡Todos alaben a la Inquisición!

691
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:17,460
¡Y todos alaben al Gran Inquisidor:
el Hermano Torquemada!

692
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:20,484
Lamento, señora, que no pudiera
confesarse apropiadamente.

693
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23,076
No hubo el tiempo suficiente
para torturarla.

694
01:11:23,261 --> 01:11:25,077
Gracias de todos modos.

695
01:11:46,255 --> 01:11:50,459
¿Quieren a una bruja?
¡Yo soy una bruja!

696
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,163
¡Y los maldigo!

697
01:11:53,348 --> 01:11:57,861
Los maldigo a que sufran
la misma muerte que yo.

698
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:00,404
Sí. Sí... ¡Sí!

699
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:02,635
Acérquense... ¡Acérquense!

700
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,292
Denle una buena mirada
a su propia muerte.

701
01:12:06,253 --> 01:12:08,289
¡Miren de cerca!

702
01:12:09,123 --> 01:12:11,868
Podrían perderse el sufrimiento.

703
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:13,743
¡Verdugo!

704
01:12:14,128 --> 01:12:19,218
Te condeno a morir
por la llama en tu mano.

705
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:34,428
¡Los justos prevalecerán y
los culpables serán castigados!

706
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:39,339
¡Torquemada, hipócrita!
¡Tirano!

707
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:43,309
¡Te condeno a morir
por tus propias torturas...

708
01:12:43,494 --> 01:12:47,886
en manos de todas las almas
inocentes que has torturado y asesinado!

709
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:49,825
¡Blasfema!

710
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,697
<i>¡Blasfemo!</i>

711
01:12:55,148 --> 01:12:56,799
¡Quémate, bruja! ¡Quémate!

712
01:12:57,631 --> 01:12:59,825
¡Tú la mataste!

713
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:03,021
¡Bruja embustera!

714
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:09,696
Soy un fiel hombre cristiano.

715
01:13:09,881 --> 01:13:13,728
¡Si estoy mintiendo,
que mi lengua sea...!

716
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22,263
¡No!

717
01:13:23,544 --> 01:13:27,262
Dios, si oyes las súplicas
de las brujas...

718
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:29,118
permite que María viva.

719
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,948
¡Quémate, bruja!
¡Quémate en el Infierno!

720
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,943
¡Vean su Infierno!

721
01:14:18,972 --> 01:14:20,657
María...

722
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:24,523
perdóname.

723
01:14:30,314 --> 01:14:32,399
Yo te amaba...

724
01:14:34,615 --> 01:14:36,596
y te maté.

725
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:43,871
Perdóname.

726
01:15:26,309 --> 01:15:29,959
Panadero, he decidido
no matarte.

727
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:31,613
No aún.

728
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,288
Puedes torturarme...

729
01:15:37,473 --> 01:15:41,706
Ya no importa.
¡Me da lo mismo!

730
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,698
¡Mira arriba!

731
01:15:47,315 --> 01:15:49,238
Afilado como una navaja.

732
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:52,710
¡El mejor acero de Toledo!

733
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:57,274
Bautizaré mi nuevo artefacto
con tu sangre.

734
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:54,602
<i>Antonio...</i>

735
01:16:58,212 --> 01:17:00,641
<i>¡Ayúdame!</i>

736
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,941
María...

737
01:17:05,006 --> 01:17:07,639
- ¿Dónde está mi esposa?
- Muerta.

738
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,969
¡Mientes!

739
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,930
Muerta y sepultada.

740
01:17:13,214 --> 01:17:16,225
Tal como estarás tú.

741
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:33,959
¡María!

742
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:28,403
¡No, rata estúpida!

743
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:31,263
¡No mi cara, las cuerdas!

744
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,301
Salvador.

745
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:49,193
¿Qué haces aquí?

746
01:19:49,857 --> 01:19:51,908
¿Por qué no vas
a torturar herejes?

747
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:55,612
Torturé a la esposa del
panadero y era inocente.

748
01:19:55,797 --> 01:19:56,856
¡Vete!

749
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,970
Usted me torturó
y yo era inocente.

750
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:01,709
Yo fui tu salvador.

751
01:20:01,894 --> 01:20:04,955
- ¡No dejaré que lo asesine!
- ¡No!

752
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:43,894
Eran inocentes.
¡Todas las mujeres y niños!

753
01:21:10,072 --> 01:21:12,475
Que Dios se apiade de tu alma.

754
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:24,962
¡Maldito seas en el Infierno!

755
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,193
¡No! ¡Nadie escapa!

756
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:03,792
¡Nadie!

757
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,124
¡Prepárense!

758
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,456
¡Apunten!

759
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,315
¡Fuego!

760
01:22:28,052 --> 01:22:29,333
¡Recarguen!

761
01:22:32,978 --> 01:22:36,080
¡Usen sus espadas, maldición!
¡Sus espadas!

762
01:22:36,403 --> 01:22:39,725
¡Mátenlo, tontos,
o los haré quemar!

763
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:42,963
¡Acábenlo!

764
01:22:48,949 --> 01:22:50,411
¡Mátenlo!

765
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:53,790
¡Tras él!

766
01:23:06,141 --> 01:23:07,534
¡Mátalo!

767
01:23:24,089 --> 01:23:26,170
¡No puede ser!

768
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:52,313
¡María!

769
01:24:37,454 --> 01:24:39,750
¡No la toques!

770
01:24:41,725 --> 01:24:45,679
Es mi esposa, monje.

771
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:48,750
Y no puedes tenerla.

772
01:24:48,936 --> 01:24:52,556
- Ni siquiera en la muerte.
- ¡Entonces, únete a ella!

773
01:25:13,459 --> 01:25:14,540
¡No!

774
01:25:14,725 --> 01:25:17,650
<i>Torquemada...</i>

775
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:21,233
¡No, por favor!

776
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:23,576
<i>Asesino...</i>

777
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:26,448
¡No quise matarte!

778
01:25:28,517 --> 01:25:30,769
¡Te amaba!

779
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,259
Lo juro...

780
01:25:37,505 --> 01:25:41,162
<i>Blasfemo...</i>

781
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,481
¡La maldición de la vieja!

782
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:49,317
¡La vieja!

783
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:18,281
<i>Aquí morirás, por
tus propias torturas.</i>

784
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:19,532
¡Déjame, bruja!

785
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:26,865
<i>En manos de todas las almas inocentes
que has torturado y asesinado.</i>

786
01:26:38,828 --> 01:26:40,411
<i>Perdona nuestras ofensas...</i>

787
01:26:40,597 --> 01:26:43,287
<i>como nosotros perdonamos
a quienes nos ofenden.</i>

788
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:46,022
<i>Ave María, llena eres de gracia,
bendita eres entre todas las mujeres...</i>

789
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,451
<i>y bendito es el fruto
de tu vientre, Jesús.</i>

790
01:26:48,635 --> 01:26:51,565
<i>Santa María, madre de Dios, ruega
por nosotros, los pecadores...</i>

791
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:55,328
<i>Ave María, llena eres de gracia,
bendita eres entre todas las mujeres...</i>

792
01:26:55,512 --> 01:26:57,776
<i>y bendito es el fruto
de tu vientre, Jesús.</i>

793
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,117
<i>Santa María, madre de Dios...</i>

794
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:03,074
<i>Amén.</i>

795
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,836
<i>Ave María, llena eres de gracia,
bendita eres entre todas las mujeres...</i>

796
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,512
<i>y bendito es el fruto
de tu vientre, Jesús.</i>

797
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:01,285
Atrás...

798
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:07,872
<i>Asesino...</i>

799
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,303
<i>Tirano...</i>

800
01:28:10,487 --> 01:28:14,854
<i>Blasfemo...</i>

801
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:17,890
<i>¡Blasfemo!</i>

802
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:23,506
<i>¡Hipócrita! ¡Blasfemo!</i>

803
01:28:24,176 --> 01:28:25,661
<i>¡Asesino! ¡Tirano!</i>

804
01:28:25,846 --> 01:28:27,161
<i>¡Blasfemo!</i>

805
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:30,728
<i>¡Blasfemo!</i>

806
01:28:30,912 --> 01:28:32,555
<i>¡Tirano! ¡Asesino!</i>

807
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:38,690
<i>¡Blasfemo! ¡Tirano!</i>

808
01:28:40,414 --> 01:28:42,342
<i>¡Blasfemo! ¡Asesino!</i>

809
01:28:44,087 --> 01:28:45,735
<i>¡Hipócrita!</i>

810
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:00,552
¡No!

811
01:29:00,737 --> 01:29:02,642
¡Tengan misericordia!

812
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:07,072
¡Misericordia!
¡Tengan misericordia!

813
01:29:11,088 --> 01:29:13,033
Ustedes...

814
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:16,815
confesaron sus pecados.

815
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,412
¡Todos merecían morir!

816
01:29:22,887 --> 01:29:28,955
Sus corazones están
ennegrecidos por el pecado.

817
01:29:30,402 --> 01:29:33,328
Por el amor de Dios...

818
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:37,344
Por favor...

819
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:39,679
¡No!

820
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:36,689
Perdóname, yo...
nunca debí lastimarte.

821
01:30:36,873 --> 01:30:39,995
Nunca debí permitir
que te lastimaran.

822
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:44,225
- ¿Qué te hicieron?
- Él...

823
01:30:44,411 --> 01:30:46,967
le cortó la lengua.

824
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:52,537
Éramos inocentes...

825
01:31:04,045 --> 01:31:06,611
¡Me llamaste por mi nombre!

826
01:31:07,532 --> 01:31:10,028
¡Te oí hablar!

827
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,890
<i>Te amo.</i>

828
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:18,275
¿Cómo...?

829
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:28,200
¡Tú estás muerta!

830
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:34,442
¡Regresen a sus celdas!

831
01:32:34,627 --> 01:32:37,883
¡Regresen a sus...!
¡Dije que volvieran a sus celdas!

832
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:41,544
¿Por qué no los detienen?
¡Regresen!

833
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,032
¡Vayan, deben...!

834
01:32:43,217 --> 01:32:47,305
¡Deténganlos!
¡Que alguien los detenga!

835
01:32:48,577 --> 01:32:50,385
¡Déjenlos ir!

836
01:32:57,568 --> 01:33:01,024
El mismo Gran Inquisidor
dijo que ella es inocente.

837
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,245
¡El panadero y su esposa
son libres para irse!

838
01:33:03,429 --> 01:33:04,582
¡Pero los otros...!

839
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,966
Siempre habrá otros.

526
00:55:02.704 --> 00:55:05.772
Yes, for the love of god.

527
00:55:19.089 --> 00:55:21.002
Slow and steady.

528
00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:24.902
Father...

529
00:55:25.087 --> 00:55:28.462
I confess honestly
and completely ...

530
00:55:28.746 --> 00:55:31.854
for all the sins
that I have been accused.

531
00:55:32.039 --> 00:55:36.142
I am a witch, I cast spells
and bewitching men.

532
00:55:36.327 --> 00:55:41,532
- Am I bewitched me?
- Yeah. Whatever you say, I confess.

533
00:55:41.717 --> 00:55:43.868
I alone am responsible.

534
00:55:44.053 --> 00:55:47.218
Do you want to save your husband's
I just punishment of the Inquisition?

535
00:55:47.403 --> 00:55:49.851
And when you see it in your eyes,
I want the truth.

536
00:55:50.036 --> 00:55:53.168
- Yes.
- I threw a spell?

537
00:55:53.477 --> 00:55:55.467
Yes Yes!

538
00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:58.660
Please let him go.

539
00:56:00.462 --> 00:56:02.832
You've confessed to me.

540
00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:05.785
Now, I must confess to you.

541
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:07.844
Maria...

542
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,221
I love you.

543
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:17.671
Of course ...

544
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,730
You are a holy man ...
She loves all sinners!

545
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:26,900
Not that way!
Only you!

546
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31.090
You must help me.

547
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:36.674
I do not know
this kind of love.

548
00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:38.216
Please...

549
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.289
I am a married woman!

550
00:56:42.474 --> 00:56:44.281
- Your husband will die tomorrow!
- Do not!

551
00:56:44.466 --> 00:56:45.539
- In the morning!
- Do not...

552
00:56:45.724 --> 00:56:47.401
- Yes!
- Oh God...

553
00:56:47.586 --> 00:56:50.514
I'll do anything!
Please...

554
00:56:50.798 --> 00:56:52.940
Please, let go!

555
00:56:54.178 --> 00:56:56.349
In exchange for release ...

556
00:56:56.534 --> 00:57:00.175
you'll never see him again.

557
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.069
Never more.

558
00:57:03.472 --> 00:57:05.572
Yes Yes.

559
00:57:05.757 --> 00:57:07.814
Please release it.

560
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:15,882
Would I will love ... me?

561
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23.277
Yes...

562
00:57:24.298 --> 00:57:25,776
Yes.

563
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:28.673
If left to live.

564
00:58:08.142 --> 00:58:10,131
I swear...

565
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:15,140
for my love
Blessed Holy Virgin.

566
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26.707
Lie to me
by the sword.

567
00:58:41.007 --> 00:58:43.411
Lie or he dies.

568
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:24.663
God help me.

569
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:26.264
Please...

570
01:00:26.649 --> 01:00:28.349
Please...

571
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30.708
Please...

572
01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.224
Please God...

573
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35.592
Please...

574
01:00:37.664 --> 01:00:39.355
Please...

575
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02.521
Love is stronger
that fear.

576
01:01:03.414 --> 01:01:05.525
Is that what you said?

577
01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:07.768
Is that what you said?

578
01:01:07.953 --> 01:01:10,608
- I let him have ...
- Shut!

579
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:15.134
Whatever, but
keep your promise!

580
01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:18,668
You sold your body
a promise ... Whore!

581
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,000
Let go of my husband!

582
01:01:21.185 --> 01:01:23.373
You have bewitched my manhood.

583
01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:27.014
It's not my fault
You can not love!

584
01:01:27.199 --> 01:01:30.131
You're the only one who knows that.

585
01:01:32.115 --> 01:01:35.073
¿Desacreditarías the Inquisition ...

586
01:01:35.377 --> 01:01:38.605
and hence,
the Holy Will of God?

587
01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:48.143
God help me!

588
01:01:54.434 --> 01:01:58,125
... God has spoken.

589
01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:05.074
He does not want to kill you.

590
01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:12,020
But I can not let you go.

591
01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:44,467
God forgive me
so I'm going to do.

592
01:03:04.478 --> 01:03:05.896
Oh no!

593
01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:10,271
Oh, Mary!
Oh my God!

594
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:13.786
Oh, Mary!
What have they done?

595
01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:21.566
Oh, God, Mary!

596
01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.126
No, do not do it.

597
01:03:24.377 --> 01:03:26.478
Do not do it!
It is not necessary.

598
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:28.581
Do not try.

599
01:03:30.593 --> 01:03:32.248
Listen me...

6 o'clock
01:03:32.432 --> 01:03:36,920
Listen me! You do not need a
language to have a voice.

601
01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:41.905
You can talk to
your mind and your heart.

602
01:03:42.357 --> 01:03:45.153
Oh God! Poor Maria!

603
01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:48.523
I'll take you to where the prairie
we met before.

604
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:50.967
I can not ... No!

605
01:03:51.152 --> 01:03:55.134
Antonio still love you.
Oh my God!

606
01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:59.003
He will still love him, but
You must stay alive.

607
01:03:59.188 --> 01:04:01.572
If you stay here, you will die.

608
01:04:04.266 --> 01:04:07.899
Your body is weak ...

609
01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:10,417
but you are strong.

610
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:15,081
You go to a place
where you'll heal ...

611
01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:17,825
and learn to use your gift.

612
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:22,745
For when you return,
you will be healthy and wise.

613
01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:27.545
And list.

614
01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:31,954
Now go ... Go ...

615
01:04:33.404 --> 01:04:35.072
Leave away...

616
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38.714
Leave away...

617
01:04:44.204 --> 01:04:47.268
You will rest so deeply ...

618
01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:50.075
so far...

619
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:53.118
your life will seem lost.

620
01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:55.901
They think you're dead ...

621
01:04:56.086 --> 01:05:00.561
and will take you from this dungeon
into an open grave.

622
01:05:01.952 --> 01:05:05.147
You're from the dead ...

623
01:05:05.431 --> 01:05:08.264
but you'll be alive.

624
01:05:09.469 --> 01:05:12,344
And you wake up ...

625
01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:15,649
to be free.

626
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24.541
Goodbye.

627
01:05:29.934 --> 01:05:31.390
Guard!

628
01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:35.072
Dirty bastard guard!

629
01:05:35.371 --> 01:05:38,640
- Shut up, bitch!
- They murdered another.

630
01:05:40.969 --> 01:05:46,881
Men's correct
Toledo murdered another woman!

631
01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:52.764
Curse!

632
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:56,665
Idiots! Why
they cut your tongue?

633
01:05:56.851 --> 01:05:59.138
We did not do!
No cut tongues!

634
01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:00.612
Of course not.

635
01:06:00.797 --> 01:06:04.076
How could confess
if they have no tongues?

636
01:06:07.768 --> 01:06:10,627
He must have.

637
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:14,489
Wonderful!

638
01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17,452
What are you talking about?

639
01:06:17.637 --> 01:06:21.309
She is dead and
we did!

640
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:25.777
"In the next prisoner to die,
the man responsible ...

641
01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:29,430
will be an enemy
Church and tortured. "

642
01:06:29.614 --> 01:06:32.923
Yes! I did not kill her!

643
01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.124
And who's going to tell him?

644
01:06:40.007 --> 01:06:43.563
Take away the corpse here!
It will attract rats!

645
01:06:43.748 --> 01:06:45.575
Now you begin to stink!

646
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.160
- Get her out of the castle!
- Be quiet!

647
01:06:50.359 --> 01:06:52.091
Gomez ...

648
01:06:52.355 --> 01:06:54.509
Oh, no ... no.

649
01:06:54.694 --> 01:06:57.416
Get rid of the corpse.

650
01:07:02.153 --> 01:07:04.022
I will tell you.

651
01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.303
Maria?

652
01:07:28.907 --> 01:07:30.803
Maria...

653
01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:37,132
Maria!

654
01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.164
High!

655
01:08:18.942 --> 01:08:21.016
Who killed her?

656
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:27.955
Fran ... Francis said ...

657
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29.596
- It was not me.
- If you...

658
01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.196
- Mendoza!
- Mendoza ...

659
01:08:31.382 --> 01:08:32.817
He said that...

660
01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:35.168
Well, he told me that ...

661
01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.977
- That you...
- Fools!

662
01:08:42.361 --> 01:08:44.442
Why kill?

663
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47.966
She was...

664
01:08:49.934 --> 01:08:51.838
Innocent!

665
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54,995
Innocent?

666
01:08:56.066 --> 01:08:58,360
I took her confession.

667
01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:01.170
She was not a witch.

668
01:09:05.164 --> 01:09:06.381
We did not go.

669
01:09:06.566 --> 01:09:10,241
It was old.
Bewitched us all ...

670
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:13,299
and will burn in
stake tonight.

671
01:09:13,585 --> 01:09:15.937
In the name of the Father...

672
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,878
Son ...

673
01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:24.634
and the Holy Spirit.

674
01:09:24,955 --> 01:09:26.632
- Amen.
- Amen.

675
01:09:41.256 --> 01:09:45.948
This will be a temple
for you, Mary.

676
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:16,287
Powder!

677
01:10:16.471 --> 01:10:20.239
Christians of the Holy
Toledo!

678
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:25,062
Tonight, we will free
our country ...

679
01:10:25.247 --> 01:10:28,966
of one of the
dangerous and wicked women:

680
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31.596
The Ms. Esmeralda!

681
01:10:32.285 --> 01:10:39.378
She has brought many
children of Satan in this world ...

682
01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:43.424
and has changed
by Christian babies!

683
01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.622
Captain of the guard!

684
01:10:46.104 --> 01:10:51.718
The Inquisition in Spain
entrusts the witch Esmeralda ...

685
01:10:51.902 --> 01:10:55.286
civil authorities
to be punished!

686
01:10:57.443 --> 01:11:00.471
- Be merciful to her.
- Amen.

687
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:03.443
This avowed opponent
of the church...

688
01:11:03.628 --> 01:11:05.788
is convicted,
according to the law ...

689
01:11:05.974 --> 01:11:08.843
and publicly executed.

690
01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:11,727
All praise to the Inquisition!

691
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:17,460
And all praise the Grand Inquisitor:
Brother Torquemada!

692
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:20,484
Sorry, ma'am, that could not
confess properly.

693
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23.076
There was not enough time
to torture.

694
01:11:23.261 --> 01:11:25.077
Thank you anyway.

695
01:11:46.255 --> 01:11:50.459
You want a witch?
I am a witch!

696
01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.163
And the curse!

697
01:11:53.348 --> 01:11:57.861
The curse suffering
I even death.

698
01:11:58.343 --> 01:12:00.404
Yes Yes Yes!

699
01:12:00.589 --> 01:12:02.635
Come here ... Come here!

700
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.292
Give him a good look
his own death.

701
01:12:06.253 --> 01:12:08.289
Look closely!

702
01:12:09.123 --> 01:12:11,868
They might miss the suffering.

703
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:13,743
Verdugo!

704
01:12:14,128 --> 01:12:19,218
I sentence you to death
by the flame in your hand.

705
01:12:31.632 --> 01:12:34.428
The righteous will prevail and
the guilty will be punished!

706
01:12:34.613 --> 01:12:39.339
Torquemada, hypocrite!
Tirano!

707
01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:43.309
I sentence you to death
by your own torture ...

708
01:12:43.494 --> 01:12:47.886
in the hands of all souls
innocent you've tortured and killed!

709
01:12:48.071 --> 01:12:49.825
Blasphemous!

710
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:51.697
<I> Blasphemous! </ I>

711
01:12:55.148 --> 01:12:56.799
Burn, witch! Burn!

712
01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:59,825
You killed her!

713
01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:03.021
Witch liar!

714
01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:09.696
I am a faithful Christian man.

715
01:13:09.881 --> 01:13:13,728
If I'm lying,
my tongue ...!

716
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22.263
Do not!

717
01:13:23.544 --> 01:13:27.262
God, if you hear the pleas
Witches ...

718
01:13:27.447 --> 01:13:29.118
allows Mary alive.

719
01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.948
Burn, witch!
Burn in Hell!

720
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38.943
See your Hell!

721
01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:20,657
Maria...

722
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:24.523
excuse me.

723
01:14:30.314 --> 01:14:32.399
I loved you...

724
01:14:34.615 --> 01:14:36.596
and I killed you.

725
01:14:41.925 --> 01:14:43.871
Excuse me.

726
01:15:26.309 --> 01:15:29.959
Baker, I decided
not kill you.

727
01:15:30.309 --> 01:15:31.613
Not yet.

728
01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:37.288
You can torture me ...

729
01:15:37.473 --> 01:15:41.706
It does not matter.
I do not care!

730
01:15:42.041 --> 01:15:43.698
Look up!

731
01:15:47.315 --> 01:15:49.238
Sharp as a razor.

732
01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:52.710
Best Toledo steel!

733
01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:57.274
I baptize my new device
with your blood.

734
01:16:52.273 --> 01:16:54.602
<I> Antonio ... </ i>

735
01:16:58.212 --> 01:17:00.641
<I> Help me! </ I>

736
01:17:01.288 --> 01:17:02.941
Maria...

737
01:17:05.006 --> 01:17:07.639
- Where's my wife?
- Dead.

738
01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.969
You lie!

739
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,930
Dead and buried.

740
01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:16,225
As you will be you.

741
01:17:31.303 --> 01:17:33,959
Maria!

742
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:28.403
No, stupid rat!

743
01:18:28.589 --> 01:18:31.263
Not my face, the ropes!

744
01:19:44.656 --> 01:19:46.301
Salvador.

745
01:19:47.441 --> 01:19:49.193
What are you doing here?

746
01:19:49.857 --> 01:19:51.908
Why do not you go
torturing heretics?

747
01:19:52.093 --> 01:19:55.612
I tortured the wife of
Baker and was innocent.

748
01:19:55.797 --> 01:19:56.856
Leave away!

749
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:59.970
You tortured me
and I was innocent.

750
01:20:00.154 --> 01:20:01.709
I was your savior.

751
01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:04.955
- I will not let you murder!
- Do not!

752
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:43.894
They were innocent.
All the women and children!

753
01:21:10,072 --> 01:21:12,475
May God have mercy on your soul.

754
01:21:23.026 --> 01:21:24.962
Damn you to hell!

755
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.193
Do not! No one escapes!

756
01:22:02.378 --> 01:22:03.792
Anyone!

757
01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:21.124
Get ready!

758
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25.456
Aim!

759
01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:27,315
Fire!

760
01:22:28.052 --> 01:22:29.333
Recharge!

761
01:22:32.978 --> 01:22:36.080
Use your sword, dammit!
Their swords!

762
01:22:36.403 --> 01:22:39.725
Kill him, silly,
or I will burn!

763
01:22:41.553 --> 01:22:42.963
Acábenlo!

764
01:22:48.949 --> 01:22:50.411
Kill him!

765
01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:53.790
Behind him!

766
01:23:06.141 --> 01:23:07.534
Kill him!

767
01:23:24.089 --> 01:23:26.170
Can not be!

768
01:23:50.612 --> 01:23:52.313
Maria!

769
01:24:37.454 --> 01:24:39,750
Do not touch!

770
01:24:41.725 --> 01:24:45.679
She's my wife, monk.

771
01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:48.750
And you can not have it.

772
01:24:48.936 --> 01:24:52.556
- Not even in death.
- Then join her!

773
01:25:13,459 --> 01:25:14,540
Do not!

774
01:25:14,725 --> 01:25:17,650
<I> Torquemada ... </ i>

775
01:25:19.066 --> 01:25:21.233
No Please!

776
01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:23,576
<I> Murderer ... </ i>

777
01:25:23.761 --> 01:25:26.448
I did not kill you!

The old!

01:28:24.176 --> 01:28:25.661
<I> Murderer! Tirano! </ I>

Have mercy!

01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:07.072
Mercy!
Have mercy!

813
01:29:11,088 --> 01:29:13,033
You guys...

814
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:16,815
they confessed their sins.

815
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21.412
All deserve to die!

816
01:29:22,887 --> 01:29:28,955
Their hearts are
blackened by sin.

817
01:29:30.402 --> 01:29:33.328
For the love of God...

818
01:29:35.724 --> 01:29:37.344
Please...

819
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:39.679
Do not!

Forgive me, I ...
I should never hurt.

821
01:30:36,873 --> 01:30:39,995
I should never allow
They hurt you.

822
01:30:41.859 --> 01:30:44.225
- What did they do?
- He...

823
01:30:44.411 --> 01:30:46.967
he cut the tongue.

824
01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:52.537
We were innocent ...

825
01:31:04.045 --> 01:31:06.611
You called me by my name!

826
01:31:07.532 --> 01:31:10,028
I heard!

827
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,890
<I> I love you. </ I>

828
01:31:16.887 --> 01:31:18.275
How...?

829
01:32:26.670 --> 01:32:28,200
You're dead!

830
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:34.442
Return to your cells!

831
01:32:34.627 --> 01:32:37.883
Return to your ...!
I said to return to their cells!

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:41,544
Why do not you stop?
Come back!

833
01:32:41.728 --> 01:32:43.032
Go, be ...!

834
01:32:43.217 --> 01:32:47.305
Stop them!
Somebody stop them!

835
01:32:48.577 --> 01:32:50.385
Let them go!

836
01:32:57.568 --> 01:33:01.024
The same Grand Inquisitor
She said she is innocent.

837
01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:03.245
The baker and his wife
they are free to go!

838
01:33:03.429 --> 01:33:04.582
But the others ...!

839
01:33:06.002 --> 01:33:07.966
There will always be others.
