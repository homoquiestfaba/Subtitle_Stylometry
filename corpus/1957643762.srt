4
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,505
Hey, don't get used
to eating in the new car.

5
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,240
Can I get one without cheese?
I'm trying to limit my dairy intake.

6
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,743
Copy that.
No cheese for the Blizzard.

7
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,378
- Morning.
- Dan: Boom.

8
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,881
Oh, honey,
can we eat these in the car?

9
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,081
I promise
not to make it a habit.

10
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,416
He just said that.

11
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,519
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I lost my phone.

12
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,254
- Use the Find My Phone thingy.
- That's what I'm doing.

13
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,156
I just don't know why
they make the beeps so quiet.

14
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,993
I have a meeting
in three minutes.

15
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,695
Can you help me, please?

16
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,899
Here we go.

17
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,367
- Lizzie, call the phone!
- Ringing!

18
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,537
What rooms were you in
this morning?

19
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,371
All of them!

20
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,108
It's not in Lizzie's room.

21
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,978
Voicemail!

22
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,246
Oh. Honey, call it again!

23
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,349
- Okay.
- Did you check our bedroom?

24
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,951
- ( phone buzzing )
- Shh!

25
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,151
Let's check the bathroom.

26
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,889
Ooh, did I check this drawer?

27
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,223
No, not in here.

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:08,261
( phone buzzing )

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,803
It's waterproof.

30
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,639
Okay.

31
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,113
Dan: You want me
to bring lunch by later?

32
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,446
We could do a picnic.

33
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,182
Oh, I don't know, honey.
I have a work lunch.

34
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,819
- Oh, where?
- Bluefin.

35
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,321
Ooh, dragon rolls.

36
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,188
Huh?

37
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,991
I just said "dragon rolls."

38
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,492
Those are my favorite.

39
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:42,130
Oh, no, sorry, honey.
I'm saying "huh" to this email.

40
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,798
- ( phone rings )
- Whatever.

41
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,233

All right,
what do we have this weekend?

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,822
Sunday I have a walk-through
at a property.

49
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,024
Uh, that's not in the calendar.

50
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:13,293
- What about shopping?
- No, yeah, it's in green. Oh, I have to invite you.

51
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,629
We're supposed to go shopping.

52
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,363
Oh, I know, honey.
Your dad's gonna take you.

53
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,231
I'll take you shopping.

54
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,168
I guess we're not getting a bra.

55
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,803
Hmm?
We can get a bra if you want.

56
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,370

Hi, Ed!

Ed:
<i>Hi. Who's this?</i>

68
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,206
No one.
That's just my husband.

69
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,541
- His name's Dan.
- Shh!

70
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,643
- Ed: <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah, Ed, listen.

71
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,679
Did you get the evaluations on the
retail property on Hanley Road?

72
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:07,648
- Liz? Liz?
- Ed: <i>Yeah, I'm just</i> building out more comps.

- Stop.

Ed: <i>Is everything
okay over there?</i>

76
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,322
Wait, I'm here.

77
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,860
All right, I'll talk
to you inside, in person.

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,629
Honey, I really need my own car.

79
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,865
We really don't need
another one. Coffee.

80
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,332
Okay.

81
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,769
I strongly disagree,
but I love you.

82
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,037
- Blizzard, love you!
- Love you, Mom!

83
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,539
Kick some ass today!

84
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,540
Yep!

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,675
No one says that anymore.

86
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:40,615
Morning!

87
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:41,883
Morning, Phil.

88
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,383
Hi.

89
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,586
- What did I miss?
- Nothing. It's, like, 9:15.

90
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,856
- Whatcha reading?
- Um, "The Lord of the Rings." But I'm not really reading it.

91
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,259
I'm just sort of scanning it
for baby names for my nephew.

92
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,461
Oh, that's exciting!
Congrats!

93
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,697
Okay, "Lord of the Rings."

94
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,399
Uh, that's Legolas,
Frodo, Bilbo, Haldir.

95
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,269
- Nailed it.
- You know what?

96
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,005
I'm gonna put together a list for
you from the Harry Potter books.

97
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,438
No, you don't...
that's okay.

98
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,508
- Yeah, much better universe.
- No thank you.

99
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,578
Sig Daddy!
Get off the island.

100
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,947
Anosh12, grab the lantern.

101
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,316
JimmyWarden6, go
downstairs, get cannonballs.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,552

- Ugh!

103
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,555
Yes! Suck on that, skeleton.

104
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,090

<i>Go up to the mast!

114
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:47,982
Die. Yes!

115
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,449
Ahoy, mother-bleepas!

mature when you reach manhood?

133
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,664
That makes sense.

134
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,398
How about you?
What's the latest in Prime shipping?

135
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,601
It is nuts.

136

137
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,039
- What?
- No idea. I'm really asking you.

138
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,242
Oh.
Double latte.

139
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,476
Awesome.

140
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,879
Mmm.
Hey, did you ever hear the...

141
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,016
the thing about the scorpion and the frog?
You know that one?

142
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,449
Mm-mmm.

143
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,352
Well check this out.
Okay.

144
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,454
So a frog is just down by
a river, chilling.

145
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,157
And then a scorpion walks up
and he goes,

146
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,760
"Hey, bro,
let me get a ride, hey?"

147
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,129
And the frog goes, "Nah, I may
be a frog, but I'm not dumb.

148
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,332
I'm not gonna give you a ride
'cause you're gonna sting me.

149
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,934
And I ain't down for that."

150
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,002
And then the scorpion goes,
"Why would I sting you?

151
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,738
Because if I sting you,
then we both die."

152
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,074
Frog goes, "That makes sense."
Gives him a ride.

153
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,475
Halfway across the river,
guess what happens?

154
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,712
Scorpion stings his ass.

155
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,547
And then the frog goes,
"Why did you do that?"

156
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:31,519
And then the scorpion says,
"Because I'm a scorpion."

157
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,856
I'm gonna need
some time with that.

158
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,058
- Wow.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,459
- ( phone dings )
- Ugh.

160
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,029
Somebody wants
customized hot sauce.

161
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,333
Oh, no.
Shit.

162
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,201
- Everything okay?
- Injury update.

163
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,538
My fantasy tight end's out for the
season with an Achilles injury.

164
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:54,474
Dan, that's a real man
with a real injury.

165
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,143
His family's
probably devastated.

166
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,878
That's no fantasy.

167
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,649
Okay, I am out.

168
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,285
Oh, and don't forget.

169
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,754
You're in charge, not the phone.

170
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,224
- Peace!
- Peace.

171
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,941
How's the sauce biz?

172
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,110
Oh, it's good.

173
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,711
- Yeah? Good?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,015
- Well, good is good, right?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,083
- Yeah.
- I mean, I gotta go over cost review,

176
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,687
amortization, stuff like that.
But, yeah.

177
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:46,861
Have you talked to that dad from
school about the consulting gig?

178
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,596
- Chad Raymond?
- Mm-hmm!

179
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,799
Yes.
Uh, well, not yet.

180
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,668
We're trading calls.
But I did.

181
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,972
Okay. Well,
it's a new agency,

182
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:01,075
and they need someone
with branding experience.

183
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,676
That is your gift, honey.

184
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:03,978
- I know.
- Yeah.

185
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,013
You're right.
All right, good night.

186
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,115
- Love you.
- Good night. Love you!

187
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,759
( phone dings )

188
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,433
- Carol Roman.
- What?

189
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,836
Tall Carol from work. The one
that wears men's cologne.

190
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,940
She took over
the Midwest mall leases.

191
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,408
Sorry, honey.

192
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,045
Just sucks being on call 24/7.

193
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:48,956
( texts whooshing )

194
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,627

Got anything today?

199
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,151
Perfect timing. Just two.

200
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,588
They're fragile.

201
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,888
Can I make you an espresso?

202
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,258
No, thanks.
I don't drink coffee.

203
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,860
So is Juan on vacation?

204
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,965
Juan died Saturday.

205
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,738
How?

206
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,542
Aortic embolism.

207
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,776
He's so young.

208
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:45,846
I guess.
I didn't know him.

209
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,817
People seemed to love him
at the depot yard.

210
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,823
I think there's a service.

211
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,825
If you want,
I could get you the info.

212
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:03,063
Wow. Thanks.
Yeah.

213
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,868
Alex, by the way.

214
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,770

Florence:
Before our family speaks,

236
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:16,136
I wanna give time to just
a few of the many people

237
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,574
who've contacted me to talk
about what a good man Juan was.

238
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,810
First, Chief Jimmy Golden Hawk.

239
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:31,986
Juan came into my life
as a UPS driver

240
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,121
- when he came to the reservation...
- ( phone buzzing )

241
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,056
...to pick up a shipment
of deer jerky.

242
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,758
- Turn it off.
- It is off.

243
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,594
- Off.
- It's on vibrate.

244
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,161
Off.

245
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,364
That's why I always thought
of him as a bright star.

246
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:48,570
Eight years later, Juan
had built our fish hatchery.

247
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,972
How did he find the time?
I read one book last year.

248
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,308
Florence: And now some words
from Sergeant John Hackner.

249
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,778
After coming back
from Afghanistan,

250
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,246
I was self-medicating.

251
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:03,851
Juan had challenged me
to get through my trauma.

252
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,088
But I'm sober now.
I got my GED.

253
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,425
What an incredible sense
of service.

254
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,493
John: He was right...

255
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:13,961
How often did you see him?

256
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,964
Mondays through Saturdays
and federal holidays.

257
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,367
Now I wanna
bring up Juan's new wife

258
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,303
and my dear friend Alida.

259
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,706
Why did he leave the first wife?
She's gorgeous.

260
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,873
Okay.

261
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,175
Oh, no, they're both gorgeous.

262
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,545
Go long, two for two.
Hm.

263
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,279
Alida: Juany always said,

264
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,848
"Life is right there
in front of you.

265
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,584
You just have to be present."

266
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,790
Juan taught us how to live.
I mean, we're one big family.

267
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,892
- That's how we co-parent our son.
- Carlito.

268
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,633
Juan taught us how to live
in moments both big and small.

269
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,467
Amen, Flo-Flo.

270
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,238
Wait, I'm so confused.
Were they Mormon?

271
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,074
Shh, please.

272
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,042
There's just
a lot of wives up there.

273
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,044
I'm now going to take a moment

274
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,614
and read something
from Juan's personal journal.

275
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,686
"To be truly awake,

276
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:14,355
one must sometimes
be unreachable

277
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:17,358
to the distractions
of the modern world."

278
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,844
He's right.
It's so simple.

279
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,980
We're missing out on life, but we can't see
it 'cause we're chained to our bullshit.

280
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,351
Okay, well, I have to
check my bullshit really quick.

281
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,054
Oh, speaking of,
have you talked to Chad yet?

282
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,960
We just got hit by
an existential lightning bolt,

283
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,929
and you wanna talk about Chad?

284
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,434
I'm gonna order some dinner.

285
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,784
Jesus, you scared me.

286
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,117
It's 3:30 in the morning.

287
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,520
Yeah, I know.
I couldn't sleep,

288
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,987
so I wanted to get
a head start on tomorrow.

289
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,022
I'm almost done.
I'm almost done.

290
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,225
Shh. Go back to sleep.
Shh.

291
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,000
( typing )

292
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,102
I know where she is.

293
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:39,106
- Hi.
- ( chittering )

294
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,883
- Hey, Philly.
- Don't call me that. What is that?

295
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,552
It's a North American
hog-nosed skunk.

296
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,252
I don't think that's allowed.

297
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,589
- Probably not.
- Where did you get that?

298
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,758
JD's Exotic Pets.

299
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:59,059
I wanted a beaver,
but apparently they drop a lot of scat.

300
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,564
- Is that gonna spray in here?
- No, no. The scent gland's been removed.

301
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:03,964
Oh.

302
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,402
Dan? Honey, what's happening?

303
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,706
- Ah, just visiting my wife.
- No, no, what is that?

304
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,776
It's a wild animal who is
innately connected to what's real.

305
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,343
He had its scent glands removed.

306
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,045
I did not.
The store did that.

307
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,647
What is it doing in the office?

308
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:24,117
- What do you mean? Mm, mm, mm, mm!
- Oh! Oh, my God.

309
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,821
Dan, this is my office, okay?
I work here.

310
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,456
The point is that
you are embarrassing me!

311
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,926
We should be embarrassed.
We're not thriving.

312
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,628
We're not connected
to our true nature.

313
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,563
Could you just find the skunk

314
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,565
and take it back
to wherever you came from

315
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,466
and go home, and we'll talk
about it later, okay?

316
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,336
Don't worry about the skunk,
Jeanine.

317
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,104
Worry about us!

318
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,708
We have to go away this weekend.

319
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,843
No phones, no screens, no work.

320
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,679
- Going away where?
- To the mountains. To the rivers!

321
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,282
Don't raise your voice.
Honey, how can I help you?

322
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:59,086
I want this for us.
You and me alone this weekend.

323
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,154
Just say yes. Just say it.

324
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,357
- Say it.
- Yes.

325
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,159
- Yes! You and me.
- Yes! I'm going. Yes.

326
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,629
- I got one.
- Okay. Uh-huh.

327
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:11,031
- Going away?
- Yup. He's over there. Yeah.

328
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,134
Come here. Come on.

329
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,506
Jeanine?
You got a second?

330
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,176
- Jeanine.
- Yes?

331
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,411
You're great at your job.

332
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,079
Thank you.
I love what I do.

333
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,150
But we still need boundaries.

334
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,553
Yeah, of course.

335
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,153
What is this?

336
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,790
Oh, that's a JibJab.

337
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,492
Yeah, it's one of those
animated custom greetings.

338
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,361
My cousin Tammy sent one to me for
my birthday a couple of years ago,

339
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,932
and she was a monkey,
and she put my head on a banana,

340
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,198
and she peeled me,
she ate me.

341
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,468
It was so...
I love JibJabs.

342
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,238
I use them a lot.
Do you know what a JibJab is?

343
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,674
It feels like
you've never seen a JibJab.

344
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,274
Stop saying "JibJab."

345
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,712
Jeanine, the issue is less
that you sent the message

346
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,881
and more when you sent it.

347
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,214
When did I send it?

348
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,951
At 3:42 in the morning.

349
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,586
Mm-hmm.

350
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:07,655
And you sent another to someone
on President's Day?

351
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,389
A work holiday?

352
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,092
Okay, yeah, yeah,
I see where you're going.

353
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,896
Well, at my last job,
at the law firm,

354
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:17,230
late emails and working
on holidays,

355
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:18,733
it was, like,
completely normal.

356
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,068
But this isn't a law firm,

357
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,402
and that's not
how we do things here.

358
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,838
Got it!

359
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,975
You can't drive up next to Jen
Gallivan while she's jogging

360
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,475
and blare "Eye of the Tiger."

361
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,144
Well, I was just being
supportive.

362
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,814
Why don't you take
a couple weeks?

363
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,082
No, I hear you.
I'm good.

364
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,651
No. Really.

365
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,185
Do it.

366
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,225
What is the digital detox?

367
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,995
Jeanine,
you want to handle that one?

368
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:48,663
Uh, yep.
Yep, yep, yep.

369
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:51,766
It means we're gonna unplug
from our phones for the weekend.

370
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:55,268
We're just gonna put down our work,
connect with nature and each other.

371
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,606
- A sex vacation.
- Mom?

372
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,808
Don't worry about anything.
Enjoy each other.

373
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,710
- Is this going?
- Yeah.

374
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,178
Elizabeth: Grandma, what do you
want your Hellfire password to be?

375
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,049
Oh God,
I can't remember my passwords.

376
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,752
SCRABBLESLUT1939, all caps.

377
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,386
All right. We'll call you
when we get settled.

378
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,888
I love you, sweetheart.

379
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,124
And there is money
on the counter

380
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,391
in case you guys want
to order a pizza.

381
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,926
Yeah, cell phone's
pretty spotty out here.

382
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,328
It's pretty remote, so...
oh, wait, you're the driver.

383
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,430
- I'm making you drive.
- Me?

384
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,733
I'm gonna force you
to be present.

385
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,805
Okay, you know what? For the record,
you are on your phone just as much as I am.

386
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,339
Mom, seriously?

387
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,075
No one's on their phone
more than you.

388
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,475
Okay.

389
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,879
Remember, sex
isn't just intercourse.

390
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:39,413
- Got it!
- Thanks, Ma.

391
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,749
Okay, she's getting worse.

392
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,985
Please tell me
if I start acting like that.

393
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,853
Yeah. Oh, I will.

394
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:50,124
<i>( music playing )</i>

395
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,726
Flaming Lips?

396
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,162
Could you ease me
into the weekend, please?

397
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,296
Come on,
you could dive in.

398
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,534
I actually brought
my weed blueberries.

399
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:03,203
What? Honey, you know
pot makes me fall asleep.

400
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,272
No, not these.
These are completely dialed in.

401
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,475
They're not too indica,
not too sativa.

402
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,410
I don't even know
what any of those words mean.

403
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:15,083
Well, weed science
these days is amazing.

415
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:44,712
Yeah.

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,183

- No. No, I'm good.
- Okay.

424
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:26,587
( line ringing )

425
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:30,258
- Hey, Phil, it's Jeanine.
- I know. I can see your face.

426
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:31,859
Why are you calling me
on my cell phone?

427
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,594
I told you not to do that.
It creeps me out.

428
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,764
Could you just walk me
into the conference room?

429
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:39,466
Okay, fine.

430
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:47,608
Hey, guys!
Hey! Catch me up!

431
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,177
We're good.
We got it.

432
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:51,311
You haven't even
been gone a day.

433
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,848
Plus, Stephanie said you were on
a two-week mandatory sabbatical.

434
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:56,684
Okay, which one of you babies
doesn't like JibJabs?

435
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:57,985
Who does?

436
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:02,790
( indistinct dialogue )

437
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,948
I couldn't resist.

438
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,749
I wish you had.

439
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,819
And fake rose
for a real beauty?

440
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,654
Oh!

441
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,790
Oh, it's...
it's underwear!

442
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,692
Underwear?

443
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:44,431
I bought you
gas station underwear.

444
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:46,834
Who doesn't love gas station
underwear, right?

445
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:47,935
I can return it.

446
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,071
No. No, I love it.

447
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:52,907
- Okay.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,449
We're not even that far out of
town, and it's already nothing.

449
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,685
Look at this.

450
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:25,907
- So?
- Uh, it's really remote.

451
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,975
That's the idea.

452
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,586
- Entre vous, madame.
- Thank you.

453
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:42,089
- Nice, right?
- Cozy.

454
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,025
Dan: I knew you'd like it.

455
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:58,471
Not the worst.

456
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:02,143
Not the worst.
You hungry?

457
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,581
- I'm getting there.
- Good.

458
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:10,084
I brought some food
so we can cook.

459
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:11,652
Hm.

460
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,669
Las margaritas.

461
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,037
- Dan: Fantastic.
- Jeanine: Thank you.

462
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,272
What do you recommend?

463
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,506
Chicken enchiladas.

464
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,575
- Done.
- Okay.

465
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,777
Well, then I'm gonna get something
different so we can do the splitsies.

466
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,446
Oh, splitsies, I love it.

467
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,781
I'm excited
for the both of you.

468
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,117
Uh, okay.
I'll take the steak tacos.

469
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,019
Mmm.

470
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,054
Oh, okay.

471
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,890
Uh, chicken fajitas.

472
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,292
Mmm.

473
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,227
Chicken enchiladas.

474
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,529
Chicken enchiladas, okay.

475
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:56,864
Thank you!

476
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,266
Cheers?

477
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:03,471
Mm, woo!

478
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,072
- Wow.
- Wow, wow, wow.

479
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,375
- That's a lot of tequila.
- That's a lot of tequila.

480
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,676
Yeah.

481
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,544
This place is nice, right?

482
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:14,248
Mm. A little heavy
on the taxidermy.

483
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,655
( phone dings )

484
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:30,097
( typing )

485
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,169
I know.
I just need to check on Debra,

486
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,937
who took over the construction
team in Kansas City.

487
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,041
You don't think I've made
sacrifices for this weekend?

488
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,743
I shut down production
on Holy Habanero.

489
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,747
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

490
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,749
I just... I'm just gonna
check some emails

491
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,684
while I have this bar
of service.

492
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,086
Let's make a deal.

493
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,954
Let's just drink
lethal margaritas and hang.

494
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,557
I wanna enjoy this.
Just you and me this weekend.

495
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:57,825
All right.
You're right.

496
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,593
- You and me.
- Yeah.

497
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:01,929
Yeah. Mmm.

498
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,031
Reminds me,
I have to check in on Lizzie.

499
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,675
- No fighting at Gil's.
- We're not fighting.

500
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:17,812
Well, good.
Don't make me throw you out.

501
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,580
You're my customers
for the week.

502
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,782
Yeah? Business slow?

503
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,784
Slow would be busy.

504
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:27,054
That's the rhythm of the area.

505
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:29,090
You're used to it.

506
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,392
I guess.
I was born here.

507
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:32,660
No way.

508
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,596
So was my dad.
So was his dad.

509
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:38,165
Cattlemen turned land men.

510
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,936
They helped to build this town into
the bustling metropolis it is now.

511
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:46,273
( laughing )

512
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:49,443
I suspect you've had a few
adventures outside of this place.

513
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:53,180
A few. Nothing crazy.

514
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,950
Left here after high school.
Traveled a bit.

515
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,753
Spent some time in New York

516
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,923
trying to find my young self.

517
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,725
Hung out.

518
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,927
Caught the end
of a great run at Birdland.

519
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,763
Oh! Oh, you must've
seen some shows.

520
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,700
Ooh!
No, they weren't shows.

521
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,570
They were experiences.

522
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,607
Soul transfusions.
It changed you.

523
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,075
It changed you up from the core.

524
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,679
Smoked a joint
with Sonny Rollins.

525
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,215
Damn!

526
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,652
Woo! Painted a bit.

527
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:33,555
Large canvas,
neoexpressionist?

528
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:36,123
No. Houses and offices
to pay rent.

529
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,025
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,660
Oh, I loved being in that city.

531
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,163
Even the heartbreak
was romantic.

532
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:45,399
Yeah.

533
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:48,802
You and your wife?
You have something functional.

534
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:51,272
A healthy codependence.

535
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,740
Glad it reads.

536
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,943
And you come out here
to be who you really are.

537
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,280
That's the magic of this area.

538
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,449
That's why I came back here
and never left home again.

539
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,418
Hm.

540
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,156
Mmm.

541
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,491
Oh.

542
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:14,663
Hmm. Oh, cheers.

543
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:17,566
So they built
a rest stop down on 40,

544
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:20,134
and they put
a Burger King there.

545
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:24,071
We've been losing
business ever since.

546
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:27,708
If I was you,
I'd put an ad in that rest stop.

547
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,910
Just a photo of that
sweet sign out front

548
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,380
that reads
"Gil's is open too."

549
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,688
I like that.
You in advertising?

550
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,223
Ye... No, no, no.

551
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,124
- Hm?
- No, no.

552
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,392
Hm.

553
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:56,403
How are things at work?

554
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:57,838
- Eh, whatever.
- Yeah?

555
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,473
Let's do shots.

556
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,610
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh my God, yes!

557
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,810
Yes!

558
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,945
Ha, ha, ha, okay!
Ah... Okay.

559
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,448
Do it. Do it.

560
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,283
You need a root canal!

561
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,519
Hooah!

562
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,888
You need a root canal!
Hooah! Honey!

563
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,726
- I have no idea!
- Dr. Al Pacino, DDS.

564
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,260
- What?
- Yeah!

565
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,794
No. Come on, here we go.

566
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,564
Ready? Uh, okay.

567
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:26,033
Say hello
to my "leetle" WaterPik!

568
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:26,867
Oh, no!

569
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,402
That's Andy Garcia!

570
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,170
No, Pacino playing a Cuban.

571
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,273
Say hello
to my little toothbrush!

572
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,308
"Scent of a Woman!"
"Scent of a Woman!"

573
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,945
No, it's not!
It's "Scarface!" Oh, my God.

574
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,016
Oh, my God,
you know what I've always wanted

575
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,184
to try is a Manhattan.

576
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:46,887
Oof. Well, you're not
trying it tonight,

577
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:48,822
'cause I don't know
how to make it.

578
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,425
Thank you, Gil.
Thank you.

579
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:54,161
Oh, dang, the power went out.

580
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,430
Don't worry,
I have a backup generator.

581
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,065
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

582
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:01,869
Mmm, honey, I love this place.

583
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:02,936
You're en fuego to me, honey.

584
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:04,938
Oh, God,
here comes the Spanish.

585
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,140
- You want Spanish?
- Yeah.

586
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,209
Uh, vámonos.
Uh, estoy un bombero.

587
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,714
- Yo soy.
- Yo soy un bombero. Ven acá.

588
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,784
- Ven aquí. Ven aquí.
- Ven aquí.

589
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,686
Let's do it like we used to.

590
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:19,486
- All right!
- What?

591
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:21,623
- You can DJ.
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:24,158
- Hey, she was a DJ in college. Right here.
- I was!

593
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,359
- There you go.
- Right here.

594
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,261
Jeanine the Machine. Yeah.

595
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,463
She was an amazing spinner.
Amazing.

596
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:32,900
Jeanine: What do we got?
Seven Feathers. The Shame.

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,368
Some are mine. Some are Tim's.

598
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,203
- Tim? Who's that?
- Tim is my nephew.

599
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:39,541
He's a music theory guy.
Yeah, he turns me on to stuff.

600
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,709
To Tim.

601
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,409
Okay, here we go, babe.

602
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,545
Are you ready?

603
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,913
Vamos. Estoy listo.

604
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,981
Vamos a bailar.

605
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:51,985
- ( music playing )
- Ahh!

606
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:57,091
- Come on, honey!
- Woo! Yeah!

607
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,593
Remember this, babe?
Remember this?

608
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,961
<i>♪ You were the girl ♪</i>

609
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,764
<i>♪ That changed my world ♪</i>

610
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,733
Uh-huh. Oh, oh!

611
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,034
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Here we go.

612
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,303
<i>♪ You lit the fuse,
I stand accused ♪</i>

613
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:10,572
Whoo, yeah!

614
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:13,675
<i>♪ You were the first for me ♪</i>

615
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:18,613
<i>♪ But you turned me out,
baby ♪</i>

616
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,648
<i>♪ You dropped a bomb on me ♪</i>

617
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,149
<i>♪ You turned me on, baby ♪</i>

618
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:24,351
<i>♪ You dropped a bomb on me ♪</i>

619
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,754
Jeanine: Oh, my God.
This is so fun.

620
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:27,221
Should we take this party home?

621
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,524
Yeah!
Let's make a fire.

622
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,191
I'll get us an Uber.

623
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,261
Twenty bucks says
it's a Honda Accord.

624
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,996
Dan: You're on.

625
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:45,472
Let's see. Unh-uh.

626
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,174
I got nothing.

627
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,514
We're tiny.

628
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:58,553
Nonexistent almost.

629
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,325
Puts things
into perspective, huh?

630
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:06,694
Absolutely.

631
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,001
Well, let's get out of here.

632
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:17,572
- Whoa!
- What? What did I miss?

633
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,008
Nothing.

634
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,613
God, nothing still.

635
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,053
So no service anywhere.

636
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,989
- Huh.
- Tragic.

637
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:40,862
This is Perkins,
the town crab-ass.

638
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:44,264
- Uh, Dan and Jeanine.
- Hi.

639
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,701
Uh, we want to get
back to our rental,

640
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,770
but we obviously
can't drive, so...

641
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,908
I'd offer, but I have early
onset macular degeneration.

642
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,009
Plus, I'm drunk.

643
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,078
- Yeah.
- Yeah. There's that.

644
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,881
Perkins: I'll do it.

645
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,315
Gil: Oh.

646
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:03,183
No. That's very nice,
but no thanks.

647
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,787
Oh, yeah, no, no,
we don't wanna bother you.

648
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,722
I'm drinking coffee at a bar

649
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:10,892
at 10:45 on
a Friday night, so...

650
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:15,462
Well, the truth is we just...
we don't take rides from strangers.

651
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,232
Unless they work for Uber.

652
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,442
Perkins: So what do
you do for a living?

653
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:31,880
Oh, me? I'm a commercial
leasing director.

654
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,916
Okay.
What about you, champ?

655
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,050
I make artisanal hot sauce.

656
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,489
So what brings y'all out here?

657
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,926
Oh, we just wanted a change
of pace for a few days.

658
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,426
Yeah. I did some research,

659
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,997
and they said this place
is so quiet and beautiful.

660
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,464
That's what got me out here.

661
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:52,399
How long have you
lived out here?

662
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:55,402
Nine years. I was
a long-time insurance adjuster

663
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:59,306
until one day they hired this
baby-faced efficiency expert

664
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,409
straight out of some
West Coast MBA program.

665
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,144
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

666
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:08,616
Then all of a sudden, we weren't
talking to each other like we used to.

667
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,986
We were using this
internal messaging system

668
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,656
called Outlook Suite.

669
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:18,626
Heh. Let me tell you,
the outlook wasn't sweet.

670
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:23,130
Well, good for you.
You found peace out here.

671
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,601
Yeah, my analog life
was working out just fine.

672
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:31,171
But this new digital web life?
Well, it drove me to drink.

673
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:34,842
- And meaningless sex.
- Okay.

674
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:35,843
And smack.

675
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:37,477
Smack the drug?

676
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:40,147
Once they got ya,
they don't let go.

677
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,751
You start to need those likes
and those follows

678
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,452
and branded content.

679
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:48,422
And then you search one time
for thermal socks,

680
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:52,192
and pretty soon you're
getting buried in sock ads.

681
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:54,996
- Who's this?
- ( chittering )

682
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,999
This is Lulu.

683
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,934
Hi, Lulu.

684
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,503
She doesn't talk.
She's a raccoon.

685
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,237
Right. Yeah.

686
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,374
Oh, honey.

687
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,343
Perkins:
Get down. Get down.

688
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,480
You know,
paradise comes at a price.

689
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:17,051
We've been having these power outages
for, like, three months now.

690
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,353
And I'll be a dog's dick

691
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:22,289
if it isn't all getting sucked
up by that black ops base.

692
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,826
I got a surveyor buddy
with a high-powered lens,

693
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:26,894
and he tells me that
they got everything over there.

694
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:29,196
They got tanks.
They got drones.

695
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:30,497
They got laser rifles.

696
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:33,166
They got 5G cloaking devices.

697
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,335
- That's some high tech.
- Yeah.

698
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,071
Do they think we're fools?

699
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,573
Stop pretending
that we're at war.

700
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,140
We are!

701
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,945
China is not playing
by the same rules.

702
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:46,547
Add it up.
Do the math.

703
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,216
I have.

704
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,719
It all adds up to 9/11.

705
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,220
Hm.

706
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,958
I was really hoping
those weren't the numbers.

707
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:59,459
- Here's you.
- Mm. Okay.

708
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,766
Perfect.

709
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,401
Um, thank you so much.
Have a good evening!

710
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,903
Yeah, hope to return the favor.

711
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,738
I don't need your favors.

712
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,310
Okay.

713
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:24,152
Wait, do you think that lady
went stir-crazy living out here?

714
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,855
Maybe, but,
we met two epic weirdos tonight,

715
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:30,357
and that never would've happened
if we were on our devices.

716
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:33,661
Our devices?
Okay, Grandpa.

717
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,697
Ooh. Grandpa, huh?

718
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,464
Mm-hmm.

719
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,934
That might be
a fun roleplay.

720
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,837
( imitating old man ) Ooh,
your beauty is bewitching and beguiling.

721
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:47,909
Mm, mm-mmm.
I don't need the voice, okay?

722
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,210
Oh, no, here too?

723
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,581
( imitating old man ) You know,
in my day, we made whoopie in the dark.

724
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:56,017
No, honey, stop, stop, stop.
Seriously.

725
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,152
It makes me very anxious
not having power

726
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:00,154
in a deserted cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

727
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:01,622
Honey, it's just no light.

728
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:03,091
- I have candles.
- Does it freak you out?

729
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:06,194
No. Come on.
We're pioneers tonight, okay?

730
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:07,528
Think of it that way.

731
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:11,199
Just me and you against
the elements, you know?

732
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,767
It's kind of sexy, isn't it?

733
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,669
Ah!

734
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:18,271
- What happened?
- Mm, I'm okay. I hit my head on a cabinet.

735
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:20,307
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it just hurts.

736
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,909
How can I help you?

737
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,812
Dan: Oh, just, uh, the candle
and matches are in a box.

738
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,446
Where? This box here?

739
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,149
Oh, yup. I got them.

740
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,449
Dan: I've got a big lump.

741
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,885
Yeah? Does it hurt?

742
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,385
Dan: Yeah.
It feels stupid.

743
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,856
Okay, hang on.
Let me get some light on it.

744
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,791
Yeah, that'll be all right.

745
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,860
- ( gasps )
- What?

746
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,629
- Nothing.
- No, what is it? What is it? What is it?

747
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,830
You have blood
all over your face.

748
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,532
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no.

749
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:46,200
- Stop, stop, sit down.
- I don't like that. I don't like that.

750
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,636
Let me see. Hold on.
Don't touch it. Stop!

751
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,538
- Stop smearing it!
- Okay.

752
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:53,574
Hold on. Oh, okay, yeah.
No, it's a tiny cut.

753
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:55,076
You just smeared
the blood everywhere.

754
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,276
- Do I need stitches?
- I don't know.

755
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:59,247
Let me get you some ice.

756
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:02,817
You know, on the Oregon Trail, they would
have only given me a bullet to bite on.

757
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:05,385
On the Oregon Trail,
they'd push you off the wagon

758
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,988
and use you for jerky.

759
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,023
Here, let me see.
All right, here.

760
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,792
You put pressure like this.

761
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,527
- Okay.
- All right.

762
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,096
- Thank you, Nurse Jeanine.
- Oh, honey.

763
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:16,631
- Oh, nurse?
- Yeah?

764
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:19,332
Hey, that might be fun.
Or is nurse played out?

765
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,936
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

766
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,504
- Hey.
- Hey! Good morning.

767
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,339
- How's the head?
- Ah, it's fine.

768
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,942
I love it when you wear
my clothes in the morning.

769
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,910
It reminds me
of when we lived downtown.

770
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,377
Mmm.

771
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:07,281
Let's see, we'd be arriving
at brunch right now,

772
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,551
Bongo Room,
drinking bloody Marys.

773
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,221
Oh, man, you know what?

774
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,122
When I woke up
and I saw the bloody pillow,

775
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:17,225
I thought I had murdered you.

776
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:18,993
And you weren't there.

777
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:21,696
And I couldn't remember
where I stashed your body.

778
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,463
I was like, did I chop him up?

779
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:26,267
Or did I put him in the freezer?

780
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,869
Isn't that funny?

781
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,837
Kind of.

782
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,038
I need coffee.

783
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,074
- Oh. I made some.
- What?

784
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,775
- Cowboy style.
- Nice!

785
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:37,211
Yeah, I lit the stove
with a match.

786
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,146
How rustic.

787
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:41,515
What's this?

788
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,218
Oh, I bought a journal
for morning pages.

789
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:46,320
Mmm. Thank you.

790
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:48,055
- Can I read it?
- Sure.

791
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,358
Yeah?

792
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:53,561
"The wind, the leaves,
the sun finds its place,

793
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,062
but never surrenders.

794
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:59,567
The wind, the leaves,
the sun finds its place,

795
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,969
but never surrenders."

796
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:05,472
I like the repetition.

797
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:08,276
Yeah. It just kind of came
out of me in one bit.

798
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:10,978
Mmm, mmm, good coffee.

799
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,713
Thanks.

800
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:15,549
I gotta call Grandma and Lizzie.
They didn't pick up last night.

801
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:19,520
Plus, there's still no signal.

802
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,789
That's gotta be illegal.

803
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,456
I don't think
there's a law about it.

804
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:25,993
Oh, no. No, no.
I got it right here, right here.

805
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,297
- ( line rings )
- Louise: <i>This is Louise. I can't take your call.</i>

806
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:31,065
Voicemail.

807
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,633
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

808
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,269
Hey, Louise. It's us.
Just checking in.

809
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,705
Cell service
is still really spotty,

810
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:40,408
so maybe try texting us,
okay? Love you!

811
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:42,143
Love you, guys!

812
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:45,746
I hate when people can't get a hold of me.
It makes me crazy.

813
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:48,082
No offense,
but I don't think your office

814
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,751
is gonna go out of business just
'cause you're gone for a few days.

815
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,788
I was talking about Lizzie.

816
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:56,691
She's fine. She's in her
own house with her grandma.

817
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,926
Mm-hmm.

818
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:00,127
Yeah.

819
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,136
I'm a sucker
for an iron bridge.

820
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:12,707
- Are ya?
- Look at that.

821
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:16,577
- This thing's been here for a century, for sure.
- For sure.

822
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,879
- Right?
- Yeah.

823
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,050
Okay, don't take this
the wrong way,

824
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,020
but if we die,
I want my mom to raise Lizzie.

825
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,922
A dark thought, but okay.

826
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:30,758
No, it's 'cause your mom
is confident and out of touch,

827
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,160
- and that's a bad combo.
- True.

828
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,031
But I also think her calling all Black women
"girlfriend" has influenced your opinion.

829
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:40,234
I can't say that it hasn't,
'cause she... I was gonna snap.

830
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,969
Mm, ugh, yeah.

831
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,307
Okay, if we get back into town
and that Unabomber lady

832
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,342
has melted down our car
to make weapons,

833
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:49,910
let's just not make
a big deal about it.

834
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,912
- Ah.
- Yeah.

835
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,848
Mmm.

836
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:55,449
I might start doing tai chi.

837
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:56,751
Oh, God, right now?

838
00:41:56,851 --> 00:41:58,486
No, I just mean this is like...

839
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,821
This environment
is so invigorating.

840
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:02,556
- It gives me energy.
- Yeah.

841
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:06,494
Nothing out here
but wind and maybe a hawk.

842
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:08,562
Caw-caw!

843
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:09,897
( bird caws )

844
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,400
- Shut up!
- What? Did you hear that?

845
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,402
- That was a response!
- That was so cool!

846
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:15,569
You're a hawk whisperer!

847
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,838
I speak hawk!

848
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:20,107
Getting the steps in, babe.

849
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,976
You should do this
more often in Chicago.

850
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,444
You noticed
I lost weight, right?

851
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,746
Jeanine:
Yeah. You look good.

852
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,748
We should get a picture
of these leaves changing now.

853
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:29,850
Let's get a selfie,
a vacation selfie.

854
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,252
Vacation!

855
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,889
- Gosh, still no signal.
- It's okay.

856
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,926
All right, car was not stolen,
so that's good.

857
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,095
Ha, ha. No one's
gonna steal it out here.

858
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,898
- No.
- I bet they have great hats.

859
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,167
Oh, honey, do you
really need another hat?

860
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,301
- Come on.
- I didn't...

861
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,136
Just one second.

862
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,307
Okay.

863
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,942
Huh.

864
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:59,613
Investigators determined that
the hikers were murdered

865
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:01,649
within minutes of arriving
at the mini mart.

866
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,918
"I'm Perkins!
I killed them!"

867
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,021
Can I help you?

868
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:11,192
- Oh.
- Yeah, uh, you sell hats?

869
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:14,462
- What kind of hats?
- Trucker hat? Baseball hat?

870
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:15,996
Are you a trucker
or a baseball player?

871
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,665
He is neither, no.

872
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,367
- Where y'all from?
- Oh, from Chicago.

873
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,838
Yeah, we just decided to get out
of the rat race for the weekend.

874
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:25,940
Well, we got rats around here.

875
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,708
They're just not in a hurry.

876
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:29,743
Solid wordplay, my man.

877
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,645
I should send you
to the pun-itentiary.

878
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:33,380
You like being funny, huh?

879
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,517
No.

880
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,784
Oh, hey.
Your radio's working.

881
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,285
Does that mean
there's power in town?

882
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:41,388
Yeah, it's not grid power.
It's genny power.

883
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,757
We, uh, get blackouts
occasionally, so we're prepared.

884
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:45,159
And how long
do they normally last?

885
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:49,063
- Couple of days.
- Ha, ha. Small world.

886
00:43:49,163 --> 00:43:52,366
You're the music theory kid.
You're Gil's nephew.

887
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,801
Oh, yeah.

888
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,769
What are you,
some kind of bounty hunter?

889
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,238
I don't know. Should I be?

890
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,376
Radio Host:
<i>61 degrees in Blood Lake.</i>

891
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,078
<i>Here's Mr. Joe Diamond...</i>

892
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:07,014
Hey, where's the best place
I can get reception?

893
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:08,916
Out in front
of the restaurant.

894
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,117
Okay.

895
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,589
This place is great.
Really.

896
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:15,990
You're lucky to live
way out here

897
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,393
and not checking
your phone every five minutes.

898
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:26,333
Well, she's pretty hot.

899
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,269
Good job.

900
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,470
You must have a pretty big dick

901
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:31,238
for being a bald guy
and be with her.

902
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,676
I know you're being funny.

903
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,013
Keep it.

904
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:45,186
Honey, what you doing?

905
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,321
Oh, usually, you know,

906
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:50,625
the car acts like a big antenna.

907
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,359
That's news to me.

908
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:55,029
Crap!
Now it just died.

909
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:56,997
Ah, crap.

910
00:44:57,965 --> 00:44:59,867
You know,
city Jeanine would've said...

911
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,169
- God damn it!
- Honey.

912
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,737
We're in the middle
of nowhere with no signal.

913
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:05,739
- Could you just help out?
- I'm sorry.

914
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,274
- Where's the USB cord?
- I don't know.

915
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,710
There is one in here.
Usually put it here.

916
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,979
Annoying. God, what do
you throw in here?

917
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,747
- Everything.
- ( gasping )

918
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:17,017
Lizzie's inhaler.
Honey, what if she needs it?

919
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:19,353
It's fine.
She only needs it for soccer.

920
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:22,022
I'm pretty sure my mom
doesn't play soccer.

921
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,659
How are you not stressed?

922
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:27,562
Our phones have basically never
worked since we've gotten here.

923
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,564
- It's so weird.
- It's not that weird.

924
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:33,400
When we were kids, our parents
didn't text us every four hours.

925
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,904
We're just off the grid a bit.
Doing it Juan style.

926
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:39,406
- It'll be fun.
- Oh, no.

927
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,982
I can't deal with crazy
right now.

928
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:52,786
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait, honey.

929
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:55,389
A crazy person like that
might have a satellite phone.

930
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,025
- Yeah.
- Follow my lead.

931
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:08,969
- Hi! Hello.
- Do I know you?

932
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,639
Yeah, it's Jeanine and Dan.

933
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,508
You, uh... you gave us
a ride last night.

934
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:14,975
I know who you are.

935
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:17,244
I was just doing a joke
because people enjoy humor.

936
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:18,979
Uh, okay.

937
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,181
Uh, well, we still
don't have cell reception,

938
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:22,783
and we're trying to get
a hold of our daughter.

939
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,151
Do you have a satellite phone?

940
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:26,655
Never. It's too easy
for the government

941
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,889
to track you on them things.

942
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,959
You see that?
You know what that is?

943
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:35,462
That's an AMQ Predator drone.
It's very dangerous.

944
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:37,931
They've been conducting
maneuvers since last night

945
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:39,634
right about the time
the power went out.

946
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,802
You think a drone
knocked out the power?

947
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:46,373
No, but an electromagnetic pulse
generator delivered by one of them,

948
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,109
- that could fry a grid easy.
- Mmm. Yeah.

949
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,145
Yeah, well, they wouldn't test
a heavy-duty weapon like that

950
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:55,149
- unless we were at DEFCON 1.
- Stick to hot sauce.

951
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,150
Okay.

952
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,052
Were you in
the military or...

953
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:01,422
No, I'm just
a student of history.

954
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:04,325
When the new machines
cause more harm than good,

955
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:05,760
it never ends well.

956
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:08,329
All right, look,
we are just a little anxious.

957
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:11,498
- Uh, we are not used to any of this, so...
- Yeah.

958
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,868
Don't patronize me.

959
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:18,972
I know you been doing impressions
of me at the store for the kid.

960
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,575
Jeanine: No, no.
No, no, no.

961
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:22,943
We do impressions all the time.
Yeah, yeah. It's a game.

962
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:27,081
Actually, we play a game where a
famous actor in an unlikely profession.

963
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:30,150
Like, I'm gonna make you
an omelet you can't refuse.

964
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,487
- Oh, Brando!
- Brando as a chef at brunch.

965
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:35,255
Jeanine: Okay.

966
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:42,530
That one is doing recon on mama.

967
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,131
And mama, she bites.

968
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:45,866
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

969
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:48,068
Couldn't this just be training?
I mean, really?

970
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:50,237
Okay, so now you want
to be friends again.

971
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:54,576
Huh. Remember this.
You don't know me.

972
00:47:56,778 --> 00:48:00,013
Punk-ass motherfucker bitch.

973
00:48:00,815 --> 00:48:02,182
Hey.

974
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:04,985
Lulu, let's go!

975
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:11,225
Rude.

976
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,662
I'm out.

977
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:23,237
Can we just go home now?

978
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:27,876
'Cause of her? No way.
Honey, admit it.

979
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:30,310
You're happier
when you're balanced. You are.

980
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:33,981
Life's about work and fun.
This is important.

981
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:38,218
I mean, I feel like we're connecting
for the first time in a while.

982
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,088
Yeah, you're right.

983
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:42,590
- How about this?
- All right.

984
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,258
If you still feel that way
in the morning tomorrow,

985
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:47,127
we'll pack it up and leave.
Just one more night.

986
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:48,495
Okay, one more night.

987
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,864
♪ More night ♪

988
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,901
Oh, and I brought this tune.

989
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,636
This oughta bring back
some memories.

990
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:58,405
<i>( music playing )</i>

991
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:08,048
Do you remember that time when you
were driving us up to Lake Geneva?

992
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:13,287
Yes. I was so dumb.
We were on an interstate.

993
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:15,723
Yeah, but it was also epic.

994
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,424
Mmm.

995
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,728
You know, we're not
on an interstate now.

996
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,496
- What?
- No, we're not.

997
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,732
- You can't be serious.
- I'm not. I'm not serious.

998
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:27,769
I just wanted to show you a couple
features of this car, like, uh...

999
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,336
- What?
- Precise cruise control.

1000
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:31,138
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, did you know this?

1001
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:34,609
- What? What?
- It has seven-position steering.

1002
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:37,912
And, oh, this is really sexy.
You gotta check this out, babe.

1003
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:40,981
- What?
- This seat goes back 180 degrees.

1004
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:43,417
Wait? 180 degrees?
That's flat, honey.

1005
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:45,920
Honey, no seriously, I can't see now.
Now I can't see.

1006
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,087
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1007
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,556
How's that? How's that?

1008
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:50,290
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1009
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,729
I'm just gonna see what's,
uh, happening over here.

1010
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,664
Oh!

1011
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:58,131
What's going on these pants?

1012
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:01,101
Is there some kind of
internal belt system?

1013
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:04,137
- Honey!
- This is crazy science or something.

1014
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:07,174
Yoga pants. Okay.

1015
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:12,045
Oh, that is nice.
Yeah. Okay.

1016
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:15,315
Mm, hm, hm.

1017
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:20,755
Wait, Dan.
Dan, get up here.

1018
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:23,190
That good already?

1019
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,692
No, honey, I'm serious.

1020
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:28,195
There's no power or lights
on the dashboard. Dan.

1021
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,731
Dan, I'm not kidding,
something's happening.

1022
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:31,064
I'm serious. Get up here.

1023
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,433
Okay, uh... I'm stuck.
I can't...

1024
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:34,936
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey, don't panic.

1025
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,403
Just slow down and pull over.

1026
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,573
Oh, God. I can't.
The wheel is locked.

1027
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:41,009
- Dan: I'll help, I'll help.
- Nothing's working!

1028
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:43,511
( yelps )
That's my hand!

1029
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:45,312
Honey, the brakes
aren't working.

1030
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,715
Honey, you're bumping
my head into the wheel!

1031
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,449
Get up! Get up!

1032
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:51,351
Oh, oh!

1033
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:58,993
Jeanine:
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1034
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:00,460
Oh.

1035
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:24,484
( toilet flushing )

1036
00:51:29,724 --> 00:51:30,592
Perkins is right.

1037
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:32,026
This place
is obviously being used

1038
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:33,493
for some sort
of military testing.

1039
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:34,862
It's my fault.

1040
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:37,197
What if our personal information
is getting stolen right now,

1041
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,199
and we don't have a way to
find out if that is happening?

1042
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:40,902
Our credit card company
could be trying to call us,

1043
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:43,605
telling us somebody's buying 96
blenders at a Target in Maine.

1044
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:44,939
We don't know!

1045
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,908
- It's my fault.
- Stop saying that.

1046
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:48,308
I picked this place.

1047
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:50,410
I know, you didn't
want us on our phones.

1048
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,480
I picked it
so we can't use our phones.

1049
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:57,785
I read a bunch of reviews
of people who said

1050
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:00,220
they couldn't get any cell
or internet service here.

1051
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,925
And a couple people even
said their phones got fried.

1052
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:05,727
What?

1053
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:10,665
I kept it from you, because
I just really wanted you

1054
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,900
to go on this adventure
with me so bad.

1055
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,603
And I'm sorry.

1056
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:23,511
That feels better.

1057
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:30,885
I'm actually hungry.

1058
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:33,087
I'm gonna make us some soup.

1059
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:36,423
Honey, I love that
you're a romantic.

1060
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:40,193
But in certain scenarios,
like this very one,

1061
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:42,362
I could use a little more
practical thinking.

1062
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:44,065
I don't need to eat.

1063
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:46,233
When were you gonna
start looking for a job?

1064
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,869
Hot sauce is my job.

1065
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:51,072
Hot sauce is your passion.
"I'm a born entrepreneur."

1066
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,640
Yeah, but you didn't
say any of that

1067
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,408
until you didn't get
the promotion at work.

1068
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,811
The agency screwed you over.
Fine! Whatever.

1069
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,514
But you've been licking that
wound in our garage for a year!

1070
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:03,051
I wasn't fired.
It was a mutual parting of ways.

1071
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:05,318
I took my severance,
and I pivoted.

1072
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,789
- I'm pivoting!
- You didn't need to pivot!

1073
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:10,390
You needed to stay in the game
for your family's sake.

1074
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,261
But, no, instead you wanted
to sulk and nosedive.

1075
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,731
For the record, I would love
the luxury of nosediving.

1076
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:18,365
Nobody wants to nosedive!

1077
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:21,301
I do!
I want to fucking nosedive!

1078
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,037
But I can't! I can't!

1079
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:26,741
I love your hot sauce,
but your hot sauce, it scares me,

1080
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:31,445
because I thought we'd be expanding
together and growing together.

1081
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:34,347
That we'd move back to
the city in some cool house.

1082
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,817
But instead, we're here!

1083
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:40,822
We're right here,
just stuck in the same place!

1084
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:47,294
Oh, and I,
the responsible one,

1085
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,631
have been put on
a two-week forced sabbatical,

1086
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:53,300
because people were not responding
to my fucking work ethic

1087
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,369
or my personalized
animated greetings.

1088
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:23,564
I got penalized for
my overly enthusiastic tone.

1089
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:26,567
Which I see as kicking ass

1090
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,837
and supporting my people
with a dash of levity.

1091
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:36,077
Maybe I do need to chill.

1092
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:38,179
I never knew
you hated our house.

1093
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,347
No, I don't hate our house.

1094
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,950
I don't like
how things work in it.

1095
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:48,321
You get to connect with Lizzie and go
with the flow and be the easygoing one.

1096
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,824
And I have to be
the breadwinning,

1097
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:54,061
pain-in-the-ass heavy
planning our lives all the time.

1098
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:58,766
I guess I just got used to you being
in charge 'cause you're so good at it.

1099
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,235
And it's not fair.

1100
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:03,671
It's a lot of stress for you.

1101
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,809
I could be doing more.

1102
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,744
No, you do your part.

1103
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:12,445
No. Not enough.

1104
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:16,416
But you know what?

1105
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,286
You enjoy a little nosedive,

1106
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:20,521
'cause old Dan is gonna dig in.

1107
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:23,524
That car has a lifetime power
cell and drivetrain warranty.

1108
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,662
I'm gonna get them to bring us out a
rental car and tow that lemon away.

1109
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:30,198
We don't have a working phone.

1110
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:34,467
Actually, I've been saving
power in power-saving mode.

1111
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,237
- What?
- Yeah.

1112
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,738
I'm gonna get them
to repair everything,

1113
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,107
and I'm gonna get them
to bring us a fucking pizza.

1114
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,408
Yes!

1115
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,778
Yes, I will eat the fuck
out of that pizza!

1116
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,412
Oh my God! Yes!

1117
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:46,981
- We got this, babe!
- We got this!

1118
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:49,016
We got this!

1119
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,518
Go get them!

1120
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:52,553
Yes!

1136
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:38,465
Hi, this is Dan Dewerson.

1137
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:40,835
Hi, this is Dan Dewerson.
Dewerson, Daniel!

1138
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:43,436
D-E-W-E-R-S-O-N.

1139
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:45,740
I'm in the middle of nowhere,
and your ecofriendly,

1140
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,143
ecofriend... ecofriendly vehicle
almost killed us.

1141
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:51,145
I need you to fix it now!

1142
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:53,648
Come on.

1143
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,816
I want a pizza with jalapeño.

1144
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,551
No, not everything.
No onions.

1145
00:56:57,652 --> 00:57:00,655
But jalapeños, champ!

1146
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:02,189
Come on.

1147
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:06,260
- ( line ringing )
- Yes, yes, yes.

1148
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,262
- ( loud buzzing )
- Hello? Hi.

1149
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:11,265
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah...

1150
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:13,100
Come on!

1151
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,872
Are you fucking kidding me?

1152
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:24,078
Get out of here!
Go on, get!

1153
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:26,747
Get out of here!

1154
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:30,117
Get out of the way from me!

1155
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:34,055
All right,
I guess we're doing this.

1156
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:36,657
Come on! You wanna play?

1157
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:41,095
Get out of here!
Who are you?

1158
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:54,208
You don't own me!

1159
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:57,511
You're gonna fuck off
permanently!

1160
00:58:04,518 --> 00:58:07,455
Hey.

1161
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:10,224
Ta-da! Lunch!

1162
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,360
It's our last day here,
so I thought I'd blow it out.

1163
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,495
- What do you think? I know you hate to waste food.
- You prepared all of it?

1164
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:18,599
Yeah, and I finished the peanut butter and the
wasabi peas, and I know what you're thinking.

1165
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,435
That that's not a good food combination,
but it really is. It's really good.

1166
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:23,604
Oh, and I had a couple of those
chocolate-covered blueberries

1167
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,539
- that are somehow pot?
- A couple?

1168
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,508
Yeah, yeah. Indica-sativa.
indica-sativa.

1169
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:28,843
- Are you high?
- Yeah!

1170
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:30,611
I like stoned me.
Do you like stoned me?

1171
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:32,880
- Well, you got more energy.
- Yeah, I do.

1172
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,383
Yeah, 'cause this trip's
about spontaneity, right?

1173
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:37,151
Hey, how long
until the car comes?

1174
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:38,452
Uh, not long.

1175
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:41,255
Ah, you did the job!
You did it, honey.

1176
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,790
Oh, you never toot
your own horn.

1177
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,759
That's what I love about you!
Toot, toot!

1178
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:47,928
Oh, honey, you were so right.
I am so addicted to my phone.

1179
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,497
Do you know what I did
when you were gone?

1180
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:51,332
I noticed how cluttered
their pantry was,

1181
00:58:51,432 --> 00:58:53,434
and I mindlessly went to my dead
phone to check the daily deal

1182
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,869
on the Container Store twice.

1183
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,904
Oh, yeah, well,
you made the tuna, huh?

1184
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:58,606
Hey, how far did you have
to go for reception?

1185
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:00,775
Uh, it's just, like,
five, twelve minutes. Listen...

1186
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,476
Oh, thank God
you had battery!

1187
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:04,311
Because I tried my backup
battery in my purse.

1188
00:59:04,412 --> 00:59:05,346
I don't know
where it is right now,

1189
00:59:05,446 --> 00:59:06,547
but it was totally drained.

1190
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:08,249
Yeah, right. Listen...

1191
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:10,584
Oh! I bet you those car people
were begging to be forgiven

1192
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:12,219
when you were done
with them, huh?

1193
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,622
- Pretty much.
- You gave it to 'em good! Yeah!

1194
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:15,923
Well, yeah, I guess so.

1195
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:17,191
Did you talk
to Grandma and Lizzie?

1196
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,592
Yeah, they're fine.

1197
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:19,927
Oh! That's all
I needed to hear.

1198
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:23,164
Oh, my God. Oh!
Thank you so much.

1199
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:28,169
You are Dan the man!
Dan of the woods! Whoo-hoo!

1200
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:29,503
Wow.

1201
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:30,971
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

1202
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:32,473
I am so lucky.

1203
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:33,741
I'm so lucky to have
somebody like you

1204
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:35,009
who designs an experience
like this which,

1205
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:36,677
on the surface,
seems really dumb,

1206
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:39,313
but it's such an eye-opener.
You are amazing.

1207
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:40,881
- Aw!
- No, I'm not. Don't... Don't say that.

1208
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,450
- Yeah, you are!
- Don't, don't, please.

1209
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,585
I said it. Too late.

1210
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,320
- Watch out!
- Whoa!

1211
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,788
- Ha, ha!
- ( zipper unzipping )

1212
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,991
Uh, you're amazing.
You're the amazing one. Ooh!

1213
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:55,262
You're wife, mother,
friend, businessperson.

1214
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,731
Oh, ah, I mean,

1215
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:00,901
maybe I'd have held back
on some of the tuna.

1216
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:02,436
You know,
in case of emergency.

1217
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:04,071
Mmm.

1218
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,841
And I didn't get a hold of
anyone, even though I wanted to.

1219
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:09,076
Maybe I really
didn't reach anybody.

1220
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:11,011
Ooh!

1221
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,916
Is there a car coming?

1222
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:20,721
Did you talk to Grandma?

1223
01:00:20,821 --> 01:00:22,089
Are you a child?

1224
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:25,192
Did I just give
a blowjob to a child?

1225
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,968
It's smart to just
pack essentials.

1226
01:00:34,068 --> 01:00:36,403
How are you gonna explain
the bloody pillowcase?

1227
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:38,172
Makeshift food bag?

1228
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:40,741
"Makeshift food bag."

1229
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:43,744
- Are you still stoned?
- I'm really not.

1230
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,713
In a lot of ways,
it's better than alcohol.

1231
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:47,549
Could you just
not talk anymore?

1232
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:51,185
Yeah. Yeah.

1233
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:53,254
Okay.

1234
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:01,662
( yelps )
What is going on?

1235
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,998
There's more of them
and they're getting bigger!

1236
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:08,769
Careful.

1237
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,886
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Getting supplies.

1238
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:27,821
Shoplifting.
Shoplifting.

1239
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:30,157
Honey, nobody's here,
and this is an emergency.

1240
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:32,993
- We can do whatever we want.
- Honey, please, come on.

1241
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:35,863
- Put these in your pants.
- What? Tampons?

1242
01:01:35,963 --> 01:01:37,831
Put them in your pants!

1243
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:39,733
Okay, they're in my pants.
What else do we need?

1244
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,303
Proteins, electrolytes.

1245
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:45,172
Proteins, proteins. Okay.

1246
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:47,642
Honey, these are cold.

1247
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:48,776
That means there's power.
There's power.

1248
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,277
Get the charger!
Get the charger!

1249
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,682
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, gotta get my phone.

1250
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:56,350
- Charger. Ah! Outlet.
- Oh, okay. Ooh.

1251
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,118
Come on, come on, come on.
Here, here, here.

1252
01:01:58,219 --> 01:01:59,153
Okay.

1253
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,754
We'd be so great
at "Amazing Race."

1254
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:03,257
- Honey, focus.
- I am.

1255
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,526
Nothing's happening.

1256
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,327
I don't know.

1257
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:09,263
( toilet flushes )

1258
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:14,935
Hello?

1259
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:17,238
Hmm.

1260
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:21,976
( clears throat )

1261
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,515
Dan? Jeanine?

1262
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:29,783
Both: Gil.

1263
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:32,019
- Hi, hey.
- What are you doing here?

1264
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,254
Pooping.

1265
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,156
I own this gas station.
What's happening?

1266
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,693
Oh, we noticed
your fridges had power,

1267
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,961
- so we just wanted to charge the phone.
- Charge the phone.

1268
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,864
My genny went out two hours ago.

1269
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:46,534
I mean, any cold in
that fridge is old cold.

1270
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:48,570
Is it weird for
a generator not to work?

1271
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,104
Everything's weird nowadays.

1272
01:02:50,204 --> 01:02:52,840
Look, I'm sorry you came up here
while we're having issues.

1273
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,511
Let me buy you a drink.
Fanta, Fresca, Yoo-hoo?

1274
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:57,945
Oh, go just
grab something on me.

1275
01:02:58,045 --> 01:02:59,547
Oh, no, we're okay.
Thank you.

1276
01:02:59,648 --> 01:03:01,348
- Yeah, thank you.
- Suit yourself.

1277
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:05,119
( phone buzzing )

1278
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:07,354
Hey, hey, hey.
You have a phone that works?

1279
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:08,922
Yeah. Sometimes.

1280
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,625
- Can we use it?
- Please. Please.

1281
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:13,561
Be my guest.
Not much charge on it.

1282
01:03:13,662 --> 01:03:14,895
It's okay.

1283
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:17,599
Okay, I'm gonna call
my voicemail.

1284
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:19,634
- Shh, shh.
- Okay, okay.

1285
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,102
Louise: <i>Hello, lovebirds.
Hope you've been enjoying yourself.</i>

1286
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:24,071
<i>Don't worry.
We had to go to the hospital.</i>

1287
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,708
What? What?
What happened?

1288
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:30,044
No! No, it died!
Oh, honey, hospital.

1289
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:31,845
Hospital.
She needed her inhaler.

1290
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:34,014
They did play soccer.
Oh, I think I'm gonna pass out.

1291
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:36,150
Babe, babe, babe, babe, no.
They said they went to hospital.

1292
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,818
They're probably back
at home. Breathe.

1293
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:39,386
We gotta get home.
We gotta get out of here.

1294
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,021
Gil, we're having
a family emergency.

1295
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,489
You gotta get us out of here.

1296
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,224
Maybe drive us to
the next town or something.

1297
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,126
I'd like to,
but Tim has my car.

1298
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:47,995
He's checking out
an estate sale.

1299
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:50,197
How are you not freaked out
by any of this?

1300
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:51,899
There's no power.
There's no WiFi.

1301
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,535
There's Chinese drones
flying everywhere.

1302
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,235
Look, sometimes it is
challenging living out here.

1303
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:56,970
But the way I see it,
when your time is up,

1304
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,674
well, it doesn't matter whether
you get melted by a nuke

1305
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:01,108
or choke on a chicken nugget.

1306
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:04,478
Gil! This is code red!
We are in code red!

1307
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:10,585
Looks like we got
a little settling up to do.

1308
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:15,956
- I don't have cash.
- You have my card.

1309
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:19,126
Look, we're friends,
all right?

1310
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:23,497
Let's all go to my place
and sketch each other.

1311
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:29,002
Yeah, no.
No, let's... hard no.

1312
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:35,643
( static and distorted voice )

1313
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:37,945
What's this?

1314
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:40,013
No, this is, like...

1315
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:43,150
Step away
from the solar radio!

1316
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,553
Needs to charge
for two more hours.

1317
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:49,256
Hey, Perkins, do you know if the
next town has a rental car company?

1318
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:52,861
- Maybe.
- Well, could you take us there?

1319
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,597
Stay here at the gas station!

1320
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:58,065
Guard the fuel reserves.

1321
01:04:58,165 --> 01:04:59,801
What happened to your car?

1322
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,903
The electrical system got fried.

1323
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,338
They're hacking
civilian vehicles.

1324
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:06,875
That means they've widened
their attack.

1325
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:08,442
Government's gonna
declare martial law.

1326
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:12,212
Impose a strict curfew.
Welcome to New China.

1327
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:13,615
New China?

1328
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:15,916
- You're gonna need this.
- Yeah! Yeah, we are!

1329
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,985
No, thank you.
No, no, we don't need a gun.

1330
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,587
Yes, we do!

1331
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,955
We don't have a permit, and
we don't know how to use these.

1332
01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:24,592
Yeah, okay, all right.
You're right, honey, I'm sorry.

1333
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:27,161
- Dan: Thank you.
- Jeanine: I just don't know what's going on here.

1334
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,029
We are definitely in a dead
zone and we gotta get home.

1335
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:30,665
Okay, we'll figure it out.

1336
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:33,568
Hey, Perkins, we will take
that ride to the next town.

1337
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:37,739
I never offered it.
Besides, Olive's 22 miles away.

1338
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,643
I cannot leave my post for that
long, but there's a shortcut.

1339
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:45,145
You can take the trail through the pass
and get there in four hours on foot.

1340
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:49,049
But you better leave soon because you don't
wanna be out there when the sun goes down.

1341
01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:50,284
Yeah. What time is it?

1342
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,220
- I don't know.
- It's 1400-ish.

1343
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,289
1400-ish.

1344
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,460
I found that funny.
I don't know why.

1345
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:01,529
I don't like you.

1346
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:04,998
I told Gil you think
all of us out here are a joke.

1347
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,801
And now he doesn't
like you either.

1348
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:08,302
Super weird move, man.

1349
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:09,737
You know, it would be cool
if people could form

1350
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:11,338
their own opinion
of me out here.

1351
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,575
- Whatever!
- Okay, yeah, just, Perkins, look.

1352
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:17,277
Will you just maybe give us
a ride to the trailhead?

1353
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:18,713
- Honey...
- All right, get in.

1354
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:24,719
Hey, where's Lulu?

1355
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:28,188
Exactly. Where's Lulu?

1356
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:40,067
Jeanine: Thanks, Perkins.

1357
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:48,743
Follow the road down, and when you
see a skull, that's the trailhead.

1358
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,143
A skull?

1359
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:52,514
Don't worry.
You'll die before you get there!

1360
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:55,015
- Bullies never win.
- Hey, Dan, come on.

1361
01:06:55,115 --> 01:06:57,752
Put your thumb in your mouth
and follow mommy.

1362
01:06:57,852 --> 01:07:00,688
Honey? Let's go.

1363
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,826
- She's got problems.
- Leave her alone.

1364
01:07:04,926 --> 01:07:08,228
Leave it alone, Dan.
Come on, let's go.

1365
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:11,198
All right, we're on our hike.
We can do this.

1366
01:07:11,298 --> 01:07:12,534
I don't mind people
being screwed up,

1367
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:14,969
but keep it to yourself.
That's how I feel.

1368
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:19,406
Mm-hmm. Just keep pace, babe.
Keep pace.

1369
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:29,751
Jeanine:
Okay. There it is.

1370
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:35,255
Dan: Okay.
Just hold up a second.

1371
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,766
It's in here.

1372
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:53,841
Thank God it's not
the spicy kind.

1373
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:58,078
Yeah. Thank God.

1374
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:01,849
No, I like spicy.
I hate fake spicy.

1375
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,383
It tastes synthetic.

1376
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:07,956
So the frog says, "Okay."

1377
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:10,558
The scorpion gets on his back,
they swim across the river.

1378
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:14,094
Halfway across,
the scorpion stings the frog.

1379
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,664
And as the poison's
going into the frog's body,

1380
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:19,567
he says, "Why'd you do that?
Now surely we're both dead."

1381
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:24,639
The scorpion says, "Can't help it.
I'm a scorpion."

1382
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:26,774
- That's not the ending.
- Yeah, it is the ending. He dies.

1383
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:30,511
Jeanine: No, the ending is the
scorpion says, "It's in my nature."

1384
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:32,179
Why are you
telling me this story?

1385
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,348
Dan: Just something
Juan told me once.

1386
01:08:39,053 --> 01:08:42,489
Finally ready to call that dad
guy about the consulting gig.

1387
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:49,262
All this time
and you never responded.

1388
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:50,832
Dan: I might've. I just...

1389
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,701
You can plan a whole weekend
to the land that time forgot,

1390
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:56,370
but you can't take 10 seconds
to respond to an email

1391
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,072
from a guy
who wants to hire you.

1392
01:08:58,171 --> 01:08:59,540
I didn't like the tone
of his first email.

1393
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:02,510
Jeanine: We are stomping
through the woods right now,

1394
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,244
trying to avoid apex predators!

1395
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:05,880
We don't even know
if Lizzie's safe!

1396
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,083
All because you're mourning
some guy you didn't even know!

1397
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:10,317
I knew Juan.

1398
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:11,451
Although I didn't have
to know him well

1399
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:13,286
to know he was a great man.

1400
01:09:13,387 --> 01:09:16,958
I've never met Dr. King,
but I know he was a great man.

1401
01:09:17,058 --> 01:09:20,427
Did you just compare Juan
to Dr. Martin Luther King?

1402
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,162
You better believe I did.

1403
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:23,965
You know what?
I can't even.

1404
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:26,299
Has it even occurred to you that
the whole point of this trip is you?

1405
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,169
- Oh, me? Me?
- Yes! You!

1406
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:32,040
You can't be off your phone
for 15 minutes!

1407
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,373
Literally, I've timed you.

1408
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:35,977
You used 90% of our data plan.

1409
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:37,444
And let me stop you
before you say it.

1410
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:39,714
- I know, it's for work!
- Hey, you know what?

1411
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:42,349
All you do all day
is fill up 24 bottles

1412
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,052
and come up with spicy puns!

1413
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:46,186
I write 20,
whittle it down to 10,

1414
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:48,890
- and then five!
- ( whirring )

1415
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,294
- Honey, go, go! Go!
- I'm going!

1416
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:56,496
We can't go in the woods.

1417
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:08,943
( panting )

1418
01:10:16,517 --> 01:10:20,054
Stop, Jean, please, wait.
I gotta stop, come on.

1419
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:22,690
No, come on, come on, come on.
We're more than halfway there.

1420
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,559
How do we even know
we're on the trail?

1421
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,294
Because there's only one trail.

1422
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:30,464
- Can I get a sip?
- Okay, quickly.

1423
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:31,733
Thanks.

1424
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:35,770
Oh, you know, we could
just lay down for a bit...

1425
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:40,141
- And a hiker might find us.
- What?

1426
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,543
No, we're not gonna lie
out here to die.

1427
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,946
What is wrong with you?
No, Dan, sip!

1428
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:46,581
Pass, sip, pass!

1429
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:52,620
I'm sorry.

1430
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,055
I'm an idiot.

1431
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:56,691
Honey, what are you doing?

1432
01:10:56,791 --> 01:11:00,828
No, we could use this as
a canteen in case we find water.

1433
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:03,898
What is with your attitude?
Why are you such a fatalist?

1434
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:05,967
- Get up, let's go!
- I will! I just think...

1435
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:07,568
Oh, my God,
Oh, my God.

1436
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:11,139
What? What? You just
wanna overthink us to inaction?

1437
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,473
We have to keep moving
forward, Dan!

1438
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:16,244
People move forward in life!

1439
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:17,745
This is exactly why...

1440
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,481
Exactly why what?

1441
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,252
Why exactly what?

1442
01:11:24,351 --> 01:11:26,053
Why I froze my eggs!

1443
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:38,065
- When?
- Last year.

1444
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,635
How do I not know about this?

1445
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:44,038
It doesn't matter, because
I didn't do it to hurt you.

1446
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:46,574
You don't get to decide that.

1447
01:11:46,674 --> 01:11:48,009
You don't even give me
the heads up

1448
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,911
that you're thinking
about something like that?

1449
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:53,514
We haven't had a real
conversation in a long time.

1450
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:54,414
Why?

1451
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:55,583
Because maybe we're both afraid

1452
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:57,552
of where that conversation
will go.

1453
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:05,526
It's amazing.
You want more kids

1454
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,862
when you don't have time
for the one we got.

1455
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:11,532
That's unfair.

1456
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:14,367
Just, our plan got messed up,

1457
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:17,538
and I just wanted options in case
you didn't find your way back.

1458
01:12:17,638 --> 01:12:20,141
Options? Oh, my fuck, options?

1459
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:21,509
I was fighting my way back!

1460
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:24,879
No, you weren't!
You were not!

1461
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:28,549
- You're a dick.
- Wow.

1462
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,585
You got any other gems
you wanna share, huh?

1463
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:32,920
No, don't be an idiot.

1464
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:39,026
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1465
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:41,428
I'll walk home by myself, okay?
I'll figure it out.

1466
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,598
- Really? Really?
- Yeah.

1467
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,666
You're just gonna run off
and split us up

1468
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:48,769
when we should be a team?

1469
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,037
You did.

1470
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,894
( bird caws )

1471
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:52,700
<i>"The wild winds.
The jagged stone.</i>

1472
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,104
<i>Nature demands...
destroy the frail."</i>

1473
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:59,206
Wild winds.
The jagged stone.

1474
01:13:59,307 --> 01:14:02,510
Nature demands...
destroy the frail.

1475
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,724
Dan?

1476
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:22,196
Dan?

1477
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:25,666
Dan?

1478
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:29,537
Lulu?

1479
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:33,473
- ( hisses )
- Oh, oh, oh!

1480
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:02,737
- Dan?
- Jeanine?

1481
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:04,572
Oh, Dan, I couldn't find you!

1482
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:07,808
- Jeanine!
- Oh, my God.

1483
01:15:07,908 --> 01:15:09,243
What happened to your face?

1484
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:10,478
- What, what?
- You're bleeding!

1485
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:12,913
What? No! Oh, shit.

1486
01:15:13,014 --> 01:15:14,315
I thought it was sweat.
Oh, no.

1487
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:15,750
Sit down, sit down,
sit down.

1488
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,551
Is it a lot? Is it a lot?
Is there a lot of blood?

1489
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:19,286
- No, I think... No, no, no.
- Is it? Is it?

1490
01:15:19,387 --> 01:15:20,888
You just
opened it up again.

1491
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:23,357
Let me clean it.
Hold on, hold on.

1492
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:24,492
Oh, God.

1493
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,061
I got it. I got it.

1494
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:29,630
It's okay.

1495
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:41,275
- I'm still mad at you.
- I know.

1496
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,848
I think we're off the trail.

1497
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:01,328
Jeanine: Is that a house?

1498
01:16:01,429 --> 01:16:04,632
Dan: That's a light, for sure.

1499
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:10,938
Jeanine: Watch your head.

1500
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:13,274
Dan: Here.
This way, this way.

1501
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:24,085
- Oh, there's power. Yes!
- Dan: Yes, yes.

1502
01:16:24,185 --> 01:16:26,020
Okay.

1503
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,622
Yeah.

1504
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:30,925
Holy shit.

1505
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:33,528
Oh, honey, there's an outlet.

1506
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:35,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

1507
01:16:35,663 --> 01:16:37,364
Yeah.

1508
01:16:37,465 --> 01:16:39,834
- Where is it? Where is it?
- Here.

1509
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:43,337
Okay.

1510
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:45,406
Okay, give it to me,
give it to me.

1511
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:48,209
Okay.
Let's see.

1512
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,415
( phone dings )

1513
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:56,617
Yes! Okay.

1514
01:16:56,717 --> 01:17:01,055
We'll just let it charge to 20%,
and then we'll go find a signal.

1515
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:03,558
Commander Shackleton,
I love your improvised decision-making.

1516
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:06,160
Yes, yes. Wait.
Honey, there's a light.

1517
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:09,930
Maybe somebody's home,
and they can help us.

1518
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,398
Yeah.

1519
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,977
Is anyone there?

1520
01:17:23,077 --> 01:17:25,746
Yeah, and they're watching
"Judge Judy."

1521
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:27,781
That's good. That means
they have a moral compass.

1522
01:17:27,882 --> 01:17:29,917
- Okay.
- I'm gonna knock.

1523
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,289
Hey! Who's out there?

1524
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:39,793
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

1525
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:44,999
Maybe we should talk to him.
I mean, he could be helpful.

1526
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:47,801
That man is not
going to be helpful.

1527
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:52,239
I'd like to leave this experience
not feeling like we prejudge people.

1528
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:53,407
Okay?

1529
01:17:53,508 --> 01:17:54,675
- No, don't, don't...
- Yes.

1530
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:56,443
Don't do it!
Don't! Honey!

1531
01:18:04,752 --> 01:18:07,522
- I don't wanna talk to him.
- Okay.

1532
01:18:07,622 --> 01:18:11,458
( spitting, burps )

1533
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,794
Let's go back and get the phone,
and get out of here.

1534
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:15,829
- Forget the phone.
- No.

1535
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:19,466
I'm not forgetting the phone.
That's our only chance.

1536
01:18:19,568 --> 01:18:21,068
All right.
I'll get the phone.

1537
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:22,803
Oh, no, no,
I'm getting the phone.

1538
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:25,139
- You cover me.
- Cover? What the hell is that?

1539
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:27,908
I don't know.
It just sounded right.

1540
01:18:36,183 --> 01:18:40,321
- Psst! Psst! Honey!
- What?

1541
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:41,690
Get the bag and help me.

1542
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:43,891
- Psst!
- What?

1543
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:47,161
The thing! The thing!

1544
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:58,205
I don't know what you're asking.

1545
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:02,810
- This?
- Yes!

1546
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,918
This isn't "bag."
This is not "bag."

1547
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:12,119
This is the bottle.
Give me the bottle.

1548
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:13,420
- Fine.
- Water!

1549
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:14,822
- Oh, you're a genius.
- Yeah.

1550
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:17,157
- Next time, just wave me over.
- I did!

1551
01:19:17,258 --> 01:19:18,892
No, you didn't.
You were doing this.

1552
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:20,662
I don't even know
what that means.

1553
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:22,196
- All right, here.
- Okay.

1554
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:24,765
- Well done, honey.
- All right, let's go, let's go.

1555
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:26,267
- ( clucking )
- Shh! Shh!

1556
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:28,135
Quiet down! Quiet down!

1557
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:33,575
( shushing )

1558
01:19:33,675 --> 01:19:35,577
That is amazing.

1559
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:37,211
You're amazing.

1560
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:39,681
- Okay. ( shushing )
- Good chicken.

1561
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,282
- Good chicken.
- Good chicken.

1562
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:43,017
- Good chicken.
- Okay.

1563
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,419
- ( clucking )
- Okay. Quiet, chicken.

1564
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,689
All right.
Quiet down.

1565
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:50,592
Quiet down.

1566
01:19:50,692 --> 01:19:53,561
- What?
- Oh, I think I broke its leg.

1567
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:56,196
Oh no, I think
I broke its leg!

1568
01:19:57,865 --> 01:19:59,366
- Aspirin.
- What?

1569
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:00,467
Give me aspirin.

1570
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:04,271
Okay, water.

1571
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:21,723
What was that?

1572
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:25,859
Your wife, mama-birding
aspirin to a chicken.

1573
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:27,394
I think it's more humane
if we just break its neck.

1574
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,229
No, no, no, no, no.

1575
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:32,099
I think we should just keep
giving it aspirin until it OD's.

1576
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:35,202
You're prolonging the inevitable.
It's like unplugging a patient.

1577
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:38,405
Man: What the hell
is out there?

1578
01:20:39,973 --> 01:20:41,643
( gunshot )

1579
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:43,477
What happened?

1580
01:20:43,578 --> 01:20:44,912
- What happened?
- I got shot.

1581
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,047
- What? Where?
- I don't know.

1582
01:20:47,147 --> 01:20:48,849
At first I heard it,
and then I felt it.

1583
01:20:50,217 --> 01:20:51,952
Well, did you hear it
or feel it?

1584
01:20:52,052 --> 01:20:53,521
- I don't know.
- ( gunshot )

1585
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:55,790
Oh, no.

1586
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:58,560
Honey, come on.
Come on, move. Move!

1587
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,361
Hey!

1588
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:04,365
Dan: Let's go! Let's go!

1589
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:13,040
I had no idea chickens
stunk that much.

1590
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,343
- Oh, I think that's me.
- Oh, wow.

1591
01:21:19,647 --> 01:21:23,984
Oh, oh. Honey, there's a light.
There's a light.

1592
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:29,423
Ah! Gas station!

1593
01:21:29,524 --> 01:21:33,327
- Oh, my God, civilization!
- Oh, we did it!

1594
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:36,363
- Can we ditch the chicken?
- No!

1595
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:42,970
- Hello?
- Hello?

1596
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,239
- Hello?
- Hello?

1597
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,940
Nobody's here.

1598
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,643
This is so weird.

1599
01:21:48,743 --> 01:21:51,478
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I'm gonna call somebody.

1600
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:54,381
Oh, yeah, yes. Okay, yeah.

1601
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,084
What is this?
God damn it, there's no power.

1602
01:21:57,184 --> 01:22:01,288
- What?
- No, worries. I'm gonna find somebody inside.

1603
01:22:08,462 --> 01:22:10,598
Babe, honey? Babe?

1604
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:12,032
Babe, what are you doing?

1605
01:22:12,132 --> 01:22:15,369
It's running.
It's a sign. Come on.

1606
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:16,970
- Honey, we're so close. Honey?
- Get in.

1607
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,740
Honey?
This is not us, okay?

1608
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,909
- We are better than this.
- Okay.

1609
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:22,309
I'll tell your daughter
you said goodbye.

1610
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,312
This is not ours.
This is not us.

1611
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:28,616
This isn't you?
'Cause surviving is definitely me!

1612
01:22:28,716 --> 01:22:30,184
You wanna commit a felony?

1613
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,019
Okay, that breaks up the team.

1614
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:35,222
- Bye.
- Deal-breaker.

1615
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:37,692
Where's the thing?
The thingy is not...

1616
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,627
Oh, no, the thingy's here.

1617
01:22:39,727 --> 01:22:43,230
Okay, of course this truck
is weird. Hang on.

1618
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:47,735
Oh, why is there
a thingy in the middle?

1619
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:53,240
Come on!

1620
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:56,977
That's it.

1621
01:22:57,912 --> 01:22:59,747
( clucking )

1622
01:22:59,848 --> 01:23:01,583
How do I do this?

1623
01:23:01,683 --> 01:23:03,651
Stop, stop, stop!

1624
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:08,088
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, listen up.

1625
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,924
My uncle's car had
a manual transmission.

1626
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:11,291
- We can do this, okay? We're a team.
- Okay.

1627
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:13,293
I'll be on stick,
you're on the clutch.

1628
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:15,262
What is the clutch?
What is the clutch?

1629
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:16,997
- That left pedal's the clutch, okay?
- Got it. Got it.

1630
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:18,265
I'm gonna throw it in gear,
and you're gonna let go

1631
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:19,834
of the clutch
and give it a little gas.

1632
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:22,035
- Okay, ready.
- Key in.

1633
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:23,571
- No, no.
- No.

1634
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:25,339
Equal gas, equal clutch,
okay? It's a feel.

1635
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:28,442
Proportionate.
Proportionate torque, okay?

1636
01:23:28,543 --> 01:23:30,177
Left foot. Hold on.
Hold on, honey.

1637
01:23:30,277 --> 01:23:31,411
Proportionate torque, okay?
Think torque.

1638
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:33,280
- Honey, stop.
- It's a feel.

1639
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,683
- ( engine roaring )
- That's even worse.

1640
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:38,485
Sorry. Torque!
We want torque.

1641
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:45,660
Stop saying "torque"!

1642
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,494
Proportionate torque.

1643
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:51,365
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

1644
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:53,500
Get out of my fucking truck!

1645
01:23:55,235 --> 01:23:58,640
- That's the guy that shot at us.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1646
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,307
He did. He did.

1647
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:02,844
- Okay.
- I got this, babe.

1648
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,979
What? Dan?

1649
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:06,179
I was fired.

1650
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,315
No, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan!

1651
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:10,552
- Dan!
- You stop right there, freak.

1652
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:12,219
I am a freak.

1653
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:14,589
I don't care if you've got
60 pounds and 4 inches on me.

1654
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:17,892
- Let's make this happen.
- So you want to fight me for my truck?

1655
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,861
Yeah, and your dumb chicken.

1656
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:20,929
Dan, we don't need the chicken.

1657
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:22,396
You're fucking nuts.

1658
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:23,698
Yeah, my nuts.

1659
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:26,199
What? You know what?

1660
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,536
Now I'm gonna beat your ass
in front of your old lady.

1661
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:30,404
Let's make this happen.

1662
01:24:30,504 --> 01:24:31,739
Dan, Dan!

1663
01:24:33,808 --> 01:24:36,744
- Dan!
- Get out of my truck.

1664
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:37,912
- Jeanine!
- ( honking )

1665
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:39,781
Get out of there!

1666
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:44,886
Be careful!

1667
01:24:44,986 --> 01:24:46,888
Aw, honey, your back!
Be careful!

1668
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:48,355
Oh, God!

1669
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:50,190
I think he popped my spleen!

1670
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,391
Head-butt him in the balls!

1671
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:53,160
Get your wiener
out of my back!

1672
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,063
That's my wallet!
You made it weird.

1673
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:56,496
Leave him alone!

1674
01:24:56,598 --> 01:24:58,566
( siren chirps )

1675
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:02,604
- I'll pull your dumb ear off if you don't listen!
- Ow, that's my ear!

1676
01:25:02,704 --> 01:25:05,105
- Put the man down, Francis.
- He started it, Margaret.

1677
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:06,708
I need both of you
to get off each other.

1678
01:25:06,808 --> 01:25:09,510
- He won't let go of me!
- He's not letting go of me!

1679
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:11,411
Oh! Oh.

1680
01:25:11,512 --> 01:25:14,281
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to stand back, okay?

1681
01:25:14,381 --> 01:25:15,984
Francis, don't call me
Margaret again.

1682
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:17,417
I'm a officer of the law.

1683
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:26,628
Oh! Honey, are you okay?

1684
01:25:26,728 --> 01:25:28,730
Oh, honey.

1685
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,502
Were you two doing
bath salts out there?

1686
01:25:35,603 --> 01:25:38,773
- No.
- No. It's just been so weird since we've gotten here.

1687
01:25:38,873 --> 01:25:40,608
There's no power,
and our cell phones don't work.

1688
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:42,376
And then China's
hacking our military.

1689
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:45,813
And then I found my
daughter's inhaler in the car.

1690
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:49,083
I'm a control freak. I got suspended
from work, too. There's a lot going on.

1691
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:50,818
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.

1692
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:52,319
Everything is okay.

1693
01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:54,187
You guys just scared
yourselves out there.

1694
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:56,090
This is an active
airspace over here,

1695
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,925
so the sonar can interfere
with cell reception.

1696
01:25:58,026 --> 01:26:00,094
It's not the end of the world.

1697
01:26:00,193 --> 01:26:01,763
But I still have
to write up a report,

1698
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:03,698
and there's some things
I can't figure out

1699
01:26:03,798 --> 01:26:06,701
like the comatose chicken and
the tampon taped to your head.

1700
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:10,104
Oh! This is because
we didn't have band-aids.

1701
01:26:10,203 --> 01:26:12,172
We stole some from the store.

1702
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:13,608
Paid for it.

1703
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:15,375
- We did pay for...
- Both: Shoplifted.

1704
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:17,512
- First.
- Full disclosure.

1705
01:26:17,612 --> 01:26:19,113
- And then we paid for it.
- We paid for it. Didn't intend to.

1706
01:26:19,212 --> 01:26:21,516
And then the chicken,
she wanted to...

1707
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:23,584
Well, I broke its leg,
and I thought we should...

1708
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:25,653
Broke its leg.
And I said kill it.

1709
01:26:25,753 --> 01:26:28,956
...give it medicine every two
hours 'cause I wanted for it to OD.

1710
01:26:29,057 --> 01:26:30,958
- You want to unplug someone on life support.
- I thought it would better.

1711
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:34,529
You don't want to prolong the inevitable.
Let's agree to disagree.

1712
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,532
We should've killed it,
anyway.

1713
01:26:37,632 --> 01:26:39,067
How did you end up
with Francis' chicken?

1714
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:40,134
We were trespassing.

1715
01:26:40,233 --> 01:26:41,769
Stop admitting more crimes.

1716
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,236
Okay.

1717
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:45,773
- What is with all the drones?
- Oh, my God.

1718
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:47,041
Yeah, there's a lot.

1719
01:26:47,141 --> 01:26:48,341
So this Google millionaire
came to town,

1720
01:26:48,442 --> 01:26:50,778
opened up this place
called The Drone Zone.

1721
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:53,313
He set up, like, 500 acres
of obstacle courses,

1722
01:26:53,413 --> 01:26:57,185
and apparently high school kids are
in something called drone squads.

1723
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:59,587
Now in my day, in high school,

1724
01:26:59,687 --> 01:27:01,221
I was making out
behind the bleachers,

1725
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:03,758
and I didn't do
any student activities.

1726
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:05,193
Okay.

1727
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:06,828
How did you guys
end up out here?

1728
01:27:06,928 --> 01:27:10,064
- His friend died.
- He was a great man,

1729
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:14,001
and at his memorial service,
I was just inspired to...

1730
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:16,771
...to reconnect us.

1731
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:20,541
I wanted to go somewhere remote,
so we came out here,

1732
01:27:20,641 --> 01:27:23,443
and I thought it would help us
to get out of town

1733
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:28,415
and find out what we are with
each other without distractions.

1734
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:33,286
It was a great idea,
and I really needed it.

1735
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:38,025
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1736
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:41,495
So, hat's next?
Do we call a lawyer?

1737
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:43,831
Well, Tampon Shakur,

1738
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,233
I think you should
call your daughter.

1739
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:46,399
- Oh, oh!
- Really?

1740
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,735
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, thank you so much.

1741
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:49,436
- Oh, thank you, officer.
- Oh, God.

1742
01:27:49,537 --> 01:27:50,638
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1743
01:27:50,738 --> 01:27:52,140
Solid wordplay.
Tampon Shakur.

1744
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,009
- I don't care.
- Lizzie! Oh, honey.

1745
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:57,310
- <i>Oh, we love you so much.</i>
- <i>Blizzard! How's grandma?</i>

1746
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:00,114
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Everything's fine.

1747
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:01,149
Well, we got cut off
the other day.

1748
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,617
And then I got some voicemail

1749
01:28:02,717 --> 01:28:03,851
saying you guys
had to go to the hospital.

1750
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:05,285
- What happened?
- Ask her.

1751
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,221
Oh. Grandma made some
tomato soup and felt weird,

1752
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,690
so we went to the hospital, and they
said her blood pressure's a little high,

1753
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,159
but the medication
brought it down.

1754
01:28:11,259 --> 01:28:12,527
- I'm fine.
- What? What?

1755
01:28:12,627 --> 01:28:14,361
No, they're fine.
They're fine. Tomato soup.

1756
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:16,731
Okay. Tomato soup.

1757
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:18,132
Ooh, grilled cheese.

1758
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:20,234
Uh, are you okay?

1759
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:22,302
Yes, sweetheart.
Mommy's okay.

1760
01:28:22,402 --> 01:28:26,406
- Everything's okay.
- Daddy's okay, too. We're okay.

1761
01:28:27,508 --> 01:28:29,777
I hope you like
small batch hot sauce.

1762
01:28:31,245 --> 01:28:32,880
What?

1763
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:47,460
- I hate that fucking car.
- Mm-hmm.

We love it, too.
Thanks for the great notes.

1778
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:52,693
You guys did a wonderful job.

1779
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:55,263
So, uh, have a great weekend,
get some rest,

1780
01:29:55,363 --> 01:29:58,566
and we'll talk soon, okay?
Bye-bye.

1781
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:02,402
- Back in the saddle!
- I do love jingles.

1782
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:05,239
- You're good at them.
- Yeah, right?

1783
01:30:05,339 --> 01:30:06,507
Ha, ha!

1784
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:08,576
Blizzard,
are you ready for this?

1785
01:30:08,676 --> 01:30:11,045
- Can we not?
- Oh, we're doing this.

1786
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:12,412
- It's so weird.
- ( clucking )

1787
01:30:12,513 --> 01:30:16,651
It really isn't.
It's totally normal.

1788
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,156
Why do we have to do
this in the front yard?

1789
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:24,892
Dan: Because last time,
the pizza guy couldn't find us.

1790
01:30:27,662 --> 01:30:29,597
Lizzie: What are we gonna
do in here, anyway?

1791
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:31,431
Dan: Mom brought games.

1792
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:34,501
Jeanine:
Checkers, dominos, Uno, Jenga.

1793
01:30:34,602 --> 01:30:37,504
Lizzie:
Mom, my phone has games.
