1
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,492
One video camera...
Beta!

2
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,968
Good evening, my friend.
Welcome.

3
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,510
So nice to see you.

4
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,581
I need money to buy gas,
so I can get out of this place.

5
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,808
Yes, of course.

6
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,283
You will be showing me
what is in the sack?

7
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,320
I can give you a hand.
May I?

8
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,056
Let's just open up here...

9
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,557
Oh, my, my, my!
What is this horrible thing?

10
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,262
It's a good luck charm.

11
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,895
Yes, I can see
it's working very well.

12
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,107
Whatever you do,
don't touch the medallion.

13
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,078
No, I won't.

14
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,182
I am giving you...

15
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,777
- Ten...
- No!

16
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,254
Twenty dollars.

17
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,052
Goodbye.

18
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,156
Come back soon!

19
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,604
Oh, my!
A face only a mother could love.

20
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,264
What a piece of junk!

21
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,705
"Don't touch,"
he says.

22
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,002
Because it might break,
it's so cheap.

23
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,299
Oh, Gupta, by golly!
You're a bloody genius!

24
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,637
You're making
a wonderful deal for $20.

25
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,280
Ahh!

26
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,783
I like I ndian food!
So spicy!

27
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,985
- Who are you?
- I'm a leprechaun, me lad,

28
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,926
and you're a greedy thief.

29
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,557
For trying to steal me gold,
I'll be giving you some grief.

30
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,794
Ouch! Ouch!

31
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,336
Have a lie-down, lad?

32
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,004
Nice leather!

33
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,044
I appreciate
a good pair of shoes.

34
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,578
Oh, don't mind if I do!

35
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,350
I think I'll whack you in the head
a dozen times until you're dead.

36
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,719
Take it away!
Take it away!

37
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,900
- You're very afraid of this?
- Stay away, I'm warning you.

38
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,697
I'll tear your eyes out
and I'll rip your face off.

39
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,135
You're a bloody devilish
creature!

40
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,171
You wanted me gold,
and you suffer the consequences.

41
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,610
Now I'll take what's mine,
and be gone from here.

42
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,354
No! You and your gold
belong to Gupta.

43
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,032
Well, you missed us both.

44
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,329
You wanna back up
and try that again?

45
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,597
Sorry.

46
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,433
It's all right,
happens all the time.

47
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,540
Do you know
anything about cars?

48
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,373
'Cause this one
doesn't work.

49
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
- Name's Scott.
- Tammy.

50
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,446
Tammy. Great.

51
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,610
What seems
to be the problem?

52
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,485
Obviously, I don't know.
It just... died on me.

53
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,421
Well,
let's take a look.

54
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,430
Ah, see,
someone stole your engine.

55
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,203
Start it up for me,
if you can.

56
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,009
So what do you think?

57
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,174
Have you ever
blown a rod before?

58
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,343
I beg your pardon?

59
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,819
The engine, I meant.
See, you got your pistons,

60
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,914
and your rods, and...

61
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,652
You don't wanna
know this, right?

62
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,160
No, actually I don't.

63
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,367
I'll give you 10 bucks
if you give me a ride to work.

64
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,731
Forget it.

65
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,135
You don't have to pay me.
Where do you work?

66
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,707
Chicago.

67
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,140
H uh, yeah, got me.

68
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,007
Chicago.

69
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,609
That's very good.
I would have taken you there, too.

70
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,750
Where is it?

71
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,824
Oh, here it is.
"Legends and Folklore. "

72
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,743
Computer: G'day to ya.
The name's O'Reilly,

73
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,480
and I'm here to tell you
about leprechauns.

74
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,615
Legend has it that they were once
magical elves in ancient times...

75
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,319
who became obsessed
with riches and gold.

76
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,629
96...

77
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,428
97...

78
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,264
98...

79
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,802
99...

80
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,641
I'm one shilling short!

81
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,514
Wow! Look at all the lights!

82
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,853
It's unbelievable!

83
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,984
Yeah, it's a quaint little place.

84
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,330
- So where do you work?
- "The Lucky Shamrock. "

85
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,059
Oh. What's that?

86
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,067
It's a casino, Scott.

87
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,668
What do you do there?

88
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,141
- I'm a magician.
- Right on!

89
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:16,010
Actually, right now,
I'm just a magician's assistant,

90
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,575
but one of these days,
I'm gonna have my own act.

91
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,244
I believe you.

92
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:29,294
One-little, two-little,
three little leprechauns...

93
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,659
four-little, five...

94
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,133
...little, six...

95
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,396
little leprechauns.

96
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,273
This place is unknown,
no one lives here.

97
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,539
Me own savings and loan.
I'll have nothing to fear.

98
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,277
Computer: Remember,
his power lies in his gold,

99
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,014
and he'll use all his magic
to protect it.

100
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,283
Yes, try to protect it
from this.

101
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,831
So is this your first trip
to Vegas?

102
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,060
Yeah. I'm just passing through.
I'm on my way to L.A.

103
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,002
Oh. You gonna be
a movie star?

104
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,096
No, actually,
I'm on my way to school.

105
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,107
My first year of college.

106
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,144
Great!
It's a smart move.

107
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,680
Go to school.
Learn something worthwhile.

108
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,775
I just thought I'd swing through
Vegas, see what it's like.

109
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,151
Take my advice
and don't stay long.

110
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,814
Yeah?

111
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,121
Vegas has a way of
latching on to a person.

112
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,991
You wanna go,
but you can't.

113
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,599
I'll remember that.

114
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,934
Computer: Potatoes are
a leprechaun's favorite meal.

115
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,769
Like all good ol' Irishmen,
he loves his spuds,

116
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,367
but he'll take a bite out of anybody
who threatens to steal his gold.

117
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,643
Woe betide the man who covets
a leprechaun's shillings.

118
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,082
He'll batter and brain them,
he'll mangle...

119
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,380
My, my, my!

120
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,629
Now let us go find
your little brothers and sisters.

121
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,699
I n fact,

122
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,699
let us find the entire family.

123
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,936
Computer: If a mortal gets hold
of the leprechaun's gold,

124
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,974
he'll be given one wish for
every shilling in his possession.

125
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,600
He can have anything
he wants in the whole world.

126
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,046
Thanks for the ride.
I really appreciate it.

127
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,516
- Sure.
- Bye.

128
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,894
Hey, I've never been inside
a real casino.

129
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,490
Oh, forget it.
You gotta be 21.

130
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,069
I know, but I thought
you could sneak me in,

131
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,264
so I can see
what it's like inside.

132
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,398
What do you think,
this is like Disneyland?

133
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,499
I could lose
my job for that.

134
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,703
My boss
could lose his license.

135
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,543
And you
will lose your shirt.

136
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,618
Right. I didn't think about that.
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,147
All right, look.

138
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,986
If I get you into the den of iniquity,
you gotta promise me something.

139
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,218
No gambling.

140
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,522
- Okay.
- J ust take a look around,

141
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,824
see what you gotta see,
and beat it.

142
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,593
- I'm out of there.
- All right.

143
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,759
So who do you work for,
magician-wise?

144
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,464
Right now, I'm assisting
The Great Fazio.

145
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,804
- What's a Fazio?
- Well, Scott,

146
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,878
a Fazio is a mediocre magician
who couldn't pull a rabbit

147
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,446
out of a pet store.

148
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,777
But it pays the bills.

149
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,078
Remember now,
no trouble, okay?

150
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,447
I n and out.

151
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,077
Okay.

152
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,883
Maybe I could come
see your show,

153
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,925
and we could have dinner
afterwards.

154
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,323
It's a possibility,
if I'm not busy...

155
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,762
who knows?

156
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,693
I n you go.

157
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,814
You are mine,
you little bugger.

158
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,188
Ahhh!

159
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,356
Ha, ha, ha!

160
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,694
You missed me!
You missed me!

161
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,965
If you're gonna linger,
I'll give you the finger.

162
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,209
Ahh!

163
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,856
Ahhh!

164
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,065
Stay away from me,
you steaming pile of cannibal dung!

165
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,938
I'm a dangerous man!

166
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,602
Stay away from me!

167
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,578
Computer: I remember when
Paddy McGinty got sick with...

168
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,282
I want me shilling!

169
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,461
Man: Oh, yes, yes!

170
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,436
Man: All right.

171
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,407
Oh!

172
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,535
Thank you, Marissa.

173
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,917
You're terrible.

174
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,813
Seven!

175
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,521
- Whoo!
- All right!

176
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,855
Roll again, Father Bob!

177
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,828
Give me those dice here.
More money, come on.

178
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,294
Ready?

179
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,735
Here she goes.
Look at this!

180
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,728
All right.

181
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,376
What time is it?

182
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,640
It's after 7:00.
Where's Tammy?

183
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,807
I don't know, damn it!
She's got work to do!

184
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,647
Why do you keep her around?
She's not worth a damn.

185
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,620
She's got a way
of filling out a costume.

186
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,247
I could look
just as good, you know.

187
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,155
Why don't you hire me?

188
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,491
20 years ago, Loretta,
or should I say 20 Ibs. Ago?

189
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,993
I'm not always gonna look
just like this, pally.

190
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,967
No? You found
the fountain of youth?

191
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,300
I've been saving my pennies,
buddy boy,

192
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,966
and one of these days,
I'll come waltzing in that door...

193
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,441
with everything packed
into all the right places.

194
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,876
You need more
than a boob job, Loretta.

195
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,414
You need
a personality transplant.

196
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,983
Bitch!

197
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,416
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm late, Fazio.

198
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,988
I told you, you will
address me as "Great One. "

199
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,647
Off stage and on.

200
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,884
You're a magician,
not the Pope.

201
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,723
I am your teacher.
You will show me respect.

202
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,160
Right.

203
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,660
Loretta.

204
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,097
Mm-hmm.

205
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,395
Throw me that lighter.

206
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,904
Ow!

207
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,564
Are you doing
the magic rings tonight?

208
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,902
Screw the magic rings!

209
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,275
Oh, my God!

210
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,870
I've got something
10 times better.

211
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,315
You're in the box,
I do the standard switch gag,

212
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,216
and then I set fire
to the box!

213
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,755
The audience goes nuts,
thinking you're in there...

214
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,018
being burnt alive.

215
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,924
I'm gonna call it
"The Burning Beauty. "

216
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,561
Oh, God!

217
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,602
Man: What the hell
is going on here?

218
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,610
Fazio, is this the fabulous stunt
you wanted me to see?

219
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,339
What are you, nuts?

220
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,711
Only a moron would
try something like this.

221
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,805
You believe this guy?

222
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,045
It'll be great. I'll make sure
she's got protection.

223
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,711
Forget it.
End of discussion.

224
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,847
I'm not taking any chances
with my future headliner.

225
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,789
How you're doing, babe?
You look sensational.

226
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,019
Now, you...

227
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,154
get out there and mix with
the suckers. Do something like...

228
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,893
do some card tricks or something.
Keep them entertained.

229
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,492
Out of the question!
I work the main room!

230
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
- I'm a star.
- You're a schmuck.

231
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,403
Now get out there
and earn your pay, Fazio.

232
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,906
That goes for you, too.
Break is over.

233
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,538
Back to work.

234
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,390
So, you need anything,
you know who to come to, right?

235
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,425
Right.

236
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,894
Yeah, you keep playing
hard to get,

237
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,261
but mark my words,
you'll come around.

238
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,765
I guarantee.

239
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,295
I saw that.

240
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,639
Loretta:
Rolling, rolling, rolling!

241
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,680
Where she stops,
nobody knows.

242
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,147
And winner,
winner, winner!

243
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,050
We have a winner!

244
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,247
To the sharp-dressed man!

245
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,381
Thank you.

246
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,655
You'll need a dump truck
to take it all home, Mister.

247
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,354
A rack for you.

248
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,825
Yeah, this is for you.

249
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,463
What a gentleman! U h-huh!

250
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,768
Everyone's a winner today.

251
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,506
Excuse me, do you know
where I can cash a check?

252
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,705
Are you old enough
to be in here?

253
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,783
U h... oh! Yes!
You're old enough.

254
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,717
Right over there.
You have a good day.

255
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,916
Hey, Mitch,
how's it hanging?

256
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,789
Hi, fellas!
Listen, not now, okay?

257
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,624
I've got business.

258
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,857
Stay here!

259
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,523
What are you, a 44 regular?

260
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,831
You know, I've got a plaid that'll
make you look 20 Ibs. Younger.

261
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,097
What do you want, Art?

262
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,867
What do I want?
I want brown hair.

263
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,534
I want health insurance
for all Americans.

264
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,737
I want the Mets to get
their shit together.

265
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,781
Let's not worry about what I want,
but about what I need.

266
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,077
- I need my money.
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow's good.

267
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,551
I'll stop by your store,
we'll take care of everything.

268
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,951
- Tell him.
- Okay? Excuse me.

269
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,819
Look sharp, be sharp.

270
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,887
No, tell him the other thing,
the threat thing.

271
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,486
Oh...

272
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,726
You pay Arthur the money
you owe him,

273
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,735
or I will kill you.

274
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,861
That's good.

275
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,940
What are you, tough guys?
I got hemorrhoids tougher than you.

276
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,269
Hey!

277
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,072
On the other hand, why don't
we meet a little later...

278
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,112
over by the cashier's cage?

279
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,206
How about 10:00?
It's good for me if it's good for you.

280
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,251
10:00? When do you take
your break?

281
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,719
- 9:30.
- 9:30 to 9:45? Can you make it?

282
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,346
- Sure.
- Okay, 10:00 is good.

283
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,049
- You mind?
- Yeah.

284
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,821
You buy off the rack,
that's what happens.

285
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,793
I could've taken him.

286
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,302
No, no, he couldn't.
You, bigger.

287
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,980
Loretta: Get 'em down,
before the wheel goes 'round.

288
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,713
We're gonna have somebody lucky
before the night is over.

289
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,813
You feelin' lucky?
You feelin' lucky, sugar?

290
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,915
What you gonna do
with all that, huh?

291
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,161
I believe I'll try this one.

292
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,630
Dangerous man, I like it.

293
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,663
And the wheel goes round and round,
no more bets, no more bets.

294
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,120
Ah!

295
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,468
There was an old man of Madras
whose balls were made of fine brass,

296
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,768
so, in stormy weather,
they both clanged together,

297
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,808
and sparks flew
out of his ass.

298
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,940
I'm finding this to be a very funny
and poetic leprechaun.

299
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,745
I'm glad you liked it, lad.

300
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,754
Now you left the door open,
so I assumed you wanted to see me.

301
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,825
Yes, I'm wanting
to discuss things with you.

302
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,827
- For instance?
- I want to negotiate.

303
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,193
I am for giving you
this medallion,

304
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,290
which you are terribly,
terribly afraid of,

305
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,959
for half your gold.

306
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,300
Half me gold
for a worthless medallion?!

307
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,033
This is my final offer!
You are taking it or leaving it.

308
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,906
You got a deal, lad.

309
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,140
Now, put it away,
why don't you?

310
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,514
Perhaps I'll do
a little fishing.

311
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,498
I told you a terrible lie,
and now you're going to die.

312
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,335
18 red.
We got a winner!

313
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,472
I can't...
I can't believe it!

314
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,517
How could this happen to me?

315
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,018
Place your bets, place your bets.
Tough luck, kid.

316
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,783
So, you gonna bet or what?
Get 'em down.

317
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,323
You want me to bet?

318
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,893
I had $23,000.

319
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,087
So? Looks like you got
a couple hundred.

320
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,686
You can get hot.

321
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,029
Get 'em down, get 'em down.
Big spender, big spender.

322
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,400
And the wheel goes round
and round and round, get 'em down.

323
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,632
There you go.

324
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,498
- Where the hell were you?
- I told you,

325
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,866
the trap door
keeps getting stuck.

326
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,304
That's what I get for working at
a dump like this, nothing works.

327
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,471
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

328
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,815
No more bets, no more bets!

329
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,119
Feelin' lucky,
Mr. Big Time Spender?

330
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,056
Here she's dropping...

331
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,924
Oh! Green, double zero!

332
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,997
The house makes out.
Sorry, folks!

333
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:26,229
What have I done?
I'm ruined, I'm finished.

334
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,773
What, are you kidding me?
You're due, you're gonna make it big.

335
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,967
- Place your bets!
- What?!

336
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,101
Trust me.

337
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,009
Bad streak of luck like that,
no way you're gonna lose.

338
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,378
Get 'em down
before the wheel goes around!

339
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,110
Oh, yeah, trust me.

340
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,810
But I don't have
any more money.

341
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,150
Nice watch there.
Could bring a nice chunk o'change.

342
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,820
My grandpa gave me this watch,
for graduation.

343
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,286
Make him proud.
Make a comeback. Win!

344
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,533
Pawn shop across the street,
tell 'em Loretta sent you.

345
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,125
Get 'em down, get 'em down!

346
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,565
- Ha!
- Ow!

347
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,409
Where's me shilling?

348
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,910
I want me shilling!

349
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:08,740
Help!

350
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,668
No! No! No!

351
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,834
Tell me where it is,
or by me sainted mother,

352
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,274
I'll strangle you!

353
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,606
This must be the place.

354
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,185
This is your last chance.
I'm warning you.

355
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,088
I want me shilling!

356
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,537
Oh, no!
What was I thinking?

357
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,165
With all this killing,
I've lost me shilling!

358
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,278
Hello!

359
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,939
Anybody here?

360
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,314
Hello?

361
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,860
Oh, my God!

362
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,503
Oh, man!

363
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,775
I thought I had problems.

364
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,278
Operator, listen,
I'm in a pawn shop

365
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,911
across the street from
the Lucky Shamrock Casino.

366
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,012
And I found a dead person.

367
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,317
Yeah, I'm sure.

368
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,416
Yeah.

369
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,018
All right,
I'll wait right here.

370
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,825
Computer: A leprechaun
is very territorial.

371
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,132
He can never tolerate another
leprechaun crossing his boundaries.

372
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,276
One leprechaun
can be aggravating,

373
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,369
but two can be devastating.

374
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,004
With that in mind,

375
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,913
let's review what we've learned
about leprechauns.

376
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,454
N umber one,
his power lies in his gold.

377
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,615
Without it, he's just another gnome
full of mischief.

378
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,191
N umber two,
each of his gold shillings

379
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,026
will bring a wish come true
to anyone who possesses them.

380
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,731
A wish, huh?

381
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,270
I wish I was back at the casino
on a winning streak.

382
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,264
Aargh!

383
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,205
I've lost him!

384
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,281
He's got me shilling!

385
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,043
He's got me shilling!

386
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,277
What the heck
am I doing here?

387
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,982
There are no other bets,
no other bettors.

388
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,149
J ust the house
and the golden boy!

389
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,124
He's riding seven red,
let's see how lucky he gets.

390
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,668
Oh, hell!
The seven red!

391
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,936
We got a winner!

392
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,078
You gonna let that ride,
golden boy?

393
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:57,806
And the luckiest man in Las Vegas
puts the whole load on 13 black.

394
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,276
13 black is up,
nobody else is betting.

395
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,284
Ah! Lovely golden palaces
completely full of riches,

396
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,051
I'll rip them off and rob them blind,
those dirty sons of bitches!

397
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,065
- Yeah!
- Oh, oh, oh! Black 13!

398
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,434
Another winner,
another winner!

399
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,769
This guy's got
a hell of a winning streak.

400
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,908
Winning streak.
I wished for a winning streak!

401
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,708
What the hell is going on here?

402
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,183
U nbelievable! He can't lose!

403
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,187
Two hours ago, he's losing his shirt.
Now, I can't stop him.

404
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,257
You better stop him,
or else.

405
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,323
Any other bettors?
No other bettors!

406
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,562
On the way to being
a millionaire.

407
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,394
Six black.

408
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,763
Here we go!

409
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,904
Come on, baby,
make me a winner!

410
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,369
And it's a...

411
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,250
Whoa!
The hits just keep on coming!

412
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,152
A winner!

413
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,885
I've about had it with you,
Loretta.

414
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,460
I did what you told me.

415
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,687
Something went wrong.

416
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:28,459
You better get the money back
or something will go wrong.

417
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,500
With you.
You know what I mean?

418
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

419
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,828
Golden N ugget.
I'd like one of those.

420
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,827
Loretta: He's a winner again!

421
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,968
Ladies and gentlemen,

422
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,703
due to a slight quivering
in the stem of the wheel,

423
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,039
the situation is thus...

424
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,081
this table is closed,
but it's only temporary.

425
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,740
Come back
in a little while.

426
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,818
- Aw!
- All right?

427
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,476
Thank you very much.

428
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,124
Hey, kid...

429
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,386
congratulations.

430
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,689
You've had some...
some amazing streak of luck.

431
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,196
- I mean, truly amazing.
- Thanks!

432
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,994
I don't know how it happened.
I was losing everything...

433
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,261
and all of a sudden...

434
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,133
Yeah, you see, that's how
it happens sometimes.

435
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,606
Tell me, kid, you...
you staying here at the hotel?

436
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,937
No, actually I'm not.

437
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,511
Oh, well,
let's just change that.

438
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,012
Here you go.

439
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:53,515
We'd like you to be our guest.
Anything you want, it's on me.

440
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,176
- Okay?
- Wow!

441
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,412
Thanks a lot!

442
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,615
Oh, no problem.
Listen, why don't you just relax,

443
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,352
take a break,
come back in a hour or so,

444
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,860
and see if you can keep
that winning streak going?

445
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,691
- What do you say, kid, huh?
- Yeah!

446
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,697
I can't wait
to get back into it.

447
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,768
Las Vegas is really
turning out to be a great place.

448
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,531
Vegas, the greatest
little town in the world!

449
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,163
I'll see you in a while.

450
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,004
Oh, we'll keep the same
table reserved just for you.

451
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,577
Okay, I'll be here.

452
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,838
That's good.

453
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,746
Jesus!

454
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,008
Schmuck!

455
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,443
Tammy, you won't believe
what happened!

456
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:32,114
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be gambling!

457
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,851
- I won!
- All that?

458
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,257
Scott, you said
you wouldn't gamble!

459
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,124
I know,
but something happened to me,

460
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,061
it's like I've got
the fever or something.

461
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,760
I mean, I was losing my shirt,
and then I went to pawn my watch,

462
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,598
and then
I found a dead guy...

463
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,830
You what?!

464
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,464
At the pawn shop,
but the next thing you know,

465
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,805
I'm back at the casino
winning everything.

466
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,138
Listen to me...

467
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,679
They gave me my own room!
On the house, see?

468
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,874
Scott, just shut up
and listen to me.

469
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,611
I want you to cash in your chips
and go home.

470
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,153
Get in your car
and leave Las Vegas.

471
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,519
No, Tammy, no, listen.

472
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,559
All this happened
because of you.

473
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,491
I wanna share it
with you.

474
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,224
Scott!
Oh, my God!

475
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,027
Are you serious?

476
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,470
Look, I've got a show,
I gotta go.

477
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,368
J ust...
all right, cash in the chips

478
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,407
and go to your room
and stay there.

479
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,444
Don't let anybody in!
I cannot stress that enough.

480
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,207
Nobody comes in.

481
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,441
And keep the money
right beside you.

482
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,347
- Okay?
- Okay.

483
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,546
When I'm done with my next show,
I'll come up and we'll talk.

484
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,054
- Okay?
- All right.

485
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,056
I'll be up
as soon as I can.

486
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,728
This is so great,
I can't...

487
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,989
Shh!
Scott!

488
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,121
Shh!

489
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,599
Are you gonna
cash those in?

490
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,135
Oh, yeah.

491
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,000
You've done
well for yourself.

492
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,437
It was a good night.

493
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,473
Nope!

494
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,621
Me shilling!

495
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,858
A lucky sign.

496
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,327
The gold inside
will soon be mine.

497
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,081
Fine suit of clothes, lad!

498
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,774
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

499
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,909
Those shoes...
do they come in blue suede?

500
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,112
I really like 'em, man.

501
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,348
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

502
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,186
Hey, man,
you do that pretty good.

503
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,056
Next time, make sure
you get paid for it.

504
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,187
Hey, man,
see you on the flipside.

505
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,003
Vegas!
My kind o' town!

506
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,008
Thank you.
No, thank you.

507
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,846
And now,
using all my magic,

508
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,115
I will summon forth
a member of the animal kingdom.

509
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,422
Bah!

510
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,695
Fazio!

511
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,831
Of course, the casino won't
allow me to use a real bunny.

512
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,403
Oh, my God!

513
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,974
Hello, little one.

514
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,914
What an interesting costume.

515
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,451
Watch this...

516
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,885
Oh, shit!

517
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,187
A little token of my esteem,

518
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,161
it is exactly what it seems.

519
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,166
Made fresh daily
at exactly 9:00

520
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,533
It comes from my shillelagh,
you can keep it in a crock.

521
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,486
Fazio!
J ust the girl I wanna see.

522
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,251
Not now!
Some little butthead...

523
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,054
What is that smell?
Is that my shoe?

524
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,652
- It was in my hand!
- Oh, my God!

525
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,323
Have you seen that
little tramp that works for me?

526
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,300
Oh, Tammy? Forget her.
Focus on that punk at the elevator.

527
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,905
What about him?

528
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,736
He just won over a hundred
thou with the roulette wheel.

529
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,402
You're kidding! How did you
let him win that much?

530
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,809
Something went wrong.
He still got it on him.

531
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,846
Cash and carry.

532
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,581
- I n cash?
- He's got this gold coin I want.

533
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,675
Really?

534
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,220
I figured we split
the green,

535
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,586
I get the gold coin.
You know, good luck charm.

536
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,095
What's his room number?

537
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,473
Room service?

538
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,481
Like taking candy from a baby!

539
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,147
- Go and throw me a winner!
- Yeah!

540
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,718
Yeah!

541
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,889
- Oh, I never lose!
- Hey, Tony, look what we got here.

542
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,090
- A high roller.
- Move!

543
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,430
Nice duds.
What is that, lederhosen?

544
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,163
- Take a break, pal.
- Hey, crappier,

545
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,239
you give me them dice,
I'm feeling lucky!

546
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,435
But I'm not through
winning, lad!

547
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,636
Get outta here...

548
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,337
Aaargh!

549
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,712
Looks like a slot machine!

550
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,488
You wanna try your luck?

551
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,089
This is my kind of place,
crooked and sleazy,

552
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,755
stealing gold from humans
is awfully easy.

553
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,401
Look out, Vegas!
I'm taking over!

554
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,733
Money, money,
money, money...

555
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,434
Oh, it's good!

556
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,842
Money is good!

557
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,208
Money...

558
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,397
That's silk.
I'll keep that.

559
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,118
Hey!

560
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,891
What are you doing
in my room?

561
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,156
Oof!

562
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:31,772
Ow!

563
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,885
Room service!

564
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,721
What the hell...?

565
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,758
Now, me boyo,

566
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,759
I smell me shilling.

567
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,489
Tell me where it is
or there'll be another killing.

568
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,394
What the hell are you?!

569
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,297
I'm a leprechaun,
come to claim me gold.

570
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,036
Aah!

571
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,005
Aaah!

572
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,876
Aaah!

573
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,048
God!

574
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,797
Yeah, give me hotel security.

575
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,800
Yeah, I'd like to report
a leprechaun in your hotel.

576
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,997
No, a leprechaun.

577
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,971
Yeah, a little green guy.

578
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,071
He tried to kill me!

579
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,645
Hello?

580
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,508
The coin.
The bastard took my coin!

581
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,401
Next time,
I'll take the elevator!

582
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,873
Oh!

583
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,369
I have been looking
all over hell for you.

584
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,841
- You got the coin?
- Yes, I got the coin.

585
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,571
I didn't find any money.

586
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,907
- Gimme!
- Forget it!

587
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,344
We're splitting it 50/50.

588
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,245
We made a deal,
that coin belongs to me.

589
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,648
I didn't get the money,
so now we're splitting it.

590
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,085
I'm not gonna sell it,
you putz!

591
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,090
It's got powers!

592
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,680
What kind of powers?

593
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,783
Put it on the table,
you won't believe this.

594
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,293
It's amazing!

595
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,453
Come on!

596
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,525
I can't,
it's magically disappeared.

597
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,262
- Put it on the table!
- All right. What number?

598
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,099
Oh, just any one!
Any one!

599
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,536
11 black.

600
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,604
I don't get it.

601
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,014
Get what?
Are you losing your mind?

602
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,576
It moves!
It moves to the winning number!

603
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,882
- By itself!
- Oh, I see!

604
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,754
It moves to the winning number
by itself, which means that...

605
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,690
you're nuts!

606
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,821
I gotta go do my show.
Find a coin dealer,

607
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,627
get it appraised
and we will sell it.

608
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,827
I swear,
on my mother's grave,

609
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,733
it has magic.

610
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,432
Loretta, darling,
if you want magic,

611
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,374
bend over. I'll pull a rabbit
out of your ass.

612
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,877
Do what I tell you.
I'll see you tonight.

613
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,038
Fazio!

614
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,844
I know you've got work
to do backstage.

615
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,043
I'm gone.

616
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,046
He's gone.

617
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,154
- Did you get my money back yet?
- I'm working on it.

618
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,228
- What's that?
- That's mine!

619
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,422
That looks like gold to me.
Give me it.

620
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,091
- Give me it!
- It's my personal property!

621
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,261
I'm gonna keep this until
you get my money back for me.

622
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,430
That's my personal property.
I want it back!

623
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,666
Keep your voice down.

624
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,006
One thing I can't stand
is a fat broad with a big mouth.

625
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,579
Who's calling fat fat,
Mr. Porker?

626
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,580
- Really!
- Yeah, really.

627
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,584
You couldn't get a woman
if your life depended on it.

628
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,678
I could have
any broad that I wanted.

629
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,019
Like that bubblehead
little bimbo, Miss Tammy?

630
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,684
Yeah, I could have
Tammy if I wanted her.

631
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,091
Oh, you wish!

632
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,492
Yeah...

633
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,825
I wish!

634
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,826
What was that?

635
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,533
Oh!

636
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,837
Ah!

637
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:05,211
If wishes were horses, a fat man
like you couldn't get in the saddle.

638
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,442
Mitch!

639
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,041
Tammy, what's the matter?

640
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,313
- I want you.
- You do?

641
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,414
I want you more than any man
I've ever known in my life.

642
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,459
Have you got a fever?

643
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,426
Oh, right now, Mitch!

644
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,429
Take me!

645
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,295
Take me right here!
On the floor!

646
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,431
Oh! Oh!

647
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,203
Yes!

648
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,471
"Fatso," huh?

649
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,011
Look, whatever it is,
don't change a thing.

650
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,546
You just stay like this.

651
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,741
Oh, yes!

652
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,477
Come on,
let's go to my room.

653
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,888
Mandatory drug testing
for all employees, that's it.

654
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,120
- Mitchy, Mitchy...
- We're going right to my room.

655
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,356
- Oh, it's time, Mitchy.
- Oh, I'm ready!

656
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,165
- I can get really nasty!
- You can?

657
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,897
- Yeah!
- Then you just do it.

658
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,239
- Come on, baby!
- Yeah!

659
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,750
Wait a minute.
That's what he said.

660
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,116
"I wish. "

661
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:34,761
Oh, Mitchy,
where have you been all my life?

662
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,169
I've been right here, baby,
waiting for you.

663
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,301
Gimme a kiss!

664
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,469
Oh, Mitchy!

665
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,376
I like my loving...

666
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,814
the same way
I like my men...

667
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,044
- tough.
- Tough?

668
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,620
And hard, like this.

669
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,620
Whoa!

670
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,682
Ooh, that's wonderful!

671
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,990
I wanna make you feel it,
like this.

672
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,224
Oh!

673
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,732
Ooh!
You're turning me on!

674
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,134
I think I got the idea.
Let me do it for you.

675
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,236
Oh, Mitchy! Yeah!

676
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,372
Oh, I love it! Ooh!

677
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,845
Now, can we...
can we do it?

678
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,782
My boxers
keep crawling up my butt.

679
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,086
I hate that.
I go with jockeys now.

680
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,457
It kinda makes me feel
like a sissy.

681
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,494
Yeah.

682
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,833
You can't hang,
like you really want to...

683
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,062
- How do you want it hanging?
- Loose. I wanna be comfortable.

684
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,607
- I like the support.
- Oh, yeah? Feels good.

685
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,574
- How's my tie look?
- Fine. Good.

686
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,879
My socks are hanging
down my ankles.

687
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:54,348
I wear those ones that come
over the calves, like tubers.

688
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:58,285
I'd get those garters,
but they make me feel like a sissy.

689
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,953
Where the hell is that guy?

690
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,920
Enough with the pain.

691
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,258
Okay, no more pain.

692
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,165
Oh, sweetie, mama's
gonna make you feel so good!

693
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,240
Oh, well, good is good,
pain is...

694
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:24,403
What tasteful decor!

695
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,914
Mitchy, it's like a museum.

696
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,008
Let's do it...

697
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,643
- Let's do it!
- Oh, Mitchy!

698
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,314
- This is good.
- Down, boy.

699
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,412
Now, first...

700
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,856
- First what?
- I'm gonna make you hot.

701
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,723
- Yes, I like that.
- And then...

702
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,457
- What?
- I'm gonna make you burn.

703
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,294
Burn?

704
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,267
Oh, boy!

705
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,144
That...
that's very nice!

706
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,357
Oh, that's nice,
that's good! Yes!

707
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,230
Mitch: Do it! Do it...
Yes!

708
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,911
You got real talent.

709
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,963
Whoo-whee... yes!

710
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,704
Have I got a wish for you!

711
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,616
- Mitch?
- Come and get me, baby!

712
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,914
What did you do to me?
How did you get me here?

713
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,784
- Hey, wait!
- How did I get here?

714
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,756
It's me, remember?
The love machine! Come on!

715
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,588
Get away from me!
You letch!

716
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:23,091
Oh-hh! You bitch!
You ballbreaking tease!

717
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,691
You're fired
as of tonight!

718
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,770
You're finished
in show business!

719
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,305
You'll never get a job
in this town again.

720
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,075
Belongs to me,
this gold I smell.

721
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,012
Whoever's got it
is going to hell.

722
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,203
Ah, potatoes!

723
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,936
I was gonna
make her a star.

724
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,478
All she had to do
was cooperate.

725
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,148
What the hell
is going on?

726
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,687
What channel is this?

727
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,896
What do you need her for, Mitch,
when you can have me?

728
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,593
She called me Mitch?

729
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,368
Take a look at these,
Mitch...

730
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,302
H uh! Coincidence.

731
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,645
I like this!

732
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,517
Here you go!
Baked potato, broiled potato,

733
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,249
french fries,
potato skins, potato salad

734
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,758
and six potato pancakes.

735
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,054
Anything else?

736
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,131
There once was a lady
of Totten

737
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,290
whose taste grew perverted
and rotten.

738
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,564
She cared not for steaks,
or for pastries and cakes

739
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,901
but lived upon
penis au gratin.

740
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,134
Metallica!

741
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,300
No, wait!

742
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,274
White Zombie.
I've got the album.

743
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,508
Enjoy your spuds!

744
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,955
What the hell
did I just say?

745
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,650
I'm coming for you, Mitch!

746
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,226
I must be dreaming.

747
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,727
I'm coming!

748
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,923
- Come on, baby!
- I can't wait to reach you.

749
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,193
Well, come and get me!

750
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,236
Oh!

751
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,180
- I must be dreaming.
- No.

752
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,077
- I'm not dreaming?
- No.

753
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:30,448
- Ah, this is nice, this is good.
- Oh, Mitch!

754
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,647
What can I do for you?
Where did you come from?

755
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,554
- What's the difference?
- I'll show you...

756
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:39,025
Hey, you want my heatseeking
moisture missile, don't you?

757
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,629
What a lovely treat
for a fine lad like meself!

758
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,195
What's wrong with me?
Why am I talking like that?

759
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,569
- Hey, rich kid!
- Loretta!

760
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,643
Eating up
all your winnings already!

761
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,609
Where's Tammy?
Have you seen her?

762
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,773
Ha! She's up in Mitch's office
getting her clock cleaned.

763
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,872
What?!

764
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,646
- Life's a bitch, ain't it?
- Where's Mitch's office?

765
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,983
Third floor, room 318.

766
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,455
Elevator left, then a right.
Bon appetit!

767
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,396
That's the freak
that broke into my room!

768
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,293
Oh, yeah, baby!

769
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,338
Feeling sick?
Stubbed your toe?

770
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,930
Call this lawyer.

771
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,067
I'll fix your woe.
Agony is my business.

772
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,271
I'll fight for you!

773
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,075
Even you, Mitch!

774
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,513
Oh, excuse me...

775
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,607
You... did you hear
my name mentioned?

776
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,117
- No.
- Oh, good!

777
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,619
- Tammy! Are you all right?
- Stay away from me!

778
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,852
What happened?
What's wrong?

779
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,862
Nothing happened.
Nothing's wrong.

780
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,727
J ust business as usual.

781
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,358
What did he do to you?
Tell me what he did!

782
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,530
It's what he tried
to do, okay?

783
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,075
It's not like this is the first time
this has happened to me.

784
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:04,476
It's just that this time,
along with everything else,

785
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,483
I got fired.
So let's just forget it.

786
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:13,648
No. I'm not gonna forget it.
And neither are you.

787
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,385
If we let him get away with it,
he'll do it again to somebody else.

788
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,428
And I don't know
about you,

789
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,690
but I'm not gonna
let that happen.

790
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:40,240
Praise the Lord!
And send in your money!

791
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,649
Otherwise, you're all doomed
to hellfire and damnation

792
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,153
for fornicating
with the devil's harlot.

793
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,192
Especially you, Mitch!
You're a prime offender!

794
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,989
- That just sounded like my name!
- No.

795
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,620
- No?
- No.

796
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,732
The signs point to
a tragedy about to happen.

797
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,276
Casino owner dies...

798
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,278
in a bed of lies.

799
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,280
Whoa!

800
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,215
- That was my name, right?
- Yes!

801
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,081
Oh, shit.

802
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,689
What the hell
is happening here?

803
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,385
No, no!
Get off of me!

804
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,327
Oh!

805
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,525
Where the hell is that asshole?
Come on!

806
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:38,002
A dream,
this is a bad dream!

807
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,809
You'll get what's due
when I electrocute you!

808
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,759
Scott...

809
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,295
thank you.

810
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,766
- Mitch...
- Sir?

811
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,033
My God!

812
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,237
Oh, Scott!

813
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,441
Where's me shilling?

814
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,047
You again?

815
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,552
Now, me boyo,

816
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,021
it's time to cut you
down to size.

817
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,182
Who are you?

818
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,861
Let's get out of here!

819
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,899
Mitch, I want my money,
and I want my money now.

820
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,162
What the hell's
going on here?

821
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,674
You're in
a lot of trouble.

822
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,211
- Out of me way!
- Hey! Stay there.

823
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,713
I know you, you're that guy
from the craps table.

824
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,545
You know, you really should see
a dermatologist or something,

825
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,812
that's really bad.

826
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,479
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

827
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,551
Ahhh!

828
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,865
That really hurt!

829
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,806
We dance.

830
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,648
Tell me, what was
J udy Garland really like?

831
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,935
They should have been willing
to give me me shilling.

832
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,942
But I've done well
by sending them to hell!

833
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,982
What are we gonna do?
He's a monster!

834
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,213
Nobody's gonna believe us
if we tell them what we've seen!

835
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,754
Oh!

836
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,851
Scott, what's wrong?

837
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,225
I don't know...

838
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,558
My insides...

839
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,758
It's like everything's
twisted up.

840
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,095
Oh, my God!

841
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,068
What is it?
What's wrong?

842
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,502
Your face!

843
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,130
I'm in trouble, Tammy.

844
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,640
Help me!

845
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,115
Scott,
we gotta get out of here.

846
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,649
Like you said...

847
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,742
who's gonna believe us?

848
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,115
I don't know...

849
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,921
That's where
it all happened.

850
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,152
- Where?
- At the pawn shop across the street.

851
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,856
That's where I found the coin.
I think that's where the answer is.

852
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,899
Let's go check it out.

853
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,095
H uh! I smell me shilling...

854
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:02,736
and the gentle fragrance
of a lady's perfume.

855
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,214
Let it work,
let it work, let it work!

856
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,888
Let me be beautiful.

857
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,451
Give me the body
of a stacked 20 year-old.

858
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,289
Please...

859
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,263
I wanna be sexy...

860
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,396
and beautiful again.

861
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,799
I wish.

862
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,416
Men: Yeah!

863
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,126
Enter!

864
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,768
Loretta?

865
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,303
That's right, sweetheart!

866
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,066
Little ol' me.

867
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,768
Didn't I tell you one of these days
I was gonna turn it around?

868
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,038
But how?

869
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,773
Magic.

870
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,371
All I had to do...

871
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,813
was wish for it.

872
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,114
Pretty! Yours?

873
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,749
Man, oh, man,
oh Manischevitz!

874
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,589
Look at those tits!

875
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:30,530
I wish I was a man so I could just
screw myself right on the floor.

876
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,033
And I dare you
to feel that ass, Fazio.

877
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,693
That's prime.

878
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,863
All you had to do
was wish for it?

879
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,167
You got it!

880
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,708
- Thanks!
- You! Give that back to me!

881
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,801
Give it back!
Give it back right now!

882
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,845
Thanks for the loan, Loretta.
I owe you.

883
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,177
You flaming faggot!

884
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,554
But since there's a mirror
in the room,

885
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,784
I might as well
stick around...

886
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,694
and enjoy it!

887
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,503
All right,
this had better work!

888
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:09,764
I wish...

889
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,774
I wish...

890
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,472
that I was the greatest magician
in the world!

891
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,858
I am just so damn
gorgeous!

892
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,866
They're gonna want me like
they never wanted anybody before.

893
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,104
And I'm gonna
make 'em pay.

894
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,408
Who the hell are you?

895
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,500
I'm a leprechaun, me lass,

896
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,340
and I'm gonna make you pay!

897
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,108
What do you want?

898
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,685
Your boobs are big,
your butt is small,

899
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,153
but still you're in
for quite a fall!

900
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,587
What are you talking about?

901
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,682
Oh, what,
didn't you hear?

902
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,284
Bigger is good,
but jumbo is dear.

903
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,659
I'll give you boobs
that come out to here.

904
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,203
My babies!

905
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,802
What are you doing
to my babies?

906
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,543
Those delightful lips,
they'll get you some tips.

907
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:29,414
But what about these?
Aren't they big enough to please?

908
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,748
No! What are you doing?

909
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,890
Oh, a delightful little slut!

910
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,759
But what about your butt?

911
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,770
You little monster!

912
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,772
Oh, my God!

913
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,923
Feels like rain!

914
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,477
Now that was quite a load
to have to explode!

915
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:38,519
What a lovely lass!
I had to blow up your ass!

916
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,418
But now
I must hit the road.

917
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,326
That's where I found
the poor guy lying.

918
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,334
And you think
the leprechaun did it?

919
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,630
Who else?

920
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,267
Now, there was something
on the computer...

921
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,706
about gold coins and wishes...

922
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,870
Computer: Finding the
leprechaun's gold is hard to do.

923
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:07,244
He sometimes keeps it in his hat,
or hides it in the loo.

924
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,338
That's a big help.

925
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:11,477
If you destroy his gold,
you destroy the leprechaun,

926
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,420
but mortals can never
resist the power of gold.

927
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,388
To them, being rich
is more important...

928
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,323
than doing
what needs to be done.

929
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,394
No way!

930
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,588
We find that gold,
we're getting rid of it!

931
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,495
Oh, no!
How can you say that, darling?

932
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,692
What?

933
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,792
I didn't say that.
Did I?

934
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:29,626
Oh!

935
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,673
What's wrong?

936
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,537
- Get it out of sight!
- What is it?

937
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,734
Get it out!

938
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,574
Okay.
Is that better?

939
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,147
Yeah.

940
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,011
I'm okay, I...

941
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,108
I feel so weird...

942
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,710
Scott, I think we should
just get in your car

943
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,415
and get out of here.
While we still can.

944
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,151
I can't.

945
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,318
You need to see a doctor.

946
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,259
Not yet.

947
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,228
There's something here,

948
01:08:56,332 --> 01:09:00,393
something I need
or want very badly.

949
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:03,063
I don't know what it is.

950
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,037
Maybe you should go.

951
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,735
No way.
I'm not leaving you, Scott.

952
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,321
Wow.

953
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,323
Look at all this stuff.

954
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,823
Yeah, it's like
a junkyard in here.

955
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,930
Tammy: Spooky!

956
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,327
What exactly
are we looking for?

957
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,064
I'm not sure.

958
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,004
Some clue
as to what happened to me.

959
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,053
Wait here, darlin'.
I think I'm onto somethin'.

960
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,211
I can smell it!

961
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,115
Delicious!

962
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:42,604
Oh! Isn't it lovely?

963
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,832
A pot of gold for the taking.

964
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,555
- Scott, you found it!
- Aye, that I did!

965
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,782
We can destroy it.

966
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,255
Remember
what the computer said?

967
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,851
If we destroy the gold, we get rid
of the leprechaun once and for all.

968
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,122
Destroy it?

969
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,255
Yeah! We have to.

970
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,800
No, lass.
We need to study it.

971
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,631
We need to look at
what jingles and jangles.

972
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,832
For science, you know,
is the study of angles.

973
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,136
Scott!
What is happening?

974
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,733
Nothing.

975
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,210
Nothing, my beauty,
nothing at all.

976
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,644
I'm just being sensible.

977
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,340
No, you're not!

978
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,883
Don't take
a leprechaun's gold!

979
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,681
Not if you want to live
to be ripe and old.

980
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,585
- You're hurting me!
- Am I?

981
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,784
Wow!

982
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,361
What happened?

983
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,760
I don't know, but don't
let it happen again,

984
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:44,730
because you're scaring
me to death.

985
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,824
If anyone's
scared to death...

986
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,028
then let it be me
doing the scaring.

987
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,405
What...?

988
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,805
I don't like
what I'm seeing.

989
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,343
Two leprechauns
is one too many, lad.

990
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,705
Scott! The gold!
The gold! Make a wish!

991
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,112
Wish him dead!

992
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,480
All right, little monster!

993
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:07,487
I wish you were encased in cement
at the bottom of the ocean!

994
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,217
Oh, no, please!
Anything but that!

995
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,358
You silly little twit!

996
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,328
Have you forgotten
the charm?

997
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,423
A leprechaun's gold

998
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,434
can do him no harm!

999
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,137
Scott!

1000
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,571
Oh!

1001
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,870
So,
for pulling this trick,

1002
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,342
I'll chop off your dick!

1003
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,175
Leprechaun:
Oh, me little darling!

1004
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,516
Oh!

1005
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,593
- Come on!
- Nice pitch!

1006
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,595
I pitch for
the Vegas All Stars.

1007
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,755
Oh, me aching noggin!

1008
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,469
When I catch up with those two
I'll give them a good scragging.

1009
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,024
Oh!

1010
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,025
Oh, no, Scott!
Is it starting again?

1011
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,651
Yeah.

1012
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:20,990
My insides...

1013
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,223
I feel like
I'm being torn apart.

1014
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,163
Oh, no!

1015
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,202
Scott, we're going
to the hospital now!

1016
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,433
Get in!

1017
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,081
You can run, me boyo,
but you can't hide!

1018
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,489
Scott!

1019
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,389
- What happened?
- He bit me.

1020
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,257
At the casino.

1021
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,991
Miss! Miss!

1022
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,396
Jesus Christ!

1023
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,697
- Can we get some help here?
- What's the trouble here?

1024
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,303
What the hell is this?

1025
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,434
Get me a gurney.
Get this man into isolation, stat!

1026
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,307
Come on!

1027
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,476
- J ust wait here.
- No, I wanna be with him.

1028
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,782
Nobody's gonna be with him
until we know what the problem is.

1029
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,082
God!

1030
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,318
Man: Get out of the road!

1031
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,199
Oh!

1032
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:52,284
Doctor: Looks like some kind
of virulent fungus.

1033
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,979
I've never seen
anything like it.

1034
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,319
Hmm... must be metastasizing
down the right quadrant,

1035
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,325
moving into
the lower thoracic area.

1036
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,657
Let's get this man
on antibiotics right away!

1037
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,433
Hold him,
for God's sake!

1038
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,528
Take it easy, son.
We're here to help.

1039
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,222
Man: Give him a sedative,
damn it!

1040
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,497
Now listen to me!

1041
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,762
This may mean the difference
between living and dying.

1042
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,365
Do you have health insurance?

1043
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,340
Do you take Green Cross?

1044
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,041
Good God!

1045
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,446
Forktus glottis!

1046
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,759
What the hell
is taking them so long?

1047
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,729
Leprechaun: Tammy Larson,
please report to the morgue.

1048
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:44,799
Oh, no!

1049
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,926
Tammy Larson,
please report to the morgue.

1050
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,202
Doctor, look at this!

1051
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,342
- This is blood?
- What the hell is going on?

1052
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,247
Bring me
his encephalogram.

1053
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:08,954
Really?

1054
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,587
Where's his EKG?

1055
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:21,625
If this is some sort of joke,
I don't find it at all amusing.

1056
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,644
Well, maybe he doesn't
need health insurance.

1057
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:34,705
Wow! Should I order
a few more tests, doctor?

1058
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,748
Let's see, uh...

1059
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,150
He can afford an MRI, and
let's give him a couple more EKGs,

1060
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,417
- and he can use a spinal tap.
- Maybe a bone scan?

1061
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:45,254
Let's start with every test
beginning with the letter A,

1062
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,452
tomorrow the B's,

1063
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,153
- and Thursday...
- You play golf on Thursday.

1064
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,356
Well, this is an emergency.

1065
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,125
Hello?

1066
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,132
Hello?

1067
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,973
Is anybody here?

1068
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,776
Hello?

1069
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,184
Hello? Sir?

1070
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:17,090
Excuse me?

1071
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,919
Sir?

1072
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,096
Excuse me, sir...

1073
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,145
Oh, God! No!

1074
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,522
Let me go,
you son of a bitch!

1075
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:52,115
Now, that's no way to speak about
me mother, bless her greedy soul.

1076
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:11,574
Now, me boyos,
I'll be checking out!

1077
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,450
Take care
of the patient!

1078
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,518
Ah, an angel of mercy!

1079
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,184
N urse!
Take this patient!

1080
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,707
Now that's what I call
managed health care.

1081
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,948
What's that I smell?

1082
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,418
Would it be
me brother from hell?

1083
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:55,217
Right.

1084
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,258
Now that you're in place,
I'll slice up your face.

1085
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,351
Oh, no!
Scott!

1086
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,020
Scott, help me!
Please!

1087
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,492
Now don't be afraid,
lass.

1088
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,124
I'll only remove
the front part.

1089
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,862
No, please!

1090
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,835
I want me shilling!

1091
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:13,965
I don't have it.
I swear, I don't have it.

1092
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,506
What a pity.

1093
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,046
What? I don't suppose
you want that nose...

1094
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,742
There will be no charge
for removing it.

1095
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,580
No! No! No!

1096
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,214
Cut her nose and
I'll hack off your toes!

1097
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,688
Back off,
you renegade,

1098
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,323
before I make you
eat that blade!

1099
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,334
Power to power,

1100
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,267
you've much to learn,

1101
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,998
taller or shorter,

1102
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:46,835
I'll make you burn.

1103
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,936
Whoa!

1104
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,547
Now where's me shilling?

1105
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,480
Fazio's the one
with your shilling!

1106
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,348
It's him
you should be killing!

1107
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:00,679
Fazio's magic,

1108
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,450
pathetic and lame,

1109
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,252
will soon turn tragic

1110
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,190
and me shilling I'll claim!

1111
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,996
Leave him alone.
You've got what you want.

1112
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,300
No, me dear,
you shall not pass.

1113
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,466
I'll raise me boot
and kick your...

1114
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,009
Aaah!

1115
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,943
Put it away!

1116
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:40,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Burning Beauty!

1117
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:48,630
A new illusion
I have just developed!

1118
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,605
Now, for the first time
on any stage,

1119
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,574
our lovely volunteer
from the audience...

1120
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:59,272
trapped inside
a burning hell...

1121
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,250
Will she come out alive?

1122
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,721
Or medium well?

1123
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,026
Scott: He's going after
the shilling.

1124
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,658
Fazio has it.

1125
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:25,263
I've got to destroy him
to save meself.

1126
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,568
Is that possible?
Will that work?

1127
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,974
I feel it.

1128
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:32,239
I'm part of whatever he is.

1129
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,611
Well, maybe we won't
have to destroy him.

1130
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:38,311
If we can find the shilling,
we can wish you back to normal.

1131
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,217
Listen to me.

1132
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:42,153
I don't want you
going in with me.

1133
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,953
When we get to the casino,
drop me off.

1134
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,961
I want you to get out of there.
Go someplace safe.

1135
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,155
No!

1136
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,323
We started
this together.

1137
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,231
We're gonna
finish it that way.

1138
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,007
And now,
a word of warning.

1139
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:04,044
If any of you in the audience
are the least bit squeamish,

1140
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:07,444
I suggest
you leave the theatre.

1141
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:11,918
Fazio's illusions
are very, very...

1142
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,146
real!

1143
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,701
- Who the hell are you?
- No reason for alarm.

1144
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:40,280
Give me the coin
and you'll come to no harm.

1145
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,414
It'd be a cold day in hell
before I give up this coin,

1146
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,818
so take a hike
before I call security?

1147
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,253
You're making a mistake.

1148
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,382
As a magician,
you're a pathetic fake.

1149
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,569
Scott, hang on!
We're almost there!

1150
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:02,931
Hang on!

1151
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,148
Get me out of this thing.
Get me out!

1152
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,049
A pleasure it'll be
to get you out, and set you free...

1153
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,379
with this!

1154
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,622
With Fazio the Great

1155
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,128
we had a good laugh.

1156
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,857
Shall I start up this saw

1157
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,330
and cut him in half?

1158
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:33,696
Yeah or nay?

1159
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,633
Audience: Yes, yes, yes!

1160
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:37,805
No!

1161
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,398
No, no!

1162
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,243
My audience, no!
No, you love me!

1163
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,505
You love me, no!

1164
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:48,877
I can't hear you!

1165
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,363
Oh, no!

1166
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,433
Now, me boyo,

1167
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,398
where's me shilling?

1168
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:08,867
You're bluffing!

1169
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,995
There's a whole room
full of witnesses.

1170
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,733
Oh, too bad!

1171
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,604
Forcing me
to split in two

1172
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,768
a nice young lad
such as you.

1173
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,374
I wish I was in
Caesar's Palace right now!

1174
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,577
No, lad.
You've had your wish.

1175
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,711
Now I'll have mine.

1176
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:32,653
Aahh!

1177
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,390
This way!

1178
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,650
Caesar's Palace...

1179
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,637
Listen to me, everybody!
This man's a maniac.

1180
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:31,207
For your own safety,
get out of the room!

1181
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,813
Come on, everybody out,
hurry!

1182
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,251
Aaah!

1183
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,082
H urry, hurry!

1184
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:03,514
Oh, God!

1185
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,142
Scott!
The shilling!

1186
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,584
I wish Scott was...

1187
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,255
No wish for you,
darling.

1188
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,418
Now I'll peel you
like a grape.

1189
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,018
Hold it!

1190
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,356
Now wait, lad.

1191
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,331
What are you doing?
We're brothers.

1192
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,335
I don't think so.

1193
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,771
Scott...

1194
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:34,541
come over to the green side.
I'll make you rich.

1195
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,516
There it is,

1196
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,179
yours for the taking.

1197
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,881
You'll share nothing!

1198
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,891
I know how you are,
you're only bluffing.

1199
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,654
Trust me, lad,

1200
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,661
one devilish creature
to another.

1201
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,832
Ah! That's me boy.

1202
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,404
We're alike,
me and you.

1203
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,166
Evil as hell,
all the way through.

1204
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:01,937
No, Scott!

1205
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,472
He's not like you!

1206
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,549
Don't listen to him.

1207
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:12,848
She's right!

1208
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,717
I'm not like you.

1209
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,551
I'll never be like you!

1210
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:19,149
Put it down, lad,
you can't hurt me.

1211
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,558
You should know that by now.

1212
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:23,494
Think of the gold, Scott,

1213
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,429
the power it can give you.

1214
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:27,524
The gold, Scott.

1215
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,762
His power lies in the gold.

1216
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:32,237
We'll share it, I promise.

1217
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,205
Share this, pal!

1218
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,277
Aaargh!

1219
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:38,470
No, me gold!

1220
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:39,705
Aaargh!

1221
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,302
Scott... Scott!

1222
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:19,578
Oh, my God!
You're back!

1223
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,587
You're normal again.

1224
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,355
Oh, I can't believe it!

1225
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:48,213
I can't wait to get out of here
and leave this nightmare behind.

1226
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:51,080
Well, we won't be
leaving it all behind.

1227
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:52,675
What do you mean?

1228
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:54,846
I found this.

1229
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,856
What do you think?

1230
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:59,426
We can have just about
anything we want.

1231
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,430
It's your call.

1232
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,872
I don't know...

1233
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:14,441
I think I have
everything I want.

1234
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,670
You know something,
sweetheart?

1235
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:22,545
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
