185
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,506
He thinks I just want his money.

186
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,441
I'm just tryin' to make sure that we're good.

187
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,043
So, that he can leave that life alone

188
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,578
and go legit.

189
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,079
But he thinks investin' in me,

190
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,849
his woman, is a waste of time and money.

191
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,884
Y'all, I am not tryin' to get that phone call

192
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,687
in the middle of the night, sayin' that he is dead.

193
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,155
- Kima, you act like

00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,790

195
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,792
- No, I do, but not like that.

196
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,727
By the time I'm done payin' rent,

cell phone bill, water, electric.

198

00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,243
Now the next time you pull a gun out on me, money

732
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,245
you better kill me bitch.

733
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,748
Get the fuck out of here, man.

734
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,421
- Yo Pam?

735
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,390
- What up?

736
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,993
- I'm all in.

737
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,861
- Yo know, Keisha,

738
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,096

739
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,164
that weak ass nigga must have smacked

740
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,000
some sense in you ass.

741
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,204
- Let's go.

742
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,079
(phone ringing)

743
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,018
- Hello?

744
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,719
- [James] What up, dog?

745
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,121
- James?

746
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,288
Are you out?

747
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,790
- [James] Hell naw.

748
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,925
And they tryin' to keep me here on some bull shit.

749
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,160
- Well, I'm still tryin'

750
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,328
to get the money up to come bail you out.

751
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,295
- [James] Cool.

752
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,130
Cool.

753
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,164
But right now,

754
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,332
I need you to come over to

755
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,167
Wayne County Jail, around one.

756
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,168
Can you do that for me, baby?

757
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,003
- Okay, I'll be there.

758
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,139
- [James] They tryin' to keep a nigga.

759
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,807
You know I love you.

760
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,376
- Love you too, bye.

761
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,312
(suspenseful music)

762
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,522
- (clears throat)

763
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,191
You have friends in high places.

764
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,796
- I'm Mr. Mason, I'm your lawyer.

765
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,131
I will be representing' you.

766
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,568
Seems these gentlemen have vested interest

767
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,104
in you stayin' out of jail.

768
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,373
- Why didn't they post bail?

769
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,207
- Couldn't.

770
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,209
Judge wouldn't allow it.

771
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,680
He's convinced you are a flight risk.

772
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,716
I hate these court appointed attorneys

773
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,386
that don't communicate Mr. Edison,

774
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,388
but that's why I'm here.

775
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,659
To make sure you completely understand

776
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,462
everything that's goin' on.

777
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,296
- Ahh.

778
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,498
Trust me.

779
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,569
- Baby, sit down.

780
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,505
This is my lawyer.

781
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,111
- May I speak freely, in front of her?

782
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,846
- Yeah, that's my girl.

783
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,115
But look, I don't know how much time I got

784
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,251
and I don't know what they tryin' to do to me.

785
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,120
But I need you to handle some shit

786
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,454
for me in the streets.

787
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,388
- You're right.

788
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,623
You don't have much time,

789
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,692
they only hired me on a small retainer.

790
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,728
But I will extend as long as possible.

791
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,196
- Then just do your job.

792
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,799
I'll make sure you get some money.

793
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,801
Can I talk to her alone?

794
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,769
- Absolutely.

795
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,606
Small retainer.

796
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,280
- Look, I got some work

797
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,250
in the front closet in the gym bag.

798
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,718
I need you to get that,

799
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,586
meet somebody, they gonna give you cash for it.

800
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,522
- What are you talkin' about, work?

801
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,356
As in drugs?

802
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,624
- Hell yeah,

803
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,126
what the fuck do you think I mean, Kima?

804
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,661
Look, I need this.

805
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,330
And you, baby, you're the only person I trust.

806
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,132
- James, I don't... I'm not a drug dealer.

807
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,966
I do hair.

808
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,168
- I know.

809
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,836
But that hair shit aint bringin' in no cash.

810
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,105
Plus, how the fuck do you think I'm gonna invest

811
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,940
in you if I'm in here?

812
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,842
- Ooh.

813
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,378
- Kima.

814
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,245
- What?

815
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,580
- Get shit done.

816
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,952

Yo, who drugs are these?

Are these yours?

837
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,246
- These are Jame's drugs.

838
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,282
He had this shit hidden in the house.

839
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,417
- Naw, fuck that, these your drugs.

840
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,652
James is in jail.

841
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,188
- What are you gonna do with all this?

842
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,923
- He wants me to sell this shit.

843
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:32,757
I'm not a drug dealer.

844
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,992
- Bitch, I am.

845
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,194
Kima, go get me some baking soda.

846
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,695
We gonna cut this.

847
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,699
See how this is all played out?

848
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,702
All I gotta do is call my connect.

849
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,738
We can double it.

850
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,173
Just gotta find out how strong it is,

851
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,975
so I know how much to cut.

852
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,478
Oh yeah, baby, what's wrong?

853
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,947
- I don't know, this don't feel right.

854
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,781
(toilet flushing)

855
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:57,715

00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,651
(water running)

858
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,387
- No, that was good weed.

859
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,321
- I hate drugs.

860
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,857
This shit took my mama.

861
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,294
And she had to shoot it in my house, Pam.

862
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,967
- Kima, you can't cry about it.

863
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,470
Some shit ya have to change.

864
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,981
- So what's the plan.

865
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,954
- You trust me?

866
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,690
- I'm not sure about this.

867
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,292
- Do you think I'm havin' you do some crazy shit?

868
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,027
- Abso-fuckin-lutely.

869
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,229
- Come on,

870
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,031
let's just get this shit over with, please.

871
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,466
- Okay, 'cause I can't breathe.

872
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,935
- Come on, I can't see.

873
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,905
(suspenseful music)

874
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,715
- Please don't kill me.

875
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,316
- Nobody gonna kill yo ass.

876
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,918
Where the money at?

877
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,754
- Oh, okay, it's a robbery.

878
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,155
Just give me a second.

879
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,058
(whispering) You can meet me in the bedroom.

880
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,061
- What if he's gettin' a gun?

881
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:17,895
- Fuck.

882
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,202
- Okay, I got one arm,

883
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,870
I just need help with the other side.

884
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,172
- Where's the money?

885
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,240
- Okay, don't kill me.

886
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,475
I don't have any cash on me.

887
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,577
But my debit card is in the back right pocket,

888
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,879
and the number is 69.

889
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,482
- Stop playin' with me.

890
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,384
- Pam, is that you, baby?

891
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,218
(gun clunking)

892
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,052
- No.

893
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,222
- Wait, wait, what's today?

894
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,458
I thought our appointment was tomorrow?

895
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,962
- Appointment?

896
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,431
- Keisha, put your mask back on.

897
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,799
- Girl, he already knows Pam.

898
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,735
- He didn't, he was guessin'.

899
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,771
- Ooh. Ooh, ooh.

900
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,539
All three of you are fine as hell.

901
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,608
- Shut the fuck up, Paul.

902
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,680
- So, since we already here.

903
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,983
Where's the money?

904
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,518
- You can speak, Paul.

905
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,487
- Okay, See I knew that was you.

906
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,722
I knew that was you, Pam, baby.

907
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,290
'Cause you the only one,

908
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,224
who had a Hennessy smell,

909
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,692
mixed up, that's your scent,

910
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,628
but, I didn't know you was bringing friends.

911
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,229
And you are all fine as hell.

912
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,497
You especially.

913
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,699
Your ass is rocked like a table with three legs.

914
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,867
(gun clunking)

915
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,739
- I told you, stop objectifying your robbers.

916
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,477
- I'm sorry, Mistress.

917
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,613
- Pam.

918
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,385
- Now, what was you sayin' about my ass?

919
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,786
- You look like, when the baby

920
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,456
had a diaper overflowing.

921
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,723
- Really?

922
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,958

923
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,526
- Okay, so you like when I pose like this?

924
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,994
- Yeah, like that.

925
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,130
- Pam, you have us in here, robbin' your client?

926
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,164
- We need the practice.

927
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:00,932
- What?

928
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,066
What practice?

929
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,301
This is our life.

930
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,635
- We're all gonna look like backs of robberies.

931
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,004
This let's us know what we need to do.

932
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,272
And look at him.

933
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,275
His ass is lovin' this shit anyway.

934
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,010
- Go ahead and grab my gag out the third drawer.

935
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,845
- You have a gag?

936
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,079
Okay.

937
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,013
- Finish tyin' me up and we can start

938
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,048

939
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:17,982

940
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,784

941
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,786
- Keisha, get over here.

942
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,055

943
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,323
- Your birthday.

944
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,858
Next week, we still doin' the pineapple,

00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,926
with the oil and the honey, right?

946
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,161
- I don't know, Paul.

947
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,029
I just started a new business venture.

948
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,700
- (whining) I thought this.

949
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,540
- I'm really appreciate everything you said.

950
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,608
- No problem.

951
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,442
Take cares.

952
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,576
If you wanna come back,

953
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,912
Wednesday, I'm open, now.

954
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,779
It's free.

955
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,814
- (laughing) Oh Paul.

956
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,648
- Pam.

957
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,217
- Welcome ladies.

958
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,385
How y'all doin'?

959
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,219

00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,622
- How can I help, y'all, today?

962
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,657
- Well, um, We lookin' for some phones

964
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,261

00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,491
- But I am gonna need a discount.

979
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,325
Or, I'm gonna kill your ass.

980
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,660

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,494

(gun shooting)

985
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,702
- [TV Voice 2] What the fuck, I don't have it.

986
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,270
- See, You gotta do some research.

987
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,705
- All we doin' is

988
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,211
actin' like we givin' these boys some play.

989
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,346
I aint gotta research that.

990
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,381
- What if they act up?

991
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,785
You gotta be able to lay them down.

992
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,288
- Pam, why you always tryin' to kill somebody?

993
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,357

you gotta make sure the safety is on.

999
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,571
- Why would I hit a dude in the head,

1000
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,407
when I can just shoot him instead.

1001
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,811

00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,213
Or like Craig, when he stole all those boxes in his day off.

1271
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,984
- Or like Tommy Bunk when he robbed the club?

1272
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,788
- Like we didn't get shit, but $122.

1273
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:12,623
- What?

1274
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,629
- Come on, girl, we got to do better.

1275
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,299
This aint even enough to get a tattoo.

1276
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,468
We gotta be on it y'all.

1277
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,738
If we gonna do it, let's do it.

1278
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,107
Need to be able to tell these broke,

1279
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,944

1280
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,314
And you thought

00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,019
- (laughing) Hell yeah.

1283
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,021

1284
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:44,955
I be on that bus like.

1285
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,057
- You got the lip quiver.

1286
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:47,958
- Mmmm-hmmm

1287
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,662
- 'Cause you wanted to rob a nigga for $122.

1288
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,165
- Oh Shoot, maybe now I can get my tattoo.

1289
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,870
- I don't have the kind of problems y'all got.

1290
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,039
- I got money, I live life,

1291
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,208
honestly, it's kinda fun.

1292
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,712
- Sean aint a problem?

1293
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,919
Where you gettin' this tattoo at?

1294
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,020
- On my hand.

1295
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,856
- Your hand?

1296
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:23,460
Why you aint gettin' it on your thigh?

1297
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,763
You got some sexy in those thighs.

1298
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,499
- Bitch, let me find out you been checkin' me out.

1299
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,401
- No, no, not like that.

1300
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,669
I'm just sayin'

1301
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,939
everything about you is sexy.

1302
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:41,511
Sean is a ho ass nigga for treatin' you like that.

1303
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,946
- Like what, Pam?

1304
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,516
- Like disrespectin' you.

1305
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,786
Puttin' his hands on you.

1306
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,455
That shit aint cool.

1307
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,459
- Trust me, I know more than anybody

1308
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,194
that Sean has a lot of growin' up to do.

1309
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,128
And honestly, I don't know

1310
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,364
why I put up with his shit.

1311
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,868
But I love him.

1312
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,904
- You love him?

1313
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,740
What you love, Keisha?

1314
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,643
The way he degrades you?

1315
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,612
The way he put his hands on you,

1316
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,481
in front of your son?

1317
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,584
- He just be goin' through some shit.

1318
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,886
- That nigga on some shit.

1319
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,355
He need to chill with that.

1320
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,189
For real.

1321
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,559
- How 'bout that one?

1322
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,961
- That whack, get that one.

1323
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,429
- Stop it.

1324
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,531
I aint gettin' no Grim Reaper on my fuckin' hand.

1325
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,732
- Might as well.

1326
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:36,566
- Stupid.

1327
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,670
- Just, a little less veracity,

1328
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,906
and we'll get through this.

1329
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:52,649
- So you still aint do what I asked you to?

1330
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,884
- Not yet.

1331
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,987
- What the fuck you mean, "Not yet"?

1332
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,989
- You really don't want to do that.

1333
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,324
- [Cop] Hey, is everything all right in there?

1334
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,694
- Yeah, yes, everything is fine, thank you.

1335
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:05,929
Please, please.

1336
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,567
- Look bitch, I need you.

1337
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,370
If you don't get this work to my man,

1338
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,704
my shit is done.

1339
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,274
A little less veracity

1340
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,410
and we'll get through this, I promise.

1341
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,244
Right?

1342
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,078
- Yeah.

1343
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,280
- All right.

1344
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,249
So, at least drop off or help with that.

1345
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,954
I'm sorry, I know I scared you,

1346
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:31,788
I'm sorry.

1347
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:32,689
I love you.

1348
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,461
Help me with this, all right?

1349
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,231
And I promise, we'll get you that salon you want.

1350
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:46,069
Yeah, and we'll talk about this baby situation, too.

1351
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,804
I know you want that.

1352
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,643
- New tattoo, who it is?

1353
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,444
Ha-ha, me.

1354
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,047
You fine girl, thank you.

1355
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,282
(laughing)

1356
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,255
- I hate that nigga.

1357
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,924
- Why you hate that man so much?

1358
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,926
- I don't know.

1359
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,295
- Because he gettin' money?

1360
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,864
- Naw, that aint it.

1361
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,433
I don't hate on nobody gettin' bread.

1362
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,334
- Then why?

1363
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,271
- Shit, maybe his name is Combs

1364
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,873
and he aint got no hair.

1365
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,307
Hell, I don't know.

1366
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,544
- (laughs) You a trip.

1367
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:30,780
Hey, girl.

1368
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,681
- Hey guys.

1369
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,821
We need to hit another lick.

1370
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,890
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

1371
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,026
- You know that dope I flushed down the toilet?

1372
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,262
I gotta get the money back, for it.

1373
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,496
- What?

1374
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,231
- I mean if I can get the money back,

1375
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,165
then James can get out of jail

1376
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,401
and everything will be fine.

1377
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:53,637
What?

1378
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,139
- Is you done or is you finished?

1379
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,443
James don't care nothing about you.

1380
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,512
He just tryin' to get out.

1381
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,980
- Yeah, K. He's tryin' to use you.

1382
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,018
He wasn't tryin' to help you when he wasn't in jail.

1383
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,587
- Well, maybe he's had time to think about it.

1384
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,256
- He in the County, not the pen.

1385
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,393
- So y'all not down?

1386
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,562
- For you, not that nigga.

1387
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,765
- Thank you.

1388
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,434
(phone dinging)

1389
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,104
It's Faith, we got a hit.

1390
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,275
- Please, God.

1391
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,711
Please, please, let this man have some money.

1392
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,446
You can do it, you can do it.

1393
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,614
- Are you crazy?

1394
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,249
You are really prayin' to the lord,

1395
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,417
for this nigga to have some money

1396
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,751
so that we can rob him?

1397
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,587
- Girl, maybe he can help.

1398
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,355
He can do all things.

1399
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,489
- You better stop.

1400
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,224
(laughing)

1401
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,827
- Hey, scheme work take teamwork.

1402
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,162
We will win it.

1403
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,131
♪ Why you want to really make me feel this way. ♪

1404
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,002
♪ I know your feeling lonely tonight. ♪

1405
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,171
(laughing)

1406
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,882
- That's the guy over there.

1407
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,518
- Oh, he's cute.

1408
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:19,956
I'll be back.

1409
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,259
(sexy music)

1410
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,039
- (whispers) Thank you.

1411
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,443
- What's goin' on with you?

1412
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,112
Come over here.

1413
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,515
Why don't you come talk to me for a moment.

1414
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,349
- Sure.

1415
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:52,288
I don't know, it could be dangerous.

1416
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,124
You aint no killer, are you?

1417
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,326
- Maybe, it depends

1418
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,162
on if you fuckin' with my money.

1419
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,230
- Huh?

1420
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,298
- You fuckin' with my money?

1421
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,133
- No.

1422
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,503
- Then that's good.

1423
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,172
So, what's with your home girls?

1424
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,343
- Well, I already know them.

1425
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,415
I'm tryin' to get to know you.

1426
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,883
- Um-huh.

1427
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,820
- Besides, they would know if I didn't feel safe.

1428
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,922
- Yeah, that's what's up.

1429
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,024
- Maybe you feel safe to,

1430
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:33,963
because, to be honest, this club is super boring.

1431
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:38,101
And I'm hopin', me and you can leave together.

1432
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:38,935
Like now?

1433
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,938
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1434
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,940
We can make that happen.

1435
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,419
(suspenseful music)

1436
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,022
- I really appreciate you takin' me with you.

1437
00:55:59,022 --> 00:55:59,956
- Oh, okay.

1438
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,958
Yeah so where you tryin' to go..

1439
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,060
- Keisha girl, I'm drunk,

1440
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,965
take me home, I can't drive.

1441
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,067
- Yo, um,

1442
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,702
Aint you, James girl?

1443
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,536
Kima?

1444
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,473
- Yeah, why?

1445
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,408
- Okay, is he all right?

1446
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,143
I heard he got hit the other day.

1447
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,245
- You know what, my girl is drunk.

1448
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,346
Let me get her home, okay?

1449
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,614
- Okay.

1450
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,116
Hey, hey, maybe we can go get a room,

1451
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,050
or somethin'

1452
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,852
- Yeah, yeah sure.

1453
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,354
(funky music)

1454
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,105
(man snoring)

1455
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,171
- You can't hit nigga in the head, while he asleep.

1456
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,806
You know what they say about,

1457
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,307
"don't go to sleep with concussions".

1458
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:25,775
We aint tryin' to kill him.

1459
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,110
- So what am I supposed to do?

1460
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,378
Wait til he wake up

1461
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:32,048
and politely ask him, "Can we rob you?"

1462
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:32,882
- Let me think.

1463
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,551
Let me think.

1464
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,419
- She has the brains in our operation.

1465
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,988
- How the fuck is she the brains of the operation,

1466
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,491
when we in the hall havin' a meetin'

1467
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,525
- I thought it was evident.

1468
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,359
She the brains.

1469
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,194
You are the muscle.

1470
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,728
And I'm the looks.

1471
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,431
- I can be the looks too, depending on who lookin'.

1472
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,966
- Okay, look, I got it.

1473
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
Let's go.

1474
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,343
(woman screaming)

1475
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,987
(gun firing)

1476
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,723
(woman coughing)

1477
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,095
- You all right?

1478
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:19,929
- Oh.

1479
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,000
- He's still breathing.

1480
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,402
- Oh shit.

1481
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,470
- Is he dead?

1482
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,006
- I don't know.

1483
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,674
He's still breathing.

1484
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,444
- Fuck that nigga, get some shit.

1485
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:37,747
- Come on.

1486
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,218
(light switch clicking)

1487
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,526
- Man. This nigga have a whole ass family.

1488
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:52,028
I can't stand men.

1489
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:58,468
This nigga got a whole ass family.

1490
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,803
- We almost killed him,

1491
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,805
so I think this is even.

1492
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:15,351
- This is nice.

1493
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,122
- Put that back, we aint at the mall.

1494
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,057
- No this is expensive.

1495
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,792
Plus I've been wantin' one.

1496
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,327
- Put the purse back.

1497
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,828
- I'm takin' this.

1498
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,770
- Come on, let's go.

1499
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:35,638
Let's go.

1500
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,645
(dramatic music)

1501
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:47,951
Come on.

1502
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,290
- Oh my God.

1503
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,092
Thanks for gettin' that Gorilla Glue out my hair, girl.

1504
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,327
That's crazy.

1505
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,195
I don't know why I did that.

1506
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:03,366
Anyway, so what did you get into last night, Kima?

1507
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,170
Kima, I asked you what you got into last night.

1508
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,205
- Mindin' my own business.

1509
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,040
- Well damn, excuse me.

1510
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,176
Sorry for askin'.

1511
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,344
- My bad, Miya.

1512
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,012
You know, she had a bad night,

1513
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,947
her man in jail, he still aint shit,

1514
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,615
but she good though.

1515
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:34,263
- What the fuck is goin' on with you?

1516
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,265
- I'm still shook up from last night.

1517
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,434
I cannot believe we got away with that.

1518
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,003
Pam, he could have killed us.

1519
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,038
I think we killed him.

1520
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:42,839
- I know.

1521
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,042
What the fuck is you doin'?

1522
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:46,876
- What?

1523
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:47,677
This?

1524
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,414
Just a little somethin' I picked up.

1525
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,816
- So you've been walkin' around with a $25,000 purse

1526
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,486
jumpin' out of 2013 Camry and drawin' attention?

1527
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,888
- They gonna say it was photoshopped anyway.

1528
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,390
- Keisha, stop playin'

1529
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,591
Get rid of the purse.

1530
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,159
- No, listen, I earned this.

1531
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,961
Thinkin' about gettin' you one too.

1532
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,195
What you waitin' on.

1533
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,631
- I have to agree, what are we waiting on?

1534
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,166
That was a $100,000 lick.

1535
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,300
Divided three ways?

1536
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,702
We deserve it.

1537
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,971
- We risked our lives, three times.

1538
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,773
- Naw, the first one don't count.

1539
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,307
No, it does count.

1540
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,276
And it would have been over $120.

1541
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,677
The other was $33,000.

1542
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,513
And when Sean see that purse,

1543
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,614
He gonna kill us all.

1544
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,182
We got to think smarter.

1545
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,017
- Look, you may be the brains,

1546
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,453
but you aint gotta think for me.

1547
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:33,389
I'm goin' to the mall, you wanna come?

1548
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,793
- No, you's a petty bitch, you know it?

1549
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,628
- Girl, the only reason you doin' this,

1550
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,563
is to bail some bum ass dude out of jail,

1551
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:44,000
and I don't tell you to throw away, your cut.

1552
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,568
- This comin' from a ho,

1553
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:46,936
who's nigga's a dope fiend.

1554
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,072
- Oh whoa, whoa, whoa.

1555
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,773
Y'all, damn, chill out.

1556
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,741
- Chill out?

1557
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,909
That's your girl, over there,

1558
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,876
proppin' up weak shit.

1559
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,111
- Hold up.

1560
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,646
You aint gotta put me on no other bitch.

1561
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:57,947
- Look, here, you been on some bull shit all day.

1562
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:58,915
- Me?

1563
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,550
Oh, so you taken up for Keisha?

1564
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,518
So what, y'all a couple?

1565
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,821
So what, y'all fuckin' now?

1566
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,556
Yeah, fuck this shit.

1567
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,365
- Keisha,

1568
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:17,200
- Hell no.

1569
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,204
(tense music)

1570
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,048
(energetic rock music)

1571
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,884
- Y'all find what you lookin' for?

1572
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,871
- So again, you didn't do what I asked you to do.

1573
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,039
I told you, I needed that money.

1574
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,176
It's niggas in here, that's probably goin' where I am goin'

1575
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,078
And you out here bull shittin'.

1576
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,312
- Don't worry.

1577
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,014
- What you mean, don't worry?

1578
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,883
Didn't I just tell you,

1579
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,085
there are niggas in here that I owe.

1580
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,521
- Listen, I got the money.

1581
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,455
- What?

1582
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,656
- I got $33,000, in cash.

1583
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,490
- What?

1584
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,263
- Yeah, I got $33,000, in cash,

1585
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,064
on me, right now.

1586
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,766
And I got realtor's business card

1587
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,569
so he can find the building for the salon.

1588
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1589
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,206
Listen, we worry about the salon, later.

1590
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,375
Where's the money?

1591
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,843
- It's in my purse.

1592
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:34,677
Where do I go to pay your bail,

1593
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:35,611
and when do you get out?

1594
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,213
- Hold on a second.

1595
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:39,749
There are procedures that we have to go through,

1596
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,950
before we do that.

1597
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,785
Listen, go home,

1598
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,287
and we will give you a call.

1599
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,988
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1600
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,390
Baby, go home.

1601
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,758
And we'll get the paperwork together, today.

1602
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,227
Then we'll have it ready for you tomorrow.

1603
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,195
- Okay.

1604
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,262
- I love you.

1605
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,733
- Shit.

1606
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,203
(tense music)

1607
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,437
- Listen, James.

1608
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,573
You know, we really can't believe anything

1609
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,142
she is sayin' right now, right?

1610
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,544
- What you mean?

1611
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:09,745
- Do you really think she

1612
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,847
has $33,000 in her purse?

1613
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,686
She couldn't even sell your drugs for you,

1614
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,556
where's she gonna get that kind of money?

1615
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,758
Get your head back in the game.

1616
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,027
She just tryin' to see what in it for her.

1617
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,998
There is no way, she has $33,000 in her purse.

1618
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,967
Where would she get that kind of money?

1619
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,235
There's no way,

1620
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,105
she has that kind of money in her purse.

1621
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,275
James, get your head back in the game.

1622
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,380
- Damn, you right.

1623
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,683
We need a plan B.

1624
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,621
I got a half a mil,

1625
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,623
stashed at my woman's house.

1626
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,026
- You have a half million at Kima's home?

1627
01:04:58,861 --> 01:04:59,962
- Excuse you.

1628
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,230
- Excuse you.

1629
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,900
- No, I said my woman's house, not my bitch.

1630
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,106
- Here.

1631
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,126

1632
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,962
- You okay?

1633
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,164

1634
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:37,066
- Who's phone is this?

1635
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,167
(phone ringing)

1636
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,335
- That's mine.

1637
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,945
- Baby, when are they gonna let you out?

1638
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:51,347
- I need you home.

1639
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,516
Your son misses you.

1640
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,619
Your side of the bed is startin' to get cold.

1641
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,553
- I know.

1642
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,522
Look, I got one of my young boys

1643
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,923

1644
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,191
I'll be home soon.

1645
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,726
- Just hurry up, baby.

1646
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,729
We gonna miss the grand opening for our salon.

1647
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,564
You put too much money into that buildin',

1648
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,534
for you not to be home, enjoyin' your investment.

1649
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:12,368
- I know.

1650
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,202
True.

1651
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,004
- I love you.

1652
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,006
- I love you, too, babe.

1653
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,943
(tense music)

1654
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,400
- So about that half mil I told you about,

1655
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,801
It's in my son's closet.

1656
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,703
I need you to get it for me.

1657
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:50,606
You the only person I trust, right now.

1658
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:54,176
- And how am I supposed to come about this?

1659
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,911
- What you mean?

1660
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,749
- How am I supposed to get my hands on the money?

1661
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:00,883
- Oh, listen,

1662
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,118
Go over to the crib.

1663
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,352
Tell her you need her to fill out

1664
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,688
some paperwork or something like that.

1665
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,790
Then say, you gotta use the bathroom.

1666
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,024
Shit, I mean.

1667
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:11,026
Go in his room, go in his closet, grab it,

1668
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:12,862
then dip out.

1669
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,463
- Okay, well first,

1670
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,602
I need you to sign this paperwork.

1671
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:23,606
Sign that.

1672
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,474
- What is this?

1673
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,009
- It's an agreement,

1674
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:31,480
that says you and I keep our conversations confidential.

1675
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,549
- All right.

1676
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,459
(suspenseful music)

1677
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,506
- Slow your roll baby girl.

1678
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,042
I know what you want.

1679
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,378
- I don't believe you.

1680
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,213
- Here, You want this.

1681
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,349
Now, I know its hard.

I know you really worked yourself into some shit.

1683
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,555
Okay?

1684
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,423
But we'll work it out.

1685
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,091
Just come with me this way

1686
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,093

01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,537

01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:29,605
- So?

1689
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,540
We don't need her.

1690
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,609
Plus you know she gonna act

1691
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,378
like she don't know us when James get out.

1692
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,147
- That's not the point, Keisha

1693
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,715
That's Kima, our special K,

1694
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,318

1695

01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,024
- How's way?

1700
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,794
- We wasn't there to steal no fuckin' purses.

1701
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,329
We were there to get the money.

1702

We coulda went to the mall and stole a fuckin' purse.

This is a Hermes, snakeskin, Birkin Bag,

1705
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,004
easily over $100,000.

1706
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,973
- A hundred thousand dollars?

1707
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,808

1712
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,652
No, it's priceless.

01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,853

I know you were only tryin' look out for me.

01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,569
I shoulda never let some purse get between us,

01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,504
even if it's worth $100,000.

1807

- A hundred thousand dollars?

1808
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,608
That's how much that purse was worth?

1809
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,377

Are we still good?

2163
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,506
- Yeah, we still on.

2164
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,775
I'm on my way to the crib, now to grab Keisha.

2165
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:48,609
Come on.

2166
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,144
- Okay.

2167
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:52,079
(hinges creaking)

2168
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,881
- You sittin' there spendin' my money

2169
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,450
on this girly shit?

2170
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:58,886
If you know somebody,

2171
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:00,922
who wanna see your ass alive again.

2172
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,924
I suggest you give them a call,

2173
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,526
and tell them to bring my shit.

2174
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:10,464
(trunk shutting)

2175
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,268
- (gasps) Pam.

2176
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:18,840
- He took her K.

2177
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,142
- Oh my god.

2178
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:25,112
Okay, wait, okay calm down.

2179
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:27,348
Maybe she just went to the store.

2180
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:28,816
- You think she trashed this place

2181
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,085
to go to the fuckin' store?

2182
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,321
They took her.

2183
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,789
- Who is they?

2184
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,591
- Comb. Fuck.

2185
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:39,961
- Come on, we gotta go find her, get up.

2186
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:40,795
Come on.

2187
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,063
We'll find her.

2188
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:46,601
Wait a minute, stop.

2189
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:47,435
Stop.

2190
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:48,269
Stop.

2191
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:49,103
Stop.

2192
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:50,438
- What?

2193
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:51,873
Hold up.

2194
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,608
(phone dialing)

2195
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,711
(phone ringing)

2196
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,279
- [Woman On phone] Hello?

2197
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,380
- Hey yo.

2198
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,115
I know who robbed you.

2199
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,418
Ya, it was my ex boyfriend.

2200
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:06,521
And he gave me a very expensive purse

2201
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,955
from the robbery.

2202
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,425
How can you trust me?

2203
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:13,127
'Cause he cheated on me.

2204
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:15,196
Look, I know where the nigga's at,

2205
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,031
I'm about to text you.

2206
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,903
(suspenseful music)

2207
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,910
(car doors slamming)

2208
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:31,412
- You look pretty cute with that purse, nigga.

2209
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:33,114
- Nigga, did you bring my money

2210
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:35,349

2211
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:37,118
- Money and dope?

2212
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,786
- I was gonna ask you the same shit.

2213
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:41,355
- The plan was for you to bring my shit, nigga.

2214
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:44,025
- No, the plan was for me to come get my shit

2215
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,627
and kill you and them bitches.

2216
01:32:46,627 --> 01:32:49,297
(guns clicking)

2217
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:59,307
- Nigga did you bring my money

2218
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:01,809

2219
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:03,444
(trunk clicking)

2220
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,947
(gun firing)

2221
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:13,788
- Pam.

2222
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:14,622
- No, no, no.

2223
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,456
She's okay.

2224
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:16,290
She's fine.

2225
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,326
Keisha come on.

2226
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:19,160
Pam, she knows what she's doin'.

2227
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:19,994
Come on.

2228
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,662
She wants you to go.

2229
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,266
(guns firing)

2230
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,269
(suspenseful music)

2231
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:54,829
- I knew you would fuck me one way or another.

2232
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:57,264
(gun firing)

2233
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:01,402
(body thudding)

2234
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:07,942
- Hey.

2235
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:11,078
We still got a job to do.

2236
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:11,946
- What?

2237
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:13,114
Aint you hurt?

2238
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:17,118
- Yeah, but I'd be more hurt

2239
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,286
if I took that asshole out for nothing.

2240
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,255
- K get me my purse.

2241
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,491
(giggling)

2242
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:30,531
- So what do you mean a bitch ran up in the crib

2243
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,533
and beat your ass?

2244
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:33,701
What happened?

2245
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:36,237
- I opened the door.

2246
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:39,507
And the bitch punched me in my face.

2247
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,108
- Did they take anything?

2248
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,510
- They who?

2249
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,745
Okay, who is this they that you speak of?

2250
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,180
It was one bitch.

2251
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:48,949
- Did she take anything?

2252
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:51,786
- She took my self respect, James.

2253
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:53,854
Damn, my eye still hurts.

2254
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:56,157
- Fuck your eye.

2255
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,792
Fuck your face.

2256
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,193
Did they rob you?

2257
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,730
- It was one bitch.

2258
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,065
No they.

2259
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,599
And no, she didn't take anything.

2260
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:06,767
- Cool.

2261
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,235
- Not cool.

2262
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:10,304
How am I gonna go to my grand opening

2263
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,306
with my face lookin' like this?

2264
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:15,042
- Man, fuck your grand opening.

2265
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,010
Shit.

2266
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,912
- That's her, right there.

2267
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:18,846
- What?

2268
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:19,914
- That's the ho that punched me

2269
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:21,148
in my face, James.

2270
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:23,617
- Kima, what the fuck, did you do?

2271
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:25,019
- I didn't do shit.

2272
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:26,854
I just made a withdrawal.

2273
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,222
- You took my money?

2274
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:29,890
- What money, James?

2275
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:33,994
- That shit wasn't yours, Kima.

2276
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:35,496
- You were my investor,

2277
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:37,565
so I expedited the investment.

2278
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,233
- No bitch, you stole from me.

2279
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,769
- (clears throat) There was no money there.

2280
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,471
- What the fuck you mean, wasn't no money there?

2281
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:44,705
Who's side are you on?

2282
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:46,373
- Nobodies.

2283
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:47,441
- But when I went there,

2284
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:49,810
there was no money there.

2285
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,980
Only your beat up girlfriend.

2286
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,081
- So you really think

2287
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:56,317
you can do this shit to me?

2288
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,486
Do you know who the fuck I am?

2289
01:35:58,486 --> 01:35:59,753
- I know exactly, who the fuck you are.

2290
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:00,921
You's a broke nigga,

2291
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,557
soon to be a dead nigga, period.

2292
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,031
- It's cool.

2293
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:13,234
It's cool.

2294
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,870
Because I'm about to post bail, anyway.

2295
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,838
Soon as my lawyer, get me the fuck out of here.

2296
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:19,206
Bitch, you dead.

2297
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:22,109
I don't give a fuck where you are.

2298
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,711
I'm gonna find you.

2299
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:24,912
- Did you say, your lawyer?

2300
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:26,113
- My lawyer.

2301
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:27,481
- Well you must have got a new one.

2302
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:30,351
Cause, you see this man right here?

2303
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:31,585
He's my father.

2304
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,488
- Your father?

2305
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:36,957
The fuck.

2306
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:38,492
You don't even talk to your father.

2307
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:40,261
- Didn't tell you everything, James.

2308
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:42,696
You never gave me the chance.

2309
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:47,067
- They are some fucking snakes.

2310
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,137
- Hey, hey, hey.

2311
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:50,971
- What?

2312
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,308
- Listen, they're always hiding more

2313
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:55,709
than you think, baby girl.

2314
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:56,644
I'm just glad I was here

2315
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,246
to get you out of this mess.

2316
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:01,515
- I didn't need you to.

2317
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:02,683
But thank you.

2318
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:05,386
- So what is this?

2319
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:06,353
Goodbye?

2320
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:09,223
- Dad, I can't, I can't do this.

2321
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:11,825
You're the reason, mom is dead.

2322
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,563
- That wasn't my fault.

2323
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:19,099
Your mother died of a drug over dose.

2324
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:20,701
- No. You weren't there for her.

2325
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,903
You were too busy, workin' or with

2326
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:24,071
your rich friends.

2327
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:26,040
She was by herself, all the time.

2328
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,974
- I'm here.

2329
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,543
I'm here.

2330
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:30,377
Now.

2331
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,081
And I'm not goin' anywhere.

2332
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:56,003
- What you want for this?

2333
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,571
- Protection and access.

2334
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:59,940
James basically said "Fuck y'all"

2335
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,208
But not me.

2336
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,409
I wanna see you boys eat out here, still.

2337
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,812
Here's a little money on good faith.

2338
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:08,182
- Okay.

2339
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:09,016
- Enjoy.

2340
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:16,957
- Fuck, man.

2341
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:20,761
- (giggling)

2342
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:23,097
- What the fuck do you want?

2343
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:26,967
