- [audience] <i>Ow!</i>

3
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,640
[newscaster] Unfortunately,
today an upper ankle sprain

4
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,903
<i>has ended the promising rise of Winter
Olympic hopeful, Abigail Simpson,</i>

5
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,948
<i>eliminating her from
the semifinal trials.</i>

6
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,863
<i>We wish her a complete
and speedy recovery.</i>

7
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,823
<i>Maybe we'll see her again in four years.</i>
- [click]

8
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:46,001
[Abigail] And that is how you
do not execute a camel spin.

9
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,655
[Kaylee] Were you hurt badly?

10
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,700
[Abigail] Nothing I
couldn't recover from,

11
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,659
but enough to pull
me from my spot.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,704
Why didn't you try again?

13
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:57,056
It took everything my parents
could muster to get me that far

14
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,102
and I didn't wanna wait
another four years.

15
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,148
My plans had changed.

16
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,237
I decided I wanted to teach

17
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,457
and coach the next group
of Olympic hopefuls

18
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,156
- which is you guys.
- [chuckles softly]

19
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:13,477
Now, go put your skates on. We've a lot of
hard work before the Christmas Ice Parade.

20
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,863
[Janet] That must have
been hard to watch.

21
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,039
[Abigail] Trust
me, Janet, it was.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,824
But showing it to the
class makes a point.

23
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,653
- Which is?
- Don't get cocky

24
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,743
and start believing
in your own publicity.

25
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:33,441
Let's go.

26
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,141

00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:43,973

[scratching]

29
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,291
[Janet] Hey, why not do
a little advertising?

30
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,380
We can offer some
sort of discount code,

31
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,035
or special beginner class,

32
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,950
make a great stocking stuffer.

33
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,735
And how you think I'm gonna pay
for advertising? My good looks?

34
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,172
Exactly!

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,478
Abbie, you were almost famous.

36
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,741
You still are!

37
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:01,354
Look, let's plaster your
name and picture on a poster.

38
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,921
We could put them all over town.

39
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,750
We're already promoting
the Christmas Ice Parade.

40
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,012
Let's make it more interesting.

41
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,144
Look, I don't know.

42
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,015
It, it sounds desperate.

43
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,582
Like I'm giving up.

44
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,844
You listen to yourself?

45
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,368
Isn't that what
you're already doing?

46
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,804
Giving up?

47
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:19,633
Wow. Aren't you supposed
to be my best friend?

48
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,504
- Your bestest.
- Okay.

49
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,812
- Well, then go supervise the kids.
- Oh.

50
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:25,379
Aye, aye, Captain.

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,597
And don't look so down.

52
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,338
You act like you're
the only person

53
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,859
to ever go through
something like this.

54
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,386
What if I am?

55
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,083
What if you're not?

56
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,345
Goodbye.

57
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,739
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,179
[lively Christmas music]

59
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,946
[tray rattling]

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,003
[John in RP accent] No. Go! Get it
outta the zone. Get it outta the zone.

61
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,353
Go! No!

62
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,572
- No. Come back! Get him. Get him.
- [sighs]

63
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,400
[John] You can do
it. You can do it.

64
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,837
Stop him. Stop him.
Don't let him get there.

65
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,709
- No! Stop!
- [referee whistles on TV]

66
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,015
Stop! Aah!

67
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:40,322
[cheering on TV]

68
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,542
It's impossible. It's
bloody impossible.

69
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,414
And, yet... [sighs]

70
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,329
And yet... it's true.

71
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,765
- [flicks TV switch]
- [mischievous music]

72
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,724
We lost.

73
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh, dear. Again, Your Highness?

74
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,815
Again.

75
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:58,949
Defeat snatched from
the jaws of victory.

76
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,169
Perhaps this will help
you calm yourself.

77
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,607
[stutters] How can I be
calm at a moment like this?

78
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,348
It is but a game, Your Highness.

79
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,437
But a game?

80
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,873
Are you serious, Marshall?

81
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,485
There's no such
thing as but a game.

82
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,399
If you say so, sir.

83
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,575
I do say so!

84
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,446
Hockey is not just a game,

85
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:18,796
it's a sport.

86
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:21,232
[sighs sharply]

87
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,973
It's my sport.

88
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:27,151
Of course, Your Highness, and
a very noble sport it is too.

89
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:30,460
But, every contest must
have a winner and a loser.

90
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,071
Fair play and all that.

91
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,556
Mm. [inhales]

92
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,951
It's high time I did
something about it.

93
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:48,521
You, sir? Do you plan
to take up the sport?

94
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,176
Marshall, of course not.

95
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,135
But I could buy a team.

96
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,399
And that way, I'd have some
say in how things are done.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,184
Your own ice hockey team?

98
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,361
Certainly a bold
idea, Prince John.

99
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,537
And one you should
pursue in the new year.

100
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,669
Don't be silly, Marshall.

101
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,933
I plan on moving forward on
this business immediately.

102
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,892
As in right now.

103
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:15,286
[stutters] But, Your Highness,
the Royal Family is your business.

104
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:19,029
[scoffs] Please, you
sound like my mother.

105
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,598
Look, I'm the youngest son
in the monarchy of sons.

106
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,080
- I will never be king.
- - True.

107
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,039
LI need to have somethingn
in ton my own. y of sons.

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
Something that belongs to me,
something that I'm passionate about.

109
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,656
Something that's really
mine, away from the family.

110
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:40,964
What better than my
own sports franchise?

111
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,226
Minor League, of course,

112
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,707
but how fantastic.

113
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,361
- Of course.
- [John chuckles]

114
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:49,364
And then, all the profits
from the merchandising

115
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,932
will go direrectly
back to the people...

116
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:54,630
by way of my
preexisting charities.

117
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,110
Very noble, Your Highness,

118
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,896
but how do you plan
to achieve this?

119
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,421
- By going to America.
- America?

120
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,901
Yes, I can't manage
all of this on my own.

121
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,426
I need to go there to
set up a co-venture.

122
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,818
Partnership of sorts.

123
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,699
I need to go there
[mischievous music continues]

124
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,912
[Marshall] "Daryl Blake."

125
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:18,001
I've a meeting with
him in a few days.

126
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:21,048
I have a very small
window of opportunity.

127
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,529
- I'm planning on seizing it.
- But, Your Highness,

128
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,401
the Royal Christmas
Festivities are imminent.

129
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,098
You're expected to be there.

130
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,492
I will, Marshall, I'll be there.

131
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,712
But I have to do this first.
It means everything to me.

132
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,889
[sighs deeply]

133
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,368
And I need your silence.

134
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,067
Can I count on you?

135
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,026
Mm-hmm.

136
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:44,506
Ah, good.

137
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,203
Silence is golden.

138
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:47,510
I have a plane to catch.

139
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,168
- And see that these are taken care of?
- Yes.

140
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,486
- [lively Christmas music]
- [sighs]

141
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,278
- [Daryl] Oh, there he is.
- Mr. Blake.

142
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,020
Your Highness,
please call me Daryl.

143
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay then, Daryl.

144
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,677
Uh, in fact, why don't we
dispense with the formalities?

145
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,549
Uh, my name is John,
so we won't be needing

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,899
any of the royal designations
from here on out.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,814
Are you sure? A
royal title can open

148
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,207
an awful lot of doors
in a town like this.

149
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,905
And the accent
doesn't hurt either.

150
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:21,385
Yeah, it can also
close a lot of doors.

151
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,257
Can even double the
price of admission.

152
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,433
So, let's just keep
it in our back pocket,

153
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,957
as you Americans say,
until it's useful.

154
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,611
Whatever you say, Prince.

155
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,440
I mean... John. [chuckles]

156
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,444
- Care to take a walk?
- Uh, absolutely. Lead on.

157
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,362
[John] <i>So you see, what
I'd like to do next</i>

158
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,668
<i>is to assemble a short list</i>

159
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,060
of potential investors, huh,

160
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,976
to come on board to help
make this team a reality.

161
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,850
I'm thinking of calling
it "The Monarchy."

162
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,373
The Monarchy.

163
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,462
I love that. Very clever.

164
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:57,900
And with you as the face of the
franchise, well, it's a perfect fit.

165
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,555
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

166
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,646
- Ready to see your future?
- Indeed, I am. Lead on.

167
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,212
Right this way.

168
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,650
[John sighs]

169
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,652
Now, even though they are
minor league franchise,

170
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,132
we've made arrangements
for the team

171
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,701
to play in the finest arenas
the sport has to offer.

172
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,354
Like this. What do you think?

173
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:19,530
[John] It's beyond
grand, Daryl.

174
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,836
Something I've only dreamed of.
- Yeah.

175
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,708
We're gonna make that
dream become a reality.

176
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,623
You understand?

177
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,884
I mean, look at this.

178
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,842
Luxury boxes,
five-star restaurants,

179
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,802
cocktail lounges, celebrity
endorsements by the dozen.

180
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:33,196
You name it. It's all
there for the taking.

181
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,852
[exhales sharply] This
is all so fantastic.

182
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,854
I'm sold.

183
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,640
What do we need to do
to make this happen?

184
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,643
I'll tell you what
we need to do.

185
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,210
We leave town.

186
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,650
- Leave town?
- Yep. Leave town.

187
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,347
I am afraid I'm not following.

188
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:55,958
Prince, professional sports
franchises are all over the place.

189
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,743
The Buffalo Bills
play at Orchard Park.

190
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,919
The Los Angeles
Angels are in Anaheim.

191
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,139
The Giants don't even
play in the same state.

192
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,446
We move outside the mainstream,

193
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,796
build d our training
facility, our base camp,

194
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:11,018
and we g everything we alwlways
dreamed of at a fraction of the ct.

195
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,759
Yes. Now I'm following you.

196
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,587
I think I've got
just the location.

197
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,197
Evanston.

198
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,633
- Evanston.
- Yep.

199
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,591
The Evanston Monarchy.

200
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,029
- Ooh!
- That's where you build.

201
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,206
In a small town, not
some gigantic metropolis.

202
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,817
Instead, an elegant little town

203
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,907
that becomestown, notthe
home of your brand.is.

204
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:35,129
And you know what? I've gotta a
lead on the perfect location there.

205
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,784
[stutters] You,
you think about it.

206
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,483
- Oh, I, I am. I, I am thinking about it.
- Better yet,

207
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,834
you, you should go up there.
Check it out for yourself.

208
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,141
Yeah. It's less
than an hour away.

209
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,534
That's a great idea.

210
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,886
Just don't breathe a word
of this to anybody, okay?

211
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,671
News gets out, press
goes up, up, up.

212
00:11:56,672 --> 00:12:00,720
Play your cards right,
all this... can be yours.

213
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,724
[sighs] Understood. Thank you.

214
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,769
Thank you.

215
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,426
[gentle Christmas music]

216
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,138
Lee, shoulder's back.

217
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,226
Head up.

218
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,058
That's beautiful,
Jamie. I love it.

219
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,067
[Curtis] I never could get
the hang of ice-skating.

220
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,460
You make it look so effortless.

221
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,809
Let me guess. You
didn't come here

222
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,638
to watch the kids
skate, did you?

223
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,468
- No.
- Look, if it's about the rent for the classroom space,

224
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,992
- I'll have it soon.
- [sighs] Listen, Abbie.

225
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,779
- I love what you're doing with these kids.
- [melancholic music]

226
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,649
But...?

227
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,346
The owner of this building

228
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,567
is thinking of
closing it entirely.

229
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,049
- Wait, are you serious?
- Absolutely.

230
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,833
I think they want to turn
it into something else

231
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,749
or maybe even sell
it completely.

232
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,317
Mr. Curtis, I need this place.

233
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,146
This is where my classroom is.

234
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,018
Look, it's Christmas. I
really need the money.

235
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,280
- Mm.
- Come on.

236
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:26,543
We're working on some
really big promotions.

237
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,198
Promotions? What kind?

238
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,592
Your Christmas Ice Parade?

239
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,986
So how are ticket
sales going over that?

240
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,686
Well, they, they could be
better, but they're steady.

241
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
That's good to hear, Abbie.

242
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,037
I'll see you in a week.

243
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:47,565
[lively Christmas music]

244
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,018
And then Bradley's pass gets
deflected in the end zone

245
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,325
and still caught by
Johnson for a touchdown.

246
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,632
Craziest thing I've
ever seen in my life.

247
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,155
- [Abigail] Hey, Al.
- [doorbell chimes]

248
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,896
Hey, Abbie.

249
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,332
You, uh, come for
your momma's cake?

250
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,508
- You bet. Is it ready?
- Sure is.

251
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,945
- Just gimme a second.
- Okay.

252
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,077
[sighs deeply]

253
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,124
[lively Christmas music]

254
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,401
[horn honks]

255
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:43,883
[sighs]

256
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,890
All right.

257
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,066
Here it is.

258
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,633
It's as nice as I can make it.

259
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,288
And it's paid for already,
so you can take her away.

260
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,724
It's beautiful.

261
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:01,943
Will I see you at
the party tonight?

262
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,467
I got an after-hours
delivery coming in,

263
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,252
eggnog frozen yogurt,

264
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,819
but maybe, if it doesn't get
too late, I could still stop by.

265
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,084
Sounds good. Oh, and thanks
for putting up the poster.

266
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,694
[Al] No problem.

267
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,870
But, hey, how come your
name is not on the poster?

268
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,177
Because it's not about me.
It's about the students.

269
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:21,441
Hey, people would pay big
money to see you skate again.

270
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,921
Al, please.

271
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,619
[chuckles] You'd sell
a lot more tickets.

272
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,187
Guaranteteed box office.

273
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,753
I'll think about it.

274
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,060
- Thanks again.
- All right.

275
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,152
[cheerful Christmas music]

276
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:43,594
Hey, hey!

277
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,639
Merry Christmas, Abigail.

278
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,034
Oh, Merry Christmas, Don.

279
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:49,643
[Abigail] Merry
ChristOh!, Abigail.

280
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,949
[John] Oh, dear! Here.

281
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,993
[Abigail] Oh, no.

282
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,429
I am so sorry.

283
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,779
Let me help.

284
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,001
[Abigail] No, it's ruined.

285
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,162
Well, I'm sure we can fix it.

286
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,527
[mischievous music]

287
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,443
I, I'm sorry, Abbie, there's
nothing I can do with this.

288
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,011
I knew it. My mom's
gonna kill me.

289
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,926
[John] Do you think you
can make another one?

290
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,536
In time for tonight's
winter festival?

291
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,974
I don't think so.

292
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,106
I mean, can we?

293
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,021
- Maybe.
- Uh, how much time do you need?

294
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,284
A few hours at least.
I, I, I'm swamped today.

295
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:26,332
- [sighs] Still have so much to do before tonight.
- Look,

296
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,768
I feel terrible about this.

297
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,511
Let me pay for a new cake.
It's the least I can do.

298
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,514
- Works for me.
- [Abigail] Okay.

299
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,517
Thanks, Al. I'll come
by later tonight.

300
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,519
Hey, excuse me.

301
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,565
Uh, sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

302
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,871
It's Abigail.

303
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:44,872
I'm John.

304
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,136
[mellow music]

305
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,716
[mischievous music]

306
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,023
Hey.

307
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,850
Hey, Abbie, wait up.

308
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,070
- [chuckles softly]
- Hey, Chad.

309
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,637
I heard you were in town.

310
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:13,248
Oh, you look a little
down, is something wrong?

311
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,512
Uh, the cake for tonight's party
got ruined, but that's all.

312
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:19,341
[laughs] That's rough.

313
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:22,779
- Look, I, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
- Then, I won't keep you.

314
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,912
Listen, ever since I
got back into town,

315
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,654
I've just been thinking
a lot about you.

316
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:28,612
- Really?
- [chuckles softly]

317
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,570
Well, that's flattering.

318
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,877
Look, I know I'm not the quarterback
of the varsity football team anymore

319
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,141
and you're not The
Princess On Ice,

320
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:40,928
but it doesn't mean we can
give it another shot, right?

321
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,539
I've just been thinking
a lot about the future.

322
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,153
Now, maybe there might
be a future for us.

323
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,590
That's really sweet, but I have
a lot on my plate right now.

324
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,375
[chuckles] I hear you.

325
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,855
But on a more serious note, um,

326
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,118
the real estate market around
here is exploding and expanding,

327
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,600
and Mr. Curtis has some
really big plans for me.

328
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,515
Yeah, I saw him earlier too.

329
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,212
He told me someone's
trying to convert

330
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,736
the ice rink into
something more profitable.

331
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:10,088
I mean, I've heard a few things,
but those are just rumors, Abbie.

332
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,525
I'm sure there are
other ice rinks.

333
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:16,574
You know, I could really be of some
assistance to you, if you'd just let me.

334
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,402
All I need is you
back in my life again.

335
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:24,059
Look, there's a lot of reasons
why people break up, Chad.

336
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,105
We really tried, but...

337
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,671
we just weren't
the right couple.

338
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,891
You know, and I could
help you with your school.

339
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,893
We could be partners.

340
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,503
You could hire some
teachers. I mean,

341
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,158
why keep risking your health
out there on the ice, you know?

342
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,507
You got lucky once.

343
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:39,987
Could have been a lot worse.

344
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,555
Yeah, but it wasn't.

345
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,122
I know you.

346
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,036
And I know you wouldn't be
sitting on the sideline,

347
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,562
not competing if you
weren't worried too.

348
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,087
Let me take that worry away.

349
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,568
Come on.

350
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:58,136
I'll think about it. Okay?

351
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,095
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

352
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,406
[solemn music]

353
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,496
[Marshall] Just because
your brother's not seen out

354
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,889
with the same woman on
his arm every night,

355
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,761
why do people find
that interesting?

356
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,676
Honestly, he could
easily find himself a,

357
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,721
a suitable heiress
who adores him.

358
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,638
I mean, Mother would love that.

359
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,857
But...

360
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,554
he chooses the
life of a bachelor.

361
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:28,166
[soft chuckle] Unwilling
to settle down.

362
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,602
Why is that, do you think?

363
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,691
It's perfectly simple.

364
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,041
He's never found a
woman fascinating enough

365
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,087
to freeze him in his tracks.

366
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,091
You mean he's never found a woman
who could hold her own with him?

367
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:44,878
Perhaps, but don't give up on
himim just yet, Your Hiness.

368
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,837
Wellgood luck changing his mind.

369
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,839
- [chuckles sarcastically]
- Have you seen this?

370
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,060
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

371
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,149
Please, Marshall, sit.

372
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:06,204
- A business plan?
- He's trying to start his own professional ice hockey team

373
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,293
in America no less.

374
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,903
- A business plan?
- He's trying to start his own profeslce hockey team? y team

375
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,384
His obsession with the sport
has finally gone to his head.

376
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,256
He eats, sleeps and breathes
professional ice hockey.

377
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,476
[chuckling] He can't be serious.

378
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,304
Oh, but he is.

379
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:22,698
As he sees it, he's finally going
to do something for himself,

380
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,614
have something all his own.

381
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,225
And...

382
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,184
I can understand where
he's coming from.

383
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,317
I mean,

384
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,927
I knew he was head over
heels for the sport,

385
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,568
but I didn't realize
it had gone this far.

386
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,541
What ever will Mother think?

387
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,588
Perhaps she doesn't
need to know about it.

388
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,677
Not just yet, anyway.

389
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,637
I think we owe your brother
that much, don't you?

390
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,553
[soft chuckle] Agreed.

391
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:54,165
[gentle music]

392
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,958
[grunts] Oh!

393
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,308
- Hey, I'm home.
- [Abigail] Hi, Mom.

394
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,614
[door closes]

395
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,050
- [Carol grunts]
- Oh, let me give you a hand.

396
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,486
Oh, thanks. Here, take
the one under my arm

397
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,358
before I drop it. [chuckles]

398
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,273
- Where's your father?
- Oh, he's at the center.

399
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,232
- He's decorating for the party tonight.
- Oh, perfect.

400
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,541
I don't want him snooping around
in my packages. [chuckles]

401
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,152
Oh, did you buy
him something nice?

402
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,285
Of course not.

403
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,373
I bought myself something.

404
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,852
[chuckles]

405
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,419
So what are you up to?

406
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,335
[sighs] I'm just making some
Christmas cards for my friends.

407
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,338
- I don't have enough money to buy gifts this year.
- I know.

408
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,122
But they'll understand.

409
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,952
Everything is going to be fine.

410
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:44,867
So, where's the cake?

411
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,478
[mischievous music]

412
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,915
Uh, about that.

413
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,351
Oh, no, don't tell me.

414
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,179
Well, I went to pick it up today

415
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,224
and there was this guy who wasn't
looking where he was going,

416
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:57,054
and he ran right into me and
knocked it right outta my hands.

417
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,666
- It's ruined.
- Oh, dear.

418
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,102
But, but, it's gonna be okay.

419
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,538
They're making a new one.
They're gonna deliver it

420
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,716
directly to the center,
so... everything's good.

421
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,109
How are you? Are you okay?

422
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,632
[sad music]

423
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,895
You mean, like, am I hurt?

424
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,158
No, I'm fine.

425
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,901
So who ran into you?
Was it anybody we know?

426
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,642
Um, no, I don't think so.

427
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:23,645
Some guy with a
fancy foreign accent.

428
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:26,170
Maybe a, a John somebody.

429
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,824
Hmm.

430
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,565
Was he handsome?

431
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,261
Mother, please.

432
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,917
Well, was he?

433
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,833
Yeah.

434
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,141
- Hmm.
- [sighs deeply]

435
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,150

437
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,202
- Marshall?
- [Marshall on the phone] <i>I'm sorry to disturb you,</i>

438
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,161
<i>Your Highness, but I
was just ringing to see</i>

439
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,685
<i>if you'd come to
your senses yet.</i>

440
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,207
Oh.

441
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,035
[mischievous music]

442
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,472
Absolutely not.

443
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,388
Look, Prince John, I'm
very concerned about you,

444
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,956
- as is your brother.
- Roger? Concerned about me?

445
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,871
[scoffs] How charming.

446
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,177
Does my mother
know anything yet?

447
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,396
No, Your Highness,

448
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,702
I've been able to
cover for you thus far.

449
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:23,575
Luckily, she's been very busy
with her holiday preparations.

450
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,011
That's good, Marshall.

451
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:28,318
But I cannot continue
this charade much longer.

452
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,538
She's bound to find
out sooner or later.

453
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,366
So what if she does?

454
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,933
I'm not a child anymore.

455
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,457
I have a right to live
my own life as I see fit.

456
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,372
<i>Most assuredly, sir.</i>

457
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:41,723
<i>But you should at least keep
them abreast of your movements.</i>

458
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,726
[John] Of course, I will...

459
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,554
in time.

460
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,165
<i>I'll return shortly...</i>

461
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,820
when I'm ready.

462
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:54,606
Your Highness, you're making
my job rather difficult.

463
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,870
Well, at is my goal in
life, isn't it, Marshall?

464
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,091
- [sighs]
- No if you'll excuse me,

465
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,831
I have a party to attend.

466
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,267
No, no, no.

467
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,921
Please don't, don't
hang up on me.

468
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,054
Merry Christmas, Marshall.

469
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,057
Merry Christmas, Your Highness.

470
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,450
[click]

471
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,413
Marshall!

472
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,762
Where is my son?

473
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,764
[Marshall] Uh, Your Majesty.

474
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:27,987
Well, uh, I, I believe he's
at the, uh, Royal Banquet Hall

475
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:30,772
finalizing the menu
for Christmas brunch.

476
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,514
I'm not asking you
about Prince Roger.

477
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,387
I'm asking you about
my youngest son, John.

478
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,520
He's about yay high

479
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,435
and not too big around.

480
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,263
Of course, Your Majesty.

481
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,787
Well, uh...

482
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,660
I'm afraid, truth be told,

483
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,097
he's, uh,

484
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,315
gone off

485
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:54,492
to America unexpectedly.

486
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,146
Ah, of course.

487
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:01,542
So if this was, as you suggest,
an unexpected decision,

488
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:06,460
he can't possibly have any
great amount of cash with him.

489
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:10,509
He would have to rely
heavily on his credit cards.

490
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,554
You know what to do then.

491
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,165
Follow the trail.

492
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,649
Your Majesty.

493
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:23,870
[sighs]

494
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:28,918

[click]

496
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,663
Marshall, you need
to stop phoning me.

497
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,709
Won't do any good, and I'm
starting to get irritated.

498
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,060
Prince John, it's Daryl Blake.

499
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:43,105
Oh, of course, Daryl.

500
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,020
<i>- My apologies.</i>
- [laughs]

501
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,502
I was having a bit of a moment
with one of my staff back home.

502
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,112
<i>Not a problem at
all. Must be tough</i>

503
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,724
keeping all those balls in
the air at the same time.

504
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,987
Just wondering how things
are going out in Evanston.

505
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:58,599
Oh, Evanston is everything
you said it was.

506
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,516
Small, quaint... lovely people.

507
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:05,780
- Beautiful. I knew that you would like it. I knew it.
<i>- Indeed, I do.</i>

508
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,261
And you mentioned you had
your eye on a property

509
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,045
for a new training
facility, right?

510
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,482
Don't worry about that just yet.

511
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,615
The important thing
here is that you can

512
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,836
see yourself setting up shop
in that charming little town.

513
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,881
<i>And it sounds like you can.</i>

514
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,275
I believe you've hit
on something, Daryl.

515
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,059
I knew I was right to trust you.

516
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,541
Thank you. Thank you, Your
Highness. It's excellent.

517
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,283
Um, listen, enjoy
your time in Evanston,

518
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:33,722
and I'm here if you need me,
and, uh, you'll be back soon?

519
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,507
Soon it is. Cheers.

00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,424
[gentle music]

522
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:56,136
- [people chattering]
- [happy music]

523
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:09,017
So sweetheart,
what do you think?

524
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,323
Pretty snazzy, huh?

525
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:13,108
Oh, it's nice.

526
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,023
Very nice.

527
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:17,852
Uh, Larry, you did a great
job. I'm proud of you.

528
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,724
Well, I had some help.

529
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,378
Well, I hope you let the younger
ones get up on the ladder.

530
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,904
Absolutely. No more
ladders for me.

531
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,862
Hey, come here.

532
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:31,518
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Right?

533
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,433
- [Carol] When did he drop it off?
- [Larry] Well, he didn't.

534
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:34,608
[John] Pardon me.

535
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,741
Well, if Al didn't
deliver, who did?

536
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,264
[John] I did.

537
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:40,832
My apologies. I couldn't
help but overhear.

538
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,660
- I'm John.
- Oh.

539
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,271
Carol, John's staying
at the Mountmore Hotel.

540
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:46,402
We met earlier.

541
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:48,230
[Carol] Oh, that's nice.

542
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,364
They have nice rooms,
very old-fashioned.

543
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,235
Oh, yeah. Absolutely right.

544
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:54,497
[Carol] Sorry, I
don't mean to pry,

545
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,064
but, tell me,

546
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:59,111
why did you want to
deliver the cake yourself?

547
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,374
[Abigail] Because he's the one who
ruined the cake in the first place.

548
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,637
[mischievous music]

549
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:07,162
Uh, yes, regretfully so.

550
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,904
Good evening, uh, Miss Abigail,
you look very pretty tonight.

551
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,907
- Oh, thank you.
- [Janet clears throat]

552
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,997
- Oh, uh, Janet, this is John.
- [gentle music]

553
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,740
Very pleased to meet you, John.
- [John] The pleasure's mine.

554
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,612
So, Abigail, what do you think?

555
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,397
You know, I'm impressed.

556
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,748
- I didn't think Al could do it.
- [chuckle]

557
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:30,359
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

558
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,407
John, could you help us for
a moment in the kitchen?

559
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,889
Oh, why... Yes, of course.

560
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:38,586
Uh, ladies.

561
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,893
[Carol chuckling] Come here.

562
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,895
Oh, dear.

563
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,854
Abbie, why are you being
so cold to that guy?

564
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,074
Was just an accident.

565
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,249
And he's so good-looking,

566
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,903
so sophisticated,

567
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:55,080
and that accent... Wow!

568
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:58,213
- Well, accents aren't everything.
- Maybe not.

569
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,824
But I think he likes you.

570
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:03,349
- [soft chuckles] Well, I doubt that.
- Really?

571
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,832
Why would he go through all that
trouble to deliver that cake in person?

572
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,399
- Guilty conscience?
- [chuckles]

573
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,272
I can't believe you.
You're acting like a kid.

574
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,405
Well, how do you want me to act?

575
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,668
We're at a party. We're
supposed to be having fun.

576
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,584
So start acting like that.

577
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,196
All right.

578
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,024
I want you to promise me

579
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:29,419
you'll be as sweet as pie to
the very next person you meet.

580
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,595
You promise?

581
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:34,511
I promise.

582
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,165
Merry Christmas, Abbie.

583
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,340
[mischievous music]

584
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,778
Chad.

585
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,563
Well, good luck with that.

586
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,826
If you two will excuse me.

587
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,003
[whispers] Coward.

588
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,876
[muffled chatter]

589
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:56,968
Oh, right here. You can help us put
the bags in the boxes. [chuckles]

590
00:29:56,969 --> 00:30:01,233
So, John, are you going to
be in Evanston for very long?

591
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,625
Oh, no, no, not long.

592
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:05,367
Just conducting a
little business.

593
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,935
Oh, what sort of business are
you looking to get involved in?

594
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,589
Larry, don't be so nosy.

595
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,373
No, it's all right.

596
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,985
It's just a little project
that I'm working on.

597
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,117
I have some pressing holiday
engagements back home,

598
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,727
so not long, I'm afraid.

599
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,381
[Carol] Mm. That's too bad.

600
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:22,471
Evanston is a wonderful
place to spend Christmas.

601
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,691
I'm sure it is.

602
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,772
And I'd also love to get to
know Abbie a little more.

603
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,826
If, if I could.

604
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,653
[gentle music]

605
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:33,613
And again, I, I am so sorry
about everything that happened.

606
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,875
Don't worry about that.

607
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,660
She's a very
understanding person.

608
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:41,403
She just, uh, feels stressed
about work right now.

609
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:44,015
Abbie teaches skating
down at the ice rink

610
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:47,235
and her class is a little
underwhelming at this time of year.

611
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,671
That's too bad.

612
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,412
Is it a beginner's class?

613
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:55,026
All levels. It's mostly just
young people trying to have fun.

614
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:58,464
Abbie was an Olympic
hopeful a few years ago,

615
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:02,599
but she had a little mishap
during a jump and didn't qualify.

616
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,862
Oh, dear.

617
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,864
- Did she give it another go?
- [Larry] No.

618
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,170
The whole thing was
broadcast on TV.

619
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:12,131
Everybody saw it, and
she was humiliated.

620
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,959
That's a pity.

621
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,399
I think I know something
that just might cheer her up.

622
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:21,704
I'm all the ears.

623
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:22,923
[Chad] <i>I have a confession.</i>

624
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,359
The only reason I
came here tonight was,

625
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,884
I was hoping to run into you.

626
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,537
Uh, really?

627
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,713
- Why is that?
- I wanted to apologize

628
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,716
if I came out a little
strong the other day.

629
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,196
Don't.

630
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,981
I could've been better myself.

631
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:39,157
What I should have
said was, I miss you.

632
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,507
I wanna make this a Christmas
we can both remember.

633
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:42,901
And I got you a
little something.

634
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,206
Um...

635
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,557
You know what? I, I can't.

636
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,168
I mean...

637
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,781
- Thank you.
- [chuckles softly]

638
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,396
It's beautiful, but
I can't accept this.

639
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,007
Here, let me help you.

640
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,749
- Uh.
- [Chad] Turn around. Just humor me.

641
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,149
- but I think that's a marvelous idea.
- Yes. [chuckles]

642
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:19,807
[sighs] Well...

643
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,069
It's been a long day.

644
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,245
Uh, perhaps I should
say goodnight.

645
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,246
[Carol] So soon?

646
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:26,726
Do you have to? Uh...

647
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,032
- [sighs] - we haven't
even cut the cake yet.

648
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,991
Yeah. I, I thought you
wanted to talk to Abbie.

649
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:35,127
Oh, well I do, but looks like
she's wrapped up at the moment.

650
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,432
[Carol] All right, John.

651
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:41,436
But don't forget what I
told you about tomorrow.

652
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,177
I won't. And thankou.

653
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,572
[gentle music]

654
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:57,758
[Carol] <i>Are you okay, honey?</i>

655
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,980
Just got a lot on
my mind, I guess.

656
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,548
Nice necklace.

657
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,117
- Pricey.
- Yeah, it was hard to say no,

658
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,164
but I'm just not interested
in reviving old flames.

659
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,645
The Ice Skating Princess and
The Football King. [chuckles]

660
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,952
That was a long time ago.

661
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,606
Yeah, he wants to pick up
right where we left off,

662
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:23,392
but I just don't
see us together.

663
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,916
I mean, he's a nice guy, but...

664
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,876
I don't know, it's
just been too long.

665
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,357
Sometimes people change.

666
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,448
- I have enough going on.
- Okay. That's fair.

667
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,624
Oh, that fella, John,

668
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,539
he was asking about you.

669
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,890
Mom, don't go match-making me again.
He'll be gone before you know it.

670
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,501
Of course, you are
right. [chuckles]

671
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:49,504
But he just seems so
debonair, so cultured.

672
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,158
You're starting to
sound like Janet.

673
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,335
[chuckles] One guy showers me
in diamonds, the other in cake.

674
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:58,035
I'm sure you look
beautiful in both.

675
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,340
- You're a riot.
- [chuckles]

676
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:00,821
Good night, sweetheart.

677
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:05,478
[sighing]

678
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,139
[sighs deeply]

679
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,014
[gentle Christmas music]

680
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:51,871
Why are you following me?

681
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:55,048
Me? [snickers] Never.

682
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:59,531
So you just wander in here where
it's a constant 35 degrees?

683
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:03,056
We, Europeans, we're
very warm-blooded people.

684
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,405
[sighs] Look, John, uh,

685
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,885
this is my private
time in the ice.

686
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:08,279
It's the only alone
time I get, so...

687
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,671
Ah, yes.

688
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:12,196
Of course, of course.
Uh, my apologies.

689
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,807
I didn't mean to
intrude or interrupt.

690
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,243
I was speaking with
your mother last night,

691
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:18,332
and she told me about
your skating classes,

692
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,769
and I thought...

693
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,077
Well, maybe...

694
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:26,994
[chuckles]

695
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,345
- You?
- Of course. Why not me?

696
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:35,133
Besides, I thought you might find it
entertaining to see me fall down a few times.

697
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,873
Well, it's tempting,

698
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,571
but you seem pretty fit.

699
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:41,008
Looks can be deceiving.

700
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,533
Okay, fine. Go rent some skates

701
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,536
- and I'll see what you got.
- Wonderful.

702
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,366
[sighs deeply]

703
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,674
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

704
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,328
You look like you've
done this before.

705
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:00,896
Uh, some, when I was
a young lad back home.

706
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,681
[chuckling] And where
exactly is "back home"?

707
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,944
[grunts softly and stutters]

708
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:08,643
Just a small little
berg outside of Belgium.

709
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,211
Uh, lovely place of
no real consequence.

710
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,518
And does this berg have a name?

711
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,302
Ooh. Well, yes, of course.

712
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,738
Of course it does.

713
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,350
[stutters] But the real
question, how am I doing?

714
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,352
Uh, it's harder than
you remember, huh?

715
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:23,571
Considerably so.

716
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:26,052
Well, do you think I
have what it takes?

717
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,794
If I can train a
ten-year-old, I can train you.

718
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,143
[chuckles]

719
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:33,059
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [both chuckle]

720
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,800
Sorry. I'm a bit wobbly.

721
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,368
- You seem fine.
- No, no, no, trust me. I'm,

722
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,021
I'm shaky.

723
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,851
Uh, maybe if you hold my hands.

724
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,071
I can't believe you.

725
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,030
[sighs]

726
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:51,251
- Now don't let go or I'll fall.
- [royal music]

727
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,252
[Abigail] Mm-hmm.

728
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,515
Come on.

729
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,343
[indistinct chatter]

730
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,737
[Agail] Yeah. [chuckles]

731
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,000
You're a natural.

732
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,568
- Oh, I'm going backwards.
- - [both chuckles]

733
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:04,699
- Stand up taller.
- Oh, yes.

734
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,266
Put your right foot forwar

735
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,748
- Keep holding my hands.
- There you go.

736
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,707
[indistinct chatter]

737
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:20,454
And he just showed up
completely unannounced?

738
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,414
Yeah. I can't believe my mom's so
free with my personal information.

739
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,677
No. She means well.

740
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,897
- She always has her nose in my business.
- [chuckles]

741
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,421
I told you he likes you.

742
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:31,857
[gentle music]

743
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,338
- He's a bold one.
- And single.

744
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:38,516
Okay, you and my mom would make the perfect pair.
- [chuckles]

745
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,563
Tell me one thing you
don't like about him.

746
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,614
- Give me a second.
- Uh-huh.

747
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,442
That's what I thought.

748
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,183
[both chuckle softly]

749
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,189
[door closes]

750
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,713
[Abigail sighs]

751
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:05,499
[Carol] And here she is in
her first little costume.

752
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,155
- I sewed the whole thing myself.
- [John] Really?

753
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,504
That's amazing.

754
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,680
- You did this all by yourself?
- Yes, I did.

755
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,029
And it wasn't easy, either.

756
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,642
All those tiny little
sequins and rhinestones.

757
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,252
- [John] May I?
- [Carol] Mm.

758
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,037
[John] You did a fabulous job.
- [Carol] Well, thank you.

759
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,431
- [chuckles]
- [Abigail] Mom?

760
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,651
What's going on here?

761
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:30,655
Well, after class today, I ran
into your mother at the market.

762
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,526
Then she asked me
how I was getting on.

763
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:35,355
And he told me he didn't have
any plans for this evening.

764
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:39,403
So, well, I thought I would
invite him here for dinner tonight

765
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,667
so we could all get
to know him better.

766
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,670
Ah, I can leave
if it's a problem.

767
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,368
No, look, I'm sorry. I'm...

768
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,545
I'm just surprised to
see you. That's all.

769
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,374
Well, then it's settled.

770
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,983
[chuckles]

771
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:57,725
I'm going to go help your
father in the kitchen.

772
00:38:57,726 --> 00:39:01,033
Oh, no. Is he making another one
of his Christmas surprise specials?

773
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,035
Well, you know your father,

774
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,690
he never misses a chance to
play around in the kitchen.

775
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,909
- [both chuckle]
- Oh, no, not again.

776
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,868
- [Carol] I wonder what he'll whip up tonight.
- [chuckles]

777
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,740
You're seriously gonna
regret doing this.

778
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,397
[John] You know, I never realized
what an incredible athlete you are.

779
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,747
[chuckles softly]

780
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,359
[sighs]

781
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:26,712
Do you feel like you...

782
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,715
didn't live up to
your full potential?

783
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,414
You have no idea.

784
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:35,415
[chuckles softly]

785
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,114
[sighs]

786
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,161
Yeah.

787
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,424
I have moments like that.

788
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,339
And then you made
them your life's work.

789
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,645
Yeah.

790
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,561
It's reduced to only work.

791
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,129
If your work is your love,

792
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,610
then you'll never work again.

793
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
Shakespeare?

794
00:39:58,918 --> 00:39:59,832
Fortune cookie.

795
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,137
[both chuckle]

796
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,662
[Carol] Dinner.

797
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:09,449
- Your father's candy cane cheeseburger casserole.
- [chuckles]

798
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,756
I warned you.

799
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,412
[soft music]

800
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,851
Oh! Tell us, John, what do
you like to do with your time?

801
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,157
Oh, um...

802
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,855
Well, to be honest

803
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:26,597
I don't really have
a lot of free time.

804
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,469
I've always been
kept pretty busy.

805
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,079
With?

806
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,082
My duties.

807
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:37,173
Oh, uh, but it's all boring.

808
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,218
Oh.

809
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,484
I saw a poster of the Christmas
Ice Parade yesterday at Al's Diner.

810
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,964
What's that about?

811
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,183
Each year, Abbie's students

812
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:51,709
- put on a holiday show for the town.
- [John] Really?

813
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,667
Maybe I arrived just in time.

814
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,234
[Carol] Oh, yes, you did.

815
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:59,673
Last night was the Annual
Holiday Winter Festival party

816
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:04,025
and tomorrow is our
Christmas Food Bank Drive.

817
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:06,375
[Larry] And next
Saturday, Abbie's students

818
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:09,640
will present this year's
Christmas Ice Parade.

819
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:11,119
I see.

820
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,078
- Are you a part of the show?
- [Abigail] Uh...

821
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,474
- No. It's showcasing the students.
- [John] Oh.

822
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,572
Well, uh, are there any
tickets still available?

823
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,916
Uh, yeah. All you could want.

824
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:28,528
Uh, you know, kids, I
ordered dessert today.

825
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:31,575
But I didn't have
time to pick it up.

826
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,577
Oh, well, not a problem.

827
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,535
I could take a trot...

828
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,624
- Oh.
- over to Al's and pick something up.

829
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,191
Shouldn't take long at all.

830
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:42,151
- What a splendid idea, isn't it, Abbie?
- [chuckles]

831
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:44,544
Yeah, splendid.

832
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:48,635
Hmm. Well, now the
two of you hurry along

833
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:51,465
and Dad and I will take
care of cleaning up here.

834
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:53,335
Me?

835
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,120
You want me to go too?

836
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:59,560
Yes. Someone has to carry the
dessert while John's driving.

837
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:01,649
[John] Shall we?

838
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,178
[doorbell chimes]

839
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,399
[ambient music
playing over speakers]

840
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:16,837
- Hey, good evening, folks.
- Good evening, Al.

841
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,578
Have a seat at the end. I'll
be with you in a minute.

842
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,579
[Abigail] Mm-hmm.

843
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,190
[indistinct chatter]

844
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,711
- [Al] All right? Careful with that, it's hot.
- [man] All right.

845
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,153
- Here.
- [Abigail] Thanks.

846
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,547
[exhales sharply]

847
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,243
Watch that.

848
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:33,854
Hey, what can I get you two?

849
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,161
I got some great drink
specials this evening.

850
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:38,206
Oh, no, thanks. Uh, we're
here for a to-go order.

851
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,860
Just a quick dessert
or something.

852
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,732
I got some cupcakes
cooling off in the back.

853
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,864
I can frost up a few if
you gimme a few minutes.

854
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,214
That would be great.
Could you spare four?

855
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,216
[Al] Four? [laughs]

856
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:51,002
By tomorrow afternoon,
I'm gonna need 400.

857
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,700
So, hey, what's a few
cupcakes among friends, huh?

858
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:56,964
Wait, I'm sorry. 400 cupcakes?
You're joking, right?

859
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,618
No, that's what my
mom was talking about.

860
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,620
The Christmas Food Bank Drive.

861
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:04,015
All the local merchants put together
holiday boxes to help those in need.

862
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:07,148
Yeah, but 400 cupcakes
in that small kitchen.

863
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:08,585
[Al] Yeah, it's a lot of work.

864
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,371
Goes faster and easier if
you have a little help.

865
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,417
- You can count me in.
- [chuckles]

866
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:20,597
Oh, right. Um, I'd be
very happy to lend a hand.

867
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,337
[Al chuckles] Great.

868
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:25,515
See you guys tomorrow. 9:00 am.
- [John] Yes.

869
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,870
Well, it looks like you'll know
where to track me down tomorrow.

870
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,176
Ha-ha. Very funny.

871
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:38,353
So do I get to call you Abbie,
now that we're coworkers?

872
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:40,704
Oh, now who's being funny?

873
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,445
[laughs]

874
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:46,927
Look,

875
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:50,017
I really like you, Abbie,

876
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:53,413
and I'd like you to like
me if you think you could.

877
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,851
And how do you
suggest I do that?

878
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:00,594
Well, I was thinking...

879
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:03,422
If it were up to me...

880
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:05,425
[soft piano music]

881
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,517
I'd ask you to dance.

882
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,693
Dance?

883
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,436
With you? [chuckles] What, here?

884
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,698
Darling,

885
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,396
can you think of a better time?

886
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:23,791
[sighs]

887
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,840
[chuckles softly]

888
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:37,587
[chuckles softly]

889
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:53,341
[chuckles softly] I haven't
danced in a long time,

890
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:56,301
so, sorry if I'm stepping
all over your feet.

891
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:57,956
Come on, don't be silly.

892
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,045
You're doing great.

893
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:02,829
As any champion skater would.

894
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,744
[chuckles softly]

895
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,746
Normally, I don't like flattery,

896
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,141
but, for you, I'll
make an exception.

897
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,583
[Chad] Well, look who it is.

898
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,845
Abigail Simpson.

899
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:21,674
Out on the town two
nights in a row.

900
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:24,024
- [mischievous music]
- Um, John, this is Chad.

901
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:25,547
We went to high school together.

902
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:29,943
Oh, yes, I saw you last
nighght at the party

903
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,642
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
saw you there with Abbie.

904
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:38,126
Nice to meet you, officially.

905
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:42,827
[Al] Hey, guys.
Your order's ready.

906
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,393
We were just leaving.

907
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:46,569
[exhales

908
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,879
[Chad] Abbie, wait.

909
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,838
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,755
Maybe I can call you tomorrow
and we can talk then.

911
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,021
[sighs]

912
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:06,415
[melancholic piano music]

913
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,944
- [Keep the change.
- Enjoy. s]

914
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:19,515
Can I ask, what
was all that about?

915
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,035
Look, my parents are waiting.
We should probably go.

916
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,130
Right, if you say so.

917
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,261
I do.

918
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:32,964
[doorbell chimes]

919
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:39,144
[birds chirping]

920
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:42,408
[sighs happily]

921
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:50,851
[gentle Christmas music]

922
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:17,616
[Carol] Hey, honey. Sit down,
breakfast is almost ready.

923
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,270
Oh, I can't, I'm in
a bit of a hurry.

924
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:21,011
Oh, and why is that?

925
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:23,230
I just have to do
something before class.

926
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:24,536
Something important?

927
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:26,886
[sighs] I'm headed to
the diner to help Al.

928
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,236
He's up to his ears
with the cupcake orders.

929
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:32,022
- Just you?
- Mom, please.

930
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:35,590
[chuckles] Well, I think it's
sweet that you're helping out.

931
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:38,115
Well, it's the least I could do.

932
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:41,161
And you were right about
John. He is a nice guy.

933
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,902
[chuckles] Great.

934
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:45,862
I just thought the two
of you might hit it off.

935
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,038
I figured that.

936
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,909
Well, did you?

937
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,130
- Did I what?
- Did you hit it off?

938
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,133
[exhales] Yeah, I guess we did.

939
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:58,440
[chuckles softly] Bye, Mom.

940
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:02,140
- Have fun.
- But thank you.

941
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,538
[birds chirping]

942
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,674
Hey, Janet,

943
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,895
I've been thinking about what you
said and I think you're right.

944
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,461
Yes. [chuckles] I know.

945
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:22,987
Okay, so I'm gonna need you
to write this down. Ready?

946
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:34,476
[Abigail sighs]

947
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,739
- Hey, Al.
- Hey.

948
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,350
Good morning, Abbie. [chuckles]

949
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,961
Hey. What do you need me to do?

950
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,181
Well, uh, if you can
get these frosted up,

951
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:46,619
- I'll put another batch in the oven.
- You got it.

952
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:48,489
By the way,

953
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,056
I really appreciate this

954
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:51,231
and so will all the families.

955
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:53,886
Of course, I'm happy to help.

956
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:56,715
Sorry my assistant
didn't show up.

957
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:58,152
[John] Well, who
hasn't shown up?

958
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,545
[Abigail] Oh.

959
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,373
Hey, you're here.

960
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:04,766
I was just taking out the trash.
I've been here for at least an hour.

961
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,855
What kept you?

962
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,466
Well, I...

963
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:09,642
Okay, you two.

964
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,817
Here are your piping bags.

965
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,210
You know what to do.

966
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,907
I'll put another
batch in the oven.

967
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:16,040
Aye, aye, Captain.

968
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:22,132
- You ready?
- All right.

969
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,524
[gentle Christmas music]

970
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:26,484
Yes. I'm gonna do the bottom.

971
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:28,877
Oh! [chuckles]

972
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:30,924
I'm not as good as I
thought I would be.

973
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,493
[John] You're
doing great. Yeah.

974
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,975
- Uh. Get off my cupcake.
- [laughing]

975
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:41,629
- Which one are you doing next?
- I'm gonna go for this one.

976
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,848
- [John] This one?
- [Abigail] No.

977
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,328
- [chuckles]
- I have to go first.

978
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,374
You can't mess up the design.

979
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:50,551
Oh!

980
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:53,467
Not too bad for a city boy.

981
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:57,690
- Ah. I was, I was about to say the same thing about you.
- [laughs]

982
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:02,956
You didn't have to help
out. I really appreciate it.

983
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:05,088
Of course, I did.

984
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,873
Beginning to feel really
invested in this town

985
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,658
Starting to like
it here very much.

986
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,357
Hey, sorry to break up
this little love fest.

987
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:15,142
We got five more
trays to get to, guys.

988
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:16,883
You got it.

989
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:22,279
[Christmas music
playing in the distance]

990
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,890
[indistinct chatter]

991
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:26,065
- Merry Christmas.
- [woman 1] Hey.

992
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,327
Please, have some fresh food.

993
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:28,372
- [Larry] Hi.
- Can I get you anything?

994
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:31,027
[indistinct chatter]

995
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,638
- Merry Christmas.
- [man 1] Merry Christmas. Thank you.

996
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,857
- Merry Christmas. Oh.
- Okay. Thank you.

997
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:37,686
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

998
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,559
This is amazing. Thank you
again for asking me to do this.

999
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,041
I, I feel like I'm a part of
something really meaningful.

1000
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,172
Well, you are.

1001
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:48,348
That's what Christmas is
all about here in Evanston.

1002
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:50,003
We try to give back
as much as we can.

1003
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,744
Well, I can see why.

1004
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:55,573
This, this is really special.

1005
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:59,621
You know, when I first met
you, I was really upset, but...

1006
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,450
I think I was wrong.

1007
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:05,061
Well, I did ruin your cake.

1008
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,498
- [chuckles] - No, I was
just having a rough day

1009
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:10,196
and I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

1010
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:12,547
I think we have that part
sorted out and for the better.

1011
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:14,462
Thank you.

1012
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:20,467
And, Abbie, I've, I've really
enjoyed getting to know you.

1013
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,688
Well, I'm glad you're
getting what you wanted.

1014
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:25,385
Y... You know, you can too.

1015
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,126
[exhales]

1016
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,736
Yeah. I mean...

1017
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:29,998
Look, I really love my school,

1018
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:32,132
but I just don't know
how to salvage it.

1019
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,134
[woman 2] Thank you.

1020
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:36,136
[gentle music]

1021
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,399
I think you could turn it around

1022
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,706
if you really tried.

1023
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:43,055
You just have to go for it.

1024
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,579
You know what to do.

1025
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,886
That's what Janet says.

1026
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:49,628
And she's always right.

1027
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:52,370
We'll see.

1028
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,633
[John] Mm.

1029
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,026
- Merry Christmas.
- [woman 3] Thank you.

1030
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,159
Hey. There you go.

1031
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,726
- [boy 1] Thank you.
- Yeah.

1032
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:04,730
[both giggling]

1033
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,386
- This is for you.
- You need some help?

1034
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:10,605
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1035
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:15,131
- Hey, bud.
- Here you go.

1036
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,176
[boy 2] Hello. Merry Christmas.
- Oh, this is so much fun.

1037
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,178
And where upon earth is Al?

1038
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,527
He should be here.

1039
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,181
We're only here because
of his hard work,

1040
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,618
and I feel guilty, like,
we're taking all the credit.

1041
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,838
Oh, I'm sure he's
around here somewhere.

1042
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,318
[Al] Ho, ho, ho!

1043
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,495
- [woman] Oh!
- Merry Christmas.

1044
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:33,061
- [Christmas music]
- Who wants presents?

1045
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,106
- Me.
- Me.

1046
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,368
[John] I don't believe it.

1047
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,154
That guy loves Santa.

1048
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:38,981
All right.

1049
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:40,809
He does it all for the kids.

1050
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:45,030
[with deep voice] Have you
two been good this year?

1051
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:48,164
Oh, I'll plead the Fifth
on that one, Santa.

1052
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,124
No, I, I don't know. I'll
find out Christmas morning.

1053
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,474
Thanks for helping out, guys.

1054
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,084
Merry Christmas.

1055
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:59,044
- Doesn't he make a great Santa?
- In fact, he does.

1056
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,394
I'm beginning to see why
people come to Evanston

1057
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:02,918
and stay.

1058
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:13,928
Did you get that?

1059
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,321
- Got it.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1060
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:16,844
- Over there? Mm-hmm?
- [clicks tongue]

1061
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:18,369
[sighs]

1062
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:21,894
[camera shutter clicking]

1063
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,113
- Mr. Curtis, what's up?
- [Curtis] ...okay?

1064
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,463
Oh. [chuckles softly]

1065
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:28,682
Uh, good morning, Abbie.
Uh, we're just taking

1066
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,990
a few pictures of the building.

1067
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,645
A few pictures? Why?

1068
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,691
Well, as I told you, the,

1069
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:40,433
the owners of this
property are thinking of

1070
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:43,524
converting this place
into something else.

1071
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:46,047
But this is my space.

1072
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,180
For the moment.

1073
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,576
[door opens and closes]

1074
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:54,927
[Chad] Uh, hey. Good
luck with your show.

1075
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:56,929
I hope you sell out.

1076
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,412
Yeah, me too.

1077
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:09,158
[upbeat music]

1078
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,282
- There's no class today.
- Oh, I know.

1079
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,851
I was just hoping to swing by
and pick up a few pointers.

1080
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:52,376
Wanna come skate with me?

1081
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:56,554
Oh, come on. I'll
let you hold my hand.

1082
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,166
Well, how can I say no?

1083
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:19,619
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Denucci.

1084
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,492
- I'd like to rent a pair of skates.
- Same again?

1085
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:25,452
- Same again.
- I remember, size ten.

1086
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,368
And I'd like to
keep the tab open.

1087
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,152
You might consider
buying a pair.

1088
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:32,371
Might be cheaper.

1089
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:34,808
Probably. I'll think about it.

1090
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:36,724
- Have a great day.
- You too.

1091
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,509
[payment machine beeping]

1092
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,772
- [John] Like this?
- [Abigail] Yeah. Keep going.

1093
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:44,166
[gentle music]

1094
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,144
[gentle Christmas music]

1095
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,832
Okay. So, you guys
have all worked so hard

1096
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:45,531
to prepare for this year's
show, and, honestly,

1097
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:48,142
I think it's our best one yet.

1098
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:50,884
Sadly, our ticket
sales have been low,

1099
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:53,365
mainly to all of our
friends and family,

1100
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:54,932
and I think we all can
do a little bit better.

1101
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:58,892
- [gentle music]
- I mean, I can do better.

1102
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:01,199
And I wanna do better
for all of you.

1103
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,204
So with that said, and a
little friendly persuasion,

1104
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,033
I have decided to
lace up my skates

1105
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:11,166
- and perform with you guys this year.
- [applause]

1106
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,342
[laughter]

1107
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:19,130
Now, some people think that's going to
boost ticket sales, I'm not so sure,

1108
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:22,612
but Lord knows we can use
all the help we can get.

1109
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:25,485
It'll be A Cameo on Ice.

1110
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,532
Got them.

1111
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,145
[chuckles]

1112
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,064
[chuckles]

1113
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,548
Wow. Abbie, if this doesn't fill
the space, then nothing will.

1114
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,637
People love a comeback story.

1115
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,769
And you're an all-town's
favorite. What's not to love?

1116
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:54,208
- Mm-hmm.
- [John] Abbie, this could put your school on the map.

1117
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:56,297
I've been telling her the
same thing for weeks now.

1118
00:57:56,298 --> 00:58:00,780
But no, it takes someone like you to
come along to finally convince her.

1119
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,087
[chuckles]

1120
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:05,306
Okay, so we have the posters.

1121
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:07,352
- Now what?
- Now we go out

1122
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:09,963
and start putting them out
where people can see them.

1123
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:11,835
Make sure you take all
the old posters down

1124
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:15,534
and don't forget to thank everyone
for letting us put these up.

1125
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:16,928
You won't be sorry.

1126
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:18,712
You'll see.

1127
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,672
What do I have to lose?

1128
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,151
Exactly.

1129
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:26,177
[Janet] Okay, kids, come
on. Let's get going.

1130
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:35,511
That looks pretty good, right?

1131
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,860
Yeah, I think so.

1132
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:37,775
[chuckles]

1133
00:58:37,776 --> 00:58:39,603
Brings back a lot of memories.

1134
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,256
Thanks for that.

1135
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,562
Well, I didn't do anything.

1136
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:46,391
- [gentle music]
- Yeah, but you did.

1137
00:58:46,392 --> 00:58:49,176
You made me start
believing in myself again.

1138
00:58:49,177 --> 00:58:52,137
All the self-doubt and
disappointment, all for nothing.

1139
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,574
- Thanks to you.
- Well, good.

1140
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:56,575
Let's celebrate then.

1141
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:58,882
Dinner tonight at Al's.

1142
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:01,058
And maybe we can finish
that dance we started.

1143
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:03,147
I would love that,

1144
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:07,934
but I'm in training mode right now and
I don't think my coach would approve.

1145
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:12,025
But your coach won't take
no for an answer. at,

1146
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:14,812
Well, it sounds like my
coach has made up his mind.

1147
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:18,772
I made up my mind the
first time I ever saw you.

1148
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,124
Then I guess that's a yes.

1149
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:27,085
[Marshall] Your Highness,

1150
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:28,913
at last.

1151
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:30,827
Oh, dear me.

1152
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,829
[Marshall] Thank
goodness I found you.

1153
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,745
[sighs] How ever
did you manage it?

1154
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,835
You shouldn't have used your
credit card to rent those skates.

1155
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:43,056
And I remember the name on the business
card you presented me last week.

1156
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:46,625
Your Highness, your guy
here is very persuasive.

1157
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:47,932
He said it was an emergency.

1158
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,368
An emergency?

1159
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,067
Well, your mother has
been worried sick.

1160
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,199
How ever could you tell?

1161
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,202
[Marshall] Please, Your
Highness, she is the Queen.

1162
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:01,553
The Queen? The Queen of what?

1163
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:04,426
The Queen of the Kingdom
of Donegal, Miss.

1164
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,037
The Queen of Donegal?

1165
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:10,736
Wait, the little berg
outside of Belgium?

1166
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:13,696
Wait, if your mother's the
Queen that makes you, uh...

1167
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,088
[Daryl] His Royal Highness,

1168
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:17,264
Prince John Lackland.

1169
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,136
[John] If you don't mind,

1170
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:21,529
I'm kind of occupied
at the moment.

1171
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,967
Can we talk later at the hotel?

1172
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,186
Your Highness, I am under
the strictest orders

1173
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:29,363
not to leave your side until
you are back at Donegal.

1174
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,756
Well, I'm sorry, Marshall.

1175
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:33,412
Regretfully, that
is a royal command.

1176
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:35,414
- But...
- Yes.

1177
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:41,681
As you desire, sir.

1178
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,858
[Abigail] John.

1179
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:47,643
I'm kind of freaking
out right now.

1180
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,557
Abbie, I can
explain all of this.

1181
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:52,170
No, don't explain anything.
Just tell me the truth.

1182
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:55,826
Uh...

1183
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:58,697
Yes.

1184
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:01,352
It's true. I'm a, I'm a prince,
but a very minor prince.

1185
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:04,007
There's no such thing
as a minor prince.

1186
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:06,705
[Daryl] Uh, I'm sorry, Your Highness,
I don't know what your thoughts are,

1187
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:11,406
but this ice rink would make a beautiful
sports facility for your new franchise.

1188
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:14,191
What? This ice rink?

1189
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:16,628
Yeah, the Prince's new
professional hockey franchise.

1190
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:18,325
The Evanston Monarchy.

1191
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,849
[Abigail] So that's
what this is all about.

1192
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,939
You're trying to buy this ice
rink for your hockey team?

1193
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,203
No, no. I didn't know that this was the
building that Mr. Blake was looking at.

1194
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:28,292
You're the one that's trying
to put us out of business.

1195
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,207
No, absolutely not.

1196
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:33,819
Believe me, Abbie, I didn't know
he was trying to buy this building.

1197
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,953
- You have to trust me.
- Trust you?

1198
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,564
How could you do this?
I thought you liked me.

1199
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:41,740
But I do. Abbie, I, I do.

1200
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:44,701
More than anyone ever before.

1201
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:49,096
You have a funny
way of showing it.

1202
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,534
I never wanna see you again.

1203
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:05,068
That could have gone better.

1204
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:07,854
[breathing heavily]

1205
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:14,600
Good evening, Your Highness.

1206
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:23,696
I hope you're happy doing
my mother's bidding.

1207
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:28,874
I've made a real mess of things.

1208
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,528
Don't be disheartened,
Your Highness,

1209
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:32,922
- it's really not all that bad.
- [sad music]

1210
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:35,359
By tomorrow, we could
be back in Donegal,

1211
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,363
surrounded by the joyous
celebrations of the holiday season.

1212
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:41,409
A... All of this
will be forgotten.

1213
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:42,976
Forgotten?

1214
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,153
A... Are you out of your mind?

1215
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,636
[sighs]

1216
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,290
I finally met someone.

1217
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,162
I met someone I care about.

1218
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,339
Now, it's ruined. Sh...
She thinks I lied to her

1219
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,255
and I plotted to put
her out of business.

1220
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,737
You mean you didn't
tell her who you were?

1221
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:08,045
Well, no, not exactly.

1222
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:11,308
But I never lied about it.

1223
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,962
I just didn't want
the royal trappings

1224
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:15,529
to get in the way of
something special.

1225
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,750
And the further
along it went...?

1226
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,449
Deeper the rabbit hole.

1227
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:31,590
[sighs]

1228
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,811
I never dreamt I'd
meet someone like her.

1229
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,598
Certainly I didn't think I'd fall
this hard for anyone, but I did.

1230
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,818
[sighs]

1231
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,211
And now it doesn't
matter anymore.

1232
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:48,867
How can I even think of starting my
new project here in Evanston now?

1233
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:51,696
Your Highness, there are
plenty of other small towns.

1234
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:55,004
No, but this one's perfect.

1235
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:57,485
And it has the one thing
that I've been looking for.

1236
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,487
The girl I love.

1237
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,360
[gentle music]

1238
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:04,622
[sighs]

1239
01:04:04,623 --> 01:04:06,146
I guess that's done now.

1240
01:04:08,627 --> 01:04:14,154
If that's true, then perhaps it's time
for us to return home without delay.

1241
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:18,984
I'm sure Mr. Blake can find
another suitable location

1242
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:21,945
and you can begin fresh
after the new year.

1243
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:26,862
If you stay, it's only
going to be worse.

1244
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,126
And we still have your
mother to contend with.

1245
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:34,783
I'm sorry, Marshall.

1246
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:46,925
I'm not leaving until
I speak with Abbie.

1247
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,232
But I thought you
said it was over, sir.

1248
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,712
Very well may be.

1249
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,629
But there's always a slight
chance of righting the ship.

1250
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,849
I want you to make
a call for me.

1251
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,157
Here's what I want you
to do. Don't mess it up.

1252
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:06,205
[lively piano music]

1253
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,686
[woman 3] Oh, well...

1254
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,907
- That was good.
- [man 2] It was fantastic.

1255
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,867
[exhales sharply]

1256
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:17,478
[music volume increases]

1257
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:21,134
[muted dialogue]

1258
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,125
[doorbell chimes]

1259
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,739
[Janet] Thought I'd
find you here...

1260
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,828
drowning your sorrows
in a milkshake.

1261
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,482
[melancholic music]

1262
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:06,745
So you heard.

1263
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:08,789
Imagine that.

1264
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,663
A real-life prince
right here in Evanston.

1265
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,012
Wow.

1266
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,883
And he was your boyfriend.

1267
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:18,060
Well, that ended
well, didn't it?

1268
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:20,018
Don't count me in on that one.

1269
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:23,108
I wouldn't have sent
him packing so quickly.

1270
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:25,807
Not at least without
hearing what he has to say.

1271
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,854
But I do have some good news.

1272
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,117
I heard that TV Six,

1273
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:33,858
all the way from Lock Valley

1274
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:36,688
is going to cover the
Christmas Ice Parade.

1275
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:39,342
We'll be on TV.

1276
01:06:39,343 --> 01:06:42,562
This could be huge
for the school.

1277
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,129
Well, if Prince
John had his way,

1278
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,914
my school would
already be shut down.

1279
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,962
Think the TV folks would
still be interested in us

1280
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:53,095
if they find out the
real star of the show

1281
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:56,054
is on his way back to his
own little private kingdom?

1282
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,796
Oh, stop.

1283
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:03,192
They're not coming to see him.

1284
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:04,716
They're coming to see you.

1285
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:08,936
Well, maybe they're coming to see him a little, but who cares?
- [chuckles softly]

1286
01:07:08,937 --> 01:07:12,070
Look, I'll get us a table where
people will sign up for lessons.

1287
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,681
Everyone is going
to be so anxious

1288
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:17,555
to learn how to skate
after they see you perform.

1289
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,861
Thanks.

1290
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:22,820
Look, you've really
done a great job.

1291
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,431
[sighs deeply]

1292
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:28,566
- If only...
- If only you weren't so miserable?

1293
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:31,655
[Janet sighs]

1294
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:35,006
Are you sure you and the
Prince are really through?

1295
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:38,662
Seems to me like you guys
were just getting started.

1296
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,881
Yeah, I mean, it
happened so fast.

1297
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,883
It felt like my
head was spinning.

1298
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:45,060
You say anything
that you regretted?

1299
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,889
Honestly, I don't even
remember what I said.

1300
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,675
Something like, "Get
outta my life forever,"

1301
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:53,634
- or words to that effect.
- [chuckles]

1302
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,856
You think maybe you
overreacted just a little bit?

1303
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:04,035
I mean, maybe if you two sat
down and hashed things out.

1304
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:06,691
He's probably halfway
back to Donegal by now.

1305
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,867
That's where he belongs.
Back in the spotlight

1306
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:13,610
and in front of his
adoring subjects.

1307
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:14,699
Wow.

1308
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:16,875
You're a real sorehead.

1309
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:20,095
Huh. Do you blame me?

1310
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,751
I mean, he made me look foolish
like a love struck school girl.

1311
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:27,754
I really thought
that he liked me.

1312
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:30,192
Are you so sure that he doesn't?

1313
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,150
I mean, guys can be funny.

1314
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,675
They're, they're hard to read.

1315
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:39,375
Listen, you are never going
to know how he really feels

1316
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:44,031
about you unless you give
him a chance to explain.

1317
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:46,295
I don't even think I could
do that if I wanted to.

1318
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,471
[doorbell chimes]

1319
01:08:48,472 --> 01:08:51,562
Well, you're about to find out.

1320
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:56,827
Abigail.

1321
01:08:56,828 --> 01:09:00,700
Uh, let me guess, my mother
told you where I was.

1322
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:03,878
Uh, no, I figured
this out on my own.

1323
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,402
Oh,

1324
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,186
my apologies. Do you mind?

1325
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:10,884
Oh, no, no. Not at
all. Absolutely.

1326
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:15,673
Um, I will, uh, just go
help Al clean up a bit.

1327
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,201
Thought you'd be
on a plane by now.

1328
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:26,161
No, not yet.

1329
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,511
I'm not leaving until you
hear what I have to say.

1330
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:29,729
[soft piano music]

1331
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,558
Well, I guess I can't stop you.

1332
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:36,736
- [Janet very softly] Oh, my goodness.
- [John sighs]

1333
01:09:36,737 --> 01:09:39,696
Listen, Abbie,

1334
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,960
I know I should have told
you about myself earlier.

1335
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:44,570
But when I first got here,

1336
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:46,224
I was just trying to
have a look at the town

1337
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:48,966
to see if it might be a
suitable place for us to settle.

1338
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:53,362
Yes, we were looking for a
building to house our team.

1339
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:54,928
But I had absolutely no idea

1340
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:57,017
that Mr. Blake was
looking at your building.

1341
01:09:57,018 --> 01:10:00,412
It's just one of many
properties that he controls.

1342
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,458
There are other ice rinks
that are just as good,

1343
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:06,027
and I promise I would never
put you out of business.

1344
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,640
Then why didn't you come
clean about who you were?

1345
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:12,598
Do you think I was

1346
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:15,558
in for your money or
your social status?

1347
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,690
- Do you really think I'm that shallow?
- [John] No.

1348
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:20,389
Oh, absolutely
not. Of course not.

1349
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,695
I'm so sorry.

1350
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,959
[exhales and stutters] I just
didn't think it mattered.

1351
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,961
I mean, the further
along things went,

1352
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:30,529
the less I cared about
that part of my life.

1353
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:34,578
Prince John, it, it,
it became a liability.

1354
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,887
I don't know, a title that
could just trip things up.

1355
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:45,371
I kind of like just being
run-of-the-mill John.

1356
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,028
Yeah, well, I did too.

1357
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:00,691
[John] Please.

1358
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:03,433
Don't let us end this way.

1359
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:05,739
We've come this far...

1360
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:10,004
and I never thought that
I'd say this, but...

1361
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:13,050
[sighs]

1362
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,182
I love you,

1363
01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:17,098
Ms. Abigail Simpson.

1364
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:21,364
And I believe that
you love me too.

1365
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:26,499
[Abigail] I don't know.

1366
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,372
With how things ended, I mean,

1367
01:11:30,503 --> 01:11:32,897
we're so far apart,
it's not even funny.

1368
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:35,421
You think so?

1369
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:39,685
Sometimes opposites do attract.

1370
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,993
But do they live
happily ever after?

1371
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,388
In fairy tales, they do.

1372
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:49,479
[sighs] Give us a chance.

1373
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:51,916
Another shot at the gold.

1374
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:55,093
Can't we just hit

We deserve a try, don't we?

1377
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:11,370
And how do you
propose to do that?

1378
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:16,592
Well, first,

1379
01:12:16,593 --> 01:12:19,159

never got a chance to finish.

1398
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,563
I mean, my stomach's in knots, my legs
feel like rubber and I'm scared to death.

1399
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:27,174

1407
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:43,625
I mean, what if I fail?
