1
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:53,681
Miss Yuan,

2
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,978
something is fishy.

3
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,120
12 bodies,

4
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,619
13 sets of DNA.

5
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,189
A flight attendant is missing.

6
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,839
According to our initial testing,

7
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,135
we found traces of ZPF on the uniform.

8
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,606
It is an advanced fabric

9
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,211
used only by U.S. paratroopers.

10
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,813
This is where we found

11
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,142
the missing DNA.

12
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,414
Please come this way.

13
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,316
Where's the car?

14
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,891
I have seen it.

15
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,538
I have a feeling something
big is coming down.

16
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,140
Anything else I should know about?

17
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,407
The radiation data is normal.

18
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,981
Send everything to the Blue House in Korea.

19
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,716
Also...

20
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,236
meet me at the airport right away.

21
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,992
Xiao Zhang, I'm going abroad.

22
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,585
There are 9 of you. I'm counting to 9.

23
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,292
If nobody opens the door
to the isolation room,

24
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,068
I'll kill all of you.

25
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,599
<i>1</i>

26
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,338
2

27
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,268
You came to the wrong place.

28
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,349
The cubes infused are not
in the isolation room.

29
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,837
Don't give me that.

30
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,641
Now there are <i>7</i> of you left.

31
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,545
I'll count to 7.

32
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,219
<i>1</i>

33
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,577
2

34
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,223
Don't kill me. I know where they are.

35
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,726
We're 30 minutes late.

36
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,126
Lieutenant Park,

37
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,065
we can't wait any longer.

38
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,970
Give him <i>5</i> more minutes.

39
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,056
It's time. Shall we start'?

40
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,889
Go ahead.

41
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,963
Where is Papa?

42
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,326
Hold him for me.

43
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,175
Min Ho,

44
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,519
we're about to start.

45
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,517
Let's go.

46
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:03,423
Happy birthday to you...

47
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,257
Happy birthday to Myeong Gun.

48
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,734
Happy birthday m you.

49
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,131
Please blow the candle...

50
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,358
Sir.

51
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,557
Didn't we say tomorrow morning?

52
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,290
I'm sorry, Mrs. Choi.

53
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,228
Time is tighter than expected.

54
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,802
You are crashing a banquet
you're not invited to.

55
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,607
Where are your manners?

56
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,367
Honey.

57
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,176
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,675
Please wait outside.

59
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,371
Yes, Sir.

60
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,096
Honey.

61
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,166
Before we got married,

62
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,207
I knew what you have done for the country.

63
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,416
I meant to give this to you tomorrow.

64
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,620
Make sure you bring this back.

65
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,226
Don't worry about us.

66
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,790
Take care of Myeong Gun.

67
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,796
Professor,

68
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,265
the Police need your help.

69
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,876
Mr. Lee,

70
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,384
we're not yet done with the drill.

71
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,214
What's the drill for?

72
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,324
Why me?

73
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,056
I'll level with you, Mr. Lee.

74
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,427
I don't like working with your department.

75
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,134
Everything is confidential.

76
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,704
How can I work with you
when I don't know anything?

77
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,430
Right?

78
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,475
The NIS

79
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,702
suspect their most wanted criminal,

80
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,344
a man called Helios,

81
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,411
and his assistant The Messenger

82
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,045
have stolen cubes and a mobile device.

83
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,754
According to the intel intercepted by MI6,

84
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,089
the device will change hands in Hong Kong.

85
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,563
The specialists from Korea
are on their way here.

86
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,295
Now you know what I know
and it'll stay that way.

87
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,803
This is all confidential.

88
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,011
You have a right to know
since we recruited you.

89
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,672
You're only a physics professor,

90
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,840
not Snowden.

91
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,029
Wait for me over there.

92
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,796
Sorry.

93
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,752
Colonel Choi,

94
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,955
thank you for your help.

95
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,564
It's my honor.

96
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,704
We're still waiting for someone.

97
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,602
Here...

98
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,123
Colonel Choi,

99
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,825
thank you for your help.

100
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,142
I heard today was your son's birthday.

101
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,169
I sent a gift over to your house.

102
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,298
You're very kind.

103
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,010
I've checked up on you.

104
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,673
Honestly,

105
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,545
I must apologize to your family
on behalf of my father.

106
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,549
This country is heavily in your debt.

107
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,426
I don't know what to say.

108
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:15,764
<i>Woo Chem is one oi our finest agents.</i>

109
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,366
He will protect you.

110
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,369
Work with each other and come home safely.

111
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,674
I'm entrusting the safety of this country

112
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:34,417
and the entire northeast
Asia in your hands.

113
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,753
We'll do our best.

114
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,099
Mr. Lee.

115
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,903
Please put your mobile phone
and personal belongings here.

116
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,935
Thank you.

117
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,578
Over there.

118
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,948
This is CIF' Wong Kin Chung.

119
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,457
In addition to me,

120
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,151
he will also liaise with the running of
the task force.

121
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,298
All of you,

122
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,465
these buyers are sneaky.

123
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,461
We have zeroed in on two locations.

124
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,264
CIB is already at work.

125
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,349
But before we head out,

126
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,272
I'd like to hear the assessment of
the Hospital Authority.

127
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,341
Mr. Wong,

128
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,308
according to your initial risk assessment,

129
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,880
it's an overload on our health care system,

130
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,641
but we'll do our best.

131
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,787
The paperwork from Customs is almost ready.

132
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,014
50 swimming pools under LCSD

133
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,179
are ready.

134
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,293
The Fire Department doesn't have enough
manpower and equipment.

135
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,396
We'll work with whatever
the Force can give us.

136
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,225
All I can say is...

137
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,958
we'll do our best.

138
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,096
Is it that bad?

139
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,703
You knew when you came to me.

140
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,340
It'll only get worse.

141
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,137
Anymore input?

142
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,305
Hello,

143
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,915
I'm the consultant on this task force.

144
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,676
I'm Professor Siu Chi Yan.

145
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,081
Judging from these pictures,

146
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,520
you're treating this like Daya Bay.

147
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,886
Good thinking.

148
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,053
DC8 is a portable weapon developed by
the Koreans unilaterally.

149
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,893
We have no clue how powerful it is.

150
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,227
I personally think,

151
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,529
it's an extremely deadly device.

152
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,168
If our friends from the Hong Kong Police

153
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,467
are confident they can stop this deal,

154
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,474
let me give you some friendly advice.

155
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,793
During the interception,

156
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,404
do not shoot the weapon.

157
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,175
Nobody knows what will happen.

158
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,079
It'll impact its stability
to say the least.

159
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,548
Once you intercept it,

160
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,279
ship it out at once.

161
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,252
For the sake of the safety
of Hong Kong citizens,

162
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,951
DC8 must go.

163
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,419
Forget detonation.

164
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,598
Even a simple leak

165
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,462
given the current setup and training,

166
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,331
Hung Kong simply cannot handle it.

167
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,296
If shit happens

168
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,741
and someone is held accountable,

169
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,309
it'll entail more than you saying

170
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,206
we'll do our best

171
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,813
and a job transfer.

172
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,143
Start Beep 2.

173
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:28,809
According to the international Covenant, you can't
have access to both sets of activation codes.

174
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,956
Woo Cheol, you'll keep one set.

175
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,689
I sent the other set

176
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,554
to our agent stationed
in Hong Kong.

177
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:42,825
She knows her way around and will
contact you upon your arrival.

178
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,725
Yes, Sir.

179
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,539
Nice to meet you.

180
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,370
He's with the Hong Kong Police.

181
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,539
Welcome to Hong Kong.

182
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,051
Watch what you say.

183
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,382
Fan Ka Ming, CTRU.

184
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,886
Mr. Fan, I'm Choi Min Ho from NIS.

185
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,554
This is agent Park Woo Cheol.

186
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,223
You are welcome. Please come this way.

187
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,033
According the U.S. and U.K. intel,

188
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,644
and our own investigation,

189
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,007
we believe the deal

190
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,581
will take place in 3 hours.

191
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,009
Excuse me.

192
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,751
Hello?

193
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,220
General Lee told me to contact you.

194
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,088
Listen, I just got a reliable tip:

195
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,456
The buyers changed the venue

196
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,098
to a parking lot in Tsim Sha Tsui.

197
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,431
Okay,

198
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,263
thank you.

199
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:27,802
Hello?

200
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,962
Mr. Fan, I just found out

201
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,201
the venue was changed to
Tak Hing Street in Jordan.

202
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,917
Mr. Lee, we'll be ready in 10 minutes.

203
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
Mr. Fan, this is...

204
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,925
You're Choi Min Ho?

205
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,968
You look younger in the picture.

206
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,995
Did you just call me?

207
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,369
General Lee called me

208
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:42,343
and wanted me to drop
everything at the magazine.

209
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,375
I'm Agent Sin Mi Kyung of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs,

210
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm sorry, but how old are you?

211
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,204
It's because of your reputation
that you haven't been frisked.

212
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,535
Thank you.

213
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,807
But I don't know who the fuck she is.

214
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,018
You have your bodyguards, I have mine.

215
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,086
I don't trust your bodyguard.

216
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,995
I don't like strangers.

217
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,434
Not even my reputation?

218
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,350
Do you mind'?

219
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,590
Stop.

220
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,681
Not until I see what's in the box.

221
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,183
No money, no box.

222
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,215
Whose fucking rules are you playing by?

223
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,689
My fucking rules.

224
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,961
10% to anyone who opens the box.

225
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:55,166
My business, only one rule counts.

226
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,872
The highest bidder wins.

227
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,505
I already have someone
offering more than you.

228
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:07,742
If it wasn't for your reputation,
I would not be here.

229
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:12,053
Or perhaps I was misinformed.

230
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,090
Trooper Ready.

231
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,749
Ranger Ready.

232
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,792
Unicorn Ready.

233
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,053
Action.

234
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,643
Take the Boss.

235
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,010
Go and check that out.

236
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,016
Get the guns.

237
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,120
Back out. Back out.

238
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,428
Officer down. They outgun us.

239
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,999
We need backup.

240
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,029
Frankie.

241
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,178
Mr. Fan, please allow Woo Cheol
to join in the action.

242
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,043
As observers, you have
no jurisdiction here.

243
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,245
Does that matter? What
if something goes wrong?

244
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,048
Tam, keep an eye on them!

245
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,089
Yes, Sir! Please stay back.

246
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,997
Stop.

247
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,635
Go.

248
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,346
Four officers down.

249
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,212
Get them out.

250
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,876
Frankie, cover me.

251
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,032
Freeze.

252
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,540
The cops are here.

253
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,415
Lower your weapon.

254
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,111
Withdraw.

255
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,097
Hit the ground! 9 o'clock, cover me.

256
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,968
Run.

257
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,452
Grenade.

258
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,212
Fuck you.

259
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,538
Freeze.

260
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,922
Run.

261
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,930
Watch out.

262
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,496
Colonel Choi,

263
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,037
the weapon was hit. It fell on the ground.

264
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,236
Yes,

265
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,410
it was hit.

266
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,953
Let's do it.

267
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:21,101
Eyes are connected to the NIS office.

268
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,704
We can start.

269
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,771
November 6, Hung Kong 06:10.

270
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,407
Choi Min Ho of NIS to
authenticate the weapon.

271
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,759
Weapon in question

272
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,397
is placed inside a brown leather bag.

273
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,930
We must separate the weapon from the bag

274
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,068
in order to authenticate the weapon.

275
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,414
Before you saw the weapon,

276
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,610
you refused to assess its power.

277
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,921
If anything goes wrong with the weapon,

278
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,599
everything you see now will all disappear.

279
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,203
Judging from the appearance,

280
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:34,001
the device is a 90% look-alike
of the DOB prototype.

281
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,841
It appears the device
has not been activated.

282
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,314
To play it safe,

283
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,250
I suggest we authenticate it online.

284
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,522
I agree.

285
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,093
Wait.

286
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,488
Except for online,

287
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,633
there's no other way to authenticate it?

288
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,792
Mr. Choi, the notification from NIS

289
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,337
never mentioned authentication meant
activation of the weapon.

290
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,496
Mr. Lee,

291
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,665
if this device is a fake,

292
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,005
going online will do no harm.

293
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,708
If this is indeed our missing device,

294
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,267
I can use the activation procedure

295
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,117
to reset ii to shutdown mode.

296
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:24,224
It's definitely safer than doing nothing.

297
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,699
Mr. Choi, I agree you should proceed
with authentication.

298
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,862
The Police escort motorcade
is ready to leave

299
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,703
once authentication is complete.

300
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,078
Confirming mobile device DC8.

301
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,224
We begin authentication procedure.

302
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,059
The computer confirms this device

303
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:41,670
is the DC8 prototype that was missing
16 hours ago.

304
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,002
Activate selection mode.

305
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,544
We have chosen "termination" mode.

306
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,620
First online authentication
of DC8 complete.

307
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:15,295
Built in CPU is linked up to tablet PC.

308
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,767
Terminate detonation complete.

309
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,173
Good work.

310
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:34,548
Didn't expect our countries to team up
in this regard.

311
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,790
Indeed.

312
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,493
Task force is ready

313
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,757
to move the weapon.

314
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,883
How did it go, Mr. Choi?

315
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,829
We have confirmed this
is our missing device.

316
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,229
The motorcade is ready.

317
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,593
Thank you.

318
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,365
Sorry, the weapon stays here.

319
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,585
Mr. Song?

320
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,194
You're making my life difficult!

321
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,261
Really?

322
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,897
Definitely.

323
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,932
The Koreans authenticated that thing.

324
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,102
Why won't you let them take it away?

325
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,834
This is not Lost & Found.

326
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,167
It's a matter of national security.

327
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,681
I need you to work with me.

328
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,343
If you keep the weapon in Hong Kong,

329
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,920
how can I work with you on that?

330
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,299
Mr. Lee,

331
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,837
there are certain things,

332
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,202
because of your rank,

333
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,741
I'm unable to share with you.

334
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,577
Why?

335
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,917
Like I said, it's a matter
of national security.

336
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,725
China and the U.S. don't see
eye to eye on many issues.

337
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:53,328
I'm sure you know that I believe...

338
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,798
the situation will change after this.

339
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,298
The Koreans confirmed the weapon

340
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,804
and reset ii to safety mode, right?

341
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,004
Just help me keep an eye on it.

342
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,837
I don't want any screw up.

343
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,722
This is 300m from the intel center
and 500m underground.

344
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,619
It's the safest place for your weapon.

345
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,420
For now, we can only use wireless radio
to communicate.

346
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,378
This is outrageous.

347
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,651
Why can't we ship the weapon home?

348
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,252
We're under house arrest?

349
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,719
The Security Bureau

350
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,551
has spoken to the Director of NIS earlier.

351
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,557
That's bullshit.

352
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,923
NIS never agreed to let you

353
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,462
detain the weapon.

354
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,794
We're going by the law, Mr. Consul.

355
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,528
What law is that?

356
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,706
The Central People's Government
shall be responsible for

357
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,035
the foreign affairs relating to the HKSAR.

358
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,872
Article 13 of the Hong Kong Basic Law.

359
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:25,214
The International Law should be
applied in an international incident.

360
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,413
Please calm down, Mr. Consul.

361
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,251
We're looking at the big picture.

362
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,757
Shipping it out is the right thing to do.

363
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,920
But going by the Basic
Law is not wrong either.

364
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:51,004
Is that his idea?

365
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,546
Pardon me.

366
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,479
Can I just say something?

367
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,686
Don't forget you're from Hong Kong.

368
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,425
As a physics consultant,

369
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,587
technically, we're
detaining a mobile weapon

370
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,223
that the Koreans have
unilaterally declared safe.

371
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,534
Do you know how dangerous that is?

372
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,499
We know it's a weapon of mass destruction.

373
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,641
Why do you want to keep it?

374
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,538
It doesn't make sense.

375
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,309
Except for political reasons

376
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,811
I see no other reason for it.

377
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,113
Will you do something so stupid?

378
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,423
This is not the first time I worked
with civil servants,

379
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,743
but this is the first time I get to see

380
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,560
how members of this so-called task force...

381
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,594
before and after this gentleman showed up,

382
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,758
your attitude did an about-turn.

383
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,302
Professor.

384
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,932
Hold on.

385
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,099
Would you like to hear
what Mr. Song has to say?

386
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,548
After the proper diplomatic mediation,

387
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,853
the weapon will be escorted out of
Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Police

388
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:10,186
and our Ministries of Foreign Affairs
will handle the handover.

389
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,289
This is it.

390
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,953
Just like that?

391
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,639
Whose side are you on?

392
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,172
It's not about taking sides.

393
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,570
It's always about taking sides.

394
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,010
It's whether or not you have a conscience.

395
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,905
Don't forget...

396
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,214
you're from Hong Kong too.

397
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,246
I'm only following my orders.

398
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,556
No one has used that tone with you before.

399
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,597
Still pissed?

400
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:54,961
No.

401
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,640
Mr. Lee told me

402
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,333
all members of the task force

403
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,244
must stay at the intel center

404
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,880
until this whole thing blows over.

405
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,183
But he was the first one to leave.
How irresponsible.

406
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,550
And that Professor...

407
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,190
You call this a task force?

408
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,987
What a joke.

409
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,728
Shall we have a little pep talk?

410
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,874
Can I help you, sir?

411
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,517
Eric Lee to see Martin Koo.

412
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,354
What's so urgent?

413
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,786
You must have heard about.

414
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,423
Tsim Sha Tsui last night.

415
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,060
How bad was it'!

416
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,127
We intercepted a weapon
of mass destruction.

417
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,795
It's in a vault.

418
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,398
Helios?

419
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,370
Tell me all you know.

420
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,973
Everybody out.

421
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,616
For the past decades, the U.S.
has always objected to

422
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,121
any weapon development by other countries,

423
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,481
all in the good name of
maintaining international order,

424
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,061
when in fact, it boils down to protecting
their own vested interests.

425
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,822
You won't give it, but people want it.

426
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,329
It's all a matter of supply and demand.

427
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:31,796
Spare me the political analysis.

428
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,958
Can you make contact?

429
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,968
You already have the weapon,

430
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,834
why do you need to contact him?

431
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,339
The U.K. and the U.S. are
pointing fingers at us,

432
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,509
but Hong Kong is unusually quiet.

433
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,147
No news is good news.

434
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,682
There's something wrong
when everybody shuts up.

435
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,078
You have any idea how many
eyeballs are on Helios?

436
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,849
I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you.

437
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:19,981
Take off your shoes.

438
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,878
I'm sorry.

439
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,409
Forget it.

440
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,556
Of course not.

441
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,724
We haven't been properly introduced.

442
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,723
Song An.

443
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,058
Song as in the dynasty, An as in saddle.

444
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,529
This is my assistant Yuan Xiaowen.

445
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:46,536
You understand Putonghua?

446
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,845
Thank you.

447
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,256
Nice tea. It hits the spot.

448
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,923
I know you're a busy man,

449
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,122
but I didn't know you're that busy.

450
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:14,930
But still, please keep an eye on DC8.

451
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:20,841
Its safety is very crucial to what
we're about to do.

452
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:27,081
Eric Lee promised me I could freely come
and go at the intel center.

453
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,750
As for how often I check DC8,

454
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,554
I don't need you to tell me.

455
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,190
Of course.

456
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:42,263
Hung Kong is the intel
center in the Far East,

457
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:46,560
but ii has never been under attack, right?

458
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:51,473
I want to keep it that way.

459
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,132
I'm sure you do too.

460
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:07,848
I chose to settle the matter
via diplomatic channels.

461
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:13,293
First, I want Korea to review the situation

462
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,626
and find out why their security system
is so fragile.

463
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,870
Second, I want the buyers to realize
the odds and back off.

464
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,967
What do you think?

465
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:29,176
Arms dealing in the black market
is only a form of smuggling.

466
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,411
It hardly qualifies as terrorism.

467
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:35,483
But we must take precautions.

468
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,416
If these people choose to do
their business in Hong Kong,

469
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,021
I want to send them a message.
Where are we?

470
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,721
Hong Kong,

471
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,558
it's part of China.

472
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:49,329
To oppose Hong Kong is to oppose China.

473
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,430
Do you understand?

474
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,506
When you came in,

475
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,245
you must have seen the placards outside.

476
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,050
Like I always tell my students,

477
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,311
we must defend one core value:

478
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,616
To respect people's freedom of speech.

479
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,830
Have some tea, Mr. Song.

480
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,178
A gentleman can agree to disagree.

481
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,414
I don't think your way

482
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,676
is the only way to keep Hong Kong safe.

483
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,886
You must have your doubts, Professor.

484
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,017
Tell me how this sounds to you...

485
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,657
The safety of a region

486
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,702
in terms of the overall interests of
the whole country

487
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,130
will crash and kill if you fail to manage
it properly.

488
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,839
My job is to ensure the safety of your car

489
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,577
as well as the citizens of Hong Kong.

490
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,409
How does that sound to you?

491
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,714
Mr. Song,

492
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,581
I'm afraid your methods

493
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,227
are not quite in sync with
international convention.

494
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,088
Really?

495
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,295
It appears to me.

496
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:36,468
Mr. Lee found the right man.

497
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,343
Scholars can be such a pain.

498
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,017
Are you sorry for what you've done?

499
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,017
I wouldn't have come if I wanted to escape.

500
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,917
The deal should have happened already.

501
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,220
The weapon is in a very safe place.

502
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:35,926
Yeah, in the hands of the fucking Police.

503
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,762
My brother died because of you.

504
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:49,777
Mr. Big, we all know the risk in
this line of business.

505
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:57,042
We stole the device and
cubes from two Koreas.

506
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:03,124
It's my responsibility to make sure your
weapon is fully operational.

507
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:06,050
It hasn't changed.

508
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,289
DC8 is the smallest weapon ever built.

509
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,870
It's an unprecedented
breakthrough in physics.

510
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,932
Without proper activation,

511
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:22,039
DC8 is no more valuable than dog shit.

512
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,509
Then let's kidnap another fucking
scientist, activate the bomb now.

513
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,647
There are only five
scientists in all of Korea

514
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:34,187
who have the expertise
to activate this device.

515
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,858
So it needs to be done delicately.

516
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,926
Why the fuck didn't you
tell me (his beforehand?

517
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,259
The less everyone knew the better,

518
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:52,831
which was fine until the bastard Chinese
governor Song screwed everything up.

519
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,541
Helios has never been caught before that.

520
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,745
I don't want that to change now.

521
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,506
We're all working for
the Majesty, isn't it?

522
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,743
We help your organization
get what you want:

523
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,549
The power to play god.

524
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,752
Don't let my brother's death be in vain.

525
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,132
How much time do we have?

526
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,865
30 minutes.

527
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,080
How many in your party?

528
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,683
Sophia.

529
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:37,010
You're so thin. Have you eaten?

530
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,309
Of course not.

531
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,013
Come.

532
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:47,881
How are you?

533
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,388
Good.

534
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:51,217
And you?

535
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,051
Here...

536
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,491
Of all the godsons,

537
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,929
only you would buy me pills for my stomach.

538
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:01,932
Still don't want money for it?

539
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,094
I got paid already.

540
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,442
Here...

541
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,870
What would you like?

542
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,449
Pig knuckles. On a hot plate.

543
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,237
I've been keeping tabs on you.

544
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,879
That's why I tell the boys...

545
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,717
Don't go to Hong Kong this week.

546
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,134
I quit.

547
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,504
You still have my stuff?

548
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,787
Shit.

549
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,723
You're going to war?

550
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,698
Are you guys hungry'?

551
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:04,879
I think your companions don't like
to mingle with people like us.

552
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:07,913
Not at all.

553
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,285
Please don't take any offense.

554
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,823
They're both afraid of large crowds.

555
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,997
Call it middle-aged shyness if you like.

556
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:21,767
Is the weapon safe? Is it still stable?

557
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:25,804
I heard it had sustained
considerable damage last night.

558
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:28,639
I'm impressed by your intel.

559
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:34,539
Intel is my trade. You know I'm the best.

560
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,575
They're paying a lot of money

561
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,947
for the cop who killed the brother.

562
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:45,850
If I can get information on who the cop is,

563
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,287
can you tell me more about Helios?

564
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:55,631
Allow me and my business to offer you
and your boys a little friendly advice.

565
00:59:56,293 --> 01:00:00,605
Do not turn Hong Kong into a battlefield.

566
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,640
I don't care how you do it.

567
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:09,011
Get this bomb out of my
city as soon as possible.

568
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,217
You got it?

569
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,297
Please take a look at this.

570
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:25,296
What is it?

571
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,958
You wanted me to dig up
everything on Helios.

572
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,009
The Japanese Imperial Household Agency
gave him that name.

573
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:38,174
12 years ago, someone broke into
the Imperial Palace in Tokyo

574
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,145
and stole one of the three
Imperial Regalia of Japan,

575
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,841
the jewel Yasakani no Magatama.

576
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,452
He became an international arms dealer
after he left Japan.

577
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,247
The U.S. suspects he has,
over the past decade,

578
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,358
orchestrated at least 3 arms deals in Asia.

579
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,426
He managed to getaway every time.

580
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,456
It's possible Hong Kong
is one of his bases.

581
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:00,932
With someone good at attack,
his enemy won't know what to defend.

582
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,469
With someone good at defense,
his enemy won't know what to attack.

583
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,171
You mean...

584
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,839
Tell the weapon experts in Beijing to
stand by and be prepared to come at once.

585
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,260
We have some information
from the CIA regarding Middle East.

586
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:35,264
They have got some mass destructive weapon
they are using against civilians.

587
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,668
This is all the information we received.

588
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:38,601
Excuse me.

589
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:39,638
No problem.

590
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:48,739
Eric, someone is rounding
up firearms in Macau

591
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,044
and shipping them to Hong Kong.

592
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,105
Something came up at the university.

593
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,003
Can I call my secretary Angela?

594
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,507
Hurry.

595
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,972
Put it through.

596
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,922
Mr. Fan, we're underground.
Can you hear me?

597
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,458
Go ahead.

598
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,252
Good.

599
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,397
We'll start the safety check.

600
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:57,808
Mr. Fan, I have a reading of 1250 msv.

601
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,384
My assistant is down.

602
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,953
Call the Fire Department
and get an ambulance right away.

603
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,112
Do you COPY?

604
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,781
Tracy, call the Fire Department
and get an ambulance right away.

605
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,017
Yes, sir.

606
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,253
Have you contacted Colonel Choi?

607
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:35,845
Their phones are off.

608
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,288
Control is trying to locate them.

609
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,563
Here's a graphite case

610
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,164
that can last 3 hours.

611
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,927
I have another one.

612
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:48,829
As soon as you find them,

613
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,232
ship this thing out right away.

614
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,499
It's not going anywhere.

615
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:55,675
This weapon is leaking.

616
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,903
Do you care about the lives
of Hong Kong people?

617
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,546
This is precisely what I'm doing.

618
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,181
Have you forgotten what I told you?

619
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,549
Mr. Fan, I don't care anymore.

620
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:06,881
There's nothing I can do.

621
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,216
The weapon specialists from Beijing
will be here soon.

622
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,552
If the professor doesn't want to help us,

623
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,251
and I mean "if",

624
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,729
give us a bit more time
and we can take over.

625
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,428
Ridiculous.

626
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,632
- Professor.
- Shui up.

627
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,368
- I know.
- Enough.

628
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,545
I can't accept him.

629
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,048
I can't work with him.

630
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,208
I know.

631
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:39,953
So stubborn!

632
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,460
Sorry, we're closed. Come back at 6.

633
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,371
Are those the books for the restaurant
or from the arms deals?

634
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,385
How long has it been?

635
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,616
Almost 20 years.

636
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,091
The day you opened this joint,

637
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,730
I didn't have time to drop by.

638
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,430
You head up a department now?

639
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:04,171
And I thought you had retired.

640
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,499
You know I always do the cooking.

641
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,335
Let's cut to the chase.

642
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,177
How nice of you to drop by. Have you eaten?

643
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,215
Let me fix you something.

644
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,390
Sit down.

645
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:36,693
Two nights ago, we busted an arms deal.

646
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:40,299
Both parties should be rather antsy by now.

647
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,174
My informer tells me

648
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,575
the buyer is so pissed

649
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,982
he ordered firearms from Macau

650
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:50,718
to go to war with the Hong Kong Police.

651
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,556
I can only think of you,

652
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,050
who can fill such a huge order in Macau.

653
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,894
Where is Helios?

654
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,743
Mr. Lee,

655
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,581
you lost me.

656
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,219
I'll make it simple for you.

657
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:37,087
After I stepped inside this restaurant,

658
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:41,462
nothing in here belongs to you anymore.

659
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,597
Including your life.

660
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,885
You work hard

661
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:04,882
to give your family the good life, right?

662
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:15,233
If you touch my granddaughter,
I guarantee you'll die horribly.

663
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,004
If you come with me quietly,

664
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,635
I guarantee your family will be safe.

665
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,805
They're taking Sophia to Hong Kong.

666
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,850
Once she gets inside that car,

667
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:32,145
she'll be blamed for any deal
that goes sour from now on.

668
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,548
She will never tell on us.

669
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,688
It's the rule, what we believe

670
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,085
is not what other people will believe.

671
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,422
When she decided to go with Eric Lee,

672
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,757
she was prepared to die.

673
01:11:57,213 --> 01:11:58,851
Don'! Move!

674
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,898
Calm down, Mr. Lee.

675
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,339
Take her away.

676
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,187
Sin Mi Kyung, since we left the temple,

677
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:01,583
you wanted us to keep our phones off

678
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,417
and took us around in circles.

679
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,784
What's going on?

680
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,267
Our DC8

681
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,425
has alerted the UK, US, China

682
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,433
and half of Middle East.

683
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:22,473
Because it's detained,
they say in addition to Helios,

684
01:13:22,632 --> 01:13:26,079
at least 3 other parties will launch
a terrorist attack on Hong Kong.

685
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,511
If we hand over the cop
who killed the Middle Eastern buyer,

686
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,948
they'll tell us where to find Helios.

687
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,253
That's simple enough.

688
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,225
Explain to Inspector Fan,

689
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,087
and tell him to do the trade.
What's the problem?

690
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,297
Are you suggesting we betray
the Hong Kong Police?

691
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,304
Use Inspector Fan to exchange
for unconfirmed intel?

692
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,745
Inspector Fan is a cop.

693
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,719
He should be prepared
to die for his country.

694
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:14,191
If I were in his shoes,

695
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,452
I would have done the same at all costs.

696
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,266
This is not about trading
one life for another.

697
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,561
This is about trustworthiness.

698
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,633
What you're doing is
no different from those criminals.

699
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,210
Sacrificing one life

700
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,454
can save many others.

701
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:43,089
Didn't you say we must get the weapon back?

702
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,690
Even by force?

703
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,292
I have deployed my men.

704
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:48,129
Why are you so indecisive all of a sudden?

705
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,130
I only told you to get ready

706
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,662
just in case.

707
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,095
Just in case?

708
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,800
If the informer is reliable,

709
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,507
we missed Helios by a few inches.

710
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,304
We would have

711
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,380
let the generals down.

712
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,408
How can you face them?

713
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,114
Hold on.

714
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,217
Can I say something?

715
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:22,056
Colonel Choi, your decision is immature.

716
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,043
Turn your phones back on.

717
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:46,680
There's something wrong with your weapon.

718
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,015
Everyone must report back
to the intel center.

719
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:02,569
Chinese weapon experts are coming to
Hong Kong, arriving in 30 minutes.

720
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,938
I'm sending you a file.

721
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,040
When you see the breaking news,
forward it 10 CTRU.

722
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,381
When the Hong Kong Police intercepted DC8,

723
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:22,716
we have examined it carefully.

724
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,256
The bullet did not damage the inside.

725
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:29,093
After authentication,
we activated the insulation mode.

726
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,492
It's impossible to have a radiation leak.

727
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,600
You're saying...

728
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:39,800
The Professor is helping us.

729
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,490
We sent her blood sample to the lab.

730
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,567
We'll know in 8 hours

731
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,762
if she's the missing flight attendant.

732
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,708
Drink some water.

733
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:40,590
How old are you?

734
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:43,753
24?

735
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,726
26?

736
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,599
You should be sensible.

737
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,241
You still have a choice.

738
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,007
Either,

739
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,583
a life sentence,

740
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,246
<i>or,</i>

741
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,354
help us find your boss.

742
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,291
Forget about turning state witness
and a reduced sentence.

743
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:21,294
You squeal on him and you walk.

744
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,293
I'll send you wherever you want to go.

745
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,498
Mr. Lee.

746
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,668
Think ii over.

747
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,396
We're at the race track right now.

748
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,001
Allegedly, there was an
explosion 20 minutes ago.

749
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,865
Over 20 people were injured.

750
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:34,303
The bomb squad has been
summoned to the scene.

751
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,500
As you can see, many racing fans...

752
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,674
Somewhere on the stand behind me

753
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,715
exploded.

754
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,549
This is just the beginning.

755
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:55,059
Hand over the weapon and
the hostage in an hour

756
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:58,790
to Causeway Bay on your own,

757
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,458
or else start preparing
for massive casualties.

758
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,505
If you wish,

759
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:11,270
with an invitation from
your Chief Executive,

760
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,240
our PLA in the Hong Kong
Garrison can be deployed.

761
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:18,908
Do you realize you're out of control?

762
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,553
Listen...

763
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,946
before you have a grasp on what's going on,

764
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:26,025
we have already declared war on Helios.

765
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:27,587
If you compromise,

766
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,821
he'll turn Hong Kong into

767
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,828
a hub for arms deal.

768
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,227
You want that?

769
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:37,269
Hold on a second. I actually
got another solution.

770
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,660
According to my informer,

771
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,428
he can give me the whereabouts of Helios

772
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,773
if we give him the officer

773
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:45,339
who shot the Middle Eastern buyer,

774
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:47,514
who happens to be Inspector Fan.

775
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:51,375
Is your informer clean?

776
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,515
He was the one

777
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,781
who told us the location of
the deal two nights ago.

778
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,582
I killed the guy.

779
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:03,796
I don't really mean to hand you over.

780
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,929
But if we make contact,

781
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,796
maybe we can find Helios.

782
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,304
Can you manage?

783
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,634
Sure.

784
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,375
- Wai Yip.
- Yes.

785
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:20,494
Get <i>2</i> teams ready to go
with me for the handover.

786
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,981
Yes, Sir.

787
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,641
Professor, Mr. Choi,

788
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:28,015
please double check DC8.

789
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,626
Where are we going?

790
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,627
We're going to Macau.

791
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,847
Thank you, Professor.

792
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:30,983
For what?

793
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,176
I come from a family of scientists.

794
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,046
I'm willing to swear by my family

795
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,621
and my brother's name

796
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,258
this is the safest weapon ever built.

797
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:42,159
I already told Eric Lee.

798
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:45,796
I'll leave after debriefing
you upon your return.

799
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,392
The sooner DC8 leaves,

800
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,161
the sooner Hong Kong will be safe.

801
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,132
Do what you have to do

802
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,137
and you'll be doing us a favor.

803
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,683
Even inside the graphite case,

804
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,515
absolutely no more collision.

805
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,749
Handle it with your utmost care.

806
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,282
Lieutenant Park,

807
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,122
I have something to do. I need your help.

808
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:50,262
Yes, Sir.

809
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:51,921
Mr. Choi.

810
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,025
Stay calm.

811
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,996
Any monkey business from you,

812
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:28,126
and you're the first one I'll shoot.

813
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:49,747
Saad.

814
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,378
Saad, I brought them here.

815
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:54,548
Saad.

816
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:39,762
Say it.

817
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:40,899
Change location.

818
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,969
Sunshine Plaza on Jaffe Road in Wanchai.

819
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,532
Listen up everyone, new location.

820
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:51,678
Sunshine Plaza on Jaffe Road in Wanchai.

821
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:05,380
Go around it.

822
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:07,185
Stay close to her.

823
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,346
Lock down the building.

824
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,851
The hell with procedure.
Shoot her on sight.

825
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,386
Yes, Sir!

826
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:20,931
Can you talk?

827
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,931
I'm still in Macau.

828
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,029
The informer is dead. We have trouble.

829
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,168
But don't worry about me.

830
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:31,268
How are things on your end?

831
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,672
We have DC8 now.

832
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:37,381
Professor Siu said the Korean consulate was
in an office building in Admiralty.

833
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,712
Sending the weapon over
there is too dangerous.

834
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,112
He gave us the address of a pier.

835
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:43,620
I'll text you later.

836
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:44,586
<i>Okay.</i>

837
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:47,784
I'll call Consul Kwon for back up,

838
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,986
and hurry back to Hong Kong.

839
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,424
But I'll be a bit late.

840
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:54,590
One more thing, it's very important.

841
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:56,598
I want you to spread the word.

842
01:29:56,758 --> 01:30:00,763
DC8 is back in our hands and we have left.

843
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:06,243
So no one will give Hong
Kong further trouble.

844
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:08,571
Will do.

845
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,919
Is this the right way?

846
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,894
We're almost there.

847
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:29,492
Something is not right.

848
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,164
Is this the right location?

849
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,264
Yes, according to the GPS.

850
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,299
Dodge.

851
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,275
Shit!

852
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,012
Who are these guys?

853
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:21,714
Let's split up.

854
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,446
No, we stick together.

855
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:45,536
Can you manage?

856
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,349
Go.

857
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:00,949
Colonel.

858
01:33:06,448 --> 01:33:08,086
Hang in there.

859
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:29,167
Colonel.

860
01:34:52,554 --> 01:34:54,124
Colonel.

861
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,642
This...

862
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,380
no hope.

863
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,046
Mission...

864
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:21,589
we must complete our mission.

865
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:25,226
Colonel.

866
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,297
Hang in there.

867
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:29,291
Hang in there, Colonel.

868
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,127
Buck up.

869
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:18,340
Mr. Song,

870
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:19,681
we checked.

871
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:21,377
Xiao Yuan is missing.

872
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,304
Wait!

873
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,375
Fan, we have a mole.

874
01:37:52,667 --> 01:37:54,010
Go check everyone's phone and email records

875
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:57,672
and their whereabouts after we left HQ.

876
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:30,744
Mr. Lee,

877
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,407
over these two days,

878
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,712
only Professor Siu had
made a call from here.

879
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:48,731
Hello, Angela? This is Professor Siu.

880
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,928
Do something for me.

881
01:38:51,826 --> 01:38:55,273
Ask Mr. Lee about the theses

882
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,034
by Year 3 students.

883
01:38:58,132 --> 01:38:59,475
Sorry.

884
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:01,375
Also, sort out

885
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,015
the papers on my desk.

886
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:07,675
I only want to keep nos.
5, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 18.

887
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,051
Toss the rest.

888
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,624
Ask Mr. Lee about the theses

889
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:15,920
by Year 3 students.

890
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:18,126
Also, sort out

891
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,321
the papers on my desk.

892
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:22,991
I only want to keep nos.
5, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 18.

893
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:24,602
Toss the rest.

894
01:39:45,713 --> 01:39:49,718
Ask Mr. Lee about the theses

895
01:39:49,884 --> 01:39:50,828
by Year 3 students.

896
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,658
Also, sort out

897
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,163
the papers on my desk.

898
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,997
I only want to keep nos.
5, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 18.

899
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,832
Toss the rest.

900
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:01,370
"Where's Mr. Lee now?"

901
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,304
Professor, the Police need your help.

902
01:40:07,535 --> 01:40:08,980
Everything is confidential.

903
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:11,480
How can I work with you
when I don't know anything?

904
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:14,085
For the sake of the safety
of Hong Kong citizens,

905
01:40:14,242 --> 01:40:16,415
DC8 must go.

906
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,250
The Koreans confirmed the weapon

907
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:20,221
and reset it to safety mode, right?

908
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,258
Just help me keep an eye on it.

909
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:23,758
This is all confidential,

910
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:25,898
Before you have a grasp on what's going on,

911
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,624
we have already declared war on Helios.

912
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:29,927
If you compromise,

913
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:32,435
he'll turn Hong Kong into

914
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:34,266
a hub for arms deal.

915
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:35,202
You want that?

916
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:39,038
Professor, Mr. Choi,
please double check DC8.

917
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:45,816
Do you need help?

918
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:46,917
No.

919
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:50,078
If I'm wrong, you can take the project
from my computer.

920
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:54,416
If I'm right, you can have my office.

921
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,748
Mr. Lee, do you need help?

922
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,140
Looking for me?

923
01:42:08,823 --> 01:42:11,599
14 years ago when I was transferred to
the Crime Unit,

924
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:15,539
my boss told me on my first case that.

925
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:17,699
Police officers were only human

926
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:21,169
and they would make mistakes.

927
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:25,544
He must have thought very highly of you.

928
01:42:27,341 --> 01:42:30,083
He wanted you to bust one of
your own on your first case.

929
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,450
But he picked the wrong guy.

930
01:42:38,386 --> 01:42:40,161
Why?

931
01:42:41,222 --> 01:42:45,170
I have a habit of suspecting everyone.

932
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:49,132
You must be very unpopular.

933
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:51,674
The worst.

934
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:55,579
I cracked the case and busted my boss.

935
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:59,147
Because he tried to make
his subordinates take the rap.

936
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:08,792
Since I came back from Macau,

937
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,227
I've been thinking...

938
01:43:12,153 --> 01:43:13,791
why...

939
01:43:14,822 --> 01:43:17,393
why is it whatever we do,

940
01:43:18,759 --> 01:43:20,932
Helios is always one step ahead of us.

941
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,575
Helios?

942
01:43:41,282 --> 01:43:44,593
The Americans and Koreans failed to
nail you all these years.

943
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,758
I feel so honored.

944
01:43:48,956 --> 01:43:51,334
You knew I was Helios,
and yet you came alone.

945
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:53,669
Song An is still around.

946
01:43:53,928 --> 01:43:55,874
No matter how certain I am,

947
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:58,633
I don't want him to crack this case.

948
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,175
Your personality is your downfall.

949
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,018
You want to be the Commissioner?

950
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,914
Him?

951
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:15,517
He was still copying my
homework in high school.

952
01:44:17,718 --> 01:44:19,322
But don't tell anyone.

953
01:44:24,225 --> 01:44:26,102
Why?

954
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:30,169
No reason.

955
01:44:30,865 --> 01:44:32,640
It's just a deal.

956
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:40,410
But...

957
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,947
you made one fatal mistake.

958
01:44:49,917 --> 01:44:52,056
You shouldn't have hit a woman.

959
01:44:55,156 --> 01:44:56,897
You better apologize.

960
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:18,538
Where's Myeong Gun?

961
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:25,883
Thank you very much, Colonel Choi.

962
01:47:27,007 --> 01:47:31,422
We should...

963
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:35,382
Good work.

964
01:47:35,749 --> 01:47:39,925
I'm sorry.

965
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:48,539
I failed to protect Woo Cheol.

966
01:47:50,998 --> 01:47:52,636
Colonel Choi,

967
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:58,167
thank you for your good work. Welcome home!

968
01:48:14,922 --> 01:48:19,268
Colonel Choi Min Ho reporting to

969
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:26,875
the General and NIS Director.

970
01:48:55,763 --> 01:48:57,538
Mr. Song, here's our findings.

971
01:48:57,698 --> 01:49:01,077
Professor Siu Chi Yan is
not Vietnamese Chinese.

972
01:49:01,502 --> 01:49:03,539
According to INTERPOL intel,

973
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:06,548
his 2 messengers and a black market buyer

974
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,550
called His Majesty

975
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:11,052
were last seen in Estonia.

976
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:12,713
This is where we suspect

977
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:15,587
they concluded the deal on DC8.

978
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:17,886
We analyzed the data.

979
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,087
Mr. Lee left us,

980
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:21,062
we believe Helios' next target

981
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,098
should be in Kyoto.

982
01:50:50,344 --> 01:50:56,659
The train for Demachiyanagi Station
is arriving on Platform 2.

983
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:14,744
Mr. Song, we're ready.

984
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:07,088
You know Italian too? How erudite.

985
01:52:17,464 --> 01:52:19,876
Almost didn't recognize
you without the vest.

986
01:52:22,803 --> 01:52:24,749
Professor, you're a hard man to track down.

987
01:52:26,073 --> 01:52:27,677
But you still found me.

988
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,446
Helios deserves his reputation.

989
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:38,723
You didn't come all this way
to give me a compliment.

990
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,956
We found the buyer.

991
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:45,827
Mr. Fan also helped me
find your assistants.

992
01:52:46,827 --> 01:52:48,966
They haven't contacted you for so long.

993
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:54,001
What if they betrayed you?

994
01:52:54,368 --> 01:52:56,644
We have something you don't.

995
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:58,912
It's called trust.

996
01:53:08,715 --> 01:53:11,457
You're harder to catch than I thought.

997
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:18,331
My messengers stole 16 cubes
from the ceramic factory.

998
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:22,433
If they don't call me within 20 minutes,

999
01:53:22,696 --> 01:53:25,700
the other cubes will be
detonated in Hong Kong.

1000
01:53:25,932 --> 01:53:28,173
There were no cubes, right?

1001
01:53:28,669 --> 01:53:31,013
When I accepted the order,

1002
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:32,878
I've been thinking

1003
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:36,879
where to crash

1004
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:40,456
that Korean plane carrying
the mobile device.

1005
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:48,460
With someone good at attack,
his enemy won't know what to defend.

1006
01:53:49,923 --> 01:53:55,498
With someone good at defense,
his enemy won't know what to attack.

1007
01:53:59,933 --> 01:54:01,970
How long has Xiao Yuan worked for you?
8 years?

1008
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:07,317
You haven't made contact for so long.
Don't you suspect her?

1009
01:54:10,043 --> 01:54:12,523
You have more than 2 messengers.

1010
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:39,715
"According to the assessment
by military specialists,"

1011
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:41,216
"detonating such a highly
concentrated cube"

1012
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:42,513
"can wipe out a radius of 300 km."

1013
01:54:42,676 --> 01:54:43,711
"Detonating 8 of them"

1014
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:45,997
"will wipe out an area 4 times
the size of Hong Kong."

1015
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,916
"The battle against Helios..."

1016
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:50,755
"...has just begun"
