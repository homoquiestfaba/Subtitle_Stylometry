00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,753
We're almost there.*[POL]

2
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,095
The doctors are looking at us.

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,014
Try to hold on.

4
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,312
You're nervous.
That's what makes you cough.

5
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:49,108
Plug your ears and pray to
The Mother of God.

6
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,110
Alright.

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,448
We'll soon be at aunt Edyta's
and

8
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,492
we'll be safe together.

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,373
We'll start our families
and have plenty of children.*

10
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,539
What are they saying?*

11
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,758
- No.
- Ewa, it's fine.*

12
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,593

- Auntie
- Wojtek ! Ewa !

17
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,358
They told me you weren't there,

18
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,568
but I found you, auntie!

19
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,570
Thank God.

20
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,079
Come in. We looked for you
a long time. 

21
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,620
It's a miracle.

22
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,996
Edyta, who is it?

23
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,000
Wojtek! Wojtek, my niece is here!

24
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,630
Ewa found us!

25
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,348
We haven't seen each other
since the wedding.

26
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,059
But I remember you.

27
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,064
Give her something to eat and drink.

28
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,649
Yes, of course.

29
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,026
Come, I'll make you some tea.

30
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,663
They said you weren't there, on the boat.

31
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,293
Your uncle went to Ellis Island and

32
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,170
they said you hadn't come.

33
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,007
No, WE were there.

34
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,011
they said YOU weren't there.

35
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,848
They said your adress wasn't valid.

36
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,976
But I knew it wasn't so.

37
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,186
That you wouldn't have forgotten us.

38
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,982
Of course we'd never forget you!

39
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,192
Never.

40
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,863
Where's Magda ?

41
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,660
She had to stay in the hospital.
She's sick.

42
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,581
But she sent me a letter.

43
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,500
With your help we can get her out.

44
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,925
Magda was very brave.

45
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,353
Without her, I wouldn't be here.

46
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,567
I'm very tired...

47
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,737
But I'm well.

48
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,168
Tomorrow we'll go to church

49
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,796
to give thanks.

50
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,965
Let her rest.

51
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,136
Of course. Yes.

52
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,517
Dear, you're safe now.

53
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,563
You'll be very happy in this country.
You'll see.

54
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,400
We live well, here.

55
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,154
You'll find a nice man and

56
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,074
you'll get married.

57
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,034
Sleep, now.

58
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,495
You'll feel better.

59
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,928
Don't lose hope, dear.

Sleep.

63
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,323
Magda.

64
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,177
I was dreaming.*

65
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,026
Why?*

66
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,365
I have a good reputation, a business...

67
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,534
I don't want to be dishonored.

68
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,994
I didn't do anything.

69
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,207
They told me what you did
on the boat!

70
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,709
- You're shameful.
- No.

71
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,627
A whore!

72
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,547
Be grateful we let you
sleep here last night!

73
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,966
No! It's a lie!

74
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,344
Aunt Edyta! It's not true!

75
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,220
That's enough.

76
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,973
- Don't speak to her!
- What about Magda?

77
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,393
I pray for her.
She's sick, you poisoned her!

78
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,978
Where are you taking her?

79
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,271
Shut up!

80
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,191
- Tell me where they're taking her!
- It's MY house!*

82

We're from Lodz.

83
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,385
It's terrible, how they treat us here.

84
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,429

It's so hard to say it...

122
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:01,225
Last Sunday I went to church.

123
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:04,771
First time in a long while.

124
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:10,234
I prayed to the Holy Virgin.

125
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:17,033
I've gone through so many trials.

126
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,706
Is it a sin to try to survive?

127
01:39:31,423 --> 01:39:32,423
Auntie...

128
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:41,015
Is it a sin to want to survive

129
01:39:41,183 --> 01:39:43,434
when I've done so many bad things?

130
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:53,236
Your uncle is a proud man.

131
01:39:55,447 --> 01:39:57,490
I can't change him.

132
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:00,868
I know.

133
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,041
I know he's rejected me.

134
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,711
But I'm asking you

135
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:15,466
to believe I can be saved.

136
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:21,472
God sent me

137
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:24,183
to someone who's really lost,

138
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:31,232
someone who turned my life into a sin.

139
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:32,775
And now,

140
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,239
this person is suffering for me.

141
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:45,121
So I'm learning the power of forgiveness.
