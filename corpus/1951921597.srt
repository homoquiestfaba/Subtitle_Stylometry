1
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,291
It's about time.

2
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,166
Don't wait.

3
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,834
Meeting.
Conference room.

4
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,338
Five minutes.

5
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,398
You too, Drake.

6
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,970
Hey, it's Margo Dey.

7
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,516
If it's Philip, don't bother
leaving a message.

8
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,183
Did you hear him, Drake?

9
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,779
Five minutes.

10
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,484
Yeah.

11
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,480
Back to work.

12
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,476
What's that, Patty?

13
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,847
Yes, it is my birthday.

14
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,782
Thank you for remembering.

15
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,619
Now, Maury,

16
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,023
you should know better
than to ask a lady her age.

17
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,394
Damn it, George.

18
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,984
Good night, George.

19
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,047
Hey, it's Margo Dey.

20
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,113
If it's Philip, don't bother
leaving a message.

21
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,455
Hey, Margo, it's Philip.

22
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,961
Listen, we need to talk
about what happened.

23
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,020
We need to talk
about what happened.

24
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,226
I wanted to let you know
that I'm real sorry

25
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,236
and I really
want to talk to you.

26
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,101
And I know today's
a special day for you,

27
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,940
so I thought maybe
we could do something fun,

28
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,912
something that
you want to do.

29
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,175
And I promise
I'll listen this time.

30
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,514
Anyways,
happy birthday.

31
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,719
And call me when
you get this, okay?

32
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,762
I love you, baby.
Bye.

33
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,868
I'll be there on time, yes.
I gotta go. Bye.

34
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,931
- Sorry.
- Sit, please.

35
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,510
The other day we got a call...
domestic dispute.

36
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,847
Found a woman dead...

37
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,352
early 30s,

38
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,411
shot twice in the chest,
once in the head.

39
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,059
- And the happy husband?
- He was out of town.

40
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,790
- Hmm. The happy sideshow.
- Sideshow?

41
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,299
Whoever she was
blowing that day.

42
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,434
The point is the husband came home
and told us about the kid.

43
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,372
Which brings us
to our Amber.

44
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,769
Top priority.

45
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,946
Don't you ever
do that again.

46
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,047
Come on.

47
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,469
What?

48
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,839
Nothing.

49
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,985
Come on.

50
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,393
Shit!

51
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,406
Shit!

52
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,841
Oh, you've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

53
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,579
God.

54
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,302
Hey, George.

55
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,283
Hello?

56
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,084
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
- What?

57
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,788
I said I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

58
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,432
Haven't I seen you?

59
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,169
Oh... no.

60
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,832
We're just passing through
on our way to a family reunion.

61
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,205
That is,
until we ran out of gas.

62
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,766
Right, Peter?

63
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,271
Right, Peter?

64
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,239
Oh, yeah.

65
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,978
Truck doesn't run
on empty.

66
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,718
And how are you tonight?

67
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,258
I have to pee.

68
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,904
Look, it's been
a really long day for us.

69
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,007
Do you mind if
we use your bathroom?

70
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,810
Oh, no no,
of course not.

71
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,475
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

72
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,530
Where is it?
I gotta go.

73
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,127
We're almost there.

74
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,911
There.

75
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,053
I know. I tried
that calcium lime stuff,

76
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,959
bleach, everything.

77
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,123
Nothing seems to remove it.

78
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,190
What happened?

79
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,101
Owners say that one
of their employees, Horace,

80
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,833
just went crazy.

81
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,431
Came in here
and killed himself.

82
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,808
That's supposed
to be the blood.

83
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,606
Don't think about it, Horace.

84
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,181
Now he's stuck
in purgatory...

85
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,656
half dead, half alive,

86
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,920
haunting the grounds
until his soul can be laid to rest.

87
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,197
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

88
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,663
I know.

89
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,669
I think it's scary.

90
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,500
Finish up, please.

91
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,969
What the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

92
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,275
Um...
well, it pays well

93
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,008
'cause no one else
wants to do it.

94
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,380
And besides, I'd rather spend time
with my quiet friends

95
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,419
than a boss up my ass,
you know?

96
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,958
All set?

97
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,730
All right.

98
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,171
What is it?
What's wrong?

99
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,677
I saw someone.

100
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,235
Oh, well,
that's just George.

101
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,837
He's the night watchman.

102
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,946
There's mud on the mirror.

103
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,649
That's impossible,
I just cleaned it.

104
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,225
It was right here.

105
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,989
Ha ha, very funny.

106
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,560
- I'm hungry.
- Do you like cookies?

107
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,537
How about chocolate chip?

108
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,197
Well, I have some.

109
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,798
Come on.

110
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,577
Swing a right.

111
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,612
I made them myself.

112
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,344
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

113
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,908
You're welcome.

114
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,476
Thanks again for everything.

115
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,284
Oh God, not a problem.

116
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,517
Ooh!

117
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,652
There's a truck outside.
Do you know who it belongs to?

118
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,759
George?
George?

119
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,239
He must have stepped out.
I'm sure he'll be right back.

120
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,044
Closest town's Birmingham.
It's like six miles back.

121
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,742
Why don't you just
stay here for a while

122
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,580
- until he gets back?
- We don't really have a...

123
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,586
What choice
do we have?

124
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,651
Look, is there a place
I can wait for him?

125
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,523
Yeah, front lobby.
He goes in through there.

126
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,030
All right.

127
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,532
- Come on.
- Where do you think you're going?

128
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,159
We're coming with you.

129
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,759
I don't want to go.

130
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,335
Let's go.

131
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,238
I said let's go.

132
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:01,045
Hey, I have
a deck of cards

133
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,916
and we can play,

134
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,751
eat some cookies
in the coffee lounge if you want.

135
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,483
Is that okay with you?

136
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,028
Fine.

137
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,588
You be good, okay?

138
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,236
Come on.

139
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,863
Right this way.

140
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,304
Whatcha doing?

141
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,343
Building a card house.

142
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,878
Very cool.

143
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,210
Help! Someone!

144
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,046
Help! Somebody!

145
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,679
Please, we need some help!
My friend Samim...

146
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,087
- I think he's dying.
- Yeah, of course!

147
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,756
You got a cell phone?
I can't find mine.

148
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,386
Cell phones
don't work in this area.

149
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,863
Listen, we have a land line.
I'll call 9-1-1.

150
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,593
No, don't!
I'll do it!

151
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,828
I mean...
l... I know the situation.

152
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,564
I can explain it better.

153
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,065
Okay... phone's this way.

154
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,111
- Here, just help Samim with this, all right?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

155
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,778
Honey, honey, it's okay.
It's okay.

156
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,010
Listen, just let me
help him, okay?

157
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,317
Damn it.

158
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,822
What the hell?
The door's locked.

159
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,755
- No, it can't be.
- Well, it is.

160
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,885
I got keys. Listen, just give me
a second, okay, honey?

161
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,020
Just give me a second.

162
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,456
It shouldn't be.

163
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,399
Like I said.

164
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,132
Where are my damn keys?

165
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,640
Let's try the one
down the hall.

166
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,113
Over there.

167
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,678
Hello? George?

168
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,907
George?

169
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,637
Ooh! Did you get help?

170
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,842
I gotta head back.
I gotta check on Samim.

171
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,147
How do we get out of here?

172
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,017
Well, let me show you.

173
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,818
Asshole.

174
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,775
Excuse me...
excuse me, George?

175
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,315
Hey, we're talking to you.

176
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,112
We ran out of gas
about a mile up.

177
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,484
Could you help us out?

178
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,420
We'd really
appreciate it.

179
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,390
Peter...

180
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,293
Let me handle this.

181
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,299
Peter, don't.

182
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,267
Let me.

183
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,329
Fine.

184
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,065
I'll just grab Jill,

185
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,633
get the hell
out of this place.

186
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,410
What happened?

187
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,811
Can I ask you
what happened?

188
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,293
- Get the...
- Dude, shut up!

189
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,925
- You've gotta...
- I've got it, okay?

190
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,492
We're... we're not
gonna get in trouble.

191
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,333
Okay, just fuckin' drive!

192
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,872
Son of a...

193
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,807
Hey, George is back.
Jill, come...

194
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,709
Who are they?

195
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,291
All right, Jill,
come on.

196
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,263
Come on.

197
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,880
Nan?

198
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,685
Nan!

199
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,984
Where is she?

200
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,322
Come on.
Let's go back inside.

201
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,457
Back inside.

202
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,966
- Has Nan come back?
- No, I haven't seen her.

203
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,143
George.
Stay here!

204
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,043
Hey.

205
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,315
- Wait!
- What?

206
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,851
I'm coming with you.

207
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,614
You don't know
how to talk to George.

208
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,349
He's been through a lot.

209
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,881
- Fine.
- Listen, he just lost his daughter.

210
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,292
He doesn't want to talk
to anyone but me.

211
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,024
George, where are ya?

212
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,793
George, you there?

213
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,697
George?

214
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,976
He must have
left again.

215
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,515
Great.

216
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,380
Now what?

217
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,248
I think he has a flashlight
around here somewhere.

218
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,290
Hold on.

219
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,892
Here.

220
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,395
Perfect.

221
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,158
Try these...

222
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,860
Look. Bingo.

223
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,599
- Here we go.
- Yeah, keep the pack.

224
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,776
Right this way.

225
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,543
What is that?

226
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,055
Check it out.
Oh my God, are you okay?

227
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,633
What's going on?

228
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,698
Somebody's after us!
When's help getting here?

229
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,405
Horace...
it's him, isn't it?

230
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,071
Where are they?

231
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,979
Honey, I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

232
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,744
Margo, open the door!

233
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,116
- It's Peter! Open the door!
- You are not going out there.

234
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,623
You're not gonna risk my life and everyone
else's for somebody I don't know, okay?

235
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,215
- We're gonna find another way out of here.
- Open the goddamn door!

236
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,989
Samim, don't worry.
I'm gonna get us some help.

237
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,552
Margo, please,
open this door!

238
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,326
We are not opening
the door, it's a trap!

239
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,162
Open the door!

240
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,699
- He needs our help!
- Listen, we're not going out there!

241
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,208
It's quiet.

242
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,040
Don't.

243
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,912
He's hurt.

244
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,508
Margo!

245
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,069
Peter!

246
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,869
Peter!

247
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,741
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

248
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,372
No no, no no.
Come.

249
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,416
- Open the door!
- Who is it?

250
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,041
Open up!

251
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,382
Margo!

252
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,029
Can someone tell me
what the fuck that was?!

253
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,142
Someone?

254
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,176
It's Horace.

255
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,909
- Horace?
- Who's Horace?

256
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,780
Margo knows.

257
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,252
- It's stupid.
- Well, what's going on?

258
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,121
Listen, some worker,

259
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,659
he killed himself on the grounds
like years ago

260
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,423
and now Jill thinks
he's after us.

261
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,533
I never got through.

262
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,467
Excuse me?

263
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,906
The ph... the phone.

264
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,643
- It doesn't work.
- I saw you use it.

265
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,544
Yeah, I know. And I'm telling you
I never got through.

266
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,980
That's bullshit. I just heard
the phone ringing.

267
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,574
Me too.

268
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,120
How'd you guys
get here, anyway?

269
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,056
There...
there was an accident.

270
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,023
All right, look.

271
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,463
Let's just get the flashlights,
find Nan,

272
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,125
and get the hell
out of here.

273
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,193
I'm not going out
in the dark.

274
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,000
Well, I think I can fix
our lighting problem.

275
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,563
- Come on.
- No.

276
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,199
I told you,
I'm staying right here.

277
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,812
All right... Margo!

278
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,688
It's Margo.
Open up.

279
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,587
Jill!

280
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,316
Power's up.

281
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,929
This yours?

282
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,873
Yeah.

283
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,570
- How do you come to work?
- Bike.

284
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,273
Where is it?
The bike... where is it?

285
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,838
It's out front.
Why?

286
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,884
I gotta find Nan.

287
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,612
Here's what we're gonna do.

288
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,177
Let's split up.

289
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,280
Two of us go to town...
one on your bike,

290
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,484
one on foot.

291
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,960
The rest stay here
locked in this room.

292
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,656
You, Einstein,

293
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,289
you're coming with me.

294
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,962
Oh, there's a lock.
It's combination.

295
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,766
It's 3-20-33.

296
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,003
Can you remember that?

297
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,903
Let's go.

298
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,110
Let's go. Now.

299
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,140
Shit. Where's the bike?

300
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,369
I don't see it.
Where'd she say the rack was?

301
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,208
Should be right
around the other side.

302
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,484
After you.

303
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,079
I'm not going first.

304
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,347
- Shit.
- What?

305
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,011
It's not here either.

306
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,355
What do we do?

307
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,318
We walk.

308
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,513
What the hell
were you thinking?

309
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,851
What are you
talking about?

310
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,443
I'm talking
about the door.

311
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,989
"I'm not risking my life
for someone I don't know."

312
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,486
I could've died back there,
you stupid fuck.

313
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,254
Why are you
bringing this up now?

314
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,402
Look,
I just figured...

315
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,374
Yeah yeah yeah,
you just figured what?

316
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,302
- Uh, we have a problem.
- Just keep walking.

317
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,673
No, hold on.
You see this?

318
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,371
See what?

319
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,314
You're kidding, man.

320
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,525
Must have taken
a wrong turn or something.

321
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:55,093
Let's... let's just head
back down the road.

322
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,360
We... we probably
just got turned around

323
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,334
or something.

324
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,961
Yeah.

325
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,625
What the hell
is going on?

326
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,412
Dude.

327
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,646
What that hell
is going on?

328
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,058
All right.

329
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,097
Head back down
around the curve.

330
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,893
I'll stay here.

331
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,456
Okay.

332
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:13,204
Hey!
Tell me what you see!

333
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,649
Peter! Look up the road!

334
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,551
How the hell
did you get up there?

335
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,722
I don't know.

336
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,904
What the hell's going on?

337
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,574
I don't know.

338
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,124
We should
head back inside,

339
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,750
grab the others

340
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,317
and find a way
out of this morgue.

341
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,522
What do you think?

342
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,728
Jacob?

343
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,999
Jacob?

344
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,247
Hello?

345
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,010
Jacob?

346
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,908
All right, man,
this isn't funny.

347
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,663
No no no!

348
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,791
Margo, open the door.
It's Peter!

349
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,451
Open the door!

350
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,552
- Where's Jacob?
- What?

351
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,120
- Have you seen Jacob?
- Jacob was with you!

352
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,722
What are you
talking about?

353
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,825
What... what happened?

354
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,806
We have to leave now!

355
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,571
Okay, let's go,
but what about him?

356
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,669
We'll come back
with help.

357
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,605
Oh God.

358
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,139
This way.

359
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,671
We can cut through
the chapel

360
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,478
- and go out the side entrance.
- Okay.

361
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,079
Stay close.

362
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,329
Whoa.

363
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,662
- This way.
- Let's go.

364
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,502
Peter!
Over here!

365
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,274
Over here!

366
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,069
What's wrong?

367
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,230
What the...

368
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,862
- Where is he?
- They took him away.

369
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,736
All right, Jill.

370
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,406
I want you to stay here.

371
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,074
Keep the door locked.

372
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,448
I don't want to stay here.
Please.

373
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,578
Stay here
where it's safe.

374
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,089
I will come back
and get you.

375
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,091
Trust me.

376
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,061
Okay.

377
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,735
Okay.

378
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,204
Margo!

379
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,674
He's gone.

380
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,617
He was right there.

381
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,122
You saw him.

382
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,786
We all saw him.

383
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,121
Help!

384
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,331
Help me!

385
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,278
Help me!

386
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,942
Help me!

387
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,098
Peter?

388
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,292
Peter!

389
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,802
Oh my God, Peter!
Peter, I'm gonna get you out of there!

390
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,360
I'm gonna get you out!

391
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,203
Help! Help me
get out of here!

392
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,144
Margo!

393
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,045
Peter, keep pushing!

394
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,640
Come on!
Come on, kick it!

395
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,480
Kick it,
he's coming!

396
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,384
Come on!

397
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,945
Peter, come on!

398
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,788
He's coming!
He's coming!

399
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,889
Oh God!
Oh God!

400
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,453
Oh God!

401
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,107
Come on!

402
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,236
No! No!

403
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,787
Jill...

404
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,826
Jill!

405
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,762
Jill?

406
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,278
Come on! Come on,
we've gotta go now!

407
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,448
Come on, come on.

408
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,650
Oh, honey.

409
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,868
It's gonna be okay,

410
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,028
I promise you.
We just need to get out of here

411
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,901
and it's gonna
be okay.

412
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,907
Okay?

413
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,738
Come on.

414
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,622
The point is, the husband came home
and told us about the kid.

415
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,855
Which brings us
to our Amber.

416
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,423
Top priority.

417
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,727
You guys can get started
on this by heading out

418
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,205
to the accident
that was just reported:

419
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,401
a two-car collision
on Highway 57.

420
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,179
Officers say they found
an eight-year-old girl.

421
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,077
Let's get moving.

422
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,709
Yeah.

423
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,126
Okay. Okay, come on.

424
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,453
We made it.

425
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,345
Oh...

426
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:13,455
Come on.
Come on.

427
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,996
Notify the hospital.

428
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,227
Excuse me!
Can you help?

429
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,098
- Can you... excuse me, can you...
- This is one mess.

430
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,331
Oh my God.
Can somebody help us?

431
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,844
Is that our Amber?

432
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:34,943
No such luck.

433
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,353
- Take this.
- Okay.

434
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,332
Excuse... hey, can you...

435
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,495
Oh, no, no.

436
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,231
It's okay.

437
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,205
We're fine now.

438
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,070
This car was stopped.

439
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,941
The blinkers are on.

440
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,708
The black car
piles into it.

441
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,316
Somebody walked away.

442
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,347
Help! Help!

443
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,324
Somebody, please!

444
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,529
Somebody.
Somebody, help me!

445
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,999
There's handprints,
there's blood there.

446
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:31,539
Over there...

447
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,536
Hold, please. Chet.

448
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,806
That's attractive.

449
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,513
Good. Thank you.

450
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,520
That was not the guy
that walked away.

451
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,058
No.

452
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,193
Will you grab my gloves
from the car, please?

453
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,133
Margo?

454
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,469
Philip?

455
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,921
Margo.

456
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,130
Shit!

457
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,597
Shit!

458
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,634
Oh, you've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

459
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,481
Nan, I would think real hard
before I speak right now.

460
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,117
Did you forget
we're on a schedule?

461
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,521
Don't you think
I know that?!

462
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,354
I'm the one who planned
the fucking thing.

463
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,291
Yeah, but you can't find time
to get gas, is that it?

464
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,330
Did you remember
to charge your cell phone?

465
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:07,235
Oh, shit.

466
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,066
Jill!

467
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,072
Jill!

468
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,664
See what you've done?

469
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,732
Yeah. Suck on this.

470
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,301
Jill!

471
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,511
Jill!

472
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,685
Don't you ever
do that again.

473
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,253
Come on.

474
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,357
Hey, it's a lady.

475
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,800
Ooh! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

476
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,666
Everybody okay
over here?

477
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:46,174
Yeah yeah.
We just ran out of gas.

478
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,075
Oh, jeez, the closest
gas station's like six miles away.

479
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,044
Six miles?

480
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:52,580
Do you hear that, hon?

481
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,309
Got a long walk for you.

482
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,414
Hi, sweetheart.
What's your name?

483
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,284
- Jill.
- Hi, Jill. I'm Margo.

484
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,551
Oh, your sneakers
are all dirty.

485
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,060
- Hit the...
- Dude, shut up!

486
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,999
- You've gotta...
- I've got it, okay?

487
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,367
- We're not gonna get in trouble.
- Just fuckin' drive.

488
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,770
Son of a...

489
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,004
I got something that'll
do just the trick.

490
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,869
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

491
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,313
You are very, very welcome.

492
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,715
Ridiculous!
Stupid!

493
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:35,723
Watch out!

494
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,320
One, two, three,
four, five.

495
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,467
Come on, baby, please.

496
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,129
One, two, three,
four, five.

497
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,796
Phil! Phil!
What are you doing?

498
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,932
Phil! Phil! Phil!

499
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,566
No, get away!
Get away from me!

500
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,668
- Phil! Phil!
- Get away!

501
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,906
- Phil!
- One, two, three, four, five!

502
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,318
- Phil!
- One, two, three, four!

503
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,855
Oh, Christ.
Phil, she's gone!

504
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,823
They did that. They did that.
Get her out of here!

505
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,689
Get her out of here!
Phil, stay here with me.

506
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,059
You're here with me.
It's okay.

507
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,490
I'm right here.

508
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,905
I'm right here.

509
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,620
How you doing, George?

510
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,349
Fine, Paul.
How are you?

511
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,448
I'm doing good.

512
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,812
How's the kid?

513
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,787
Oh, he's gonna be
just fine.

514
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,958
I'm really gonna
miss this young lady.

515
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:12,091
There was something
special about her.

516
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,060
She was always
very good to me.

517
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,336
Well,
take care, Paul.

518
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,142
You have a better one.

519
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,402
Prep Room,
this is Frank.

520
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,573
Oh yeah.
Hey man, what's up?

521
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,981
I'm all right. I'm just prepping a male
and a female before lunch.

522
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,448
If you want to.

523
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,865
Yeah, that'd be great.

524
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,009
Hey!

525
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,724
Somebody's in here!

526
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,087
Stop!

527
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,904
Oh, no!
Hey, stop!

528
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,172
Stop it!

529
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:24,409
No, stop! No!

530
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,981
I'm alive!

531
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,852
No! Help me!

532
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,759
Help me!

533
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,873
Now he's stuck in purgatory...

534
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,243
half dead,
half alive...

535
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,579
haunting the grounds
until his soul can be laid to rest.

536
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:35,387
I'm alive!
I'm alive!

537
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,007
Help
me!

538
